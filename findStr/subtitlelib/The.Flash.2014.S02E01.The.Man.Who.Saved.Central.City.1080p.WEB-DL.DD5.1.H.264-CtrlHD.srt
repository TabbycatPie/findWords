1
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:03,047
<i>Last season, on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:05,316
What's happening to me?

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:07,651
<i>I wasn't the only one affected, was I?</i>

4
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:10,354
<i>We've been searching for other meta-humans,</i>

5
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:11,488
<i>like yourself.</i>

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,690
<i>Don't be afraid, Cisco.</i>

7
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:14,024
You were affected, too.

8
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:15,893
Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.

9
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,027
Yes, I did.

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,362
<i>What do you say we do that?</i>

11
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,965
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

12
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,733
<i>You killed my mother!</i>

13
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:24,268
Why?

14
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,703
<i>We're enemies, rivals, opposites,</i>

15
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:27,004
reverses of one another.

16
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:28,472
Just tell the police what you did.

17
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,074
<i>Get my dad out of prison!</i>

18
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:32,209
You could go back and save your mother.

19
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,378
A wormhole, opening the gateway

20
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,081
<i>into time itself.</i>

21
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,317
I always win, Flash!

22
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,752
Eddie!

23
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,387
<i>Eddie's his ancestor. If Eddie dies,</i>

24
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,722
<i>he'll never be born.</i>

25
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,857
<i>He's being erased from existence.</i>

26
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,860
<i>The singularity won't stop,</i>

27
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:51,095
<i>not even after the Earth is gone.</i>

28
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,663
We have to disrupt the motion.

29
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:53,897
It cannot be stopped!

30
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,599
<i>I have to try.</i>

31
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:20,057
- He's coming back around!
- Yeah, to die!

32
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,702
I swear one of these days I will kill you!

33
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:44,348
I was late again, wasn't I?

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,183
Right on time.

35
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:49,486
<i>Whoo!</i>

36
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:57,928
Two down at the same time?

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,797
Superhero double play, baby!

38
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,566
- Didn't do it alone.
- You're never alone, Barry.

39
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:04,301
Neither are you, Mrs. Raymond.

40
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,138
Thank you for not doing that

41
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,440
when I was inside you.

42
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,208
It happened one time. Let it go.

43
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,544
<i>Snart and Rory.</i>

44
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:17,281
You're gonna put a cop
like me out of a job.

45
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:18,582
Just trying to help.

46
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,517
You do more than help, Barry.

47
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,654
You give the people of this city hope.

48
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,355
You're the hero, Barry.

49
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:28,058
Congratulations, everyone.

50
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,861
A spectacular victory.

51
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:33,263
A milestone, if you will.

52
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:38,869
Mr. Allen, I believe there's
nothing left I can teach you.

53
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:42,072
I believe...

54
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:46,243
that you're ready to do
all of this on your own.

55
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,561
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

56
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:07,397
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

57
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,199
<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed</i>

58
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,301
<i>by something impossible.</i>

59
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,004
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

60
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,039
<i>Then an accident made me the impossible,</i>

61
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,108
<i>and I became the Flash.</i>

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,710
<i>I used my powers to find the man</i>

63
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,945
<i>responsible for my mother's death.</i>

64
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:25,182
<i>I thought I would finally
get justice for my family,</i>

65
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,850
<i>but I failed.</i>

66
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:29,386
<i>It's been six months
since the Singularity.</i>

67
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:32,422
<i>I'm on my own now.
Decided it's better that way.</i>

68
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,625
<i>Keeps the people I care about safe.</i>

69
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:37,528
<i>There's only one thing I can do now.</i>

70
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,670
<i>I run.</i>

00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,473
How's it going?

73
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,909
Hey. Uh, good.

74
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,143
How you doing?

75
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,045
Good.

76
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:58,048
So, the victim. His name is Al Rothstein.

77
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,483
<i>He's a welder here at the nuclear plant.</i>

78
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,286
Co-worker found him this morning.

79
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:04,855
So, what do you got?

80
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:07,357
Petechiae on his face and
the whites of his eyes,

81
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,826
and this bruising around his neck...

82
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:11,762
So he was strangled.

83
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,431
By someone very strong and very large.

84
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,233
Or something?

85
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,501
This wasn't Grodd.

86
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:19,903
Oh, thank God.

87
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,471
<i>Look,</i>

88
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,574
I'll let you know

89
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,375
when I find more.

90
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,578
So this Flash Day thing.

91
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,546
I'm hoping you're planning
on making an appearance.

92
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:32,049
Ah... I haven't decided.

93
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:33,817
Bar, I heard the Mayor's trying

94
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,118
to give you the key to the city.

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,286
Yeah, I don't need an award.

96
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:37,821
You love getting awards.

97
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:40,157
Like all those science trophies
you got in high school?

98
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,992
Those I deserved.

99
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:45,562
I'll let you know what I find, all right?

100
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:46,964
All right.

101
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:00,978
<i>Flash Day is almost here.</i>

102
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,412
<i>A special downtown rally</i>

103
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,415
<i>to honor the man who saved Central City.</i>

104
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,652
<i>It's been six months since
the Flash saved Central City</i>

105
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:11,989
<i>from the freak black hole
that erupted in the sky.</i>

106
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:14,591
Joe, where are we at with
the murder at the nuclear plant?

107
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:16,093
Barry's still analyzing the evidence,

108
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,494
but there was definitely something weird.

109
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:18,662
Yeah, which is why I let you have

110
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,330
that Anti-Meta-Human Task Force.

111
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,399
Speaking of which, where's
your scientific advisor?

112
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:23,934
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

113
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,602
Fear the beard!

114
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:32,042
It's a very distinguished look... Sir.

115
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:34,678
- What is all this, Mr. Ramon?
- Oh, this right here?

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,879
This is a little something I'm working on.

117
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,247
I'm cooking it up for Joe

118
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,183
and the task force to
take down meta-humans.

119
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:41,718
I'm think I'm going to call it The Boot.

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,121
Oh, here are the receipts.

121
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:49,092
Oh, Captain, one more thing.

122
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,862
You are not getting a badge, Mr. Ramon.

123
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,466
He's really stingy with
those badges, isn't he?

124
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:58,802
Yeah, cops are funny that way.

125
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,071
So you really think
you can get this to work?

126
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:03,140
Don't have me caught out on
the streets with my pants down.

127
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,975
Yes, once I finish the Boot,

128
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:07,978
CCPD will totally have what it
needs to take down a meta-human.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,646
Especially now that Barry
has decided to go all

130
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:12,616
Lone Wolf McQuade and
fight crime by himself.

131
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,318
I know, right? Have you spoken to him?

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,952
Not really. Haven't even heard from Caitlin

133
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,454
since she started work at Mercury Labs.

134
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,923
- Hey Cisco. Hi, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

135
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,858
Hey, I was wondering if you'd
talked to Barry about the rally.

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
We was just saying.

137
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,062
I'm sorry, but, I can't believe

138
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,364
they're gonna give the
Flash the key to the city.

139
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,032
Although technically,
as members of Team Flash,

140
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,200
we should all be getting keys.

141
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,668
Well, you know Barry.

142
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,570
The more we try to convince
him to do something,

143
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:34,738
the less he's gonna want to do it.

144
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,506
Yeah, but he should go.

145
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,375
Someone should try and get through to him.

146
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,643
Maybe his best friend.

147
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:42,446
Joe, believe me, I've tried.

148
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,281
I meant her.

149
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:46,717
Bye, baby.

150
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,719
- Yeah.
- Okay.

151
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,592
You know, if you ever decided

152
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,494
that you didn't want to be the Flash,

153
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:33,096
you have a good future being a contractor.

154
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,031
Thanks.

155
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,134
Yeah, I'm just trying to put it all back

156
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:41,104
exactly how it was before the...

157
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,106
You know.

158
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,945
Seems like a lot of local businesses

159
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,515
are being rebuilt at night.

160
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,251
In secret.

161
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:57,421
I was thinking about writing
an article about it for the paper.

162
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,189
Don't. Please.

163
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:01,091
Look, people have heard the stories.

164
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:02,793
They've read the articles.

165
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:05,829
They've maybe even seen the
red streak racing past them.

166
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:08,698
But they've never seen the Flash, Barry.

167
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,333
So that's why you're here?

168
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,836
You came to talk me into
going to the rally?

169
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,038
'Cause I'm... I'm not gonna go.

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,441
People just want to thank the
man who saved Central City.

171
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,277
Well, they can't, 'cause that's not me.

172
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,646
You should know that, better than anyone.

173
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:31,087
Central City believes in the Flash.

174
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,192
So do I.

175
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:27,444
Brilliant!

176
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,845
He's contained the Singularity

177
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,681
by adding to its angular momentum!

178
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:33,650
Barry, it's stabilizing.

179
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:35,352
Keep doing what you're doing!

180
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,787
I'm not sure how much longer I can.

181
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,990
<i>Cisco! Now what?</i>

182
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,959
We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons.

183
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,561
How do we do that?

184
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:47,464
By separating in the eye of it.

185
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:51,701
The amount of energy from
the fissure should do the trick.

186
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,506
It's our only hope, Ronald.

187
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,975
Ronnie, no! It's too dangerous.

188
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,178
What if you can't escape the inrush?

189
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,248
Cait, we have to try.

190
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,619
Ronnie... Professor...

191
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,223
No!

192
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,159
Ronald... Ronald...

193
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,607
I'm so sorry.

194
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:09,990
Are we expecting trouble?

195
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:11,958
Cops always expect trouble.

196
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,062
In this city, I expect
super evil flying monsters.

197
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,031
That's a solid expectation.

198
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,504
Well, I'll be.

199
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,849
Good morning, Central City!

200
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:39,286
A year ago, our world changed.

201
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:43,690
Our city became ground zero for...

202
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,493
some pretty weird stuff.

203
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:48,962
<i>We got a new breed of criminal:</i>

204
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:52,199
Men and women who defied not only our laws,

205
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:55,402
but physics and reason.

206
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:58,638
But we got something else, too.

207
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,575
We got the Flash!

208
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,182
Our wounds run deep,

209
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,184
<i>and I know many of you are afraid</i>

210
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,854
of what threats tomorrow may bring.

211
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:16,456
<i>But the Flash doesn't just protect us,</i>

212
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,459
<i>he restores hope where it was lost.</i>

213
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:22,863
That's why I'm honored to present the key

214
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:27,234
to the man who saved
Central City: The Flash!

215
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,731
Flash. Flash.

216
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,719
The doors to Central City

217
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,689
will forever be open for you, Flash.

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Look out!

219
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:34,968
You all right?

220
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,308
I got this, all right?

221
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:46,880
The man who saved Central City,

222
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:49,082
hate to rain on your parade.

223
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,019
Oof!

224
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:14,374
<i>Cisco!</i>

225
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:15,842
<i>Cisco!</i>

226
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,478
- The Boot!
- Right!

227
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,318
Locked and loaded. Go!

228
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,557
Booted!

229
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,969
<i>Cisco, you said this
thing would take him down.</i>

230
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,238
He's not going down.

231
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:53,046
He went up.

232
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,848
Run! Run!

233
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:00,887
- What are you doing?
- I'm throwing, you're shooting.

234
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,739
That's Al Rothstein.

235
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:22,542
The body we found at the nuclear plant,

236
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:24,677
he's alive!

237
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,906
According to the coroners office,

238
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,287
Al Rothstein's body was in
the morgue all night,

239
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,456
so we can scratch off "zombie attack."

240
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,358
<i>Rothstein have a twin brother?</i>

241
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,593
Nope. Only child.

242
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,895
And get this, the night
the accelerator exploded,

243
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:49,798
Rothstein was on his
honeymoon, in Hawaii.

244
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,234
So we're looking for
a guy who's really strong,

245
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,470
can grow twice his size,
and just happens to look

246
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,372
exactly like the guy he murdered?

247
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,607
I would think this meta was really cool

248
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,910
if everything about him didn't
just terrify me to my core.

249
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,479
Is that what happened to you?

250
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,281
You looked really spooked
there for a minute.

251
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:08,250
- Uh...
- I actually see

252
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,019
the guy that I can ask about it right now.

253
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:12,688
Call you back, okay? Hey.

254
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,658
So, the hospital next to
the Flash Day rally,

255
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,694
The x-ray and CT machines
all failed at once.

256
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,095
<i>Was that because of you?</i>

257
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:24,333
I did not do anything
that would cause that.

258
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,470
I'm 92% sure.

259
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:31,874
I'm going to go make that 100. Excuse me.

260
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,609
You okay?

261
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:37,146
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,317
Barry can't do this alone anymore.

263
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,086
That's his plan

264
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,421
and I don't know how to talk him out of it.

265
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:46,555
At this point, I'm just trying

266
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:47,923
not to push him farther away.

267
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,758
Well, maybe Barry has been so successful

268
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,027
at pushing you, me and everyone else away

269
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,896
because we keep letting him.

270
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,531
Let's not let him.

271
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,633
What do you suggest?

272
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:02,204
Well, "if you keep
getting 'no' for an answer,

273
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,106
stop asking questions."

274
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,808
I say that. You quoting me to me?

275
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,343
What can I say? You are a very smart man.

276
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,823
So this is what it looks
like inside Mercury Labs.

277
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,158
Security here is way better
than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs,

278
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,526
what with people walking in and out

279
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,762
of the Cortex all the time.

280
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:28,864
- Hi Cisco.
- Sweet Sarek.

281
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,733
Is that a 6K proton splicer?

282
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,401
Yes, it is.

283
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,070
Dr. McGee insists on having
all the latest technology.

284
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,972
Wow.

285
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:39,541
You deserve it.

286
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:42,778
I spotted you, at the rally today,

287
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,048
and I'm guessing you saw what happened.

288
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,916
Cisco, I can't come back.

289
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,552
Okay, check this out:
we found this on a victim

290
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,087
at the nuclear power plant,

291
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,356
but the badge shows
absolutely nothing at all,

292
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,258
which is so weird.

293
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,061
What's also weird is that at the
same time that meta-human grew,

294
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:02,030
all the x-ray machines within a
mile radius just went belly-up.

295
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,933
- Cisco.
- Just... if you could just...

296
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,336
See if the badge was
tampered with or something.

297
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,604
I mean, if it's broken, or...

298
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,939
Whatever.

299
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,041
It'll really help.

300
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:25,954
Mr. Allen.

301
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,456
<i>Barry Allen?</i>

302
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,792
- Yeah.
- I'm Greg Turk.

303
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,694
I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone.

304
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,763
I don't usually make house
calls, but I've been trying

305
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,398
to get in touch with you
for several months.

306
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,567
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

307
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,002
I've just...

308
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,970
I've been really busy with police work.

309
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,306
We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs.

310
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,975
As you know, Harrison Wells
left the property to you

311
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,243
as part of his living trust.

312
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:52,047
Yeah, which I did not ask him to do,

313
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,116
but I've been keeping the place up.

314
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:55,818
Well, It's going to take more
than cleaning the floors

315
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,053
to retain it, I'm afraid.

316
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,955
The facility and the real
estate are scheduled to go

317
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:04,493
into receivership at the
end of this week unless...

318
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,730
you watch this.

319
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:09,965
What is this?

320
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,634
A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.

321
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,904
What's on it? Have you seen it?

322
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,906
No. He was very specific.

323
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:20,142
It was only to be watched by you.

324
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,577
The device will send me a notification

325
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,312
after you've viewed it.

326
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,881
And at that point, I'll have
everything ready to execute.

327
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,449
I'm not going to watch that.

328
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:29,685
Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen.

329
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,654
I'm only here to represent
Harrison Wells' final request.

330
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:34,823
Good day.

331
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:08,857
What are you guys doing here?

332
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,493
- Working.
- So, Caitlin was right.

333
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,363
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

334
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,832
due to contact with cell
phones, microwaves,

335
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,066
televisions, et cetera.

336
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,302
Our bodies are natural conductors.

337
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:22,271
I think our meta's been
sucking up all the radiation

338
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,039
around him and using it to power himself.

339
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,974
Which is why the x-ray
machines at the hospital

340
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:27,209
failed the day of the rally.

341
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:28,543
So if we want to find him,

342
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,445
we gotta look for places without radiation.

343
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,515
All right, guys, I don't want
any of you here right now.

344
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:36,351
Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

345
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,921
Barry, everyone in this
room cares about you,

346
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,789
but we also care about this city.

347
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,057
We all want to make a difference,

348
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,425
and that means fighting meta-humans,

349
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,460
and that means working with the Flash.

350
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:47,129
<i>You can't deny us that.</i>

351
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,797
<i>Not anymore. Got him.</i>

352
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,032
There's a three block dead zone

353
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:51,867
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

354
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,069
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

355
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,940
That's where you'll find your atom smasher.

356
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:02,277
Because he absorbs atomic power,

357
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,414
and he, well, smashes.

358
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,917
Come here.

359
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,786
That's a great name. Welcome to the team.

360
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,388
- Thank you.
- Great, guys, thank you.

361
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,990
You can go now, all right?

362
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:17,859
Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein

363
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:19,928
figure out a way to stop this guy.

364
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,064
No, I don't.

365
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,605
Barry left his comm system behind.

366
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:33,208
We can't talk to him.

367
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,644
He's on his own.

368
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:06,037
Well, this is a curve ball.

369
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,140
I thought I was going to
have to come looking for you.

370
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:11,209
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

371
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:13,945
- I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
- Yeah?

372
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:15,496
Then why'd you kill Albert Rothstein?

373
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,031
And why do you look like him?

374
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,933
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

375
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:22,636
- Try me.
- I'm about to.

376
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:23,771
Is there really no way of knowing

377
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,205
what's going on in there?

378
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:28,375
I'm looking for the security cameras.

379
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:29,743
Booyah.

380
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,463
My turn.

381
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,268
- Dad.
- Maybe I can make it there.

382
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,570
No, you won't, and what are you
gonna do when you get there?

383
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:57,571
The Boot didn't work on him.

384
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:59,306
Alarm!

385
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,941
- Believe me, we're all alarmed.
- No, the alarm system.

386
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,243
You've tapped into the
surveillance cameras, correct?

387
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:05,479
Correct!

388
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,115
"Come on, feel the noize."

389
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,088
He said you were some kind of big hero,

390
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,057
but you don't seem worthy
of him, or this city.

391
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:25,899
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

392
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,435
I believe that's already
been well established.

393
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,255
No, thank you.

394
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,357
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

395
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,793
I'm not hungry.

396
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,795
It's been six months, Barry.

397
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:56,697
You gotta eat, son.

398
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,532
It's a good move,

399
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,267
being angry all the time.

400
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,735
I get it.

401
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:03,170
<i>You miss your mom and dad, and you want</i>

402
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:04,571
<i>to show them that you're strong.</i>

403
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:07,074
Being mad makes it easier.

404
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:11,578
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

405
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,682
It's okay to be sad. You can be sad, Barry.

406
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:18,185
Your parents will understand

407
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:21,588
if you're not strong all the time.

408
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,724
That is why I'm here.

409
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:30,330
It's okay, son. I got you.

410
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,488
You're good. I got you.

411
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:01,028
Where is everyone?

412
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,164
I figured you wouldn't want an
audience when you came to.

413
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,101
Yeah, thanks.

414
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:11,605
Iris is right.

415
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,273
You're not gonna do this anymore.

416
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:15,008
For the last six months I've
given you your space

417
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,379
to work all this out, come back to us.

418
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:23,450
But today proved that you'd
rather just get yourself killed.

419
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:28,422
It's better than getting my friends killed.

420
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,658
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

421
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,095
I can't. It was. Guess what?

422
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:38,298
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

423
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,068
All of the rest of us were there too.

424
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,737
Eddie and Ronnie,

425
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:46,507
they chose to help you stop Wells,

426
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,976
and stop that...

427
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:51,879
- Singularity.
- Singularity thing.

428
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:54,882
It's on all of us, Barry.

429
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:58,986
So stop with this hogging
all the blame and regret.

430
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:03,023
We gotta live with it. Move on.

431
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:08,562
What do I do now?

432
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:11,598
Well, I know that you've been

433
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,636
rebuilding Central City at night.

434
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,505
It's just bricks and paint.

435
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:22,109
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild...

436
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,244
things that really matter.

437
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:40,460
What are you doing here?

438
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:43,764
Sorry, I should've called or something.

439
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:47,534
I just... I wanted to see you.

440
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,036
It's been a while.

441
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:51,271
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you

442
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:54,708
at the Flash Day celebration.

443
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,910
I was surprised.

444
00:27:56,912 --> 00:28:02,649
You, better than anyone,
know I wasn't the hero that day.

445
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:06,753
- Of course you were.
- No.

446
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,691
Cait, Ronnie died saving me.

447
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:15,295
And I should've saved him,
and I'm... I'm so sorry.

448
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:18,665
Barry, I know that you
did everything you could.

449
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,868
It wasn't your fault.

450
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,838
I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.

451
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,008
I blame myself.

452
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,843
Why?

453
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,113
When Ronnie first became Firestorm,

454
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,482
he asked me to leave Central City,

455
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:41,188
and go somewhere that we
could have a normal life.

456
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,991
And I said no.

457
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:51,365
I couldn't leave S.T.A.R.
Labs, Dr. Wells... you.

458
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:55,769
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

459
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,871
<i>Being at S.T.A.R. Labs just
made me think of that</i>

460
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,240
every single day.

461
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:03,510
Here.

462
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:06,413
Oh, you carry a handkerchief now?

463
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:08,382
What are you, 80?

464
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:15,455
- What's that?
- Ah, it's uh...

465
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:19,159
Apparently, in case of his death,

466
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:22,362
Wells had some kind of a living will.

467
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,899
And you haven't watched it yet?

468
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:29,002
No. No, I've...

469
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:32,072
been too afraid.

470
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,676
What if we watched it together?

471
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:38,979
All right.

472
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,855
<i>Hello, Barry.</i>

473
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:50,857
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

474
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:54,094
<i>that means something
has gone horribly wrong.</i>

475
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:59,633
<i>I'm dead and the last 15
years have been for nothing.</i>

476
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:02,202
<i>Bummer. 15 years.</i>

477
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:04,604
<i>You know, when I realize
that in all those years</i>

478
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,406
<i>helping raise you,</i>

479
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:08,842
<i>we were never truly enemies, Barry.</i>

480
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,811
<i>I'm not the thing you hate.</i>

481
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:15,449
<i>And so, I want to give you
the thing that you want most.</i>

482
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:17,250
<i>It won't matter.</i>

483
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:21,121
<i>You'll never be truly
happy, Barry Allen, trust me.</i>

484
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,723
<i>I know you.</i>

485
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:24,324
<i>Now...</i>

486
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,360
<i>Erase everything I said up to this point.</i>

487
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:29,896
<i>Give the following message to the police.</i>

488
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:32,299
<i>My name is Harrison Wells.</i>

489
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:34,034
<i>Being of sound mind and body,</i>

490
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:36,236
<i>I freely confess to the
murder of Nora Allen.</i>

491
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:38,472
<i>In her home, on the
night of March 18th,</i>

492
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:40,173
<i>in the year 2000.</i>

493
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:41,842
<i>I attacked Nora Allen
in her dining room.</i>

494
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:43,443
<i>- Oh, my God.
- I stabbed her in the chest</i>

495
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,545
<i>- with a large butcher knife...
- He confessed.</i>

496
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:47,614
<i>From the drawer to the
left of the sink in the kitchen.</i>

497
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:49,683
This is it.

498
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:54,454
This is what I need to free my dad.

499
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:01,061
Hey, Joe. Yeah, hey.

500
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:04,731
Can you have everybody
meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs?

501
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,199
Yeah. All right, thanks.

502
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:09,002
Yeah. All right, bye.

503
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:11,905
I'll drive.

504
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,573
Okay.

505
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,822
<i>You think the video's enough?</i>

506
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:24,443
<i>Well, sure.</i>

507
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,879
- What's she saying?
- Hold on.

508
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,781
Wells gave all the right details.

509
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:31,884
It's not a done deal yet,
but the D.A. says it looks good.

510
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:35,421
Yeah, I'm here.

511
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,225
Is it good news?

512
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,694
- I think so.
- Henry's coming home?

513
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:49,568
Okay, well...

514
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,138
that still leaves Atom
Smasher to deal with.

515
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,974
Last time you faced him,
it did not go well.

516
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:58,510
No, it did not.

517
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:01,313
I clearly can't stop him by myself.

518
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:03,916
So how are we gonna beat him?

519
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:07,953
Well, ever since I was
shown a drained radiation tag,

520
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,788
which I haven't been
able to stop thinking about.

521
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,891
- Thank you, Cisco.
- You're welcome, Caitlin.

522
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:15,527
If this guy likes radiation so much,

523
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:18,497
I say we give it to him.

524
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,443
Showtime.

525
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,419
What's up?

526
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:41,520
I see you got my message.

527
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,554
That light was perfect bait.

528
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:44,289
What made you think of that?

529
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:47,593
I don't know, I think I saw
it in a comic book somewhere.

530
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:49,595
You want me?

531
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,663
You're gonna have to catch me.

532
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,836
It's working, dude.
Rothstein's following you.

533
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:00,339
I must say, he's quite
agile for a man his size.

534
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:01,974
Run, Barry, run.

535
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,675
Come on.

536
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,233
Didn't think I could catch you, huh?

537
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:33,572
No, I knew you could.

538
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:35,107
Now, Cisco!

539
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,250
The amount of radiation
about to flood that room...

540
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:47,386
Atom Smasher won't be
able to absorb it all.

541
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,614
The radiation's been cleared.

542
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,449
It's safe for you to go in.

543
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,869
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:41,239
I couldn't let you hurt anyone else.

545
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:43,875
Why?

546
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:45,077
Why did you want to kill me?

547
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,086
He promised he'd take me home...

548
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:57,589
if I killed you.

549
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,625
Who?

550
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:00,826
Who promised you that?

551
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,433
Zoom.

552
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:00,050
Let's get out of here.

553
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,707
I'll race you.

554
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:06,110
You will lose.

555
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,150
Welcome home!

556
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,200
Gather round, everyone, please.

557
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:07,205
Looking at all of you,

558
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:11,742
thinking how far we've all come,

559
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:15,713
<i>and remembering those
who are no longer with us,</i>

560
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:20,952
I'm reminded of a Hebrew word
used during times of graduation.

561
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:27,625
<i>Kadima. It means, "Forward."</i>

562
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,827
Forward.

563
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,063
Forward.

564
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:32,997
Forward.

565
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,533
- Forward.
- Forward.

566
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:37,001
Forward.

567
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:38,436
- Forward.
- Forward.

568
00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:49,413
- Well said.
- Thank you.

569
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:52,283
- You good?
- Ah, yeah.

570
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:58,756
Stuff goes to your head after
being away from it for 14 years.

571
00:37:58,758 --> 00:38:02,126
I bet. All right, well, look.

572
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:04,629
I was thinking, what if, in the morning,

573
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:06,797
the two of us started looking
for an apartment for both of us,

574
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,768
and Iris has actually been
doing some research on

575
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,069
how to get your medical license back

576
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:14,305
so you could start your practice up again,

577
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:16,774
or, if you wanted, come work
with us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

578
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:19,076
I don't know. I mean...

579
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,579
- What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah, it's a party.

580
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:24,015
Come on, we can talk
about all this tomorrow.

581
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:30,588
- Talk about what?
- Barry...

582
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,126
Are you not planning on sticking around?

583
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:38,129
Okay.

584
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:40,431
Okay, do you think...

585
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:46,504
Can you be all that you are becoming...

586
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:50,041
With me here?

587
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:58,816
You're the only family that I have left.

588
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:04,789
Well, that's not really true, is it?

589
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,758
Don't you have another family in this room?

590
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,429
They need your help too, Barry.

591
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:14,932
When you need me, I will be here,

592
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:16,734
but right now, Central City
doesn't need you

593
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,369
to be Henry Allen's son.

594
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:23,040
It needs you to be the Flash.

595
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,345
My kid.

596
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:31,549
The superhero.

597
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,992
I have to go.

598
00:39:42,795 --> 00:39:50,167
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

599
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:51,869
Yeah.

600
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,300
Your dad get off okay?

601
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:28,406
Yeah, I just dropped him at the station.

602
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,574
You good?

603
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:33,077
I don't know, I...

604
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,613
Just feels like every
time I win, I still lose.

605
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:36,981
Well...

606
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:43,854
It's not bad.

607
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:47,391
No, it's not bad.

608
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:52,196
It's pretty cool. It's real cool, come on!

609
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,867
- Ho ho!
- Hey, guess what?

610
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:00,704
I added a little upgrade to your suit.

611
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:04,175
It's just like the one from
the future newspaper

612
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,177
Gideon showed us.

613
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,345
I was thinking, you know,

614
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:10,281
you shouldn't fear the
future anymore, right?

615
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:13,250
No, and it'll be here faster than we think.

616
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:15,786
Well, see, I like it. The
lightning definitely pops

617
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:17,188
more against the white.

618
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,857
And S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

619
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,226
Increased security and surveillance.

620
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:25,062
Re-coded, double firewalled,
electronic lock sets.

621
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:27,264
Nothing is getting through
here without us knowing.

622
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,500
So people can't just waltz
in and out of here.

623
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:32,036
Exactly.

624
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:33,471
For real? Stay where you are.

625
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:35,039
Who are you?

626
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,976
You don't know me, but
I know you... Barry Allen.

627
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:41,078
Take one more step, it'll be
the last step you take.

628
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,680
The man asked you a question.

629
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:46,450
Who the hell are you?

630
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:48,419
My name is Jay Garrick,

631
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:50,588
and your world is in danger.

632
