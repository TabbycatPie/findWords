1
00:00:01,582 --> 00:00:02,814
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,817
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,854
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:11,857
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,460
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,362
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:20,732
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:24,035
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,938
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,207
Previously, on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:30,742
Is this why you came to Central City?

12
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,310
This nonsense.

13
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,612
I don't actually
have to explain myself to you.

14
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:35,147
This is illegal. I'm a cop.

15
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,915
The detective who didn't know he had a son.

16
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,383
I saw Mom today.

17
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,085
She says you haven't been by in a while.

18
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,219
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

19
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:42,521
I have every right to be angry.

20
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:44,489
- I'm leaving Central City.
- What?

21
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,525
I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

22
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:47,793
at Midway City University.

23
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,528
Got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,663
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

25
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,865
Zoom's speed, and then
we'll get your daughter back.

26
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,834
That might take longer than we thought.

27
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:57,169
Because Turtle's dead.

28
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,172
Now, decide in return

29
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:02,274
for your daughter's life.

30
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:05,310
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

31
00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:10,282
People think of tar now
as mainly a roofing product.

32
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:13,485
Fun fact: it's also been used
as medicine and flavoring

33
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:15,187
for candy and liquor.

34
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,788
I bet what you're thinking right now

35
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,758
isn't "yummy", is it?

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,159
What I hope you're thinking is,

37
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:24,062
"Wow, Clay is serious
about wanting to know

38
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,664
"where I put that money.

39
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,465
"I think I'll give him
that account number now,

40
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:30,535
"so he doesn't drop me into
this vat of boiling tar."

41
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,137
Hmm?

42
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,872
I'm sorry, what?

43
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:39,578
Central City Bank account 5463728.

44
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:43,248
Please, please, pull me up now.

45
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,282
I'm so sorry!

46
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,452
Aah!

47
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:52,991
I thought you said
you weren't gonna kill him.

48
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,526
I say a lot of things.

49
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:58,630
Where's Joey?

50
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:00,065
Wishing he was somewhere else.

51
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,099
Let's go.

52
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,402
Dude, get in the car! Let's go!

53
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,137
Drive! Drive!

00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,706
There's this song lyric I like.

56
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,776
"All the broken hearts
in the world still beat.

57
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,612
"Mine's beating, but bruised.

58
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:49,547
"Hopefully not for long.

59
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,082
"The one thing I do know is:

60
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,852
time changes everything."

61
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,321
I didn't think about how many

62
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,756
crazy things police see.

63
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:59,190
And can't unsee.

64
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:00,692
You always wanted to be a cop?

65
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,260
Yeah, my dad was one.

66
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,462
He was my hero, so I never thought

67
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,497
of being anything else.

68
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,665
What about you?

69
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,267
No, I wanted to be an astronaut.

70
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,802
Wait, that's what Barry wanted to be.

71
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,070
Really?

72
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:13,305
Probably not for the same reasons.

73
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:14,973
Going to space is like the fastest

74
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,742
a human being can go,
so it was either an astronaut

75
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,111
or, like, have you heard of scramjets?

76
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,647
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, they're like

77
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,015
supersonic on oxygen, dude.

78
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,483
It's nuts.

79
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,285
You're right. Not the same reason as Barry.

80
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,654
You are really all about the speed, huh?

81
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,022
Yeah, I mean, it's what I love.

82
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:34,192
Is that why you're still drag racing?

83
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,595
You are, aren't you?

84
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,065
Isn't that a little dangerous?

85
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah, for the people that race against me.

86
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,469
Sure is.

87
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,871
Look, thanks for the hang,

88
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,139
but I got to go.

89
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,808
It's early. Don't leave yet.

90
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,043
No, I got some stuff to do.

91
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,579
I'll see you later.

92
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,887
Why'd you do that?

93
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,823
"Thanks for the hang?"

94
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,925
Is he your son or age-inappropriate buddy?

95
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,860
Look, I know the dynamic is weird.

96
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,662
I'm just trying to figure it out.

97
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,163
From my perspective, it seems like

98
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,598
you're ignoring something that could,

99
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,067
oh, I don't know, get Wally killed.

100
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,370
The fact that Wally
even wants to get to know me

101
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,538
is the big win here, so in the future

102
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,574
could you try not
chasing him out of the house?

103
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,110
Look, Dad, I'll play along
if that's what you want,

104
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:29,014
but which you exactly are you
trying to let him get to know?

105
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:31,583
Because the person that I saw tonight,

106
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:34,719
I don't recognize that dad.

107
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,359
Journal entry 1-14: Turtle's brain.

108
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:45,930
So, what I learned
from Turtle's brain matter

109
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:49,067
and the Reverse-Flash, as it turns out,

110
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,668
has allowed me to complete a device

111
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,739
that when installed inside The Flash's suit,

112
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:58,076
will let me harness his speed,
so that the next time

113
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:01,813
he taps into the Speed Force...

114
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,852
I could begin... collection.

115
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:13,158
I wish there were another way,
but there's not.

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,459
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

117
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,529
You're here late.

118
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,530
As are you.

119
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:21,066
Shouldn't you be out...

120
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,834
doing whatever it is that 26-year-olds do

121
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:24,269
on a Thursday night?

122
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,870
Um, I am recently single.

123
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,639
- Ah.
- So, I thought I would

124
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,340
tackle the breach problem.

125
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,676
See if I could figure out how to close them.

126
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:32,811
Looks like you had the same idea.

127
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:36,477
Right.

128
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,845
I work better alone.

129
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:38,979
Oh, no, haven't you heard the expression

130
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,014
"two heads are better than one"?

131
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:40,748
No.

132
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,024
Must be an Earth-1 thing.

133
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,025
You understand, for me,

134
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,660
that my Earth is Earth-1?

135
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,395
- Yeah.
- Your Earth has yet to create

136
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,331
CFL quark matter, and so
it would take you too long

137
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
to catch up on the science haul.

138
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,468
Do it by myself.

139
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,669
This science?

140
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,739
Yes, that science.

141
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,341
Watch this.

142
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,481
That's annoying.

143
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,717
Wow. All right, I'm all caught up

144
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,852
for the next, like,
30 minutes, give or take.

145
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:11,887
Looks like I missed one though.

146
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,856
All right, you can assist,

147
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,424
but I'm in charge.

148
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,993
Yeah, you're in charge.

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,972
Check that ass.

150
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,649
Hey.

151
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,083
What the hell are you doing here

152
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,152
aside from trying to send me to therapy?

153
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,987
I told you, I did some research.

154
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,056
I thought it would be a good idea

155
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,925
for a story for the paper,
plus I thought this would be

156
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,761
a great way for us to really
get to know each other.

157
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:54,030
I mean, I want to know
what's so great about this

158
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:57,066
that you can't let go, bro.

159
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,234
No one here is eager

160
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,268
to get their picture in the paper,

161
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,336
you got me?

162
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,604
And which part of the paper?

163
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,205
The front where they put

164
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:05,675
the mugshots or in the back
in the obituary section?

165
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,909
Yo, why don't you just take a page

166
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,210
out of your dad's book.

167
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:09,745
Let me do what I'm gonna do, okay?

168
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,113
I don't need a big sister.

169
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,982
I know, you're gonna need an undertaker.

170
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,317
Last race of the night, people.

171
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,120
Our reigning champ: Tail Lights.

172
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,961
Oh.

173
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,763
What?

174
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:29,498
No good luck?

175
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,090
We'll have the latest on Oliver Queen's

176
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,158
mayoral campaign coming up.

177
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,794
In local news, Roofing Tar Industries,

178
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,896
which was devastated by the S.T.A.R. Labs'

179
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,365
particle accelerator explosion
two years ago,

180
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,735
is finally set to reopen.

181
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:17,012
Guys, clean up before you leave!

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,266
Two years!

183
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,935
Two years I was trapped in the ground,

184
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,537
in that blackness.

185
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,072
I couldn't see,

186
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,874
I couldn't feel,

187
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,042
but I could still hate.

188
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,646
Joey?

189
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,148
Did you ever wonder what it felt like

190
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,117
when you dropped me in
that vat of boiling tar?

191
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,253
Since I went in headfirst,

192
00:08:57,255 --> 00:09:00,222
I actually felt my ears and nose burn off.

193
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:02,925
The pain of my eyeballs
searing was unimaginable,

194
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,795
but it was the way that
it burned down my throat

195
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:10,499
as I tried to breathe that
I thought was really special.

196
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,601
Please.

197
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,471
Why don't I just show you?

198
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,492
Excuse me.

199
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,560
- Barr, you good?
- Hey.

200
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,228
Yeah, yeah, no, it's just, you know,

201
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:28,736
it's weird Patty's not here.

202
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,504
Oh, not for the same reasons,

203
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,896
but I miss Patty too.

204
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,398
What do we got?

205
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,501
Victim's name is Daniel Burge.

206
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,470
Not exactly a Boy Scout,

207
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:42,674
but managed to buy
this garage two years ago.

208
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:45,477
It looks like he was dipped in a volcano.

209
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,512
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,714
Actually the depth and uniformity

211
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,683
of the burn pattern
is something you would see

212
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:55,019
if the body was covered
in something like lava,

213
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,554
but with a lower burn temp

214
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,823
and an added chemical characteristic.

215
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,060
The fire investigator didn't
find a secondary accelerant.

216
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:04,262
Yeah, he probably wouldn't with a meta.

217
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:07,031
All right, I'm gonna take
a sample back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

218
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,733
Have Cisco run some tests.

219
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,668
Good, I'm gonna go meet Iris for lunch.

220
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,270
She wants to talk to me about Wally.

221
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,005
Yeah, how's that going, you and him?

222
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,341
Great. Well, good.

223
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,243
I don't know, baby steps.

224
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:19,444
I'm trying to give him space.

225
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,513
I mean, he just lost his mom.

226
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,248
Just met me and his sister.

227
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,349
He's got a lot on his plate.

228
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:25,383
Yeah, he just found the best dad

229
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,351
he could've wished for.

230
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:27,652
Oh, you say that now,

231
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,020
but you didn't always think that.

232
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,488
Well, you were pretty strict.

233
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,856
That's for sure.

234
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,424
But strict isn't always a bad thing,

235
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:37,061
especially when you know
it's coming from love.

236
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,264
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.

237
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,834
It's disgusting.

238
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,284
Okay, now click here.

239
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:01,953
Bam, that's my app.

240
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,455
See, the app just went live.

241
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:11,629
So, you can sink up
all social media postings

242
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,864
about meta-human activity.

243
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,727
Somebody sees something
cray in Central City,

244
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:15,928
I get an alert about it.

245
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,496
Yo, man,

246
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,131
you have too much time on your hands.

247
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,633
Oh, I thought you were
gonna say it was cool.

248
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,643
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.

249
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:32,444
Didn't your girlfriend
just break up with you?

250
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,346
- Yeah?
- Pretty sure she just did.

251
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,015
Hey, Harry.

252
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:38,717
Wait, so if that app gives you
eyes and ears all over the city,

253
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,587
then why don't you use it
to find the next Ms. Right?

254
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,721
Did I just make the meta-human Tinder?

255
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:43,923
Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,224
Nope, not starting that fetish.

257
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,592
It's about checking your profile.

258
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,260
This is not a place for that.

259
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:51,764
Hey, baby.

260
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:53,299
Hey.

261
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,002
You look like you're working hard.

262
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:58,270
I am.

263
00:11:58,272 --> 00:11:59,638
I'm researching a story.

264
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,675
One that you'll find interesting actually.

265
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,510
Mm.

266
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:07,813
This is Curran Roberts.

267
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,315
After his head went through the windshield

268
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:14,119
of his hot rod, he was
in a coma for six months.

269
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:17,222
This kid, he died.

270
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,158
He wrapped his car around a tree

271
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,293
at 110 miles per hour.

272
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,228
They were all street racers, Dad,

273
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,831
and Wally could be the next one.

274
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,500
What do you want me to do, Iris,

275
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:29,535
lock him up?

276
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,203
Or stop the races.

277
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,738
Look, I learned a long time ago,

278
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,773
you can't stop your kids
from being who they are.

279
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,709
Really?

280
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,678
Why won't you be his parent, Dad?

281
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,780
What are you so afraid of?

282
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:43,048
All right, you're right.

283
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,783
I'm afraid.

284
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:47,853
I'm afraid he'll reject me, us.

285
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,588
Like the last time I confronted him

286
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,590
about the races, it didn't
go so well, remember?

287
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,325
And I need it to go well with Wally.

288
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,361
I mean, after all these years lost,

289
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,697
I want him in our lives,

290
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:03,068
but let me get him to trust me,

291
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,672
then I can do something about it.

292
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,240
Okay.

293
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,314
What's the matter?

294
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,783
Um, not... I can't remember,

295
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:19,752
is the helicity of a particle left-handed

296
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:22,021
if its spin and motion
is the same, or opposite?

297
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,722
- It's...
- No, hold on, I got it.

298
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:25,057
Hold on, don't answer that.

299
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,998
Opposite. I knew that.

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,433
You know that's really annoying?

301
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:36,101
Uh, it's, you know, just got to...

302
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,736
Recharge the old short-term

303
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,739
every once in a while.

304
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:45,310
You know, this feels like old times.

305
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:46,512
Okay.

306
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:47,913
Yeah, I mean, I know, obviously,

307
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,348
this is our first time working together,

308
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,184
but I am learning a lot from you.

309
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,586
The last Wells was a real mentor.

310
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,356
He believed that I could do anything.

311
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,590
Made me believe it.

312
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:00,125
Okay.

313
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:02,127
He opened up whole new worlds to me.

314
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,363
Guess he really was like
another father almost.

315
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:07,733
Stop it, all right? What?

316
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,535
I did not ask for you help, okay?

317
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:11,437
I certainly did not ask to be your mentor.

318
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,438
Okay, relax.

319
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,806
I was just talking about...

320
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:15,040
Hey, you know what? I have a kid already.

321
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,475
I don't need another one, so scram.

322
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,610
Let me finish this by myself.

323
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,381
All right.

324
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:35,294
Hey, I ran your crime scene
samples six ways from Sunday.

325
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,295
What's wrong with you?

326
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:37,429
I was...

327
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,598
Uh, nothing. What's up?

328
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,100
Two things, very strange.

329
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:43,335
One, definitely meta-human cells in the oil.

330
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,370
And two, he didn't die from his burns.

331
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:46,538
It was suffocation.

332
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,340
Suffocation?

333
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,576
That makes sense actually.

334
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,778
The burns indicated that the
body was covered in something.

335
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,447
Cross-referencing O2 levels
in the organic matter,

336
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,649
I found a direct match to animals trapped

337
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,251
and preserved in an asphalt seep.

338
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:00,786
The guy was fossilized.

339
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,121
Whoa.

340
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,889
So whoever killed him

341
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,891
is like a walking...

342
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:07,126
- Tar pit.
- Tar pit.

343
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,827
Mmm, too slow.

344
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,095
It's okay.

345
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:12,030
So, he's basically

346
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,399
drowning them in tar.

347
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,201
God, that's a horror show.

348
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,170
Why did he target Daniel Burge?

349
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,241
Oh, that's my meta-human social media app.

350
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:23,909
That's right.

351
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,177
There's an attack in progress.

352
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:27,346
6th and Bell, downtown.

353
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:58,343
Remember me, Clay?

354
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,346
We killed you.

355
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,550
I bet right now you're not thinking...

356
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:07,486
"Yummy."

357
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,855
Yo, are you guys seeing this?

358
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,423
Oh, yeah, we see it.

359
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,432
All right, any ideas?

360
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,800
Viscosity of asphalt lowers

361
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:22,968
as its temperature lowers.

362
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,169
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it hardens.

363
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,271
Hey, find a way to cool him down.

364
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,946
Hey, barbeque!

365
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,647
Hit me with your best shot!

366
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,263
Oh, yeah!

367
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,832
Team Flash!

368
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,367
Hey, buddy.

369
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,802
I've got some questions for you.

370
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,437
Let's go.

371
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:06,178
You're coming home, Jesse.

372
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,512
You're coming home.

373
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,633
All right, so Tar Pit...

374
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:14,678
Tar Pit, that's what we're calling him?

375
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,143
- That's right.
- Tar Pit was after

376
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:17,111
one Clay Stanley.

377
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:18,379
Stanley, as it turns out,

378
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,451
is a suspected hit man that the CCPD

379
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,053
has been trying to track for a while,

380
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,755
but they haven't been able
to make anything stick.

381
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,090
No pun intended.

382
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,959
Do we know why he was attacked?

383
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,028
Uh, Stanley wouldn't
answer any of my questions.

384
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,995
He was pretty scared.

385
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:32,096
When a hit man is scared,

386
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,398
you know something's wrong.

387
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,133
Hey, did you get an ID on our meta-human?

388
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,068
Yeah, I'm running it through five different

389
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,803
facial recognition systems right now,

390
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,104
so it should take a minute.

391
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,507
And there it is.

392
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,409
Who's the best hacker in the world, people?

393
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,177
- Felicity Smoak.
- Felicity Smoak.

394
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,312
What is wrong with you two?

395
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:49,214
That's not friendship.

396
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:52,016
Our meta-human's name is Joseph Monteleone.

397
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:53,451
Oh, he looks friendly.

398
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,753
"Monteleone was reported missing."

399
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,522
Surprise, surprise, the night of the

400
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:58,990
particle accelerator explosion.

401
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,258
And what's the connection

402
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,293
between Monteleone and the two victims?

403
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:03,661
I'll call Joe.

404
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,330
Have him run background checks
on all three guys.

405
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,465
Okay, I'm gonna run some tests
on the tar samples.

406
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,968
See if I can find his weakness.

407
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,374
Hey, are you feeling okay?

408
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,109
Yeah. Why?

409
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,477
You're going slower than normal.

410
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,512
You clocked in at 1,450 miles an hour.

411
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:23,147
But, I'm sorry, how fast do I usually run?

412
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,216
1,500. Are you getting enough to eat?

413
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,151
Yes, yeah, dude, I'm fine, seriously.

414
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:28,853
The difference seems negligible.

415
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,189
Fast is fast, right?

416
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,525
See ya. Yep.

417
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,497
Harvick up to fifth place by Edwards.

418
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:40,632
A valiant effort.

419
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,334
Just overtake him, you idiot.

420
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,208
Clark Bronwen?

421
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,876
Who's asking?

422
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,286
You're that chick who was
hanging around Tail Lights.

423
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:04,222
I'm a reporter for CCPN.

424
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,257
I want you to stop holding the races.

425
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,826
Sweetheart, unless you could find me

426
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,995
another way to make five grand a night,

427
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,164
it ain't gonna happen.

428
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,970
Here's a preview of
the exposé that I am writing.

429
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:21,339
You are the star of the piece.

430
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:24,042
I had a little chat with some
of your previous associates

431
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:26,277
and dug up some revealing details about you.

432
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,679
Like the gambling rings you run

433
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:30,114
or the thefts you've been involved with.

434
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:33,351
I'm sure the CCPD will be
interested in this one.

435
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:36,954
You're forgetting something in here.

436
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,223
Aggravated assault.

437
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,825
You think you're the only one

438
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,727
that can play this game?

439
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,595
I could find out where you live,

440
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:47,498
what you eat, when you sleep,

441
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,169
every little detail about your life.

442
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,570
Hmm?

443
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:54,772
Publish that trash,

444
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:58,910
we'll see what happens to you, hmm?

445
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,580
This entire conversation

446
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:05,216
is being recorded and sent to CCPN.

447
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:07,385
If you or any of your people
lay a hand on me,

448
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:11,756
my colleagues will send this
to cops immediately.

449
00:20:11,758 --> 00:20:14,025
Get out of my office.

450
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:25,570
You got a death wish?

451
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,704
You are not the first person

452
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,973
to accuse me of that, so maybe.

453
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,142
Going down there, threatening them?

454
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,177
These people, Iris, they live in the dark.

455
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,246
They're cockroaches,
except they don't scatter

456
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:36,314
when someone turns on the lights.

457
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,415
They're looking to bite.

458
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,716
If they are so dangerous, Wally,

459
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,952
then why are you in so deep with them?

460
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:42,487
I'm not.

461
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,554
I can stop when I want.

462
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,523
So why don't you?

463
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,158
You said that you were only street racing

464
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,460
to earn money for Francine's medical bills.

465
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,329
Well, there are no medical bills anymore,

466
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:53,331
so why are you still doing it?

467
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,933
Look, I am not going to pretend

468
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,436
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you,

469
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:00,104
but in the short time that
I got to spend with her,

470
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,607
I saw what kind of person she had become.

471
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,276
She was smart and kind and loving,

472
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:08,079
so I can't even imagine
how much you miss her.

473
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,715
You don't know what I'm feeling.

474
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,518
Well, let me tell you how I feel.

475
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,019
I know that you were trying really hard

476
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,721
to convince everyone that you were a badass,

477
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,956
but I know that you're a good kid, Wally.

478
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,892
And you didn't get that
way raising yourself.

479
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:22,994
You had a single mother who cared for you,

480
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,530
so my dad and I care whether
you wrap yourself around a tree

481
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:28,299
or get shot by one of these gangsters.

482
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,701
Having someone care about your well-being

483
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,171
cannot be a new sensation for you.

484
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,843
Show up there again,

485
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:41,746
and I won't be able to protect you.

486
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,891
Just going over some research.

487
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:56,227
Ten-year-old determination.

488
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,596
What?

489
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:02,533
When my daughter was ten she...

490
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,669
Science teacher had her
do a project, you know,

491
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,572
and this project...
I spent every waking hour

492
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:12,310
tinkering and perfecting
her solar-powered oven.

493
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,480
Anyway, ten-year-old determination,

494
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:18,049
you remind me of her.

495
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:25,890
Did you scold her as well?

496
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:28,426
- Yes.
- Mm.

497
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:32,363
Look, I know that this
has been hard for you,

498
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:33,798
but you're not in it alone.

499
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Yes, I am. Hell yes, I am.

500
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:38,736
I... as much as you all want me
to be part of your team,

501
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:40,271
that's never going to happen.

502
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:43,274
I'm always going to be a father first.

503
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:47,445
And one day, Zoom is gonna
make me choose between you

504
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:50,581
and my daughter, and every time,
unblinkingly, unflinchingly,

505
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,416
I would choose my daughter.

506
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,785
I will betray you.

507
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,187
That's binary thinking.

508
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:58,422
It doesn't have to be either-or.

509
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:01,659
Life is either-or...

510
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:06,230
yes/no, black/white, love/hate...

511
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:10,434
from the dawn of time
to this moment right now.

512
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,169
I guess I just have more faith in you

513
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,905
than you have in yourself,

514
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:18,242
and by the way, I came up with an idea or...

515
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:22,747
a notion rather, on how we could
close the breaches for good.

516
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,888
This is...

517
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,925
This... who wrote this?

518
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,359
You did.

519
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:38,362
Yeah, the other you.

520
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:41,933
Evil, not stupid.

521
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,501
I think the answer might be in

522
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:47,238
the electromagnetic insulator
of the quark matter.

523
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,973
Like I said,

524
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,375
we are a team.

525
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:55,980
I'm gonna take a look at this.

526
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,281
I'm going to stick around and run some

527
00:23:57,283 --> 00:24:00,451
computer sims on the formula.

528
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:02,987
I'll see you tonight.

529
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:06,157
Yeah, see you later.

530
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,076
Drink up.

531
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,052
Aah.

532
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,758
Had enough?

533
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,260
Not even close.

534
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:44,362
Give me back my daughter

535
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:45,796
and I'll get you the rest.

536
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,832
You're not in the position

537
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,767
to negotiate.

538
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,302
You won't kill me

539
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,870
and you won't kill my daughter

540
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:55,673
because if you do, then
you won't get what you want.

541
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:59,043
I don't need to kill your daughter.

542
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,014
I can torture her.

543
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:05,016
Bring her right up

544
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,885
to the edge of death,

545
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:11,789
so I can do it again the next day

546
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,924
and the next.

547
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:17,762
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

548
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:33,426
Hey.

549
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:34,280
I ran background checks

550
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:35,744
on everyone involved in this Tar Pit mess,

551
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:36,745
came up empty.

552
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,180
I mean, they all have records,

553
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,249
but they're sealed, so I can't read them.

554
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:43,385
Well, that's 'cause you're
bound by ethics, Detective West.

555
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:44,987
How many felonies are we committing

556
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:46,455
breaking into sealed court records?

557
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:48,223
Eh, three or four.

558
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:49,558
Nope, five.

559
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,060
Well, they were sealed because

560
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:52,962
the records are all juvenile offense.

561
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:53,996
They weren't arrested together.

562
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:55,531
No, but look at this.

563
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,700
They served in the same
juvenile detention facility.

564
00:25:57,702 --> 00:26:00,669
Actually, Monteleone
and victim one were bunkmates.

565
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:03,372
Who do we have shacked up with vic two?

566
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,606
Bronwen, comma, Clark.

567
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:05,607
Good luck finding him.

568
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:06,976
He has a ton of addresses

569
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,777
and I can't seem to find anything current.

570
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,913
I'll run his picture
through facial recognition.

571
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,681
That won't be necessary.

572
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:14,783
In this case, I am facial recognition.

573
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:16,752
I know exactly where we can find that guy,

574
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:19,355
and, Dad, you are not gonna like how.

575
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:22,324
Okay, you can tell me about it on the way.

576
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:24,893
What is that?

577
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:26,595
Breach implosion reactor.

578
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:27,930
Sorry I asked.

579
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:28,931
You ready?

580
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,265
Yeah, let's do it.

581
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:32,201
Have fun fixing the universe, you two.

582
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:33,569
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

583
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:34,737
You seem like you're in pain.

584
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:37,039
What? No, no, I have a...headache.

585
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:40,542
If our calculations are correct...

586
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,011
- And they are.
- And they are.

587
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,579
When this device detonates,

588
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,514
it will collapse the event horizon

589
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:48,050
on this side of the breach,
thereby shutting off

590
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,285
any connection to Earth-2 permanently.

591
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,922
Are you okay?

592
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:55,090
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

593
00:26:55,092 --> 00:26:56,125
I don't feel like myself.

594
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,394
I'm good though.

595
00:26:58,396 --> 00:26:59,862
Yeah.

596
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:02,965
- It's gonna work, Harry.
- Yep, yep. Okay.

597
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,367
You ready? Yeah, give it to me.

598
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,916
Come on.

599
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:29,158
We did it!

600
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,292
Come on!

601
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:31,827
You just rewrote the laws of physics!

602
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,796
Don't smile or anything.

603
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:35,130
I guess that was pretty cool.

604
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:36,765
Yeah, I'd say so.

605
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,401
One down, 51 to go.

606
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,270
Yeah.

607
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:43,038
Allen...

608
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,540
Yeah?

609
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,707
Thank you.

610
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:46,708
It's just the first step

611
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,545
in getting your daughter back.

612
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:51,713
Come on!

613
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:03,158
Welcome to the wrong side
of the wrong side of the tracks.

614
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,027
So where's Clark?

615
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,695
- That's him.
- Oh.

616
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,667
Come on, man.

617
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,138
There's Wally.

618
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:21,643
Now, if our fly flag girl can step up,

619
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:23,312
we're ready to begin.

620
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,470
What the...?

621
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:54,409
- Call Barry.
- Okay.

622
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:56,945
We good?

623
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,614
Been a little quiet ever
since we closed the breach.

624
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,182
Listen, Allen...

625
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:02,518
Hey, sorry, it's... real quick.

626
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,021
Hey, let me call you back, Iris, I...

627
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,189
I got to go.

628
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:20,596
Iris!

629
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:22,364
Get her to the hospital!

630
00:30:38,894 --> 00:30:40,460
Hey, baby.

631
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:41,728
Hi.

632
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,519
You all right?

633
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,411
What happened?

634
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:48,147
Piece of glass from that car
pierced your shoulder.

635
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,215
Mm.

636
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,651
But you're gonna be all right.

637
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,619
I hate hospitals.

638
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,860
Wally, hi.

639
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,729
Hey, can I come in?

640
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,999
Uh... I got you some flowers.

641
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,670
I don't know what kind
or anything, I just...

642
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:14,340
Or maybe you're allergic...
is she allergic to flowers?

643
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:17,343
No, I'm not, Wally. Thank you.

644
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:19,545
Cool. Um...

645
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,816
I'll just leave them here.

646
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:35,328
It's okay, Wally.

647
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,399
Feel better.

648
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:43,736
I'll be back.

649
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,571
Hey, hey, hold up a minute.

650
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:46,572
I got somewhere to be.

651
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:47,940
Yeah, you do.

652
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,176
At your sister's bedside.

653
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,644
Iris came to that race last night

654
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:53,245
because she cares about you.

655
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,513
Look, man, this ain't on me.

656
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,848
I didn't tell her to go to that race.

657
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,882
Look, I know you didn't.

658
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:57,883
This ain't a blame thing.

659
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:00,453
Just hear me out, okay?

660
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:05,224
Look, I know you just lost your mother

661
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,426
and you just found us,
it's been like a whirlwind.

662
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,529
Now, I... I can't tell you
how to live your life,

663
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:13,833
but I can tell you this: you're not alone.

664
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:18,237
You have people that sit up
at night worried sick about you,

665
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:21,140
and they're not going to
stop worrying about you.

666
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:24,543
That's what a family does.

667
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:25,778
They put up with each other

668
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,079
and they put each other first,

669
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,948
before ourselves.

670
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,850
So you're not mad at me?

671
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:32,418
For being reckless with your life?

672
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,487
Yeah, hell yeah, I'm mad at you.

673
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,821
But I'm more mad at myself

674
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:36,989
for being something I'm not.

675
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:40,192
I'm not your friend, Wally.

676
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,895
I'm your father.

677
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:45,097
I ain't letting you go.

678
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,466
Okay.

679
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:52,805
Oh, it's Barry.

680
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:53,806
Go.

681
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,074
I'll stay with her.

682
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,710
You sure?

683
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,346
Well, she's my sister, right?

684
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,948
That's my boy.

685
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:09,422
Don't worry, we're gonna get him.

686
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:11,157
I'm sorry, dude. What?

687
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,191
Tar Pit.

688
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,292
You shouldn't worry.

689
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,695
We're gonna get him with these.

690
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,830
With these nitrous grenades.

691
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,265
Each of these has ten times

692
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:21,434
the concentration
of a hot rod's nitrous tank

693
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:23,235
and is triggered by extreme heat.

694
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:25,104
We're talking 650 degrees.

695
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,806
That's the boiling point of asphalt,

696
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:30,209
so one of these puppies makes contact,

697
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,745
you got a Tar Pit popsicle for dessert.

698
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:35,214
All right, that's great. Um...

699
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:37,683
Hey, look, I think that

700
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:38,684
maybe you were right.

701
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:41,087
I felt slower tonight.

702
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,655
You know, not by much, but enough.

703
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:43,689
Well, do you think there's something wrong

704
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:44,724
with the suit maybe?

705
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:46,125
It's unlikely.

706
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:47,960
The readings from the suit are normal.

707
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:49,195
You know I take care of that thing.

708
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:51,564
Yeah, what? Am I sick?

709
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:52,565
I don't know, dude.

710
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,333
Feel any different?

711
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,534
No, not really.

712
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,870
I mean, I know that I'm slower

713
00:33:57,872 --> 00:34:00,740
in the moment, but I can't tell by how much.

714
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:03,142
2%.

715
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,910
Tests on the components in your blood

716
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,879
show the Speed Force at a 100%

717
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:09,381
for the last 60 days until today,

718
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:10,816
it dropped to 98.

719
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:12,351
Zoom stole Jay's speed.

720
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,686
Do you think maybe,

721
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:14,820
during your fight with Zoom,

722
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:15,821
yours might have diminished?

723
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:17,289
But that was weeks ago.

724
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,692
Why would I just be feeling
those effects now?

725
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,360
Dr. Wells? Yeah.

726
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,696
You've studied the Speed Force
more than anyone.

727
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,498
What do you think could have happened?

728
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,134
It could be any number of things.

729
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:29,802
Yeah. All right.

730
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,371
I just looked, I mean,

731
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:35,107
Iris could have died tonight.

732
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,709
She's gonna be okay, Barry.

733
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:37,710
You know, this time,

734
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:39,245
but the fact is, she is hurt

735
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,546
right now because of me.

736
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:42,615
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris

737
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:44,984
just from some meta-human tonight.

738
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:47,286
When Zoom attacks again,

739
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:51,357
I need all of my speed and then some.

740
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,959
I can't lose anyone else.

741
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,730
You won't.

742
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,499
I did it.

743
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,468
What?

744
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,008
Whoa, whoa, what is that?

745
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:16,982
I stole your speed.

746
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,484
I gave it to Zoom.

747
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:20,419
No, no, no, this isn't...

748
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,454
What... you're working with Zoom?

749
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,456
No, not at first.

750
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,525
We trusted you. I trusted you!

751
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,696
Joe, stop!

752
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,071
Why did you put him in there?

753
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,439
Because if I didn't, I would've kill him.

754
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:42,808
Let's go find this tar freak.

755
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,957
- Yeah, what the hell, man?
- Shut up.

756
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,559
I thought I was being transferred.

757
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,862
You're not being transferred.

758
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,464
You're the bait.

759
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:06,232
What?

760
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:16,943
This is for two years ago, Clay.

761
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,531
Stay.

762
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,081
You know, it's ironic.

763
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,449
I was just saying

764
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:58,418
how much you remind me of the old Wells,

765
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,220
and now, here we are,

766
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:01,487
just like I did with him,

767
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:03,289
standing on either side of this glass

768
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,359
with me asking you, "Why?"

769
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:07,527
I'm doing what I have to do

770
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:08,528
to save my daughter.

771
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,230
Yeah, at any cost, right?

772
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:11,331
The cost of Joe's daughter.

773
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,933
I told you, "I would betray you."

774
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:17,003
I told you, "I would have to choose."

775
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:18,371
You chose wrong.

776
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,872
Really, did I?

777
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:22,242
Because I just sacrificed my daughter.

778
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,110
Because I just sentenced
my daughter to death

779
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,278
to save your son.

780
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,779
You want a pat on the back?

781
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,148
I want you to send me home.

782
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,384
Send me back to Earth-2.

783
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:32,652
Think about it.

784
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:35,688
Zoom wants you to get faster.

785
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,057
He wants you to have
more Speed Force in you,

786
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,959
for when he finally takes it, send me back,

787
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,428
use the implosion reactor
to shut down the breach.

788
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,564
Shut down all the breaches.

789
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,200
Close them all

790
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,936
and Zoom will never be able to crossover,

791
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,838
ever again,

792
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,573
and that'll be the end of it.

793
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,943
What about your daughter?

794
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,579
Jesse's my battle to fight, not yours.

795
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:23,169
Hey, how are you feeling?

796
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:26,172
Like I could use some pizza right now.

797
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:29,909
Well, they're letting you out tomorrow,

798
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,577
so I can get you any kind you want

799
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,645
from anywhere you want.

800
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,747
Deal.

801
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,985
You know... growing up,

802
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:40,687
we didn't have a lot of money

803
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:44,891
to go to the movies or buy toys.

804
00:38:44,893 --> 00:38:46,559
Instead, she would just take me in the car,

805
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,194
we'd would go for these long drives.

806
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:52,231
Just her and I and her music.

807
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,300
I remember being on the road with her

808
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:58,771
and just watching the scenery flash by

809
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,206
and feeling so happy.

810
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,312
And now, when I race,

811
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:08,047
feeling that rush of speed

812
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,183
it's like...

813
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:12,885
It's like I get to back

814
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,387
to those days.

815
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:19,292
I didn't want to stop

816
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,761
because if I do...

817
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:32,038
See, that wasn't so hard.

818
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,709
Actually, it was pretty hard.

819
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:42,081
This is a sample of Barry's cells

820
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,484
after whatever Harry did to them.

821
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:45,852
As you can see, not only is it

822
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,019
drained of the Speed Force,

823
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,588
but it's also presenting itself

824
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,356
as chromosomal damage.

825
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:53,526
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

826
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:56,462
he could have taken your powers permanently.

827
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:58,631
Even Evil Wells couldn't
figure out how to do that one.

828
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,233
Well, look, somebody better
send his ass back

829
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:01,801
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

830
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:04,070
- Amen.
- No.

831
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:06,773
What do you mean, no?

832
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:08,141
What would we have done

833
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:10,376
if we were in his position?

834
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:11,444
I mean, what would you do

835
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:13,212
if it was Iris, Joe?

836
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,782
And Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

837
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,016
threatened to kill your brother

838
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:18,317
unless you helped, you did,

839
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,853
and none of us judged you for that.

840
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:23,456
We still don't because
when it comes to family,

841
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:27,059
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

842
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,428
we're all vulnerable.

843
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,631
None of us are above
making a wrong decision.

844
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:32,698
He could have done it.

845
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,699
He could have stolen my speed,

846
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,767
gotten away with it.

847
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,402
None of us would have even known,

848
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:39,305
but he didn't, and now
his daughter's gonna die

849
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:40,973
and we're okay with that?

850
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,975
I can't just give up on her.

851
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:45,912
I can't give on a world.

852
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:47,814
This is a world full of people

853
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:50,249
who are facing death.

854
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,251
I don't know, I may not be fast enough

855
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:56,222
to beat Zoom yet, but I'm not gonna just

856
00:40:56,224 --> 00:41:01,093
close the breaches and forget about it.

857
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:04,297
We have to help Wells.

858
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,366
Look, guys, I...

859
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:10,303
I was the one that trusted him first.

860
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,304
I own that.

861
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:12,638
I let him stay

862
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,974
when literally all of you told me not to,

863
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,042
so everything that's happened

864
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,410
up until this point, it's on me,

865
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:19,879
but this has to be a group decision.

866
00:41:25,954 --> 00:41:27,820
Come on.

867
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,030
Well...

868
00:41:39,634 --> 00:41:42,068
I guess this is good-bye.

869
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,004
No, it's not.

870
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,173
I told you, we're a team.

871
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,909
Now you're a part of it.

872
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,244
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

873
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:54,013
We're not sending you through alone.

874
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,048
We're going to Earth-2.
