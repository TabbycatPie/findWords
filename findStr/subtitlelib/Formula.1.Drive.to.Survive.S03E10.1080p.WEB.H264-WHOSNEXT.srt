1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Welcome to the season finale.</i>

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,440
<i>It's the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,040
I can't believe
you've recovered so quickly.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,040
Yeah. Me too, man.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,960
Only just made it.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>Lewis Hamilton is back.
He's tested negative for COVID.</i>

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,080
It's been a year like, like no other.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,760
<i>The World Championship record is equaled.</i>

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>Lewis Hamilton
is a seven-time champion of the world.</i>

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,160
I think what we've done as a team is...
It's very special.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,520
<i>It's seven consecutive
Constructors' Championships for Mercedes.</i>

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,320
If you're gonna take on Mercedes,
you've gotta be firing on all cylinders.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,240
<i>Oh dear. That's Max Verstappen.</i>

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,880
- Fuck!
- Something broke.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,840
<i>Max Verstappen is out
of this race and out of the car as well.</i>

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,360
You need to see that gap reduced.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,120
<i>Can Red Bull put down
a marker for next year?</i>

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
<i>And who will prevail
in this epic battle for third?</i>

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
We're in a very good position.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,960
It's gonna go down to the wire.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Who wants it more will probably do it.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,360
The battle for third in the Constructors',
it's absolutely incredible

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,720
that we should be
at the last race of the season...

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,840
'Sup?

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
...and still have
this massively important fight.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,400
I think we've got a good plan.
It's all coming together.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,200
And now it's going down to the wire.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,080
<i>We have come to the final
of the pre-practice sessions in 2020.</i>

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520
The battle
for third is Racing Point...

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,320
The key is
I don't want to overheat the tires.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
...Renault...

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,000
It's gonna be hot again.
I think 30 degrees or something.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,400
...and us.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,800
All right,
let's fucking win this thing.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,520
It's a game where you want
to make the most

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,480
of other people's misfortunes,

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,200
but, uh also realize that, at any point,
things could happen to you.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,600
If anything, we thought Racing Point
would be quite convincingly third,

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,280
so we brought a very good fight to them.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
And we knew it was gonna be
a very tough fight with Renault.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,440
You think
we should be competitive there?

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360
I've never been so...
probably excited about finishing third

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,960
in a championship before.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
It's been a hell of a battle.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,480
I mean, at times,
Racing Point's been third,

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,880
McLaren's been third, we've been third.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,960
It's gonna be tight,
but all we can do is focus on this weekend

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,480
and end the season on a strong note.
That's, uh, you know, the hopes.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,960
To fuck shit up in
all the good ways possible.

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,560
That's what I'm hoping to do.

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,160
<i>On board with Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
<i>Nice job, mate.</i>

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,600
Two or three more laps like this
would be great.

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
Okay, this is about my pace now.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
<i>Very classy performance.
He's absolutely flying.</i>

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,440
Yeah, I think 'cause I'm, uh,
I just have amazing natural abilities,

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,240
uh, I'm the epitome
of human high performance...

58
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,960
<i>Daniel Ricciardo
is having a very good final sector here.</i>

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,920
It's just hard.
It's just hard to be humble.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960
It's really hard!

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
I'm just kidding.

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,720
<i>Daniel Ricciardo
absolutely aces the final sector</i>

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
<i>and goes second fastest.</i>

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,120
I honestly feel
I'm getting better each year.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,320
There's things I'm still...
internally, I know I'm doing better,

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,760
even if it's controlling the pressure,
controlling the emotion.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,840
It's also experience, you know. It's...
it's my tenth year, I think, in Formula 1

68
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,200
and I'm at that,
probably at that nice balance now

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,680
where I've got, still got the desire
and the, let's say, the will

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,320
to push the car to the limit,

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
but I've also got now the knowledge
and experience

72
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
of being a tenth-year driver.

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
Is that a podium, boys?

74
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
Is that a fucking podium?

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
<i>It's a fucking podium!</i>

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>He's here. Woo!</i>

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
- <i>Mega, man, mega.
- </i>Oh!

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>Daniel Ricciardo
comes home in third place</i>

79
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,440
<i>and gives Renault their first podium
since Malaysia in 2011.</i>

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,720
A fucking podium, Daniel!
Thank you!

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Well done.

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,360
Every single lap
that we see Daniel performing,

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,840
a moment of uh,
of joy and satisfaction, of pleasure,

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,400
but at the same time,
it's negative emotion

85
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,600
because we also measure what
we'll be missing, what we'll be losing.

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,240
It feels like
the first podium again.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,680
The joy and, uh, the feeling was missed,
so yeah, I'm very happy.

88
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,560
For him, it was so important
to make the point and to show

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,120
that until the last lap of the last race,

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,520
he will be loyal to his decision
that he made a few years ago.

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm sorry, but yeah,
it's... it's not complete.

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
It's not over yet.

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
So, we made the bet.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,600
It was if I get a podium,
uh, he has to get a tattoo.

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,800
I probably threw it out there because
I've got more than a tattoo or two.

96
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,400
I was like, "Why don't you get one?
Do you have any?"

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,080
He goes, "No."
I was like, "That's it. Tattoo."

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
So he was like, "Okay."

99
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,640
Well, you know what,
if we do a podium, I'll do a tattoo!

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,880
- You've got to.
- I can't... It's not...

101
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,800
We've achieved the achievable

102
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,960
and it's time to get it done.

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,560
Have you done this one before?

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,760
- The buffet?
- No.

105
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,920
- For lunch?
- We had it for dinner, it was cool.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,280
It's good
to get something healthy, eh?

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Sometimes, I give up, I'm like...

108
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,240
It's the first time I didn't
check the dessert menu.

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,200
- Says the Dyson!
- What's that book?

110
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
One of the boys gave it to me
to give to you. Look.

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,760
There's some
of the most, like, horrific tattoos.

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,320
- Oh my gosh!
- It's for Cyril!

113
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh no!

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
I've never seen someone so excited
to get a tattoo, so...

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
That Homer Simpson one's awesome.

116
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,800
Have you seen the Judge Judy one?

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,240
I spoke to him the other night about it.
He reckons he's gonna get it on his ankle.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,600
- Yeah.
- That's the most painful spot!

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
- But I think he feels it's like... Yeah.
- It's hidden.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
We can pass this on to Cyril.

121
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,680
It's the worst tattoos.

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,840
I was not betting
against my own luck,

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,840
I was not betting against my own team,

124
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
and I'm extremely happy

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,800
to have to honor this... this obligation
now that we've done this podium.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Oh, yeah, a bit of sun!

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,400
♪ <i>There you are looking at me
On the elevator... ♪</i>

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
Fruit platter?

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
For you?

130
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,600
Thank you.

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,800
No, it's not for him. No, no, no.

132
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,720
It's for us.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,120
No, leave it here.

134
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,880
I am the athlete.
I need to hydrate.

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,120
What do you mean
he's a very important person?

136
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
- He pays.
- He pays.

137
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
But leave it here.

138
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
Yay!

139
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
So, battle for third,

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,760
we are behind our friends there
in Racing Point.

141
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,120
A few more than Renault
and a few more than Ferrari.

142
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

143
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,200
We've gone all of a sudden
from being the underdog

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,600
to having a chance
to win that midfield battle.

145
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,280
We are doing a good job
of making it to the points with both cars.

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,600
I think it's time for...

147
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,960
There you go.

148
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,800
With Carlos's podium last season,

149
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,360
a lot of people saw him as,
you know, <i>the </i>driver within the team.

150
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,200
That hit me hard because it's something
I'd want more than anything,

151
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,360
but then it switched, I think,
quite heavily, as we came into the season.

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
I started the year with a podium,

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
then a lot more people saw me
as being able to deliver when I need to.

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
How's it going, dude?

155
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm quite sore after, um...

156
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,400
- Golf?
- After golf.

157
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
- Are you?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
- What kind of golf were you playing?
- Men's golf.

159
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,280
We're very tight
in the championship.

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,120
I think, you know, before the last race,
we were split by one point. I was behind.

161
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,520
Now, I'm one point ahead.

162
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,720
- What do you play off, 12?
- Uh, 16.

163
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
- Carlos is pretty good.
- Yeah.

164
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,840
We want to beat each other,
but we also

165
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,120
need to do a good job for the team.

166
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,400
We don't have one driver doing really well
and one doing not well.

167
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,520
We're pushing each other,

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,840
and, uh, I think that's why
we're probably the closest pairing

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,160
or closest teammates on the grid
consistently in qualifying and races.

170
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Gonna be tight.

171
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,280
- Gonna be tight.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,440
Racing Point
have been third best the whole year.

173
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,080
We'll miss Carlos.
We've enjoyed our time racing with him,

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
but, you know, we're... we're excited

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
and, uh, in a couple of races' time,

176
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,400
we'll be, uh, thinking
all about, uh, Daniel and... and Lando,

177
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,440
and hopefully,
that'll take us yet to another level.

178
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,560
I wanna know what Daniel thinks
when he drives it.

179
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
What he brings, you know,
why everyone says he's so special,

180
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,000
why they say he's a better driver
than the majority of the grid.

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Learning from him,
you know, a multiple race winner,

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,200
a guy who's worked
with multiple different teams and so on,

183
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,000
I just look forward
to that next chapter of the story.

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,600
<i>Welcome to the Yas Marina circuit.</i>

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,720
<i>It's time for one final blast
around the track</i>

186
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>

187
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,760
<i>It is the last qualifying of the season.</i>

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,840
<i>Renault have been quicker
than Racing Point and McLaren all week.</i>

189
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,040
<i>It's a Grand Prix
for which pole position is crucial</i>

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,160
<i>and the last five races have all been won
by pole position here.</i>

191
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
<i>A tenth and a half
covers the top four.</i>

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,600
<i>It's very much Red Bull versus Mercedes.</i>

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,160
<i>Something is changing
a bit for a Mercedes team this evening</i>

194
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,240
<i>that have been one and two
in qualifying here,</i>

195
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,680
<i>uh, for the last six Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
<i>So, pressure then,
on Daniel Ricciardo of Renault,</i>

197
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
<i>just to get into Q3.</i>

198
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,440
<i>Also pressure on Lando Norris' McLaren.</i>

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,160
<i>As we watch Lance Stroll.</i>

200
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,960
<i>Can he get into Q3?</i>

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,480
<i>That'll do nicely.</i>

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
<i>Lewis, then, really treating his tires
extremely kindly on the out lap.</i>

203
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,080
<i>Hamilton crosses the line.
He's back on pole position.</i>

204
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,720
<i>Who can deny him now?</i>

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
<i>What about Max Verstappen?</i>

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,120
<i>He's gone best of all
in the middle sector.</i>

207
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,080
<i>He was only a tenth down in the first.</i>

208
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,440
<i>Max Verstappen's taken pole
in the season finale.</i>

209
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
<i>Pole position.
That's a statement.</i>

210
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,600
<i>- Excellent job.</i>
- Yes!

211
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Come on, boys! Come on!

212
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,240
Well done, Max.
Mega lap. Well done!

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,800
Ah, this feels good.

214
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,680
Well done, boys. Amazing. Amazing.

215
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,200
<i>Great lap by Norris,
powering his way.</i>

216
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,520
<i>Gets to about 200 miles an hour.</i>

217
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,280
P4. Get in.

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
<i>Fuck yeah!</i>

219
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,760
Nice.

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,840
<i>Daniel Ricciardo
can't get into the top ten</i>

221
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,320
<i>and he misses out by just four hundredths
of a second to his teammate.</i>

222
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,880
<i>That's a shocker.</i>

223
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,760
<i>I fully expected him
to clear the bar and get into Q3.</i>

224
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,120
<i>Both Renaults are out.</i>

225
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,480
<i>Lance Stroll takes
eighth place on the grid, sadly for him.</i>

226
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,280
<i>That's going
to make Racing Point uncomfortable.</i>

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,760
You know, I want to do well,
so I... I'm frustrated,

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,760
but overcoming tough times
and getting through them,

229
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,080
that's something that, um,
I've improved at as I've matured.

230
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,960
Fucking surfing!

231
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,000
Nice one.

232
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,400
I look back and there's been
quite a few, uh, highlights this season.

233
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,600
It's great when you do well.

234
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,760
I was on pole a few weeks ago.

235
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,160
<i>Here comes Lance Stroll.</i>

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,000
<i>Stroll crosses the line
and he does go pole!</i>

237
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,480
<i>1:47.7.</i>

238
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,760
It was just
such an amazing achievement.

239
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,280
Yes, boys!

240
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Let's go!

241
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,480
You dream about things in the sport

242
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,640
and one of those things
is to stand on the podium,

243
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
to win a race,
and, you know, to be on pole.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,800
Brad, I wanna hear you say it, mate.
That's pole position!

245
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
I wanna hear you say it!

246
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
<i>That's pole position, Lance,
pole position.</i>

247
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,120
Let's go!

248
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,200
I love my job.

249
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,640
Lance did a great job
putting it on... on pole,

250
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
which just shows what talent, uh, he has.

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,440
And then after that, in Bahrain,
we scored a significant amount of points.

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>Sergio Perez comes home
to win the Sakhir Grand Prix!</i>

253
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,320
<i>And it's the first ever
double podium for Racing Point as well,</i>

254
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,320
<i>as Lance Stroll takes third place.</i>

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,680
<i>Well done, Lance.
P1 and P3 for the team.</i>

256
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
Well done, guys.

257
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,480
But...

258
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
...you know, sometimes, um...

259
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,440
you love the sport
and it just don't love you back.

260
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,040
<i>Here comes Dani Kvyat
down the inside</i>.<i> Oh, there's contact!</i>

261
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
<i>Massive accident.</i>

262
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,960
<i>Are you okay?</i>

263
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,960
Yeah, I'm okay.

264
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,560
Definitely wasn't a normal race
after that happened.

265
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,560
<i>There's Sergio Perez.</i>

266
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
<i>Oh, puffs of smoke!</i>

267
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
<i>That's Sergio Perez
very much out of this race.</i>

268
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,040
You know, it's racing.

269
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,720
Some weekends are good
and some weekends are bad.

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,440
For sure, it sucks.

271
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Uh, none of us were happy
walking away from that race,

272
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,520
but I'm still learning.

273
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,280
I think we learn every day.

274
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,520
You catch that six-meter wave?

275
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,240
- You were killing it out there.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,280
I definitely wanna work
on my consistency, get better

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,240
and, you know, be there more often.

278
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,840
Um, I just turned 22, so,

279
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,600
um, I do see myself getting better,

280
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,840
hopefully.

281
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,160
<i>As we bring to an end
the Formula 1 season in 2020,</i>

282
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,960
<i>17 races and 3,249 racing miles,</i>

283
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,320
<i>it is down to this</i>

284
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,880
<i>to decide who gets that third spot
in the Constructors' Championship.</i>

285
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,960
There are
a fair few million reasons

286
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,320
why you'd wanna fight for third
in the Constructors' Championship.

287
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,760
It's not just about pride.
It's big bucks. Big, big bucks.

288
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,920
Racing Point are ten points ahead
of McLaren with one race to go.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
That's an easy swing.

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,400
I would have said a few races ago,
it was Renault.

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
However, McLaren are the ones
that are right behind us.

292
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,200
Arguably, Racing Point have been
the third-fastest car of the season.

293
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
Anything less than third
in the Constructors'

294
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,960
could be seen

295
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
as a failure.

296
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,600
We're on this journey
to get back to the front of the field,

297
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,960
and we've been ninth, sixth, fourth,

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,720
and here we are, fighting so hard
to finish third in the championship.

299
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,120
<i>Renault's
a bit further back in the race for third,</i>

300
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,680
<i>12 points behind McLaren,</i>

301
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>who are in turn
ten points behind Racing Point.</i>

302
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,040
Given all the water
that's gone under the bridge this year

303
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,920
between Racing Point and Renault,

304
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,000
there's no way Cyril wants to lose third
in the Constructors' Championship

305
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,120
to that team.

306
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,480
Racing Point this season,

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,880
uh, clearly, uh.

308
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,200
no one was expecting a team of this size

309
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,240
to... to be operating at that level.

310
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,400
So, clearly, finishing, uh, on that podium
of P3 for the Constructors'

311
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,440
would be, uh, quite something for us.

312
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,160
<i>It's a race
that could just conjure up anything</i>

313
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,680
<i>and you can feel it,
the pressure in the air.</i>

314
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>With a ten-point lead
over underdogs McLaren</i>,

315
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,440
<i>Racing Point must be favorites.</i>

316
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>And in his last race for the team,</i>

317
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,520
<i>only a fool would bet
against Daniel Ricciardo and Renault.</i>

318
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,360
- This is what it's all about, Tom.
- Yeah.

319
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,760
Normal start.

320
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,760
Let's have a good race.

321
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,600
I think we can pull it off.
I think we can pull it off.

322
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,360
All right. Whatever happens today,
thank you for everything.

323
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Fuck some shit up.

324
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
Give everything.

325
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,320
Yep. Thank you, boys.

326
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
Fifty-five laps.

327
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
Everything we got.

328
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
<i>And for the final time,</i>

329
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,040
<i>we're racing in 2020.</i>

330
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
<i>Verstappen ahead of Bottas.</i>

331
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,280
<i>Norris getting a good start,
but behind Lewis Hamilton.</i>

332
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,840
<i>Into the first real big braking zone
we go.</i>

333
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,800
<i>Daniel Ricciardo on the Ferrari
at the hairpin</i>

334
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,040
<i>and he's got himself
ahead of Sebastian Vettel.</i>

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,280
<i>Currently,
your pace is faster than anyone up to P4.</i>

336
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
Understood.

337
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,080
<i>Here comes Lance Stroll.</i>

338
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,560
<i>Two points in it at the moment
between McLaren and Racing Point,</i>

339
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,480
<i>now that Lance Stroll has moved up
into seventh place.</i>

340
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
<i>Sergio Perez still right at the back.</i>

341
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm losing power.

342
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I lost the fucking engine again.

343
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,960
I'm off.

344
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,320
<i>That is absolute heartbreak</i>

345
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,480
<i>for Perez and the Racing Point team.</i>

346
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,040
You're fucking kidding me!

347
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,160
<i>What could that do
for the team's ambitions</i>

348
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,720
<i>to finish third
in the Constructors' Championship?</i>

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,880
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Perez engine failure.

350
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
That's what I want to hear!

351
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
Go on, Carlos!

352
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,520
<i>Daniel Ricciardo in fifth,
stayed out and got track position.</i>

353
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,280
<i>- Car behind is Norris.</i>
- Okay.

354
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,800
We should naturally be quicker
than Ricciardo ahead.

355
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, confirm.

356
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,520
This is looking really good.

357
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,640
<i>A good bet for fifth place, McLaren.</i>

358
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,880
<i>202 points as it stands at the moment</i>

359
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
<i>will be taking that third spot
in the Constructors' Championship.</i>

360
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Nice job.

361
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,240
<i>Stroll, the one remaining
Racing Point car left in this race.</i>

362
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Ah! Brakes are shit!

363
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,360
<i>Big lock-up there from Stroll.</i>

364
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
We've got a tire problem.

365
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,920
We have no traction.

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm trying to brake, but I lock up.

367
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,240
<i>You can understand
Racing Point's concern there.</i>

368
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,480
<i>Pierre Gasly
has gone down the inside of Lance Stroll.</i>

369
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,240
<i>He's gone past the Racing Point.
They did touch as Gasly went through.</i>

370
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,640
It's unbelievable how bad we are
at maintaining temperature.

371
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,160
<i>Stroll's gonna have to look out behind him</i>

372
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
<i>because Esteban Ocon's catching
at a rate of knots.</i>

373
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,600
<i>Verstappen, starting from pole,</i>

374
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,320
<i>he's led every single lap of the race.</i>

375
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,200
<i>As he rounds the final corner,
the checkered flag's in sight.</i>

376
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,400
<i>Verstappen wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</i>

377
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,080
<i>and rounds off the season
in perfect fashion</i>

378
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
<i>for himself and for Red Bull.</i>

379
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,441
<i>Norris crosses the line to finish in fifth</i>

380
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,680
<i>and his teammate Carlos Sainz,
home in sixth position.</i>

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,040
Yeah!

382
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah!

383
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,320
<i>Daniel Ricciardo will be seventh.</i>

384
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Awesome job.

385
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Thank you.

386
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,120
<i>Ocon is really hustling
the Racing Point now</i>

387
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
<i>in the battle for ninth place.</i>

388
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>Ocon has DRS.</i>

389
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
Brad, leave me alone.

390
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Go!

391
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Yeah!

392
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>Esteban Ocon left
his good work right until the last minute.</i>

393
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,440
<i>It's gonna be Esteban Ocon
to finish in ninth place.</i>

394
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,040
Yes!

395
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,520
Until the end there.

396
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,680
Oh, well done, mate. Good effort.

397
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
<i>Stroll couldn't score the points</i>

398
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
<i>that Racing Point wanted and needed.</i>

399
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh, fuck.

400
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,720
Thanks, guys.
That was a nice way to send it off.

401
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,480
Thank you, Daniel.

402
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,840
And, uh, we look forward
to racing against you next year very much.

403
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
Thank you.

404
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,120
We can have a beer tonight.

405
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
<i>Two.</i>

406
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Congrats, everyone.

407
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,640
- Lando, great job.
- Great job, Lando!

408
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
- Cheers, Zak.
<i>- Yo, dude!</i>

409
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,880
We all know you would've won
the race, but, you know, we did our best.

410
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,520
Great job!

411
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Woo!

412
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,760
Well, luck is,
uh, definitely a part of sport.

413
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,720
I think you create your own, uh, luck

414
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,280
by working very hard
and having great people.

415
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,960
I think this year, there's more
hard work and grit and determination

416
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,200
that's gone into it,

417
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,960
which is another step,
a lot more money for the team.

418
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,360
Getting that third spot's part
of that story I'm trying to make

419
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
with McLaren.

420
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,200
Getting back to that, winning races
and winning championships again.

421
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,280
We only did it in the last race,
so it was close,

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,800
but, um, as long as we improve some races,

423
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,040
my engineer does a better job, um...

424
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,040
...then I look forward
to another season next year

425
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,000
where we can hopefully do a bit better.

426
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on, man.

427
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,640
Congratulations.

428
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Leaving a team, moving on,

429
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,680
I think kind of breaking any relationship
is... is never easy.

430
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,240
I look back now,
and I look back at the start of 2019

431
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,840
and where we are now
and yeah, we really did build something.

432
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm stoked that we can part ways

433
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,760
knowing that it was...
it was a really nice two years.

434
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,560
Daniel is a fantastic driver.
I cannot not love Daniel.

435
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,920
I love Daniel. We all do.

436
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,400
Everyone's life has sort of...

437
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,120
uh, these moments where you know
you should be doing something

438
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,760
and waiting and pushing,
but procrastinating a bit.

439
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Daniel is the one that has pushed us
into doing the changes.

440
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm not convinced we would have done
those changes without Daniel.

441
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
Credit to Cyril, he actually called me

442
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
'cause he obviously,
he really wants to honor the bet.

443
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,520
And I said, "With lockdown, the way
Europe is at the moment, it's difficult,

444
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,680
so it'll probably have to wait
'til next year."

445
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,040
Who's paying? You paying or I'm paying?

446
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,760
He gets to choose a design
and I think he's done that,

447
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,120
and I get to choose the size and location
and I've done that also.

448
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
Not too visible.

449
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,480
But a Mike Tyson thing, no.

450
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,720
I guess the base of it
will be something quite traditional

451
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,560
and then maybe
with, like, a little bit of, uh,

452
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,840
a honey badger involvement in there.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,040
But I don't wanna make it too,
like, cheesy or anything,

454
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,520
but it should also be something
that maybe he looks at and giggles,

455
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,520
uh, for... for the rest of his days.

456
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,920
We should have come third,
but it's not easy to do.

457
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,680
Next year,
our driver line-up is, uh, Lance

458
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,880
and Sebastian,
four-time world champion, a veteran.

459
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
We wanted to bring in a driver
who had the experience

460
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,680
of working with world-championship teams.

461
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
To have a young,
up-and-coming driver

462
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,120
with an experienced driver
is the right thing to do,

463
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,800
and who better to learn from
than Sebastian Vettel,

464
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,960
who's a four-time world champion?

465
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Lance can learn from Seb
and, uh, and hone it

466
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,480
such that he too, in the future,
can aspire to become a world champion,

467
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,680
so I think we got a great combination.

468
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,920
Next year,
Lawrence has big ambitions for the team.

469
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,680
Any moment, guys, be ready.

470
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,360
Aston Martin is coming in,
a great name for Formula 1.

471
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,960
Ultimately,
it's all about contract performance

472
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,480
and there's a lot that goes into that.

473
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,800
And that's what Lawrence wants to do,

474
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
that's what we're gonna focus on
in the next two, three, four, five years.

475
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Good morning.

476
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,120
The heart and soul of this company
started with its racing.

477
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,560
This is the factory
where the cars are built.

478
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
And then, to support its racing,

479
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,520
built the most luxurious
bespoke automobiles.

480
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,880
- Looks really good.
- Yep.

481
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,600
So, it was natural
to be able to take Aston Martin

482
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,760
and align it
with these great bunch of guys

483
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,440
that is currently today Racing Point.

484
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,240
It's, I believe, the most exciting thing
to happen in Formula 1 in decades.

485
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,680
- That's a great color.
- Yep.

486
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,520
Aston Martin are seen
as the British Ferrari.

487
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,880
That link with James Bond,
that 1960s chic.

488
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,840
It's very, very cool.

489
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,800
You get so excited,
seeing all this luxury product,

490
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,200
bring Formula 1 to market it
and put it on track next year,

491
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
it's very beautiful.

492
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,400
This is where we have our design center.

493
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,760
Marek Reichman,
our chief creative director,

494
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,760
and his people...

495
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,120
Hello, Marek.

496
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,640
...are about to show me the visuals
of what our cars will look like

497
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,120
for next year on the grid.

498
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,616
- How's it going?
- Good. You?

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
Yeah, good.

500
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,840
What we have developed
is a very modern green color,

501
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,600
which has a dichromatic effect over it.
What does that mean?

502
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,640
It means
it really sparkles in the sunlight.

503
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
That's spectacular.

504
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,680
This looks like it's going faster
standing still.

505
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,800
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

506
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,280
We gotta make sure it's fast on the track.
That's great.

507
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,880
So, if there's been a lot of jealousy
on track of our performance this year,

508
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,200
there's gonna be a lot more jealousy
from our competitors

509
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,520
when they see
how good and quick we are next year.

510
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
It's a difficult year.

511
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,000
When the pandemic started, we didn't know
if we were gonna be still here or not

512
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,120
and we needed to do tough decisions
about the drivers.

513
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,840
Thank you to all of you and thank you
for the time we had here with Kevin.

514
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,360
There is obviously ups and downs,
but that's life.

515
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,600
- All right, Kevin. This is for you.
- Thank you.

516
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher.

517
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,960
This year,
he was first in the F2 Championship.

518
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,120
Mick Schumacher, Michael's son.

519
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,400
- This is the race helmet from 2012.
- Thank you. It's such an honor.

520
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,280
I really appreciate that. Thank you.

521
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,560
- And Nikita Mazepin.
- Yeah!

522
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,680
His father has come
to invest in the team.

523
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,320
It's a family which loves racing.
That is what, uh, Nikita loves

524
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
and what his dad loves.

525
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,760
For the future Haas F1 team,
I need sponsors, uh, uh, to survive.

526
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm very happy to have him on board.

527
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,920
I'm really excited to start
as soon as possible in 2021.

528
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,960
Now we've got a lineup of young drivers,
which is great.

529
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,320
Carlos did very well through the 2020,

530
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,320
and he's bringing
some know-how and experience.

531
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,360
He will fit very well with Charles.

532
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,600
Both young,
but already experienced drivers,

533
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,240
so I think
it's solid foundations for the future.

534
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,400
The plan for 2021
is try and take off where we left off.

535
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,200
We've beaten Mercedes at, arguably,
one of their most dominant venues.

536
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,600
It wasn't a lucky win.

537
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,280
It was a pole position
and a straight fight

538
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
against the two Mercedes.

539
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,520
Mercedes produced the most competitive car
they've ever done this year.

540
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,640
They are the benchmark currently
in Formula 1.

541
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,800
They have dominated the sport
for the last six years.

542
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
To beat them,
you've got to be at the top of your game.

543
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,240
We got ahead of them
by the end of the year.

544
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
It took a monumental effort,

545
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,720
but we've demonstrated it's possible.

546
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,880
With Sergio and his experience
alongside Max next year,

547
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,000
it's achievable.

548
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,880
We've just got to do it over 23 races
rather than over one race.

549
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,360
We've been unbeatable again in 2020
as a team

550
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,040
and, um, it doesn't happen for no reason.

551
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,800
<i>Time after time after time,</i>

552
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,280
<i>Mercedes create
an absolute monster of a machine.</i>

553
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,040
I think, when you reflect
on the seventh consecutive title,

554
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,880
you have that moment of satisfaction,

555
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,120
but that passes quickly.

556
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,080
You think about the next race
and you think about the next year,

557
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,120
what you need to do
in order to stay competitive.

558
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
There is no sense of entitlement
or complacency within the team.

559
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
<i>Breaking news:</i>

560
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,400
<i>Toto Wolff has signed up
for Mercedes for another three years.</i>

561
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,720
I've led this team now
for seven years,

562
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,160
which means traveling to all Grand Prix.

563
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,720
I've spent 250 hotel nights last year.

564
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,520
More than 700 hours in an airplane.

565
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,160
And you start to ask yourself
how much longer can you do that?

566
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,960
But on the other side,
I'm a co-owner with Mercedes of the team.

567
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm not gonna walk away.

568
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,080
Especially if you like to keep an overview
of what's happening.

569
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,720
So, in a way, you need to decide

570
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,520
whether you want to be on the dance floor
or on the balcony

571
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,280
and I'm on the dance floor at the moment.

572
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,160
But one day, I'd like to be on the balcony
and oversee the whole situation.

573
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't think we're done yet

574
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
with seven titles.

575
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,880
There's more to come.

576
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,720
This year has been
about more than just racing.

577
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,720
Relax.

578
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
I can't breathe, my face.

579
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,616
What are you on?

580
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
I can't breathe!

581
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
What happened with George,
it brought up a lot of emotion.

582
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,840
All of a sudden, things that have been
suppressed over my lifetime

583
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,280
bubbled to the surface.

584
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,560
And I was like...
I can no longer stay quiet.

585
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,080
Every Black kid in the world will,
at some stage, experience racism.

586
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
It's just a fact.

587
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,560
When people call you names
and the N-word's thrown around,

588
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,840
you're told to go back to your own country
when you're in your own country.

589
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,080
There are literally millions
and millions of people

590
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,520
who will have experienced
much, much worse,

591
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,080
and that needs to change.

592
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,080
I had it so many times.

593
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,440
In the past years,
I've had racist names being called to me,

594
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,480
but lately, um,
if anybody has said anything to me,

595
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
I just ignore them.

596
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,400
I was just eight years old.

597
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,200
For someone to look down
at a young eight-year-old

598
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,040
and tell them they're not gonna
achieve anything in life,

599
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,760
they must be in a really bad place.

600
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,840
As Lewis began to win,

601
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,560
the fact that he was
the only Black face on the track

602
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,800
became an issue.

603
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,160
My dad would always tell me,

604
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,520
"Tread carefully.
Be careful what you say."

605
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,960
We don't get involved with, um, people
who have problems about whether we win

606
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,680
or whether... what color we are.

607
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,000
We go out on the track and we do our best.

608
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,840
What's it been like for you
to be the only Black Formula 1 driver?

609
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Sometimes I wonder why.

610
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,280
Why me? Why am I the...
the only Black driver that's come along

611
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,680
and had the ability,
not only to get in the sport,

612
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,840
but be at the front of it for so long?

613
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,920
That's okay.
I mean, I've been built for this.

614
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,240
People probably don't...

615
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,120
...won't know
that I grew up, like, on my dad's couch,

616
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,160
so we didn't have any money.

617
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,200
I remember the struggle.

618
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,440
I remember how hard it was for my mum
with the multiple jobs she had

619
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,880
to keep a roof over mine
and my two sisters', uh, heads.

620
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,520
I remember how it was for my dad
to keep me racing.

621
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,760
So, I... I know

622
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
how hard it was.

623
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,880
And then, on top of that,
that other struggle

624
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,680
with acceptance and not fitting in,

625
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,760
that's all bubbled up into,

626
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
hmm, you know...

627
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
created the beast, I guess,
that you see on the track.

628
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,680
<i>Lewis Hamilton wins!</i>

629
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,520
<i>Hamilton has more wins
than any other driver</i>

630
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,640
<i>in Formula 1 history.</i>

631
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,920
The way I'm wired,
I... I don't really have a filter.

632
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I say what's on my mind

633
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,880
and I'm not always too bothered
about upsetting someone

634
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,440
if it's gonna make a difference.

635
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,880
<i>And the winner, Lewis Hamilton!</i>

636
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,080
What I think this year's shown was

637
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,040
when you do have that success,
what are you gonna do with it?

638
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,800
I'll be damned if I'm gonna win
all these championships

639
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,440
and have all this success

640
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,040
and not, um, use it to make change.
