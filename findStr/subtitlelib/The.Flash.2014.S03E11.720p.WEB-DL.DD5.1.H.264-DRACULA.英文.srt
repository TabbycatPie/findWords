1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,190
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,370
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,110
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,740
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,430
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,770
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,180
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,420
and I saw him murder the woman I love.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,130
But I won't let that happen.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm going to do everything in my power to change the future,

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,790
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,060
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,170
Previously on "The Flash"...

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,610
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force,

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,360
I accidentally ran into the future.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,010
I saw Savitar murder you.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,580
I wasn't fast enough to save you.

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,220
We can't do this alone, Barry.

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,000
Why don't you come work with us?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,340
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,820
Welcome to the team.

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,040
If his powers are linked to the energy

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,450
that ties together the multiverse...

24
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,690
He can open a breach to any Earth he wants.

25
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,750
The thing they never tell you about fighting villains

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,290
is that nothing ever stays the same.

27
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,730
The harder you work to take down the bad guys,

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,530
the more they up their game.

29
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,830
Gentlemen,

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,910
welcome to the future of crime.

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,810
Not even the military has these yet.

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,970
Looks like Christmas came early.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,120
You know what the only problem is?

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,950
You're on Santa's naughty list.

35
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,630
Christmas is canceled.

36
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,260
Fortunately, our team has a secret weapon of its own:

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,930
a man of science, a man of action,

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,450
and that man's name

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,240
is H.R. Wells.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,940
Look who has a vortex cannon.

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,710
HR
H.R.?

42
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,040
HR
H.R.?

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,310
With a blast from my trusty vortex cannon,

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,380
- I dispatch the miscreant-- - H.R.

45
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,000
- Hey, yep, here we are. - Barry needs help.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,870
- Yeah, Barry needs help. - Where's Kid Flash?

47
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,450
He's on his way. Are you on your way?

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,740
They need you at Keystone Bridge.

49
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,030
Surely all your adventures are not this disorganized?

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,550
There's a method to the madness, mate.

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,290
Watch and learn.

52
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,820
The Electric Gang is headed north.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,890
You gotta cut 'em off before they reach the freeway.

54
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,840
How you wanna play this?

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,880
I have an idea.

56
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,430
Eyes up!

57
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,030
Here he comes.

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,380
Just the red one.

59
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,510
Nice work.

60
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,000
They're out cold.

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Okay, boys.

62
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,230
They saved us.

63
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,510
They saved us!

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,130
Who are you?

65
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm Kid Flash.

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Oh, my gosh. Can we get your picture?

68
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes.

69
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,270
Okay. Bye.

70
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,240
Go Kid Flash! Go Kid Flash!

73
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,190
Nice save!

74
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,180
Could not have scripted it better myself.

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,150
Thanks.

76
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,220
Barry did most of the heavy lifting.

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,770
- B.A. - Yes, bravo, boys.

78
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,870
Although I did find at least six ways

79
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,250
you could have done it more efficiently,

80
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,500
just--just saying.

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,190
I mean, the bus load of hot cheerleaders

82
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,750
seemed like the way that we did things.

83
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,080
Oh, that's going in the book. You know what?

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm running low; let me buy you a cup of coffee

85
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,960
over at CC Jitters.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,900
- Bond, are you coming? - No, thank you.

87
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,410
So exactly how many hot cheerleaders?

88
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,190
I was a good boy.

89
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,200
You know, he's just been looking forward to this

90
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,890
for a long time; he's enjoying the moment.

91
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,090
Well, I'm glad you have his back.

92
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,150
We have each other's back.

93
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,110
It's actually been really nice having him out there.

94
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,280
Hey, I meant to ask you.

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,890
When you found the Electric Gang,

96
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,350
did you see them meeting with anyone else?

97
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,060
- Like who? - Well, word on the street is,

98
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,440
there is a new arms dealer in town

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
with access to sophisticated weaponry

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,660
like the gun that Plunder used.

101
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,680
Don't you think that's something

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,660
for the police to handle?

103
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm still a journalist, Barry.

104
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,430
I can't hide from the world because of what you saw.

105
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,070
See you at home.

106
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,920
Can't lose her, Cisco.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,560
Please tell me you found a way to change the future.

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,160
We found a way to change the future.

109
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,460
Did you really?

110
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,680
No, but Caitlin and I did find a way to map it.

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,050
You're gonna love this. Follow me.

112
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,640
Julian suggested we make a 3-D reconstruction

113
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,400
of the scene from the future exactly as we saw it.

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,960
With toys.

115
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,410
The medium's not important.

116
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,220
Thank you. Eye on the ball, Barry.

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,210
Is this me?

118
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,670
Why is he an astronaut?

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,580
Eye on the ball, Barry, okay?

120
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,550
Now, this diorama tells us

121
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,730
you need to cover this distance

122
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,360
in less than 0.21 seconds

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,070
if you want to save Iris from Savitar.

124
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,780
What do you guys think?

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,910
Think what you're proposing is impossible.

126
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,100
- Therefore, you will fail. - Why?

127
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,090
Multi-universe is maybe a new concept to me,

128
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,600
but mathematics is not.

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,730
Pay attention, Allen.

130
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,080
This is your speed timeline.

131
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,250
This is your maximum velocity

132
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,320
when you first acquired your powers.

133
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,460
This is your current top speed,

134
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,810
and this is where you need to be in May

135
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,130
to cover that distance in 0.21 seconds.

136
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,920
At your current rate of improvement,

137
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,230
impossible.

138
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,050
Thank you for that rousing pep talk, coach.

139
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,370
Okay, why don't you take a knee?

140
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,930
I think we got it covered here.

141
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,060
It looks like it.

142
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,910
I actually have to be back at CCPD.

143
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,130
As do you.

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,710
Cheerio.

145
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,900
He really does want to help

146
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,230
in his own snobbish, thoughtless way.

147
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,200
He is right.

148
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,710
I mean, he's kind of a dick about it,

149
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,030
but you can't argue with his math.

150
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,050
Okay, well, then, we'll find another way to make this work.

151
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,090
We need to.

152
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,590
Iris isn't gonna die.

153
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,590
Thank you very much.

154
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,520
Gotcha.

155
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,540
Freeze!

156
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,620
How'd you get in here?

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,110
You know what they say.

158
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,270
Every time a door closes...

159
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,020
a window opens.

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,000
Barry.

162
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,860
Nothing's missing.

163
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,090
- Nope. - Cash is still in the register.

164
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,330
Safe's not touched.

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,940
I mean, it seems like a lot to go through

166
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,900
to just get a late night cup of coffee, right?

167
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah, it's definitely a meta.

168
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll have Julian look into his meta database,

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,900
but I think this is someone new.

170
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,560
New and dangerous.

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,610
Well, it's nothing that The Flash and Kid Flash can't handle.

172
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,440
My two superhero boys.

173
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,530
He is doing great.

174
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,760
Speaking of my kids,

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,910
Iris, she tell you about this

176
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,540
arms dealer story she's following?

177
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,570
Yeah, she's mentioned it.

178
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,460
Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend,

179
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,090
could you look out for her

180
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,840
and maybe get her to back off a bit?

181
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,900
Because this isn't something she should be doing on her own.

182
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,270
I agree. I'm trying.

183
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,990
She seem... okay to you, otherwise?

184
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah, why? Do you not think so?

185
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,620
If you guys got something going on,

186
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,970
I hope you know you can talk to me.

187
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, I know, Joe.

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,620
Thank you-- I -- we're...

189
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,340
both doing great.

190
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay.

191
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,390
- Talk to you later. - Yeah.

192
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,720
So this is the footage from Jitters

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,700
that should help us ID our new meta.

194
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,520
Brunette? That really narrows it down.

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,490
Mm, I'll clean that up.

196
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh, look how clear the picture is on that screen.

197
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,370
That's 'cause that's not from Jitters.

198
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,710
That's our security footage.

199
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,300
H.R. Wells.

200
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,690
I know you're in there.

201
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,380
Come quietly if you don't want trouble.

202
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,030
H.R., how does she know you?

203
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,250
Talk. Who is this... gorgeous intruder?

204
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,070
Her name is Gypsy,

205
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,070
and she's what's known on my Earth as a collector.

206
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,290
What is she collecting?

207
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,010
She's come to collect, you know, me.

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,040
- Where does it hurt? - Oh, everywhere.

209
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,180
You can vibe?

210
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,230
Oh, I like it.

211
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Slow down there.

212
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,040
Let's just talk about this, like two adults,

213
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,620
over coffee, or maybe dinner, if you prefer that.

214
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,640
There's a great Thai place up the road, if you like Thai.

215
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

216
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,520
It's nice to meet you.

217
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,960
Are you asking her on a date?

218
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,780
Are you kidding me?

219
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,480
I am negotiating.

220
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Well, you showed me yours.

221
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,810
Only fair I show you mine.

222
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,460
Cisco!

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,650
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.

224
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,670
Speedster.

225
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,390
That's fun.

226
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,370
I like to have fun too.

227
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,650
I see you've got a lot to learn about your power.

228
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,530
Yeah. Like that.

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,150
How do you do that? That's cool.

230
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,590
You're harboring a fugitive from justice.

231
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,460
Our world has a strict ban on inter-dimensional travel.

232
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,210
He knew that when he came here.

233
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,700
- So you tracked him here? - Honestly, it wasn't that hard.

234
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,190
Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'

235
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,530
Adventures in the Multiverse" back chapter by chapter.

236
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,210
You know what? Whatever H.R. did,

237
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,290
you can't just come here and take him by force.

238
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,590
Not without going through us.

239
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,840
If I really wanted to go through you,

240
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
you would all be dead.

241
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,910
I've got a lock on you now.

242
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,580
There is no getting away.

243
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,180
You've got an hour to get your affairs in order,

244
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,860
and then you are coming back with me.

245
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,480
Adios, Cisco.

246
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,700
What an exit.

247
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,840
"As Francisco threw back his lustrous locks and laughed,

248
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,710
I outlined my plan for neutralizing the rampaging creature."

249
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,250
It goes on like this for pages.

250
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,430
He's been broadcasting this

251
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,940
without our knowledge or permission,

252
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,930
all the while making himself the hero.

253
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,110
Yeah, every book needs a central protagonist

254
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,120
that the audience can invest in.

255
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,220
I would have gone with Barry.

256
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,130
Barry?

257
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,280
Cisco, what was that back there?

258
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,500
First Golden Glider and now her?

259
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,380
I can't help who I'm attracted to,

260
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,890
even if it is the...

261
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,260
sexy, intense, deadly ones.

262
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,040
So she takes you back to Earth-19,

263
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,120
and, what, you pay a fine?

264
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,350
The punishment for

265
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,120
an unauthorized breach travel on my Earth...

266
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,490
it's death.

267
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,030
Death?

268
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,300
About 24, 25 years ago, a neighboring Earth

269
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,060
invaded our planet through a breach

270
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,340
and almost destroyed the place.

271
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,320
So to prevent it from happening again,

272
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,530
they banned all inter-dimensional travel.

273
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,790
And then they put the collectors in place

274
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,760
to punish those of us who violated the ban.

275
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,120
I just didn't think that she'd track me down.

276
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,390
So why would you risk your life by coming here?

277
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,760
I-- I'm gonna get packing.

278
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,060
It's time for H.R. to face the music.

279
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,530
Guys, I know H.R. can be annoying,

280
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,940
but he doesn't deserve to die.

281
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,870
Different Earth, different morality.

282
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,680
But he doesn't go back. I saw him.

283
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,610
In the future, with me and Iris and Savitar, he was there.

284
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,850
I mean, that must mean we don't let her take him back.

285
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,920
Maybe we do.

286
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,080
Maybe by letting him go back to his Earth,

287
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,610
it changes your future

288
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,970
and prevents Iris' death.

289
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,580
I gotta go see her.

291
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you just gonna let this woman take H.R.?

292
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,930
I don't know.

293
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,490
No. I just...

294
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,810
I wish I knew if it would make a difference.

295
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,950
You know, I mean, what if he goes and nothing changes?

296
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,860
How do we ever know if our actions now impact the future?

297
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah.

298
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,860
You know, sometimes I wish we had normal-people problems.

299
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,120
Yeah, that would be nice.

300
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,520
Hey, you didn't tell Joe about the future, did you?

301
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,680
No, of course not.

302
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,030
The last thing I need is for him to worry about

303
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,720
something four months away that might not happen.

304
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,280
That won't happen.

305
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,260
That won't happen.

306
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,970
Maybe in the meantime,

307
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,620
you could let this arms dealer thing go?

308
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,570
Oh, God, did my dad put you up to this too?

309
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,800
No, he didn't have to.

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,220
- Barry, look, this-- - No, look, I'm sorry.

311
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,190
I'm not trying to keep you from doing your job, okay?

312
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,100
But when we're all focused on this H.R. thing

313
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,750
and trying to prevent the future.

314
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,340
I mean, do we really need to go looking for more trouble?

315
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,620
Please?

316
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,350
Okay, I'll drop it.

317
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,360
Really? Just like that?

318
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,500
Um, yes.

319
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,250
Sometimes I do listen to you, you know?

320
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,240
That hasn't been my experience.

321
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,350
Shut up.

322
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,340
All right. I'll see you later.

323
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,580
- 'Kay, bye. - Thank you.

324
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't you get tired of running?

325
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,310
That's the thing, running just

326
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,230
sort of keeps my mind off of things, I guess.

327
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,080
Must be an amazing feeling.

328
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,330
It is.

329
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,460
You know, cracking a big story gives me an amazing feeling.

330
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
And...I think I'm onto one.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,700
Oh, that, uh, arms dealer thing?

332
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,960
How do you know about that?

333
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,920
Because both Dad and Barry want you to lay off of it.

334
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,070
The phrase "Death wish" got tossed around a lot by them.

335
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,980
Okay, I do not have a death wish.

336
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,630
I just want to see justice done

337
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,200
like everyone else in this building.

338
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,030
I get that, but it is dangerous, Iris.

339
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,840
Wally, how dangerous could it be?

340
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,360
I don't die till May.

341
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,160
Barry said that in Flashpoint, you and I

342
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,090
were a brother-sister crime-fighting team.

343
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,250
I say we make that a reality again.

344
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,260
Shouldn't we ask Barry first?

345
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,220
No, this is just between us, Wally.

346
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,040
We can do this together.

347
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,990
Do you know what I'm really gonna miss about this Earth?

348
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,310
I don't know. Uh... Soap operas.

349
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,780
I mean, a long, winding story

350
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,770
served up daily in hour-long chapters?

351
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,800
You never answered Caitlin's question.

352
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,990
Oh, about why I put mustard on my fries?

353
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,840
Why you risked your life to come here.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,910
That.

355
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,390
I looked in a mirror.

356
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,310
I don't follow.

357
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,180
Look, on my Earth,

358
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,430
I had fame and power.

359
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,840
I had respect.

360
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,610
I was "H.R. Wells."

361
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,670
But when I looked in the mirror,

362
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,420
I knew the truth.

363
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,860
And the truth was...

364
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,910
I didn't matter.

365
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,820
I was a fraud.

366
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,890
That is why I came to this Earth,

367
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,270
so I could rewrite my story, both literally and figuratively.

368
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,290
There's gotta be something you can do, H.R.

369
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,160
There's not.

370
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,460
You can't hire a lawyer? Appeal the case?

371
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,280
There's nothing I can do, B.A.!

372
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,110
I don't mean to snap at you.

373
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,700
It just--I don't have any options here, all right?

374
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,660
Unless, of course, I appeal for

375
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,020
trial by combat.

376
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,120
Guys, Gypsy's here.

377
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,960
Always so punctual.

378
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,410
I'm impressed!

379
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,090
Thought you'd try and flee again.

380
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,250
Time to go.

381
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,950
All right.

382
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,500
Gypsy,

383
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
take me home.

384
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,300
Wait.

385
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,920
You're not taking him anywhere.

386
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,370
- What? - Why not?

387
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,620
Because I challenge you to trial by combat.

388
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,370
What are you doing?

389
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,430
I'm challenging her to trial by combat.

390
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,490
No, no, he isn't.

391
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,300
Okay, I am. I'm gonna fight you.

392
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,670
Well, that one spoke first.

393
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,290
What? That's like a real rule?

394
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,320
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby challenge you

395
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,720
for possession of H.R. Wells.

396
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,050
If you want, we can solve this another way.

397
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,670
There's a great spot for drinks--

398
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,040
You realize trial by combat is to the death?

399
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,800
Yeah. For the loser.

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Listen, you want him?

401
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,680
You're gonna have to come and claim him.

403
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,400
That's Arwen. That's--Arwen.

404
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,330
I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare?

405
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,610
- Do I want the customary... - Yes, you do.

406
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,010
I would love to take advantage

407
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,710
of the customary 24 hours, if you don't mind.

408
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,060
Very well.

409
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,630
One day.

410
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,650
One day.

411
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
See you then.

412
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,640
She's gonna kill me, isn't she?

413
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,040
She's good.

414
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,090
She's great.

415
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
I mean, Gypsy is a legend on my Earth.

416
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,890
So why, exactly, did you agree to fight her?

417
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,050
I don't know.

418
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,380
You did what any of us would have done.

419
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,820
I might not have done it, just being honest.

420
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,190
Okay, all right. Lay it out for me.

421
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,030
What are my chances here, scale of one to ten?

422
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,830
She's gonna kill you.

423
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,200
It's a pretty solid "One," mate.

424
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,450
You have the same powers Gypsy does, right?

425
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,100
I mean, she's not doing anything you can't do.

426
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,260
Much better--look, I mean, she's doing it just much better.

427
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,330
You can do this, okay?

428
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,750
You just need a little practice and a little confidence.

429
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,870
And we're all gonna help you with that, right?

430
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,120
- Yes. - Uh, sure, sure, yeah.

431
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,470
- Yes. - Yeah.

432
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,890
I believe in you, all right?

433
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,330
You can beat her.

434
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,900
Listen, I have some ideas

435
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,970
for a training regimen I can set up in here.

436
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,580
Caitlin, why don't you get

437
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,930
the medical bay prepared in the meantime?

438
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,800
What? Well, why does--why does she

439
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,300
need to set up the-the medical bay?

440
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,370
For when you...

441
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,930
beat her, when you beat her,

442
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,750
she's gonna--she's gonna need medical attention.

443
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
'Cause you will beat her, I have every faith

444
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
that you're going to beat her.

445
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,210
We need to work on your interpersonal skills.

446
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,330
I was really trying.

447
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,150
- Has anyone ever beat her? - Yeah.

448
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,890
No.

449
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,220
Oh, okay.

450
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,140
Well, I've officially reached a nice, comfortable level

451
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,980
of just straight-up panic.

452
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,730
I mean, you don't even like me.

453
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,820
Why would you risk your life for me?

454
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,990
Well, you heard Barry. It's what we do around here.

455
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,120
Come on. Why?

456
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,360
You're not like the other Wellses.

457
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,710
Yeah, so you keep reminding me.

458
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,390
No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.

459
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,460
We depended on them.

460
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,220
But with you, the roles are reversed.

461
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,920
You depend on us.

462
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,890
Harrison Wells was always there for me,

463
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,010
so I guess in some weird way, I just...

464
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,070
I want to be there for Harrison Wells.

465
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,830
- Anyway... - Yeah.

467
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,690
So what are we doing here?

468
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,850
I thought you didn't want Dad to know

469
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,480
we're going after this arms dealer.

470
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,530
Oh, yeah, no, I don't.

471
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,240
But, um, actually,

472
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
I need you to swipe his file on the case

473
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,730
and photograph the pages and then put them back.

474
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,720
Thanks.

475
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,100
What?

476
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,070
Iris.

477
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,190
Have you lost your mind?

478
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,590
Dad will kill us.

479
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
No, no, Wally, he won't.

480
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,390
He won't even know that Kid Flash was there.

481
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
First, you have to tell me why.

482
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,270
Okay, look.

483
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,090
I know everyone is working really hard

484
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,650
to prevent Savitar from...

485
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,580
Yeah.

486
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,070
But, honestly, these could be my last few months on Earth.

487
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,360
Can you not talk like that?

488
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm just being realistic, Wally.

489
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,140
I get to do that.

490
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,360
Look, I want my life to mean something,

491
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,500
more than just a daughter or as a sister

492
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,720
or as a girlfriend,

493
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,120
but as a reporter.

494
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,960
This story can do that.

495
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,810
It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.

496
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,670
You know, my life was a lot easier before I had a sister.

497
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,220
But it's a lot better now, isn't it?

498
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,950
Come on.

499
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,980
Okay.

500
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,120
I can get you the no-knock warrant,

501
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,050
but, Joe, this guy is armed to the teeth

502
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,080
with God only knows what.

503
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,480
You're gonna have to move in there fast and hard.

504
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,430
"Fast and hard," okay, I kind of walked into that--

505
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,310
Hey. Sorry.

506
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,570
- Hey, sweetheart. - Hi.

507
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,190
Hi, Iris.

508
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,730
Hi. Good to see you, Cecile.

509
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,620
Um, Dad, can I borrow you for a second

510
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,860
for a little father-daughter talk?

511
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,760
I need to go catch up with Captain Singh,

512
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,170
so I will be back in a little while, yeah?

513
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,160
- It's good to see you. - Good to see you too.

514
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,320
So...what's up? How can I help you?

515
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,260
Can I talk to you for a second over here?

516
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,120
Uhh, yeah, so, um,

517
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,560
I wanted to-- to speak to you about me and Barry.

518
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,530
You and Barry?

519
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,110
- Yes. - Okay?

520
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,920
So there comes a time in every couple's relationship

521
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
when you realize that there is too much love for two people.

522
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,570
And...

523
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,440
Uh, when that happens, you know in your heart

524
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,980
that the only solution is

525
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,290
to make your family a little...bigger.

526
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,690
Okay, I'm gonna need a second.

527
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,300
Dad, hey, hey, listen to me very closely.

528
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,970
This is so important to me.

529
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,230
Oh, God.

530
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,150
- Is Barry a dog or a cat person? - What?

531
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,650
Yeah, what kind of animal does he like?

532
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,990
Because I was thinking about getting him a pet

533
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,660
and I don't really remember him having a preference.

534
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,830
Oh, man, you had me going there for a second.

535
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,310
What, what did you think I was talking about?

536
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,410
Nothing, nothing, I--

537
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,690
you can get him any kind of animal you want

538
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,860
as long as it has four legs.

539
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,610
Good, great advice, four legs, copy that.

540
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,840
Thanks for the chat. Okay, bye.

541
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,240
Damn.

542
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,930
Facing the wrong way again. How many is that?

543
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,840
- Three. - Nine.

544
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,870
- You'll get there. - Yes.

545
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,520
Hopefully in the next 21 hours and 46 minutes.

546
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,620
All right, look, whenever I'm out there,

547
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,600
I'm in a tough fight, I think maybe I don't have it,

548
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,900
I just take a deep breath...

549
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,740
Trust my instincts.

550
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,590
Trust my instincts, that's good.

551
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,730
That helps.

552
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,730
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

553
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,360
Guys?

554
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
Up here.

555
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,710
- Let--let's go talk. - All right.

556
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,700
We can't let Francisco fight Gypsy,

557
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
because if he does, he is a dead man.

558
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,910
- You don't know that. - Oh, I know that.

559
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,530
You know that. He knows that.

560
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,710
- Okay, I get it. - She knows that.

561
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,630
We know that; everybody knows--

562
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,130
So what are we supposed to do?

563
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,630
We're supposed to stop her before she fights him.

564
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
That would be great if we knew where she was.

565
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,330
- Yes? - I know where she is.

566
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,550
How?

567
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,840
I tagged her with a tracer last time she was here.

568
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,820
A magician friend told me

569
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,290
you kind of distract 'em and tag--

570
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,900
- H.R. - I needed to know where she was

571
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,290
so I could stay one step ahead of her.

572
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,460
She is...

574
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
At the Waterfront.

575
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,400
What do you say? For Francisco?

576
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,580
All right.

577
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,100
This world may be a primitive,

578
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,540
uncultured backwater,

579
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,190
but they do make an excellent cup of coffee.

580
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,900
That they do. You know what you gotta try?

581
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,210
You gotta try the Brazilian roast, it's new.

582
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,340
It is so good.

583
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,820
Maybe I'll take a few bags back with me.

584
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
Yeah, think that's wise.

585
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,690
Will you be going back in a bag?

586
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,410
Look, that kid, Francisco,

587
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,740
he's just trying to protect me.

588
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,700
Then he's as foolish as he is cute.

589
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,550
Okay, Gypsy.

590
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,380
Let's go home.

591
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,390
BA
B.A.!

592
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,020
Nice try!

593
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,990
You think I didn't see that coming?

594
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,300
Stop, stop!

595
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,110
- Stop what? - Stop--

596
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
Stop trying to enforce the law?

597
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,660
You are a criminal.

598
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,110
Now, it's great that you made friends here,

599
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,340
but that doesn't change the fact that you lied.

600
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,820
You broke our most sacred laws,

601
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,060
and now it is time for you to face justice.

602
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,140
Wait!

603
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,890
You still need to face Cisco.

604
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,610
No, I think this little stunt forfeits his claim.

605
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,420
And his time.

606
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,230
You just said you believe in the law, right?

607
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,270
We made a mistake.

608
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,160
Cisco will hold up his end of the deal.

609
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,280
He will.

610
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,130
You have really pulled a number on these people

611
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,760
if they would die for you.

612
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,180
Tell Cisco there is no backing out now.

613
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,370
I'll keep this one as insurance until then.

614
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,530
BA
B.A.

615
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,550
That's not good.

616
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,300
She took H.R.?

617
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,450
Can she do that?

618
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,680
I mean, I though this whole trial by combat thing had rules.

619
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,240
Which apparently we broke

620
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,730
when we tried to get the drop on her.

621
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,610
Well, that wasn't very clever, was it?

622
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,400
A deal's a deal. It should be honored.

623
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,530
You know what? You're right, Julian.

624
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,490
A deal is a deal.

625
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,320
And our deal was that I would train

626
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,190
so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two

627
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,340
wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?

628
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,280
We didn't go--

629
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,630
we just thought maybe you could use some help.

630
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,650
Yeah? What happened to,

631
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,970
"Cisco, you can beat her"?

632
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,600
- You can. - "I believe in you."

633
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,920
- I do. - "Trust your instincts."

634
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,470
Well, right now,

635
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,930
my instincts are telling me I should be writing

636
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,840
my last will and testament, so please excuse me.

637
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,250
Cisco, come--

638
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,230
Should I go talk to him?

639
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,300
No, I--

640
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,150
I got it.

641
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,460
Looks like I'm not the only one

642
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,240
who has to work on their interpersonal skills.

643
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,860
I'd be careful if I were you.

644
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,490
Last thing we want is for me to touch a button

645
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,920
and blow your head off, right?

646
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,050
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing, right?

647
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,260
You know I don't think that.

648
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah, well, you have a very,

649
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,320
very strange way of showing it.

650
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,380
You're right, man. I'm sorry.

651
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,810
I don't know. I just...

652
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,820
guess this whole "Not getting faster" thing,

653
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,340
it just has me rattled.

654
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,170
I was always able to do it before, you know?

655
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,040
I mean, against Reverse Flash and then against Zoom, but...

656
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,390
Savitar's on a whole other level.

657
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,320
And knowing what he'll do to Iris if I fail?

658
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,450
I'm afraid just...

659
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,870
thinking what's gonna happen to H.R. if I don't beat Gypsy.

660
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,900
But you, you're the hero. I mean,

661
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,190
how do you handle all this pressure all the time?

662
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,300
By just leaning on all of you guys.

663
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,910
You know, I mean, you're always in my corner,

664
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,720
helping me face my fears.

665
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,990
And it is okay to be afraid. Trust me.

666
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,540
And when you are, I'll be there

667
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,810
in your corner.

668
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,210
Yes, lovely little speech, Allen.

669
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,600
But what Mr. Ramon needs to defeat

670
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,810
his inter-dimensional adversary

671
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,820
is a practical stratagem.

672
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,340
Lucky for you, I found one.

673
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,730
This is Gypsy's signature move.

674
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,110
I call it her "Breach and blast".

675
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,300
Oh, yeah. That move.

676
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,430
You see just before she comes in and out of a breach,

677
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,220
her feet come off the ground.

678
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,900
So for that split second she's off the ground,

679
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,790
she'll be off-balance.

680
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,830
Yes, and vulnerable.

681
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,310
It might behoove you to use this during the battle.

682
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,730
This is great, Julian.

683
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,930
Hmm, just glad I could be helpful.

684
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,790
This is...more than helpful. I gotta work on this.

685
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,700
- Thank you. - Cheers.

686
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,340
Thanks.

687
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,120
You sure this is the place?

688
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,390
- Positive. - All right.

689
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,710
You ready to bust an arms dealer?

690
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,460
- Get me a front-page headline? - Wally, wait.

691
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,630
CCPD's been looking for this guy for months.

692
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,780
He might have some sort of secret tunnel network

693
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,520
that helps him slip out and get away.

694
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,770
I should do a quick recon.

695
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,940
Yeah. Thorough.

696
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,410
We don't want to miss anything, okay?

697
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,860
Be back in a you-know-what.

700
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,960
Hope you like what you see,

701
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,230
'cause this sneak preview is gonna cost you your life.

702
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,940
Yeah, I don't think so.

703
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,330
Are you crazy?

704
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,280
This'll rip a hole right through you.

705
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,660
Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?

706
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,200
And I am pretty sure today just...

707
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,070
isn't my day.

708
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,420
What the hell, sis?

709
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,920
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

710
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,660
God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here

711
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,250
before CCPD sees you.

712
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,030
Don't worry. Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.

713
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,420
He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.

714
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,070
Hell no, I ain't cool with this.

715
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,470
You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation

716
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,720
that took the DA's office months to assemble.

717
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,880
You still got the guy, right?

718
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,450
That is not the point, Iris.

719
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,250
The point is, you had you and your brother out there

720
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,900
in danger, and for what?

721
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,150
A story? And where the hell were you?

722
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,350
Dad, this is more than just a story for me.

723
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,040
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.

724
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,690
Oh, God.

725
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,920
What?

726
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,890
Iris.

727
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,730
What is going on with you?

728
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,030
Joe, I'm sorry-- can I talk to you for a second?

729
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,210
We'll be right back.

730
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,370
Joe already suspects something's up.

731
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,280
You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.

732
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,520
This story is going to change lives, Barry.

733
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,970
Why do you think that you're the only one

734
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,860
allowed to risk your life to do good?

735
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,470
I don't.

736
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,760
It's okay to be afraid of the future.

737
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,170
But I won't let you die.

738
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,190
I am not afraid to die, Barry, I'm not.

739
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,710
Then what?

740
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,450
I'm afraid...

741
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,440
What if I end up just like my mom?

742
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,650
Just gone without making a mark,

743
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,730
without leaving anything behind.

744
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,050
Iris, your mom,

745
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,400
she left something behind.

746
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,920
She left a brave, wonderful son

747
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,600
and the woman that I love.

748
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,380
All right?

749
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,450
I don't know what the future holds, none of us do.

750
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,810
I know that we will face it together.

751
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,980
Gypsy just vibed me her location.

752
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,440
Let's do this.

753
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,410
I don't think the literary critics on our Earth

754
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,350
would know a real sci-fi romance best seller

755
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,510
- unless it bit them in the-- - Time's up, Wells.

756
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,590
Looks like your so-called friend is a coward after all.

757
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,880
He's not a coward.

758
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,540
He's one of the finest men I've ever known.

759
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,400
Oh, you're right about that!

760
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm fine as hell.

761
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,970
There he is.

762
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,040
Didn't think you'd show.

763
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,160
Oh, I wouldn't miss an evening with you,

764
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,770
even if it is for a showdown.

765
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,520
I will kill you, Cisco.

766
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,210
We'll see who dies tonight.

767
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,960
To the victor goes H.R. Wells.

768
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,610
May the best vibe win.

769
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
Part of me was hoping you wouldn't show tonight.

770
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,240
How do you want to do this?

771
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,850
"Westworld"-style, back to back, ten paces, turn and shoot?

772
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,770
No.

773
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,090
This does not bode well.

774
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,790
Cisco can hold his own.

775
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,820
Hmm. Barely.

776
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,870
Barry, we can't let this happen.

777
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,960
What if he can't defeat her?

778
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,810
I can't interfere again.

779
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,160
If I do, then we forfeit. H.R.'s a dead man.

780
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,130
At this rate, Cisco's gonna be the dead man.

781
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,530
Ooh, girl!

782
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,690
You done did it now!

783
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,650
Stronger than I thought.

784
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,780
I'm just getting warmed up.

785
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,200
Yeah, maybe not do that.

786
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,970
Time to turn things up to 11.

789
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,650
That's, like, one of my favorite movies--

790
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,100
Where did they go?

791
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,530
I--they could be anywhere by now.

792
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,020
In any universe.

793
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,620
This is Earth-2.

794
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,760
You're cute, but you talk too much.

795
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,310
Oh, you want to play dirty, huh?

796
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,830
Let's play dirty.

797
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,370
That hurts.

798
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,040
That too.

799
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,790
Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?

800
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,410
Well, this is hot.

801
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,120
I think you're flirting with me to distract me

802
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,920
'cause you're afraid.

803
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,180
My collection record is flawless.

804
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,020
In these trials, I am undefeated.

805
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,590
Oh, please.

806
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,540
Everybody's got a weakness.

807
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,870
Even you.

808
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,130
Says the man afraid of showing everyone

809
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,920
how powerful he can be.

810
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,710
You and I resonate on a similar frequency.

811
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,770
I can feel it.

812
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,930
Yet you allow your fear and insecurity to hold you back.

813
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,550
That's why you're gonna lose.

814
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,220
Does this look like holding back to you?

815
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,100
I could do this all night. - How did you--

816
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,650
You might want to work on your balance next time, girl.

817
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,830
Admit it,

818
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,450
I won.

819
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,830
- Yes! - He won.

820
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,320
- Yeah, he did. - He won.

821
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,510
Yes!

822
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,690
She must have been having an off day.

823
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,630
What?

824
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,240
By the laws of Earth-19,

825
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,540
the prisoner is yours for the taking,

826
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,460
as is my life.

827
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,790
Oh, no, no, no, no.

828
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,470
We don't roll like that around here.

829
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,370
Come on.

830
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,490
In all the multiverse, I have...

831
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,190
never...

832
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,670
met anyone like you, Cisco.

833
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,750
Please, call me Vibe.

834
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,590
Or--or you can call me Cisco.

835
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,030
That's also allowed.

836
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,830
I'm just a regular guy.

837
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,810
Just a regular...

838
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,850
single guy.

839
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,230
It says you're totally fine.

840
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,710
So what happens now? Go back to your Earth?

841
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,680
Tell all your superiors that you were bested in battle,

842
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,280
all the charges against H.R. Are dropped.

843
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,370
No.

844
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,200
I tell them I killed him.

845
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,840
Wait, what?

846
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,140
If I return empty-handed, they'll know I failed.

847
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,670
And I never fail.

848
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
Until today.

849
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,020
Okay, but if you

850
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,100
tell them that you killed me, then I--

851
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,150
You will never go back to Earth-19,

852
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,680
ever.

853
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,710
Do we have a deal?

854
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,560
Yeah. I guess we have a deal.

855
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,060
I don't really have anything to go home for.

856
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
You'll always have a home here, H.R.

857
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,240
Listen, I know there's no coffee on your Earth

858
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,680
'cause of the whole Blight thing or whatever,

859
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
but this--this is just an absurd

860
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
amount of coffee you're bringing back to your Earth.

861
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,300
That can't be legal.

862
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,960
I mean, I won't tell if you won't.

863
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,130
You know, for someone so fixated on enforcing the law,

864
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,600
you sure seem oddly at ease about breaking it.

865
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,540
Well, I guess some laws are worth breaking

866
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,560
for the right person.

867
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,220
So this good-bye then?

868
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,720
For now.

869
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,570
What an exit.

871
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,140
Okay, you know, for the fastest man alive,

872
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,810
you are the slowest reader.

873
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,130
Hey, this is your big article, I'm not gonna rush through it.

874
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm just kidding. I read it five times already.

875
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,650
You sure sold the hell out of Kid Flash

876
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,020
as Central City's next super savior.

877
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,300
I'm sure Wally's loving that.

878
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,650
/Well, I did promise him the front page.

879
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,390
But what do you think?

880
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,350
Do you think it'll make any difference?

881
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,320
Kid Flash already changed one thing that we saw in the future.

882
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,310
No, I meant the article.

883
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,390
What?

884
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,490
The article?

885
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,100
I think you should be really proud.

886
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,120
It's the beginning of...

887
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,770
an amazing journalistic legacy.

888
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,860
Really?

889
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,560
How amazing? Like Pulitzer amazing?

890
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
Time will tell.

891
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,150
Hey, I'm sorry. I--

892
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,140
Do you know what I realized?

893
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,940
Savitar, he said that I trapped him

894
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,000
wherever he is; you know what that means?

895
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,270
Means I beat him.

896
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,350
And I'm gonna do it again, I promise.

897
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,720
So don't worry.

898
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,340
The Flash is gonna save you.

899
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,550
My hero.

900
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,740
The thing they never tell you

901
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,540
is that nothing ever stays the same.

902
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,060
So the harder you work to take down the bad guys,

903
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,000
the more they up their game.

904
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

905
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,580
No.

906
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,430
Just had to grab some stuff for--

907
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,800
I thought you were finished working with that stuff?

908
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh, no, it's just, uh, this is just for me.

909
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,720
No, the--the book, it-- you know,

910
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,050
my own personal sense of accomplishment.

911
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,740
Well,

912
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,510
you've accomplished plenty.

913
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,450
What have I accomplished, Francisco?

914
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,100
Well, for one,

915
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,390
you got me to risk my life to save yours.

916
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,040
And trust me, my friend, that is a huge accomplishment.

917
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,170
Yeah, about that...

918
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,110
I just want to say that

919
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,980
I appreciate what you did for me.

920
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,370
Yeah, it's what we do for our friends, right?

921
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,860
Besides, it was a way for me to balance the scales.

922
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,050
Balance the scales, right.

923
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,220
What does that mean?

924
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,790
I just mean...

925
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,210
I can't tell you the amount of times

926
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,430
that I've been in your shoes and a man with your face

927
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,500
has made me feel better.

928
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,380
Yeah, about that, I would--

929
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,640
I would love if you could share

930
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,280
some of my doppelganger's knowledge.

931
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I would love to know what the smarter versions of me think.

932
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,990
Okay.

933
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,770
The first Wells told me

934
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,550
my time would come

935
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,780
to be a hero,

936
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,560
that it was my job to show up,

937
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,540
to be ready for when it did.

938
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,640
You know why I love working here?

939
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
Why?

940
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,030
We're all making investments in each other.

941
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,680
I made an investment in you,

942
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
and one day, that investment's gonna pay off

943
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,510
when you use that...

944
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,040
crazy way of thinking you have to help me out.

945
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,660
I guess if he were here, he would say,

946
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,840
"Show up""

947
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,030
Be ready.

948
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,320
'Cause...

949
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,180
one day, you might need to save my ass.

950
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,940
Keep it up at this rate, you're gonna reach Mach 3 soon.

951
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,910
I know, it's--it's crazy how fast I've gotten

952
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,870
- in such a short time, right? - Yeah.

953
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,720
And I'm gonna need you to get a lot faster.

954
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,610
Why is it?

955
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,370
Because I have done the math over and over,

956
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,140
I finally realized that I have been looking at things the wrong way.

957
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,540
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savita,

958
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,650
you're.
