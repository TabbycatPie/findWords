<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:07,040
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:10,811
<i>but secretly, with the help of my friends</i>

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime</i>

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:15,516
<i>and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,484
<i>I hunted down the man who killed my mother,</i>

9
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>but in doing so, I opened up our world</i>

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,155
<i>to new threats,</i>

11
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:24,324
<i>and I am the only one

12
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,332
There is, indeed, a hole in our universe

15
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,069
which leads to his Earth.

16
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,089
Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

17
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think we've reached
the good-night kiss stage?

18
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:47,080
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,850
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

20
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,685
through the breaches to fight me.

21
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,554
Her name is Doctor Light.

22
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:54,588
Hello, gorgeous.

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,756
What do you want from me?

24
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,393
Your life.

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,777
I saw myself.

26
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,947
Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

27
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,700
Where are you?

28
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,702
I'm right here.

29
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,708
I'm here to kill you, Flash,
so get ready to fry.

30
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,461
Bring it on.

31
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:40,067
Told you.

32
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,769
Zoom always wins.

00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,836
_

35
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,200
Zoom sent me here to kill you,

36
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,369
but I didn't want to.

37
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,488
But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,958
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,710
Leave her body for Zoom to find,

40
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,846
he'd think I was dead, and I'd be free.

41
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,633
How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

42
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,135
Just let me go.

43
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,638
Let me disappear.

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,889
You would spend the rest of your life

45
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,973
looking over your shoulder,

46
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,675
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

47
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:26,063
Okay. And what's your great idea?

48
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,481
How were you supposed to contact him

49
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,615
after you killed me?

50
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,017
I was supposed to get something...

51
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,203
something I could only get
if you were dead...

52
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,372
and then throw it
through the breach as proof.

53
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,074
- And then what?
- Then he'd come for me.

54
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,409
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

55
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,662
- Why do you want to know?
- Because I want to find him.

56
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,879
You really don't.

57
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,881
He's gonna keep coming for me.

58
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,667
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you,

59
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,919
forcing them to do what he wants.

60
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,222
I have to stop him before more people die.

61
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,891
- You can't stop Zoom.
- Yes, I can.

62
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,345
I will, but I need your help.

63
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,437
Zoom wants Doctor Light
to send him your new emblem.

64
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,155
Yes. We need it for bait.

65
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,375
If we can get Doctor Light
to take my emblem,

66
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,189
throw it through the breach,
then Zoom will come

67
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,224
to collect my body, and we can trap him.

68
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,309
You know it took a lot of work

69
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,860
to make that emblem, right?

70
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,729
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

71
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,197
in order to escape Zoom,

72
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,399
but now she's willing to help us catch him?

73
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,984
She knows it's the only way.

74
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,620
Before I left Earth-2,

75
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,189
I worked on a serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

76
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,907
All we would need is for Ramon

77
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,576
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

78
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,028
Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

79
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,413
Maybe another criminal can get it,

80
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,031
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

81
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,549
I would never let that happen.

82
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,301
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

83
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,254
Are we forgetting how much more powerful

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,505
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

85
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,391
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

86
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,843
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

87
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,230
Surprise... the element of surprise.

88
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,731
All we would do is rig a projectile

89
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,184
to fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

90
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,552
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

91
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,720
- That's great.
- Thanks.

92
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,106
Joe, voice of reason here?

93
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,076
We need a plan. That's as good as any.

94
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,411
As long as he can deliver.

95
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,773
Don't underestimate me, Detective.

96
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,200
Oh, Patty needs us back at the station.

97
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,619
I'll meet you there, all right?

98
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,010
Are you just forgetting
everything Jay told us

99
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,294
and supporting Wells now?

100
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,929
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

101
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,514
I just want to see what he's up to.

102
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,466
I figure we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

103
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,718
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

104
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,688
Look, my hunch after interrogating suspects

105
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,109
all these years, something's
not right with this dude.

106
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,145
Barry told me about this thing you can do?

107
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,481
- Vibing.
- Oh, God, just relax.

108
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,950
Can you do it with Wells?

109
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,902
I can try.

110
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,544
<i>Incapable?</i>

111
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,329
<i>Well, let me tell you something.</i>

112
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,583
<i>If you are incapable
of aligning the quantum helix</i>

113
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,302
and, by the way, the sole purpose

114
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,087
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

115
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,255
could you save me some time and effort?

116
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,140
Could you go out there and find someone

117
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,478
who can actually do your job for you?

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,180
There it is.

119
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,983
Work voice.

120
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,668
When I was little and you used to bring me

121
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,869
to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

122
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,521
it used to freak me out

123
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,823
how differently you talked here
than when you were at home.

124
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,526
You and your mother both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

125
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,912
I graduated high school when I was 15, Dad.

126
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,997
- Right.
- Can miss a day of college.

127
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:38,368
Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick.

128
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,505
- So?
- So?

129
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,457
Is it true?

130
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,092
Is what true?

131
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,161
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference?

132
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:52,299
That your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

133
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,307
- It is... Jesse...
- Why didn't you just tell me?

134
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,890
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

135
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,493
is much faster at assigning blame

136
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,523
than he is at actual heroics.

137
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,725
- Dad, The Flash is a hero.
- Uh-huh.

138
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,061
Okay, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much,

139
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:13,331
but now I know it's because
he knew what you'd done.

140
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,866
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs

141
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,785
is change the world, Jesse,

142
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,871
unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

143
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:23,291
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

144
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:27,245
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

145
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,247
You should get to school.

146
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't worry. I got my education today.

147
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,094
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

148
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,769
- All right. Talk to you later.
- See you, Joe.

149
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,488
Great, you're here.

150
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,706
Good morning to you too, Patty.

151
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes, I was up all night

152
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,908
working on the Doctor Light case.

153
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,126
I... I've been trying to anticipate

154
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,627
all the powers she might throw our way,

155
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,829
you know, on the premise

156
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,380
that she can manipulate light energy.

157
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,998
- I appreciate it, but...
- Did you know

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,301
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

159
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,552
I mean, that doesn't even sound
like a thing, but it is.

160
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,137
Seriously, Patty...

161
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,222
No, and on the other end
of the spectrum is invisibility.

162
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,458
Look, it... it's just
hypothetical, but I think that...

163
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,262
The Doctor Light case is closed.

164
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh, uh, okay.

165
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,183
Can you tell me why?

166
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,801
No.

167
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,106
No?

168
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,691
- Okay.
- Hey.

169
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,025
- Hi!
- Are you good?

170
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

171
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,496
Your dad just shut me down in a big way.

172
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:37,365
- What do you mean?
- I... I don't know. It just...

173
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:42,787
You don't think it's because
you and I kissed?

174
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,922
No, I don't think he knows.

175
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,457
I didn't say anything,

176
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,875
but I can talk to him if you want.

177
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,326
No, no, no, I'll talk to him.

178
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,594
You know, he's my partner.

179
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,212
We should have trust and communication.

180
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,214
Are you sure? I don't mind
talking about that kiss.

181
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,466
It was a good kiss.

182
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah, yeah, although the memory...

183
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,722
it's a little foggy.

184
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,307
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,010
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

186
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,013
Okay.

187
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,207
- Hey.
- Hey.

188
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,742
Have you had any word from The Flash

189
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,329
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

190
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:27,999
No, not yet, but I know he's working on it.

191
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,918
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

192
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,170
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

193
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,055
Look, Larkin is dead,

194
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,723
which makes it really hard
for me to concentrate

195
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,875
on field goals and doping scandals.

196
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,677
I don't want to sit around
being told not to worry

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,146
my pretty little head about it.

198
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:44,048
I get that. Believe me, I do.

199
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,733
Then tell him I want to help.

200
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,153
Please, I can't let this woman
who looks like me

201
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,155
hurt anyone else.

202
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,157
I'll ask again.

203
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,110
But trust me, Flash has
everything under control.

204
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,370
Crap.

205
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,593
Doctor Light's gone invisible.

206
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,645
Lock the doors.

207
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,481
Shut the doors!

208
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,650
The doors aren't responding.

209
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,069
None of the security protocols
are responding.

210
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,287
She's hacked the system.

211
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,272
Barry, Doctor Light is escaping.

212
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,745
Where is she?

213
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,188
Doctor Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

214
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,924
The whole building runs on fiber optics

215
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,842
that operate on pulses of light,

216
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,428
so she turned off the dampeners
and used her powers.

217
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,896
I told you how dangerous she was.

218
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,431
You should have listened to me
and sedated her.

219
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,166
I thought I had convinced
her that helping us

220
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,568
was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

221
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,602
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Yeah.

222
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,187
Okay, look,

223
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,972
Doctor Light is gone,
so instead of assigning blame,

224
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,690
let's try to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

225
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,659
Do you think she's gonna try
and take Linda again?

226
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,327
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,

227
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,196
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

228
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,647
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

229
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,249
I think we isolated the composite.

230
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,533
And we're modifying the dart The Arrow used

231
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,785
to take down Wells.

232
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,320
He's not Wells. I'm Wells.

233
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,922
Whatever, Harry.

234
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,707
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

235
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,342
Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test,

236
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,460
so can we end
this scintillating staff meeting

237
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,045
and get back to work?

238
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,713
Or how about I say
what everybody's thinking?

239
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,432
Maybe it's a good thing
that Doctor Light is gone.

240
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe it's the universe stopping us

241
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,385
from doing something really stupid.

242
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,271
No. No. Keep going.

243
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,525
I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

244
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,527
Hey, slow your roll. I want to talk to you.

245
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,447
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

246
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,482
Okay, I don't, so why don't you clue me in?

247
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,984
I'm trying to stop Zoom.

248
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,184
I thought you were on board with that.

249
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,203
I'm keeping my options open.

250
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,289
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

251
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,957
Zoom wants me dead.

252
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,659
The meta-humans that
he's sending from Earth-2,

253
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,494
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

254
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,579
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

255
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,882
He was just collateral
damage in Zoom's war.

256
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,051
The next time, that could be you or Iris.

257
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,753
I'm just wondering if going
after him now is premature.

258
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,672
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

259
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,890
Wells does.

260
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,891
You're putting a whole lot of faith

261
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,975
in the man wearing the face

262
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,727
of your mother's killer.

263
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,346
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

264
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't want to help

265
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,600
get me killed, and we can't just sit around

266
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,602
and wait for Zoom
to make his next move anymore.

267
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,071
We can't.

268
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,272
Aren't you the one who told me

269
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,690
life isn't about playing defense,

270
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:41,941
sometimes the only way to succeed

271
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,359
is by working the offense?

272
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,577
I think at the time we were talking about

273
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,995
your high school football tryouts.

274
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,698
You said you'd never bring that up again.

275
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,674
Hey.

276
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,427
I just wanted to say using
the, tungsten composite

277
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,464
to dampen vibrations, that was...

278
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,799
that was pretty brilliant.

279
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,521
What are you doing?

280
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm congratulating you.

281
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,858
Don't touch me.

282
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,310
Wow, try to give a guy a compliment.

283
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,728
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

284
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,862
You're trying to meddle into things

285
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,147
that are none of your business.

286
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,648
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

287
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,118
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

288
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,403
God, why? What's there to vibe on?

289
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,326
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

290
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,912
Otherwise stay away from me.

291
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,421
So?

292
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,141
God, you'd think the serial killer version

293
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,926
would've been the bigger jerk.

294
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:50,977
What happened when you touched him?

295
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,095
What did you see?

296
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,229
Oh, I didn't see anything.

297
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,964
Go touch him again.

298
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,316
No, he's onto me now.

299
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,634
Well, you have to keep trying.

300
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,020
I mean, I think Joe's right.

301
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,607
Something must have happened
between Wells and Zoom,

302
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,243
made this personal.

303
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,202
<i>The Arrow of Starling City
formerly known as The Hood,</i>

304
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:19,488
<i>has been unmasked
as billionaire Robert Queen.</i>

305
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,990
<i>Robert was marooned on an island</i>

306
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,759
<i>when his boat went down in the Pacific,</i>

307
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,761
<i>an accident that ended
with the tragic death</i>

308
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,129
<i>of his son, Oliver.</i>

309
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,547
<i>Robert Queen was thought dead when...</i>

310
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,001
<i>Excuse me, I'm receiving word.</i>

311
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:35,438
<i>There has been an attack
at Central City College.</i>

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,506
<i>The science building was the focus</i>

313
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,442
<i>of another meta-human attack.</i>

314
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,010
<i>We are just receiving video.</i>

315
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:42,612
<i>Please be advised, I'm being told</i>

316
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,113
<i>that the footage you're about to see...</i>

317
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,566
Hey, Jesse, it's Dad. Can you...

318
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,351
I just... I saw on the news...

319
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,620
Just call me, all right?
Let me know that you're okay.

320
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,238
That you weren't...

321
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,874
<i>Witnesses report that
The Flash arrived on the scene</i>

322
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,742
<i>but not before the hostile meta-human</i>

323
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:59,078
<i>escaped with a hostage, a female student.</i>

324
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,696
<i>We have not yet ID'd her,</i>

325
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,915
<i>and there is no indication
as to why she has been</i>

326
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,133
<i>specifically targeted.</i>

327
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,587
No.

328
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,535
Joe... Detective...
can we talk for a minute?

329
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,070
If this is about Doctor Light...

330
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,005
No, yeah... No.

331
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,541
Maybe, but okay, look.

332
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:46,909
I think I figured out why you've been

333
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,761
a bit shut down the last couple of days.

334
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,963
Really?

335
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,098
Yeah, I feel like you're not being

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,349
completely transparent with me,

337
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,768
but I think that it's my fault.

338
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,438
Look, you're a great...
excellent... wonderful detective,

339
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,274
and I think you can sense I'm not being

340
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,892
completely transparent with you.

341
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,527
And you're right. Look, we're partners.

342
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,362
We need to be completely
honest with each other.

343
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,980
- No secrets...
- Patty.

344
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,149
Barry and I kissed.

345
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,438
There's something to being too transparent.

346
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,242
No, no, no, no, I think that it's great

347
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,827
that everything's just out
there, right out in the open.

348
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,579
Whatever you and Barry do in private

349
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:27,583
is your own business.

350
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:31,254
Okay.

351
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,505
So you're not mad at me?

352
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:35,391
I promise you, I could care less.

353
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,846
Great, I feel so much better.

354
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,067
Is there anything, you know,

355
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,070
maybe you've been meaning to tell me?

356
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,405
We're partners...

357
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,585
totally transparent with each other.

358
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,313
Nope.

359
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,951
Cool.

360
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,796
Are you guys having a dinner party?

362
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,764
You would think.

363
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,966
I know, I know.

364
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,051
It's just, sometimes
cooking helps me to relax.

365
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,104
Have you heard anything about Doctor Light?

366
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,389
Am I still in danger?

367
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,391
- We're not really sure.
- Come on.

368
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,110
I'm going crazy here, Barry. Yeah, she is.

369
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,613
That is the cake.

370
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,783
Hope you're hungry.

371
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,151
She's not kidding.

372
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,953
There's enough food in
there to feed an army.

373
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,788
She must be terrified.

374
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,873
More like furious.

375
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,375
Larkin died trying to protect her,

376
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,826
and it only makes it worse
that the person who did it

377
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,461
looks just like her. I mean, trust me.

378
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,363
If Linda had Doctor Light's
powers right now...

379
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,252
What?

380
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,088
I just, Linda and Light...
They're identical.

381
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,058
So identical that Light even
thought she could fool Zoom.

382
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,061
Now we have Light's suit.

383
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,712
You don't even have to
say anything, I know.

384
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,732
- It's a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, it's not.

385
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,435
We make Zoom think
that Linda is Doctor Light

386
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,604
and use her to draw him out.

387
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,606
It's too dangerous, right?

388
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,441
Let Linda decide.

389
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,076
I mean, she's desperate to catch the person

390
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,695
who's responsible for Larkin's death,

391
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,364
and she deserves the chance to help us.

392
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,452
Okay.

393
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,256
I still don't understand why we're here.

394
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,258
I thought your dad said
not to leave the house.

395
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,545
- Someone wants to talk to you.
- Who?

396
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,633
Ms. Park, I need your help.

397
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,212
Heh, dude.

398
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,311
How long you been sitting on this?

399
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:58,079
It's important to have hobbies.

400
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:05,237
This is ridiculous.

401
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,289
No, it's not.

402
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,040
You look just like Doctor Light.

403
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,025
And with these gloves that Cisco rigged up,

404
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,878
you'll be able to do what she does.

405
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,196
Don't worry, they are totally safe.

406
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,715
- Ish.
- Ish?

407
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,166
Well, come on, it's gotta be believable,

408
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,386
so they really do fire and explode things.

409
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,171
And you are going to have to let her

410
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,307
hit you with those blasts
when she gets the hang of it.

411
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,894
Who exactly came up with
this terrible idea?

412
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:31,096
Okay, it's not a terrible idea.

413
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,348
The suit can absorb the blasts.

414
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,983
For real or ish?

415
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:37,602
What does a terrible idea
look like to you, Cisco?

416
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:39,554
Okay, you know what? I like to think

417
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:42,357
I can see the bright side of things, okay?

418
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,225
Positivity, people.

419
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,529
All right, all right.

420
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:52,250
So just hit the ones of me. Okay?

421
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,286
- Got it.
- Great.

422
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,237
Doctor Light.

423
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,911
You know what?

424
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,013
I'm just gonna adjust those a little.

425
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,181
Screwdriver.

426
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,882
Coming. Coming.

427
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,768
Just...

428
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,471
Okay, so, do the opposite of that,

429
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,975
and we'll have it.

430
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,459
It's on fire.

431
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,611
Ooh, sorry.

432
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,464
My bad.

433
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,446
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

434
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,081
I did it! Did you see that?

435
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,149
Yeah!

436
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,702
Ooh!

437
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,923
You all good? You okay?

438
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,291
Sorry.

439
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,761
Okay, no offense to Linda,
but there is no way

440
00:20:26,763 --> 00:20:28,380
she can pull this off.

441
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,515
Well, maybe if she didn't
scream every time she fired.

442
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:32,667
Yup, Linda had a rocky start,
but she can pull this off.

443
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,135
I know she can.

444
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,887
All right, did you find
someplace near a breach where

445
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,188
we don't have to worry about
civilians getting in the way?

446
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,058
Yeah, there's a place by the docks
that's usually deserted at night.

447
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,843
Awesome. How are we doing
with the speed-dampener?

448
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,612
- My tests indicate that it should work.
- It will work.

449
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:46,815
I'll tune up Ramon's gloves,
make sure they work better.

450
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,566
Okay, great.

451
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,952
Hey, we're actually gonna
go through with this?

452
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,287
Yeah, we're doing this.

453
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,689
I'm gonna have Iris get Linda ready.

454
00:20:57,793 --> 00:21:00,078
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

455
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,531
Barry, hold up.

456
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,383
Hey, what?

457
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,034
You saw what happened in there.

458
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,336
Linda's not ready.

459
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:09,971
She is. She's ready enough.

460
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,090
Why are you pushing this?

461
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:14,142
What... why do you think?
I want to get him.

462
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:15,760
Get who, exactly?

463
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,345
Is that a real question?

464
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,763
You tell me.

465
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,899
I'm... I'm not sure this
is even about Zoom.

466
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,216
I'm starting to feel like
you're still chasing

467
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,718
the Reverse Flash.

468
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,186
Reverse Flash is dead.

469
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,654
Yeah, but after all he did to you,

470
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,657
you weren't the one that stopped him.

471
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,992
We all worked together.

472
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:33,945
Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end.

473
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,413
I mean, did that make you feel cheated,

474
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,865
like you didn't get your revenge,

475
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:41,119
and stopping Zoom is the next best thing?

476
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,787
Look, all I'm saying is,

477
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,339
if you're gonna ask people like Linda

478
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:45,907
to risk their lives, you better be sure

479
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,292
of exactly why they're doing it.

480
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:03,925
Look, I'm sorry I'm a
terrible supervillain.

481
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,644
I don't need you to come here
and make me feel worse.

482
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,397
That's not why I'm here.

483
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,201
Doesn't matter, I... I can't do this.

484
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:14,702
I just don't have it in me.

485
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,404
That's not true.

486
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,289
You're one of the strongest
women I've ever met.

487
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,824
You can do anything.

488
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,127
And you know that about me
based on what exactly?

489
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,630
Linda,

490
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:29,116
you are trusting me.

491
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:32,303
So I need to trust you fully.

492
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:35,456
I know that you can do this...

493
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,650
Because I know you.

494
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,236
Barry. Holy crap.

495
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,775
I've made out with The Flash.

496
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,144
Listen, I just want to bury the hatchet

497
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,363
and say thank you for all your work.

498
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:17,600
You're welcome.

499
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,702
Okay.

500
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:23,790
I think maybe the trigger
mechanisms are just sticking.

501
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,441
It's not the trigger mechanisms.

502
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:26,659
- I think...
- It's not the... don't, no...

503
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:27,861
It's just a little bit of oil.

504
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:31,581
Ugh, I'm just gonna
clean this up really quick.

505
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,083
- Do not touch me.
- I'm just trying to help.

506
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,634
I know Wells went to the other Earth.

507
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,352
Why?

508
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,655
I don't know, I swear.

509
00:23:55,657 --> 00:24:00,860
Your loyalty is admirable,

510
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:01,862
Jesse.

511
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,588
I'm sorry.

512
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:24,066
Joe, Doctor Light.

513
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,635
- I thought we settled that.
- No, we didn't.

514
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,853
She's still out there on the loose...

515
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,337
a meta-human who just murdered a man.

516
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,172
Why aren't we doing something about it?

517
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,357
Look, none of this makes any sense,

518
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,708
and you're not talking to me.

519
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,809
All right, all right, all right, look.

520
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,444
It's a bit complicated,

521
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:38,781
but we're not going after
Doctor Light right now.

522
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,783
I need you to trust me, Patty,

523
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:43,069
for a few days or so.

524
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,821
Are you somehow involved in this?

525
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:48,407
If you're asking if I'm dirty, no,

526
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,495
but I need some time
to take care of some things.

527
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,913
I trust you, I do.

528
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,549
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't.

529
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,217
This is about you not trusting me.

530
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:02,805
- Patty, I trust you.
- Not enough.

531
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:06,425
A few days.

532
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,982
- Hey.
- Hey.

533
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:14,400
Do you want to maybe grab dinner tonight?

534
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:16,018
I could use your opinion about something.

535
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,236
I can't tonight. I'm sorry.

536
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:18,321
Sure.

537
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:20,573
I... I would. Joe and I actually...

538
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,693
Joe and I have a thing
that we've gotta do tonight.

539
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,244
Some other time.

540
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,780
I would much rather be
spending the evening with you.

541
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:32,335
Seriously, if I could cancel
these plans, I would.

542
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,921
Can we do dinner tomorrow?

543
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:36,071
Yeah, I would like that.

544
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,873
All right, I'll see you.

545
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,592
Good luck with your thing.

546
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,628
Thanks. I think I'll need it.

547
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,815
I'm here to kill The Flash,
and no one can stop me!

548
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:03,983
How's that?

549
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:05,484
It's a little too much.

550
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,119
Stop messing with the earpiece.

551
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:09,622
Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it.

552
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,940
Right, you... you told me that. I'm sorry.

553
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:16,245
No, no, you're doing great, Linda.

554
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:19,498
All right, Doctor Light, here I am.

555
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,334
But we're gonna skip the part where you say

556
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:23,419
you're gonna kill me
and go right to the part

557
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,787
where I don't let you.

558
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,006
I'm here to kill you, Flash.

559
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:28,257
Wait, what are you doing?

560
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,141
We're skipping that?

561
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:31,060
Yes.

562
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:35,464
I am loyal to Zoom,

563
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:37,800
so get ready to fry.

564
00:26:37,802 --> 00:26:39,402
Next time we're doing this,

565
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:41,020
I'm writing better dialogue.

566
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:42,022
- Next time?
- Next time?

567
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:50,663
- Oh!
- Gotcha.

568
00:26:50,665 --> 00:26:52,415
- Yeah, you did.
- Real good.

569
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,834
All right.

570
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:57,152
Bring it on.

571
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:21,360
Told you,

572
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:24,563
Zoom always wins.

573
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,235
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

574
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:32,788
I had to make it look good.

575
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,292
Here it is, Zoom, I did what you wanted.

576
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:39,245
Now bring me home.

577
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,663
Come on.

578
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:08,922
Come on. Come on.

579
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:24,438
This is everything he wants, right?

580
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,689
Come on, Zoom.

581
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:32,362
Hey, stop fidgeting.

582
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:33,847
Sorry, it's been an hour.

583
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,566
I landed in a ridiculous position,

584
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,401
and my foot fell asleep.

585
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:39,486
He's probably just waiting
to see if you're really dead.

586
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:42,322
Any minute now, he's gonna strike.

587
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,576
No.

588
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,750
Sorry, I probably screwed up somehow.

589
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,203
No, Linda, you did great.

590
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,730
So Wells ain't taking this well.

591
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,381
- Mm-hmm.
- How about you?

592
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,268
Yeah, it just sucks, you know.

593
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,520
You were right a little bit

594
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:15,572
about this not being just about Zoom...

595
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:18,775
about it being about the Reverse Flash.

596
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,060
Okay.

597
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,278
But not for the reason that you think,

598
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,080
not because I didn't beat him.

599
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:26,233
It's... Wells...

600
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:28,752
he said something to me on that video

601
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,420
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

602
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:34,208
He said that even if he was dead,

603
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,545
that he still won because I wasn't happy,

604
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:40,881
that I'd never really be happy.

605
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:42,382
How the hell would he know?

606
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,219
He knew me. He knows future me.

607
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,187
That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

608
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,890
I still think that Wells is right.

609
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,259
Ever since I went back to that night

610
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:54,094
and I didn't save her...
I didn't save my mom,

611
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:57,564
I just... there's just
been this void in me.

612
00:29:57,566 --> 00:30:02,936
You know, I just feel like that
is always gonna be there.

613
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:07,274
For better or worse, Wells... He knew me.

614
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:08,825
Better than I know you?

615
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:11,912
He may have stalked you
for 15 years, but I raised you.

616
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:15,582
Look, Wells said what he said
to you to mess with you...

617
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,084
to get in your head one last time.

618
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,670
If you listen to him, you let him win.

619
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,555
I know. I don't want that.

620
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:24,508
You're responsible for your
own happiness, Barry.

621
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,393
Forget about Wells.

622
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:28,428
Think hard about what you want

623
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,931
and what makes you happy.

624
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:32,900
Go out and get it.

625
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:34,768
Simple as that.

626
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,604
- All right?
- Yeah.

627
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,778
<i>And look at their eyes.</i>

628
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,614
Amazing.

629
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:50,167
Oh, good to see you guys.

630
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:52,786
- Bye.
- Bye, Patty.

631
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,956
- Hey!
- Hey.

632
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,674
Have you seen this video
of babies' expressions

633
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:58,675
as they go through tunnels?

634
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:01,094
Their faces are priceless.

635
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:03,496
I'm not baby crazy or...

636
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,062
Wow.

637
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:21,231
What did I do to deserve that?

638
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,734
I've just been thinking
about what makes me happy,

639
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:28,071
and getting to know you makes me happy.

640
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:30,657
We should do more of that then.

641
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,705
Hey.

642
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:48,091
I wish I could have kept
the gloves at least.

643
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:50,177
What would you have done with them?

644
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:53,563
Raves, duh.

645
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:56,650
That is not what you were thinking about.

646
00:31:56,652 --> 00:31:59,186
I was thinking about a lot of things.

647
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:00,771
Like how everything that's happened to me

648
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:02,889
the past few days is the best story

649
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,057
I can never write.

650
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,160
Ooh, tell me about it.

651
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:10,563
Do you ever get used to it?

652
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:15,002
Keeping a secret that big? No.

653
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:17,070
It's pretty heavy.

654
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,174
I need a good night's sleep.

655
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:24,511
I'm gonna head out.

656
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:27,080
I'll see you tomorrow.

657
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:30,183
Oh, hey, if we're gonna be
The Flash's sidekicks,

658
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:33,020
we should probably join
CrossFit or something, you know?

659
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:36,023
- Oh, yeah, girl.
- Yeah.

660
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,357
Bye.

661
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:50,487
Linda!

662
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,830
There you go.

663
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:02,299
It's like you think these things
just grow on trees or something.

664
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,284
And we threw away the last one for nothing.

665
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:07,721
You've been going over
this footage dozens of times.

666
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,789
Everything went exactly according to plan.

667
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,259
If it had, Zoom would have shown up.

668
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,677
Maybe Light was wrong.

669
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,128
Maybe he can't see through the breaches.

670
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,013
Or maybe he finally decided to give up.

671
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,134
Hey.

672
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,135
Iris, slow down.

673
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,303
I can't understand you.

674
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:28,742
Zoom has Linda.

675
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:31,862
He's on the roof.

676
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:38,702
Put her down.

677
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:42,422
You like to fish with bait?

678
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:44,374
I do too.

679
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,719
Come on. Come on.

680
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,058
You need to get out of here, okay?

681
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,360
No, you can't fight that thing.

682
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:04,394
It's a monster.

683
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:06,480
Just go.

684
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,707
Zoom cannot be human.

685
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,626
He is... Or was.

686
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:35,130
How the hell is Barry
supposed to defeat that?

687
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:39,384
Why is he running away?

688
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,753
He's not. He's not scared.

689
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:49,710
Ooh, he's gonna thunderbolt him!

690
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,929
What?

691
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:54,149
Jay taught him how to throw lightning.

692
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:13,901
Did you guys see that?

693
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,787
See him catch a bolt of lightning

694
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,456
with his demonic claws? Yeah, saw that.

695
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:20,508
Jay was right. He cannot do this alone.

696
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,460
He's not alone.

697
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,912
<i>- Run, Barry.</i>
- No.

698
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,183
I'm gonna see if Wells'
speed-dampening serum works.

699
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,434
What do you want from me?

700
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,252
Everything.

701
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,305
You want to be me? Is that it?

702
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,440
You want to be a hero?

703
00:35:35,442 --> 00:35:38,193
Heroes die.

704
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:41,279
Only if you can catch them.

705
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,375
How is Barry gonna match Zoom's speed?

706
00:35:54,377 --> 00:35:56,110
Genius. He's not gonna match it.

707
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,745
He's gonna take it out
of the equation altogether.

708
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:59,664
- What are you talking about?
- Terminal velocity.

709
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,133
The highest velocity attainable
by a falling object.

710
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,752
- Falling through the air?
- Yeah, freefall fight.

711
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,304
Their drag force equals
the downward force of gravity,

712
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,339
making the net force zero, making...

713
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,225
Equal velocities. That is genius.

714
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,706
Never forget,

715
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,376
I am the fastest man alive.

716
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,166
- He's killing him.
- Barry.

717
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:59,340
You're next.

718
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:15,039
Barry.

719
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:18,993
Look at your hero.

720
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:27,385
This man is no god.

721
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:30,538
He is nothing!

722
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:43,601
The days of The Flash
protecting this city are over.

723
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:45,520
- No, hold your fire.
- Put him down.

724
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:50,191
Now what will you do
without your precious hero?

725
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:52,277
Shoot that thing, now.

726
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,477
Nice try.

727
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:22,573
- Anything?
- No.

728
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:24,692
- Do you have him?
- No.

729
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:35,136
Barry!

730
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,005
Harrison Wells,

731
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:41,092
you thought you could defeat me

732
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,728
with this?

733
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:47,515
I made a mistake.

734
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:52,487
Yes, a costly one.

735
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:59,827
Goodbye, Flash.

736
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,364
You, too, weren't fast enough.

737
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:20,631
No. No!

738
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:23,084
Stay with me. Stay with me, Barry.

739
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:26,971
Stay with me. Please, Barry, please.

740
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,026
This is all you! If Barry dies, you die.

741
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:33,444
Joe, Barry's vitals have stabilized.

742
00:39:33,446 --> 00:39:35,262
- Let's let him go.
- No, Caitlin.

743
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:37,598
Why? What good does that do for Barry?

744
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,934
It's gonna help me.

745
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:44,238
Joe, stop. Who's Jesse?

746
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,709
How do... Jesse's my daughter.

747
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,578
Zoom has her. You've... you did vibe me.

748
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,446
- Yes.
- What did you see?

749
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:54,499
I saw your daughter.

750
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,617
She was with Zoom.

751
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,303
But she's alive?

752
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,973
Yeah.

753
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,176
Zoom sent you here like the others?

754
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:08,096
You kill The Flash, and you
get your daughter back?

755
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,463
The only way I get my daughter back is,

756
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:10,765
I capture Zoom.

757
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:14,819
Do you understand? You love Barry.

758
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:17,071
I love my daughter.

759
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:19,657
And none of these children are
safe as long as Zoom is here.

760
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:22,777
I tried on my Earth to capture him.

761
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:24,078
I failed.

762
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,415
I thought I could bring him down here

763
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:31,502
with Barry's help.

764
00:40:31,504 --> 00:40:33,755
I was wrong.

765
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:48,836
Hey, I think he's waking up.

766
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:52,607
Barry. Barry?

767
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,860
Can you hear me?

768
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,395
Hey.

769
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:02,116
You scared the crap out of us.

770
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:04,152
You were gone for a long time.

771
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:05,853
How bad is it?

772
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,572
Bad.

773
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:11,042
If you didn't heal so quickly,
I'd be very worried.

774
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:13,694
- Linda... how is she?
- She's fine.

775
00:41:13,696 --> 00:41:16,798
She's staying with some
friends out in Coast City.

776
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,033
Zoom?

777
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:23,888
Let's... Let's worry about Zoom
when you're up and about, okay?

778
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,425
Oh, no, you're staying put.

779
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:29,927
Yeah, seriously, you got your ass kicked.

780
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:33,347
No, guys, I can't feel my legs.

781
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:39,887
I can't feel my legs.
