1
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:06,093
<i>Back in 2009, your Aunt Robin
got a job hosting a morning show.</i>

2
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:08,931
<i>Which meant she had to get up
kind of early. How early?</i>

3
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:12,329
Morning, everybody.

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,532
- Hey!
Hey, Robin!

5
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:18,668
So you're actually doing it, huh?
You're actually going to work at 2:00 a. m.

6
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,678
Okay, I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for the fans.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,238
Who exactly are the fans of a show
that airs at 4:00 in the morning?

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,579
People getting up to host a show
at 5:00 in the morning?

9
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:28,709
Ha, ha, ha.

10
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,878
Meth addicts
who haven't sold their TVs yet?

11
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,512
Strippers in that messy gray area
between getting off work

12
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,591
and getting their kids up for school?

13
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:37,057
Them's my peeps.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,593
All right, catch me up.
What's been going on?

15
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,925
You know, just the uzhe.

16
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,021
- Really, the uzhe?
- Yes.

17
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:47,499
Robin, think of the funniest thing
that has ever happened.

18
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:50,195
- Got it.
- Now double that.

19
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:52,794
So, a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,901
Something even funnier than that
happened to Marshall today.

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,477
Okay, first of all,
there's nothing funnier than that.

22
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:04,105
Second of all, look,
it's not that good a story.

23
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,613
Oh, come on, you guys.

24
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:10,015
You're four young, active people living
in the most exciting city on Earth.

25
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,711
You're telling me
you have no stories for me?

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,153
What can I say?
Some weeks are just like that.

27
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:18,750
It's the same thing over and over.
A kid in my class ate some paste.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,159
I used deceitful means to hook up
with a less-than-intelligent girl.

29
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:26,790
My ex-girlfriend, Karen, moved to town.
It's just... It's all the same, Robin.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,492
Karen's in town?

31
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:30,694
- You have got to be kidding me!
- No!

32
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,794
<i>Kids,
I think I've told you about Karen.</i>

33
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,871
<i>She was my girlfriend in high school
and intermittently during college.</i>

34
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:40,774
<i>She was beautiful, smart.
I was madly in love with her.</i>

35
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:44,176
<i>The only problem was,
Marshall and Lily were not.</i>

36
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,341
<i>I think it had something to do with
every time Karen opened her mouth.</i>

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,181
I love that you guys live in a dorm.
It's so American.

38
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,722
It's like, "Let's all eat baloney sandwiches
and be racist. "

39
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,683
Oh, my God, she was such a douche.

40
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,158
Dude, she was the heiress
to the Massengill fortune.

41
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,592
- She really wasn't that bad.
- Of course, you think that.

42
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:08,496
She turned you into
one of her douche zombies.

43
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:14,629
"I want to eat your brain,
but only if it's organic and grass-fed. "

44
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,664
What?

45
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:19,937
- Will you pass the salt?
- Salt?

46
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:22,568
So bourgeois.

47
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,911
Totally.

48
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:32,076
- What's that thing?
- That's a TV, Karen.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,544
Oh.

50
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,784
I don't watch TV.

51
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,852
Totally.

52
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,322
You thought I actually bought tickets
to WrestleMania?

53
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,726
I was being ironic.

54
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,559
Totally.

55
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:50,395
I know that you were being ironic.

56
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:55,066
I, too, am being ironic.

57
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,831
Let's do this!

58
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,068
What?

59
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:05,343
That makeup didn't come off for a month.
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.

60
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,914
I've never looked like a bigger jackass.

61
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,208
Until today.

62
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,374
Tell the story. Tell the story.
Tell the story.

63
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:11,610
Just let it go!

64
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,084
Well, hold on. Is it really funny?

65
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,587
Robin, I am not kidding you.

66
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:22,320
I almost don't want you to hear it,
because seriously, for the rest of your life,

67
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:26,385
nothing else will ever be as funny,
and you will curse yourself

68
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,557
for agreeing to ever hear it
in the first place.

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,291
But seriously, you got to hear it.
It's so funny.

70
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,061
Fine.

71
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:37,265
<i>I was at the company gym
this morning playing basketball.</i>

72
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:40,830
<i>Now, the guys I work with
can be pretty brutal with their ridicule.</i>

73
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,400
Hey, look at Wisniewski.
He's gonna cry. Look at him.

74
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,172
Yeah, look at him.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,771
I don't know. I don't think knees
are supposed to bend that way.

76
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,873
I think he might have torn his ACL.

77
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:54,316
Bro, the only thing that guy tore
was his cervix or maybe his hymen.

78
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,887
Yeah, or his Fallopian tubes. Boom!

79
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,856
I may have cleaned up the dialog
a little bit.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,656
Anyways, I go to my duffle bag
to get out my work clothes...

81
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:08,959
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to say it.
I want to say it. I want to say it.

82
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,726
Fine. You say it.

83
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,860
Marshall goes to his duffle bag
to get out his work clothes and...

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,871
No, no, no, you say it.
It's funnier if you say it.

85
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:21,669
No, let me say it. No, no, you say it.
You say it. Say it.

86
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:24,207
Same time.

87
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,938
No, no, no, you go. You go.

88
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,940
- I forgot...
- Marshall forgot his pants!

89
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,423
He forgot his pants.

90
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,739
Okay, Marshall forgot his pants.
That's pretty funny.

91
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,605
It's no chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos.

92
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:08,373
I mean, what did he...
He forgot he put the first one on?

93
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,281
Stupid monkey.

94
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,613
So Karen in New York. Weird, right?

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,153
Ted, you cannot get back together
with Karen.

96
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:20,450
I never said I was going to
get back together with her.

97
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:21,956
But I was thinking, she's new in town.

98
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,922
Would it be the worst thing
in the world if I gave her a call?

99
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,153
No, no, Ted, it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

100
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,729
It would be the fourth worst thing.

101
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,957
Number one, super volcano.
Number two, an asteroid hits the Earth.

102
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,467
Number three, all footage of Evel Knievel
is lost. Number four, Ted calls Karen.

103
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,469
Number five, Lily gets eaten by a shark.

104
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,971
I'm Lily and I approve the order of that list.

105
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,802
You don't know the whole story.

106
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,504
Ted and Karen were off-and-on all through
college, and it always went the same way.

107
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,512
They'd be having fun, douching it up,
and then one day...

108
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:55,249
I know you think pepperoni is fascist,
and you're totally right, so I...

109
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,285
Oh, my God! Karen!

110
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,021
Sorry, bro.

111
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,087
Before you say anything,

112
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,091
<i>I think that you should read
Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal.</i>

113
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,524
Okay.

114
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,255
So then they break up.

115
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:15,630
Ted would be all depressed and we would
wait the appropriate amount of time

116
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,599
and then we would tell him
how we really felt.

117
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:19,529
Karen and I broke up.

118
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:22,071
- We hated her!
- Bitch had to go!

119
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,165
And then Ted would
build up a head of steam

120
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:29,575
and finally take the bus to Providence
to give Karen a piece of his mind.

121
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,838
- How'd it go?
- Great.

122
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,444
Look who's back!

123
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,252
- Karen!
- Karen!

124
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:43,483
And then, sure enough, the whole thing
would start all over again.

125
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,054
Make that 10,002 Maniacs,
because I got us Natalie Merchant...

126
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,463
Sorry, bro.

127
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,565
So she would come visit you at school
and the second you turned your back,

128
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,136
she would bring guys
back to your dorm room?

129
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,396
Respect.

130
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,301
Okay, I was an idiot.

131
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,897
She was my first real girlfriend.
I was madly in love with her.

132
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,636
We all did stuff we regret in college.

133
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:11,076
Junior year, Marshall grew
a soul patch, wore a Rasta hat,

134
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,648
and asked everyone
to call him M.J. Smooth.

135
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,046
I don't regret that for one second.

136
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:18,948
So you guys absolutely
don't think I should call her?

137
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,020
Ted, no!
- Of course not!

138
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,110
Get it through your thick skull!

139
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,314
Okay, okay, fine, I won't.

140
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,557
Interesting piece of trivia, I called her.

141
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,990
- What are you doing?
- You idiot!

142
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,322
Finish the pants story.

143
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,362
I can't believe you called her.

144
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,829
Why don't you just ask her to lunch
while you're at it?

145
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:38,766
Because, Lily, I'm not going
to ask her out to lunch, again.

146
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,169
- Wow.
- You asked her to lunch?

147
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,199
Why would anyone want
to have lunch with their ex?

148
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,333
Glad you asked, Marshall.

149
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:49,910
There are four possible motives
behind an ex lunch.

150
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,503
Number one, they want
to get back together.

151
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,047
Oh. Like my high school boyfriend, Scooter.

152
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,381
Lilies, clever.
I'm sorry I don't have a scooter for you.

153
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,883
My God, that's funny!
I forgot how funny you are.

154
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,827
- Where is that waiter?
- Why? You like waiters?

155
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,952
I can be a waiter.

156
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:16,692
I'm going to be the greatest waiter
on this Earth, and then you'll love me.

157
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:21,526
Number two, they want to kill you.
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.

158
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,365
I'm glad we could finally do this.

159
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:26,804
You know, after the ninth time
you rescheduled on me,

160
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,341
I almost gave up on you.

161
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:31,536
But you didn't. You just kept on trying.

162
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:36,678
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

163
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,053
Gun! She's got a gun!

164
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,720
It's a tie.

165
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,654
Number three, they actually do want
to give you your stuff back.

166
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,591
Like when I had lunch with Curt.

167
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,896
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

168
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:05,197
My snub-nose. 38 Police Special!
God, I knew I left that somewhere.

169
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:09,234
Every time I watch the news,
I'm like, "Oops. Hope that wasn't my gun. "

170
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,269
Breaking up was the right choice.

171
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,573
Or number four, to rub your face
in how great they're doing.

172
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,151
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.

173
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:23,584
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?
- My ex.

174
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:27,781
- Hello, Nicole.
- You look well, Marshall.

175
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,859
You look okay, I guess.

176
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,795
- I'm seeing someone.
- Already? Who?

177
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,955
Lee Roberts. He reads at a fifth-grade level.

178
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,935
You have to cancel the lunch.

179
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:47,063
I would definitely do that, definitely,
except I already had it.

180
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,706
Robin, I'm going to need to
borrow the butt of your gun.

181
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,836
I actually lost it again.
Can you believe that?

182
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,950
How could you break bread
with that woman?

183
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:06,648
It was just lunch,
and you know she doesn't eat wheat.

184
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:07,984
We had a great time catching up.

185
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,491
I mean, we even laughed about
what jerks we were back then.

186
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,455
I can't believe I had a beret
for each day of the week.

187
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:19,999
I can't believe I had an iron-on image
of Molière on my backpack.

188
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,831
Man, we were pretentious.

189
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,165
So pretentious.

190
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,966
What can I get you?

191
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,131
Hi.

192
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,037
I don't want to cause a scene, but
your wine list has a Châteauneuf-du-Pape

193
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,511
listed under your Côtes de Provence.

194
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:39,378
You might want to alert your sommelier.

195
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,143
And for you?

196
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:46,119
I hate to go off-menu, but can we have
some bruschett with fresh mozzarell?

197
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,881
It was great. It was great.

198
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,483
I mean, there was one weird moment
towards the end.

199
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,858
Yeah, I mean, how do you say goodbye
in those situations?

200
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:59,022
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar.
A handshake is too formal.

201
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:02,259
And a hug is just like a public dry hump.

202
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,599
I think you're hugging wrong.

203
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:08,001
- So what happened?
- Well...

204
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:12,403
Schopenhauer made a saucy little
argument in which he posited...

205
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:17,408
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside
and bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.

206
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:21,108
Hey, Karen was the first girl I ever loved.
Okay?

207
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:23,776
And after the year I've had, I...
I don't know,

208
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:27,082
I guess having lunch with her just
reminded me of what it was like to be 18

209
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:29,713
and have my whole life figured out.

210
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:34,452
And I would like to remind everyone that
at least I was wearing pants, Marshall.

211
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,224
No! No, no, no! You can't just go
changing the subject like that.

212
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,991
Oh. Yeah, the pants story.

213
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:42,726
Pants story, bomaye! Pants story, bomaye!

214
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:43,960
There's no story!

215
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,037
I had a little situation, so I called Lily.

216
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,628
And just refresh us,
what was that situation?

217
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,172
I forgot my pants.

218
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:53,839
What do you mean you forgot your pants?

219
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,969
I forgot them.
Now, I need you to bring me some.

220
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,176
What about your spare pants?

221
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,976
Last Thursday, the mustard incident?

222
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,982
Jeez, woman, you have
the memory of a goldfish.

223
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:07,986
No, Ted, you're not getting off that easy.
Marshall's pants story, while amusing...

224
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:10,750
Amusing? Try very amusing.

225
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:14,883
...is nothing compared to this
Karen madness. Finish your story.

226
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,985
What? That's it.
It was just one kiss in the restaurant.

227
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:22,328
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?
Did you kiss somewhere else?

228
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:27,302
Like where, in a tree?
No, Lily, we did not make out in a tree.

229
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,234
What's with this one?

230
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:32,573
Oh, Ted. What did you do?

231
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,280
Ted, how could you?

232
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:44,646
Ted, Marshall forgot to bring
his pants to work today,

233
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,515
and you're still the stupidest person
at this table.

234
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,920
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.
We both know your real motivation here.

235
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:55,117
You hate Karen because she lingered.

236
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,319
You son of a bitch.

237
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:58,759
What do you mean she lingered?

238
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:03,026
February 5th, 1998. I was painting...

239
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:09,366
Sorry. I... Sorry. I...

240
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:18,067
You know, that color palette
is a bit derivative of early Van Gogh,

241
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:19,873
don't you think?

242
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:26,711
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,
whatever, that's your business.

243
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:32,552
But I catch you peeping on my man's junk
and you linger?

244
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:35,148
You gots to get got.

245
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,125
The game is the game.

246
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:41,095
In Karen's defense, I had just worked out.

247
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,562
Why'd you have to paint
Marshall nude anyway?

248
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,896
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.

249
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:49,834
Look, the point is, Karen is a dirty lingerer,

250
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:52,337
and you cannot bring her
back into our lives.

251
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,873
Relax, it was just that one night!

252
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,909
And the next three after that.
And one morning.

253
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,704
But at least
I had pants on, Marshall.

254
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,178
Although, actually, I didn't.

255
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,442
- Wait, this happened in our apartment?
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,538
Where was I?

257
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,447
You know those sleeping pills
you're taking

258
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:09,315
to keep on your crazy new schedule?

259
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,047
I think they're stronger than you realize.

260
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,821
LaFontaine gets the puck to Turgeon.

261
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,228
Turgeon shoots. Glove save.

262
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,829
Hey, Ted. Hey, Lily.
Don't worry. I won't tell Marshall.

263
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,333
I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?

264
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,802
Beer! I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.

265
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:51,110
Ted, sure it's fun to look back at a time

266
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:54,883
when you were a fresh-faced farm girl
with a virgin's glow.

267
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,983
But all that stuff, Ohio, Karen, college...
All that was BS.

268
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,826
"Before Stinson. "
Now your life is awesome!

269
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:08,095
I mean, yeah, you still live with
your ex-girlfriend, which is ridiculous.

270
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,999
Your Laser Tag chops
are almost nonexistent.

271
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:16,473
And your wardrobe, it's like, what,
are you allergic to quality fabrics?

272
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,702
Seriously, Ted, shape up.

273
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,772
What were we talking about?

274
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,080
So what's next with this broad?

275
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,580
Oh, please, the story's already written.

276
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:30,584
Ted is Charlie Brown trying to
kick the football and Karen's Lucy,

277
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,814
who pulls it away at the last second
and has sex with it.

278
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:34,911
Ew!

279
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,751
You guys know what I mean.
Ted's gonna fall in love,

280
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:40,987
and then Karen's gonna cheat on him
with some meathead, who's like,

281
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:43,696
"Sorry, bro. "

282
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,862
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

283
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,991
You must have left the right answer
in your pants, Marshall,

284
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,001
because that's exactly what didn't happen.

285
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,694
<i>Because here's what happened.</i>

286
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,568
<i>One afternoon, we were at Karen's place...</i>

287
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,635
Karen? Oh, my God.

288
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,168
How could you?

289
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,937
Sorry, bro.

290
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,719
<i>So, this time,
the meathead Karen was cheating with...</i>

291
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:17,882
Was me, Ted. Me...

292
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,153
Remember that time
Marshall forgot his pants?

293
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,352
Damn it, Ted!

294
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,624
You quit trying to change the subject.
You crossed the line.

295
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:27,893
You are complicit
in breaking some poor guy's heart.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,402
And you, you of all people
know exactly how that feels.

297
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,168
You really don't want to tell
the pants story, do you?

298
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:38,400
- What?
- Pants, pants, pants, pants...

299
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:40,271
Fine! Okay?

300
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:43,470
So, Lily came down to the office
to bring me my pants.

301
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,877
- And why did she have to do that?
- Because I forgot my pants.

302
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:51,750
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to give Marshall something.

303
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:52,841
Ah.

304
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,582
Here to give him something. Got you. Nice.

305
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,056
Yeah, but I'm in a hurry.
Can I just give it to you?

306
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,460
Sure, okay.

307
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,629
And then you'll give it to him?

308
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,290
Wait, hey. I don't know about all that.

309
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:12,431
I mean, yours would
have to be really good.

310
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,971
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

311
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:19,837
Marshall forgot his pants,
so I'm bringing him a new pair.

312
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,073
Huh. Marshall forgot his pants.

313
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,838
Well, it's a good thing that you came by

314
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:28,177
because he has a really
important meeting today,

315
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:32,149
and it would be pretty embarrassing
and not at all funny

316
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,913
if he were to show up not wearing pants.

317
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,683
- So, I'll make sure he gets these.
- Great. Thanks, Barney.

318
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,518
And you didn't give him his pants.

319
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,652
Theodore Evelyn Mosby.

320
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:49,061
Of course I gave him his pants.
I gave Lily my word. My word is oak.

321
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,799
Though I did make some alterations.

322
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:02,107
Now, as you'll see on page 44
of the contract...

323
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,404
Hey, Eriksen, when did you join AC/DC?

324
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,474
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

325
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,643
Now, can we please just turn
to page 44 of the contract?

326
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:15,914
<i>Hey, Eriksen, I think the Oliver Twist
auditions are down the hall!</i>

327
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:23,093
Hey, Eriksen, "Please, sir,
may I have some more pants?"

328
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,532
More pants!

329
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,135
Oh, my God!

330
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,904
That's it? That's the whole story?

331
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,569
- So what happened with Karen?
- I'll finish it for you.

332
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:49,239
Ted left without saying anything
and Karen got exactly what she wanted.

333
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:50,405
Mmm-mmm.

334
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,641
Not this time.

335
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,383
So, you have a boyfriend?

336
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,921
We've been drifting apart for a long time.
I've been meaning to break up with him.

337
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:00,582
God, Karen, you are unbelievable.

338
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,659
You don't have the guts to break up
with someone like a decent human being,

339
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,024
so instead you pull this crap.

340
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,360
Okay, you're right.

341
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:13,896
I'm great with books. I'm great with art.

342
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,893
I'm great with identifying French wines

343
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:20,234
from within a mile of
where the grapes are grown.

344
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,406
But I'm really bad when it comes
to looking someone in the eye

345
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,307
and telling them the truth
about how I feel.

346
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,675
Well, we're both bad at that.

347
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:33,217
But I think we both need to change.
So why don't I go first?

348
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:37,083
Karen, you're a really hurtful
and reckless person,

349
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:40,519
and I never want to see you
or speak to you again.

350
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:42,919
<i>Au revoir.</i>

351
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,023
Ted, wait.

352
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:52,596
<i>Actually, "au revoir"means
"until we see each other again. "</i>

353
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:58,703
So, I'm assuming that you mean
we will in fact see each other again?

354
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,630
Sorry, bro.

355
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,900
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes!

356
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:10,139
- Bravo.
- Ted, I am impressed with you.

357
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:12,908
You, too, Marshall.
Have you been wearing those all day?

358
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:15,348
They show off my calves.

359
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,646
Pants story. Tell it again.

360
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:21,755
You know, maybe it was good
you called Karen.

361
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:24,848
It definitely was.
And not just for me, but for her, too.

362
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,859
Later that night, she sat down with Jerry,

363
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,952
and she had the break-up talk
she always avoided with me.

364
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,189
<i>So you see, kids,</i>

365
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,959
<i>sometimes when you
have to have a tough conversation,</i>

366
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,033
<i>the best thing to do...</i>

367
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,625
Wait a second. Wait a second.

368
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,797
You said you were never gonna talk
to Karen again, right?

369
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:42,964
Yeah.

370
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,667
Then how do you know
she took your advice?

371
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,800
Hmm?

372
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:50,306
Oh! Right. Well, about that.

373
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,608
After she broke up with that dude,
she called me, we went out,

374
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:54,080
we hooked up,
and we've been dating ever since.

375
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,240
We're really seeing eye-to-eye,
and this time,

376
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,681
I don't know,
it just feels different somehow.

377
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,310
Here she comes now. Be cool! Hey!

378
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,251
Karen.
