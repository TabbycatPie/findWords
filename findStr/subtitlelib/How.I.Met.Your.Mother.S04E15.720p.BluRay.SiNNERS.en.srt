1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:04,634
Barney, check it,

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:08,640
three blond babies drinking
bad decision juice at 8 o'clock.

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,271
Nice rack radar.

4
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:14,277
- That's my wife.
- No, I got to get going.

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,147
Seriously? But they're blond and drunk.

6
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:18,415
Isn't that your type?

7
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,486
Maybe I don't have a type, Lily.

8
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:26,126
God, do you think the male mind
is really that simplistic,

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,859
that we all have one favorite type? Jeez.

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,434
Asian with some boob.

11
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:34,203
I'm gonna hit the bathroom, then bail.

12
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:37,775
Okay, have you guys noticed
Barney's been acting weird lately?

13
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:38,967
Actually, yes.

14
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:41,135
You know how Barney always says
never buy a girl flowers,

15
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,271
because giving her a living thing
reminds her of babies?

16
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,645
- Sure.
- Well, the other day,

17
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:49,078
I saw him at that flower shop
on 82nd buying roses.

18
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,846
- What?
- Wait, now that you mention it,

19
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:53,686
Barney did do something kind of odd
at the office yesterday.

20
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:55,851
Okay, see you Saturday.

21
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,826
I'm thinking brunch,
farmer's market, maybe a hike.

22
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:01,359
I love you, too. Bye.

23
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:06,296
I figured he was just talking
to some girl he was trying to nail.

24
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:08,372
Or Ted, but now I don't know.

25
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:13,774
Wait, do you think it's possible
that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,869
Later.

27
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:18,074
Wait, Barney, hold on.
Where are you going?

28
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,375
Nowhere.

29
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,979
The beach. It's winter. Laser tag.

30
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,248
Home. Shut up. You're going somewhere.

31
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,754
Oh, my God. He's meeting her right now.

32
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,698
- Where is Barney going?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,562
We're not even in Manhattan anymore.

34
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:37,995
Where's this girl live?

35
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:41,436
We're talking about a woman who's
actually gotten Barney Stinson to commit.

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,107
I'm guessing Narnia.

37
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,002
Oh, oh, he's stopping.

38
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,254
- What the hell are you guys doing here?
- Where is she?

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,987
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

40
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,120
Oh, hello.

41
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:07,525
Wow, you really don't have a type,
do you?

42
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:12,703
Ah... These are my friends.
Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin.

43
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,800
Guys, this is Loretta.

44
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,576
- My mom.
- It's so nice to meet you.

45
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,746
I feel like I already know you all.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,640
Barney goes on and on about you
every day when we talk.

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,514
Aw! You call your mom every day?

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,687
No. Mom!

49
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,514
So that's what you were being
all secretive about?

50
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,992
You didn't want us to know
you're a big old mama's boy.

51
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:39,421
Yep, you got me.
Well, guess you guys can leave.

52
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:40,499
Oh!

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,524
- Hello.
- Hi.

54
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,801
Barney, who are all these people?

55
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,398
Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin,
I'd like you to meet Betty,

56
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,338
my wife.

57
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,509
And my son Tyler.

58
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:17,963
Betty and I are gonna get dinner ready.
There'll be plenty for everyone.

59
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,399
But remember, you,

60
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:22,202
only one helping of meatloaf
after what Dr. Grossbard said

61
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:24,937
- about your cholesterol.
- This one wants me to live forever.

62
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,137
Guilty.

63
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,379
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

64
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:31,315
- I love you three!
- Get out of here, you little scamp!

65
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:36,921
- So, I'll see you guys back at the bar?
- What the hell, Barney?

66
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,515
Okay, it's a long story.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,822
As you know,
my father had to leave my mom

68
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,195
<i>when I was a baby because he got hired
as the host of The Price Is Right.</i>

69
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,958
- It was a very good show.
- Bob Barker is your father.

70
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,096
She had to raise
my brother and me by herself.

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,141
And her only wish was for her sons

72
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,835
not to wind up alone, like she was.

73
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:02,038
Then about seven years ago,
she got really sick.

74
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:05,243
<i>It looked like she wasn't going to make it.</i>

75
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,513
<i>So I decided to make her wish come true.</i>

76
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,121
Mom, this is Betty.

77
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,918
We're engaged.

78
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:17,226
I hired an actress to play
my fiancée "Betty. "

79
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,194
Her real name's Margaret.

80
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,792
She mostly does off-Broadway theater.
Wonderful actress.

81
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,666
This close to a Tony.
It's all who you know.

82
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:25,706
It's very political. I shouldn't get into it.

83
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,775
But there's one problem.

84
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:31,078
Betty has a slight tendency
to go off-book.

85
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,207
You see, Mom?
I found someone who makes me happy.

86
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,382
- Just like you wanted.
- That's wonderful.

87
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:41,915
I just wish I could've stuck around
long enough for grandchildren.

88
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,218
I'm pregnant!

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,957
And then my mom got better.

90
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,798
Which was miraculous. But it meant
that I had to keep "Betty"

91
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,269
around and cast a kid
to play my son Tyler.

92
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,035
This is crazy.
You actually cast your own son?

93
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:03,266
Well, for a while,

94
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:06,040
I got by borrowing/babysitting
my neighbor's baby.

95
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,450
Then this one Christmas,
when my mom was plowed on eggnog,

96
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:12,111
I got away with a bag of flour
and a Chucky mask.

97
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,688
But eventually I had to hold auditions.

98
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,158
4, 8,

99
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:23,393
13, you can stay. The rest of you may go.

100
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,565
You said that if I slept with you,
my son would get the part.

101
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,429
Well, apparently
I'm a better actor than your kid.

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,508
Bring in the 11:00's!

103
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,771
And that's how the role of Tyler
eventually went to

104
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,641
Grant.

105
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,813
- Come on, Grant seems pretty good.
- You think so?

106
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,318
Watch this. Hey, Tyler.

107
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,582
Tyler. Tyler.

108
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,260
- Grant.
- Yeah?

109
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,759
See? It's like amateur hour over here.

110
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:03,137
Call me crazy, but child actors
were way better back in the '80s.

111
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:08,571
Well, Barney, it looks like your mom kept

112
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:11,111
your childhood bedroom
just the way you left it.

113
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:14,182
<i>Yeah, that sure is a big poster
of The Karate Kid above your bed.</i>

114
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:16,217
<i>Hey, The Karate Kid is a great movie.</i>

115
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:20,584
It's the story of a hopeful young karate
enthusiast whose dreams and moxie

116
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,590
take him all the way
to the All Valley Karate Championship.

117
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:27,158
Of course, sadly, he loses
in the final round to that nerd kid,

118
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:31,290
but he learns an important lesson
about gracefully accepting defeat.

119
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,727
<i>Wait. When you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

120
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:37,465
you actually root for that mean blond boy?

121
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:41,099
No, I root for the scrawny loser
from New Jersey

122
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,179
who barely even knows karate.

123
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:47,248
<i>When I watch The Karate Kid,
I root for the karate kid,</i>

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,648
Johnny Lawrence
from the Cobra Kai dojo.

125
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,179
Get your head out of your ass, Lily.

126
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,783
Okay, I just figured out
where I know you from.

127
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:00,919
I saw you perform
at the Disorientation Theater

128
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:05,434
<i>in Bertolt Brecht's Die heilige Johanna
der Schlachthöfe last fall.</i>

129
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,427
You were a revelation!

130
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,296
- Really?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, thanks.

132
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:15,036
I wasn't sure. I mean, the point
of Brecht's work, of course, is to

133
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,477
- alienate the audience.
- Alienate the audience. Sure.

134
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:20,778
Sorry. Brecht-o-phile right here!

135
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:24,187
Wow, you really know your theater.

136
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,022
Lady Theater grabbed my heart early on
and she never let go.

137
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:29,659
Every year at Christmas,

138
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,660
I'd put on a little play for the parents
with all the other kids.

139
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,857
Gee whiz, Santa, do you think
we can take off in this kind of snow?

140
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,529
Cut! Cut! Cut! Ricky!

141
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:42,333
Grandma and Grandpa are gonna be here
in half an hour,

142
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,374
and you're still butchering my words.

143
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,471
Looks like I'm gonna have to write,
direct and star in this thing.

144
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,580
Give me your elf hat. Go sit.

145
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:52,848
I always secretly wanted to be an actor.

146
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,544
It's one of those life dreams
that just slipped away, I guess.

147
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,451
Listen, if you want,
I could give you some tips on acting.

148
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:00,580
- Really? Oh!
- I'd love to.

149
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:04,923
Okay, acting rule number one,
don't be afraid to...

150
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,497
At least someone's still excited
about acting.

151
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:09,225
I miss that.

152
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,664
So, you don't like playing Barney's son?

153
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,135
I hate it. But what can I do?

154
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,267
- The phone just ain't ringing.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

155
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:18,807
I'm a newscaster.

156
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,434
But I just had to take a job
hosting a local morning show

157
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,946
that airs at 4:30 in the morning.

158
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:28,210
I just thought I'd be so much further along
by this point, you know?

159
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm almost 30.

160
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,915
Come on, you still look great.

161
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:34,213
I love your nose job.

162
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,483
I never had a nose job.

163
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,796
Right. Me neither.

164
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,491
I can't believe we haven't met you before.

165
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,763
Who knew Barney had such a great mom?

166
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:48,168
Thanks, dear.

167
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:51,909
Truth is, I wasn't always
the best mother when I was younger.

168
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,207
Oh, don't say that. I'm sure you were great.

169
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,245
Yeah, I was a bit of a whore.

170
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,113
Excuse me?

171
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,880
A whore, dear. A dirty whore.

172
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,488
I'm not proud of it.

173
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,422
But still I had some fun.

174
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,326
There is no thrill equal

175
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,524
to looking into some guy's eyes
and thinking,

176
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,999
"I don't know your name,
you don't know mine,

177
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:20,037
"but for the next eight minutes,

178
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:22,299
"we are gonna rock
this gas station bathroom

179
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,500
"right off its foundation.

180
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:28,739
"And then just drive off
in opposite directions.

181
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,281
"Just keep driving. "

182
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,845
Barney's mom?

183
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,149
- Loretta.
- Loretta.

184
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,224
Oh!

185
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,919
Anyway, that's all in the past now.

186
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:44,561
I did the best I could,

187
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:49,930
but sometimes I wonder how Barney
turned out to be so perfect.

188
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,270
You have to tell your mom
the truth, okay?

189
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:57,365
Listen, she is a sweet,
caring, slightly-too-graphic woman

190
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,206
who deserves better.

191
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,208
No. No way. The truth would kill her.

192
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:03,913
I don't feel right

193
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:07,350
about lying to such
a kindhearted woman, okay?

194
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,713
She reminds me of my own mother.

195
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,254
- What?
- "Kindhearted"?

196
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:17,022
Remember in our wedding vows
when I said we'd be together forever?

197
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,066
Well, on our way back up the aisle,
your mother leaned in and she said,

198
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,498
"Not forever, sweetie.
Marshall's going to Heaven. "

199
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:28,171
- She was making a joke.
- She hates me, Marshall.

200
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,707
But that's okay because...

201
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,368
Never mind.

202
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,438
No. What were you gonna say?

203
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:37,880
Nothing. Hey, do you want to go do it
in Barney's childhood bedroom again?

204
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,052
- On the racecar bed?
- Handles great, buddy.

205
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,547
Look, Lily, if today has taught us
nothing else,

206
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:48,286
it's that honesty is important
when it comes to family.

207
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,886
Now, whatever you're feeling
towards my mother,

208
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,263
we've been together for 12 years, baby.

209
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:58,229
- I think that I can handle it.
- Really?

210
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:00,238
- Yeah.
- Okay.

211
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,033
I hate your mom.

212
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,471
Well, guess what?

213
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:06,909
I hate you!

214
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:14,085
- Two-minute warning for meatloaf!
- Meatloaf?

215
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,653
Tyler no likey!

216
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,694
Grant, we have been over this
a million times!

217
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:24,230
- You are not getting a catchphrase!
- But it's funny.

218
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,729
Grant, I am not afraid to recast.

219
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:31,396
Now go memorize your lines
for the big dinner scene.

220
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,199
Wait. So you wrote the dinner
we're about to have?

221
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,901
Yeah, yeah. Just a short script.

222
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,137
Just things that will make
my mom happy to hear.

223
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:40,313
What kind of things?

224
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:44,783
And I really thought
Barney had forgotten our anniversary.

225
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:49,151
So I storm out to the backyard,
and there's smoke coming out of my ears.

226
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:52,316
Nostrils flaring. Her nostrils flare
when she gets mad. I love it.

227
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,120
Doing it right now. Doing it right now!

228
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:58,324
- You better stop, mister!
- Okay, okay.

229
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:00,730
Sorry, sorry, boo bear. Continue.

230
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,268
This is what you're actually like
in a relationship.

231
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,200
So I storm out to the backyard and...

232
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:11,009
Candles everywhere and a string quartet.

233
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,775
- Can you believe that?
- No, not even slightly.

234
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,617
What about my little Ty-Ty?
What have you been up to?

235
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:19,979
Funny story,

236
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:23,455
just the other night,
this little rascal had a nightmare.

237
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:25,219
And when he came in
to tell us what it was about...

238
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:27,055
Do you remember what you said, champ?

239
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:29,563
Uh...

240
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:32,966
Page four.

241
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:40,229
The dinosaur bones in the museum
came to life and started chasing me?

242
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:43,606
All right, thanks a lot, buddy.
I didn't need to sleep tonight.

243
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:47,146
No. Tyler said, "My nightmare was

244
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:50,046
"that you and Mommy didn't know
how much I loved you.

245
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:55,019
"So I wanted to come in
and tell you it was this much. "

246
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:58,684
- Aw! That's so sweet.
- We're a sweet, happy family.

247
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,761
Okay, I'm gonna grab some ice cream
from the freezer downstairs

248
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:03,728
and then we'll all hit
the sundae bar in the kitchen.

249
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:11,628
Wow. Not a weak link in that scene. Bravo.

250
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,833
Back off, Barney.
You have no idea how hard it is

251
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:17,173
to do a job that's beneath you.

252
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,805
Grant, I really enjoyed your thing
about the dinosaur bones.

253
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:24,009
Can we please stop talking
about the dinosaur bones?

254
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:27,947
- Just go eat your sundae.
- I can't.

255
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,316
I'm lactose intolerant.

256
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,827
Well, guess who's not
lactose intolerant? Tyler.

257
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,958
Tyler is gonna go in there
and enjoy every last bite.

258
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,331
- Ice cream time, gang.
- Yummers!

259
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,898
Oh, my God!

260
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,400
Tyler no likey.

261
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,737
You're not getting a catchphrase.

262
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
- I don't understand.
- I do.

263
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,217
Follow my lead.

264
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:10,321
I've been betrayed by my best friend.

265
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,366
How could you do this, Ted?

266
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,630
Think about poor Tyler,
bravely trying to hold back tears.

267
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:21,272
It's okay, son, you can cry.

268
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,236
Cry!

269
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,911
I don't want my mommy
and daddy to get divorced!

270
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,779
Wow!

271
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,286
What could you possibly have
to say for yourself?

272
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,530
Acting rule number one,

273
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,325
don't be afraid to improvise.

274
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,865
Was it me who betrayed you,

275
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,994
or you who betrayed me?

276
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,066
I'm sorry. What?

277
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:53,872
Acting rule number five,

278
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:56,911
invent a rich back-story
for your character.

279
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,772
November 14th, 1998.

280
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:03,780
The overnight train to Monte Carlo.

281
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,949
I was in the billiards car,

282
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,251
hustling some Algerians
out of a few thousand dinar,

283
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,126
when you seduced my fiancée,

284
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,259
who is blind and thought you were me.

285
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:19,460
Yes.

286
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:22,527
What in God's name
are you talking about?

287
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,671
Acting rule number eight,

288
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:26,571
don't be afraid to get physical.

289
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,111
Ow!

290
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:31,042
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

291
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,478
No, I don't!

292
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:37,984
Yes, you do! And, by God,
I'll hear you say it, scoundrel!

293
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:42,322
- Mom, can you give us a sec?
- Okay.

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,154
- There's chocolate and butterscotch.
- Okay, thanks. Now just...

295
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,959
There are various kinds
of sprinkles and marshmallows.

296
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,033
Just...

297
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,595
Have you lost your mind?

298
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,538
You were amazing!

299
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,269
You completely just became
that character.

300
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,277
Honestly, I wasn't so much playing Ted

301
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,075
as I was just trying
to get out of Ted's way.

302
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,805
What is wrong with you people?

303
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,646
Ted, how am I ever gonna
explain this to my mother?

304
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:11,415
Well, maybe it's time to tell her
the truth, Barney.

305
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:14,616
I don't know, Lily.
Sometimes, honesty leads people

306
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:18,456
to say mean things about a woman
who always took special care of me

307
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,553
because I was the runt of the family.

308
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,965
For crying out loud, I'm only 6'4"!

309
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:28,494
How good was my crying?

310
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:30,369
You nailed it. See?

311
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:33,841
Even at a gig you hate,
you still managed to love what you do.

312
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,207
Maybe that's how it will be
for you at your new job.

313
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,045
- You think so?
- I know so.

314
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,911
Thanks, Grant.

315
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,685
You're pretty smart, you know that?

316
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,984
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Sorry! Sorry!

317
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,062
Thought I was picking up on something.

318
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,230
Honey, are you okay?

319
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,896
Look, Mom,
there's something I have to tell you.

320
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,599
Something I should have told you
a long time ago.

321
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,408
Tyler is dying.

322
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:14,279
And Betty said that when he goes,
she's gonna off herself.

323
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,414
So that's all probably
gonna go down pretty soon.

324
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:19,012
Oh, my God!

325
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,692
Okay, no. No! None of that is true!

326
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,728
The truth is, I...

327
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:34,032
The truth is Betty and Tyler are actors
that I hired to pretend to be my family.

328
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:35,664
What?

329
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,669
I just wanted you to think I had the life

330
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:41,940
you wanted for me.
I wanted you to be proud of me.

331
00:17:42,748 --> 00:17:45,376
I know it sounds crazy,
and I am so sorry, Mom.

332
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:49,318
- So Betty is not your wife?
- No.

333
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,889
Thank God! I do not like that woman.

334
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,623
- Really?
- Yes.

335
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:58,787
And Tyler...

336
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,762
I know I'm his grandma
and I'm supposed to love him,

337
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,928
but I hate that kid. "Tyler no likey. "

338
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,664
- What the hell is that?
- Right?

339
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:12,006
And those fake friends of yours out there,
I just wanted to shoot myself.

340
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,104
I know! Aren't they horrible?

341
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,182
So really, really, you're not mad?

342
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:22,379
No, I'm just confused. I don't know
why you thought you had to do this.

343
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:25,653
Barney, I love you,
perfect family or no perfect family.

344
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,555
I love you no matter what.

345
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,225
- Really?
- Really.

346
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:38,336
Oh, I am so relieved

347
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:41,838
because the truth is
I am as far from married

348
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:43,932
as a human being can possibly be.

349
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:47,308
My history with women
would shock and appall you.

350
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,074
Doesn't matter. I still love you.

351
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:52,049
Seriously, you can't imagine
the things I have done.

352
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:54,745
Barney, when you were three,
I left you with a babysitter

353
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,414
and spent three weeks
with Grand Funk Railroad,

354
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,957
being passed around like a bong.

355
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,253
Mommy!

356
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:05,992
Just do me a favor.
If you ever do meet someone special,

357
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,566
don't run away from it. Don't be me.

358
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,901
Take a shot at it, will you?

359
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:13,964
Hey, Barney, cab's here.

360
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,705
I'll try.

361
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:23,510
<i>And so ended one of
the strangest afternoons of our lives.</i>

362
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:26,915
And I just wanted to say to you,

363
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,117
if I ever seemed cold
or unwelcoming, I'm sorry.

364
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,654
- Who's she talking to?
- My mom.

365
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,254
It would mean a lot to me
if you and I could be closer.

366
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,667
Now take a deep breath like
this next thing is gonna be hard to say.

367
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,764
I love you.

368
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,600
I love you...

369
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,672
- Mom.
- Yes.

370
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,305
...Mom.

371
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,239
Now pretend I said something nice.

372
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,409
Now pretend I said something nice.

373
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,452
I mean,

374
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:03,819
that's very nice of you to say, Judy.

375
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,950
Okay. You, too. Speak soon.

376
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,836
Let me get this straight.
You're really telling me

377
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,907
<i>that when you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

378
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,704
- you don't root for Daniel-san?
- Nope.

379
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:27,113
<i>- Who do you root for in Die Hard?
- Hans Gruber,</i>

380
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:31,313
charming international bandit.
At the end, he died hard.

381
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,181
He's the title character.

382
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:36,455
<i>Okay, The Breakfast Club.</i>

383
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,289
The teacher running detention.

384
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,259
He's the only guy
in the whole movie wearing a suit.

385
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,524
<i>I got one. Terminator.</i>

386
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:47,229
What's the name of the movie, Robin?

387
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:50,599
Who among us didn't shed a tear

388
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:53,139
when his little red eye
went out at the end

389
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,732
and he didn't get to kill those people?

390
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,108
I'm sorry. That movie...

391
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,882
I am never watching a movie
with you ever again.

392
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,583
They didn't even
try to help him!
