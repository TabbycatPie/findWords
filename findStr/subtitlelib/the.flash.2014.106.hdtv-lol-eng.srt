1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:05,637
- MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN,
AND I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,373
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
I SAW MY MOTHER

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:09,141
KILLED BY SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,777
- RUN, BARRY, RUN!

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,778
- MY FATHER WENT TO PRISON
FOR HER MURDER.

6
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,681
THEN AN ACCIDENT
MADE ME THE IMPOSSIBLE.

7
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:19,484
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, I'M
AN ORDINARY FORENSIC SCIENTIST,

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,521
BUT SECRETLY I USE MY SPEED

9
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:24,157
TO FIGHT CRIME
AND FIND OTHERS LIKE ME,

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,692
AND ONE DAY I'LL FIND
WHO KILLED MY MOTHER...

11
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,128
- MOM!
- AND GET JUSTICE FOR MY FATHER.

12
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,097
I AM THE FLASH.

13
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,301
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i> THE FLASH...</i>

14
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,669
- IRIS WEST.

15
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,537
I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN
WRITING ABOUT ME.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,372
- I'VE BEEN
COLLECTING INTERNET POSTS

17
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,542
ABOUT THE STREAK SIGHTINGS.
- BABY, THERE'S NO STREAK.

18
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,544
- I SAW HIM, BARRY.
HE WEARS A RED SUIT.

19
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:48,414
- I FINALLY DIAGNOSED WHY IRIS
IS WRITING ABOUT THE STREAK.

20
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:49,816
SHE'S DOING IT FOR ME.

21
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,217
- I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHO REALLY KILLED LAURA,

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,352
AND I'M GOING
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

23
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,155
- WHOEVER THIS STREAK IS,

24
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,292
I AM NOT STOPPING UNTIL THE REST
OF THE WORLD BELIEVES IN HIM.

25
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,796
- MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
SEE EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE.

26
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,868
- TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU,

27
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,870
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FIRST.

28
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,606
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE
IN THE IMPOSSIBLE.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,841
CAN YOU DO THAT?

30
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,477
GOOD, BECAUSE ALL OF US,

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,779
WE HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHAT MIRACLES LOOK LIKE.

32
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,715
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T MADE
MUCH OF AN APPEARANCE LATELY.

33
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,317
OUR LIVES HAVE BECOME ORDINARY,

34
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,620
BUT THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE
WHO IS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY.

35
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,456
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

36
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,724
I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME,

37
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,725
BUT I HAVE SEEN
YOU DO THE IMPOSSIBLE

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,727
TO PROTECT THE CITY I LOVE.

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,164
SO FOR THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE
IN YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

40
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,633
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

41
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,840
HMM.

42
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,444
[exhales]

43
00:01:56,248 --> 00:02:00,219
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

44
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,486
- HOW DID YOU--

45
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,923
I LITERALLY JUST HIT SEND.
- SPEED READING.

46
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:08,627
- IT'S CRAZY
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO YOUR VOICE.

47
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,695
- YOU NEED TO STOP
WRITING YOUR BLOG.

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,498
- PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU EXIST.

49
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,801
[phone ringing]

50
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,307
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

51
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,510
- THIS IS NOT AN INTERVIEW.
- COME ON.

52
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,245
YOU GOT TO GIVE ME SOMETHING.

53
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,413
HOBBIES, PET PEEVES,
FAVORITE COLOR?

54
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:29,549
WAIT, SCRATCH THAT LAST ONE.

55
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,516
RED, DUH, OBVIOUSLY.

56
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,486
- YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME.
- MY HEARING IS FINE.

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,688
IT'S JUST SELECTIVE.

58
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,658
WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?

59
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,394
- ANYTHING BUT THE STREAK.

60
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:44,396
- FINE. SUGGESTIONS?

61
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,665
- YOU SAID YOU WERE WRITING
ABOUT ME TO BRING HOPE

62
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,834
TO SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT.

63
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:53,705
HOW WOULD HE FEEL IF DOING
THAT PUT YOU IN HARM'S WAY?

64
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,641
- HE AND I AREN'T EXACTLY
ON THE SAME PAGE THESE DAYS.

65
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,844
BESIDES, YOU'RE GIVING HOPE
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE,

66
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,314
SO I'M DOING THIS FOR THEM.

67
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,551
[sirens blaring]

68
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,319
- TO BE CONTINUED.

69
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,590
GOTTA RUN.
- HEY!

70
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,824
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME UP...

71
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,460
HERE.

72
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:17,963
WHOA.

73
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,967
- WHOO-HOO-HOO!

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,074
Hier könnte deine Werbung stehen!
Kontaktiere noch heute www.OpenSubtitles.org

75
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,486
- WHAT KIND OF A TOOL
STEALS A YELLOW HUMVEE?

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,456
- WHAT KIND OF TOOL
BUYS A YELLOW HUMVEE?

77
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,959
GET THESE PEOPLE BACK.
- I NEED EVERYBODY BACK!

78
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,431
- SON!
OUT OF THE WAY!

79
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:55,300
OUT OF THE WAY!

80
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,875
[gunshots]

81
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:08,980
[metal impact]

82
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,483
- WHAT THE HELL?

83
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,650
- [roars]

84
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,954
- EDDIE!
EDDIE!

85
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,391
- YEAH!

86
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:29,901
- STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE!

87
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,536
- IF YOU SAY SO.

88
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,911
- UH-OH.

89
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,052
[metal impact, bones cracking]

90
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,354
[groans]

91
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,959
[metallic impact]

92
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:58,497
UNH!

93
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,706
- LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE BORN
TO TAKE A BEATING.

94
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:16,816
- CHECK THE MATH.

95
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:18,616
YOUR DISPERSAL MODELS
DON'T CORRELATE.

96
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,685
- UH, THEY DO IF YOU FACTOR
IN THE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS

97
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:21,820
IN REPRODUCTION CYCLES.

98
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,421
- WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DEBATING?

99
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:24,689
- THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF BUGS

100
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:26,459
BARRY SWALLOWS
IN A DAY OF RUNNING.

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,595
- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
YOU ACCEPT YOUR NOBEL.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,836
- BARRY?

103
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,106
- BARRY?
ARE YOU OKAY?

104
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,041
[gasps]

105
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:44,909
13 FRACTURES.

106
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:47,445
THAT'S A NEW RECORD,
AND THAT'S JUST IN YOUR HAND.

107
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,914
YOU ALSO HAVE A CONCUSSION,
THREE CRACKED RIBS,

108
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,983
AND A BRUISED SPLEEN.

109
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,754
EVEN WITH YOUR POWERS,
YOU'LL NEED A FEW HOURS TO HEAL.

110
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,990
- WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU HIT?

111
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,492
- A MAN.

112
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:02,794
A BIG, BAD MAN.

113
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:05,497
HIS SKIN CHANGED WHEN I HIT HIM.

114
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,665
LIKE, IT TURNED TO METAL.

115
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,168
- INTERESTING.

116
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,637
A MAN OF STEEL.

117
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,806
- SO YOU WENT AFTER
A META-HUMAN ALONE?

118
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,440
DUDE, WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US?

119
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,976
- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS.

120
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,012
BESIDES, I WAS OFF-DUTY.

121
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:23,581
- HMM.

122
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,484
- YOU'RE LUCKY
HE DIDN'T KNOCK OUT YOUR TEETH.

123
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,485
THOSE PUPPIES
DON'T GROW BACK.

124
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,923
- THE STRANGE THING IS
I FEEL LIKE I KNEW HIM.

125
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:32,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

126
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,829
- HE SAID SOMETHING
THAT WAS FAMILIAR,

127
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,631
BUT HE'S GONNA HURT SOMEONE
IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.

128
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:40,565
SO HOW DO I FIGHT A GUY
THAT'S MADE OF STEEL?

129
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:41,933
- WE WILL FIND A WAY.

130
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,502
TONIGHT, YOU HEAL.

131
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,506
- YEAH.

132
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,181
- THERE WAS LIGHTNING
IN MY HOUSE.

133
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,115
YELLOW AND RED LIGHTNING.

134
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:01,052
THERE WAS A MAN IN YELLOW,
THEN I WAS ON THE STREET.

135
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,055
I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT THERE.

136
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:06,792
PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO
BELIEVE ME!

137
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,627
- HEY.

138
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,995
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
LAST NIGHT?

139
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,665
- GOT BEAT UP
BY A STEEL-PLATED SOCIOPATH.

140
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:15,867
GOOD TIMES.

141
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,204
- SO HE IS A META-HUMAN?
- YEAH.

142
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,941
- THAT PARTICLE ACCELERATOR'S
THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING.

143
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,175
YOU OKAY?

144
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,944
- RELATIVELY.

145
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,644
ANY IDEA WHO HE IS?

146
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,980
- EDDIE'S TAKING POINT
WHILE I RUN DOWN A LEAD.

147
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,583
I NEED YOU TO WORK WITH HIM
UNTIL I GET BACK.

148
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:31,850
- WAIT, WHY ME?

149
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,153
- BECAUSE HE SAW SOMETHING
IMPOSSIBLE

150
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:37,956
THAT HE'S GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT,
QUESTIONS THAT I CAN'T ANSWER.

151
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,225
- IN OTHER WORDS,
MAKE UP SOME SCIENCE-Y STUFF

152
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,694
TO THROW HIM OFF?

153
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,562
- EXACTLY.

154
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,264
- [scoffs]

155
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,735
- HE STOLE THE HUMVEE
AND EVADED CAPTURE.

156
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,604
SO PLEASED YOU COULD JOIN US,
MR. ALLEN.

157
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,705
ROUGH NIGHT?

158
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,108
- UH, JUST A LITTLE BEAT, SIR.

159
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,910
- AS I WAS SAYING,

160
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:01,246
OUR PERP YANKED THREE ATMs
AFTER HE BOOSTED THE VEHICLE.

161
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,581
ATM SECURITY CAMERAS
CAUGHT HIM ON VIDEO.

162
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,084
WE GOT A HIT IN THE DATABASE.

163
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,986
TONY WOODWARD.

164
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,754
HE'S GOT A HISTORY
OF VIOLENCE, PETTY THEFT,

165
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:11,055
ASSAULT, GOING WAY BACK
TO JUVIE.

166
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,992
DROPPED OFF THE RADAR
TEN MONTHS AGO.

167
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,793
LOOKS LIKE HE'S BACK.
[school bell ringing]

168
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:18,129
- INCREASED PRESSURE
PRODUCES INCREASED HEAT,

169
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,533
AND IF YOU DON'T RELEASE IT,
YOU GET COMBUSTION.

170
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,834
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
REMEMBER ALL THIS STUFF, BARRY.

171
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,737
- BECAUSE HE'S A LITTLE FREAK,
JUST LIKE HIS OLD MAN.

172
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,573
- DON'T TALK ABOUT MY DAD.

173
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:28,606
- OR WHAT?

174
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,311
IS HE GONNA MURDER ME, TOO?

175
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:36,182
LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE BORN
TO TAKE A BEATING, ALLEN.

176
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,287
- ALLEN.

177
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,656
HEY, ALLEN.
- HEY.

178
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:44,789
- YOU OKAY?

179
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,292
- HEY, YEAH.
SORRY, EDDIE.

180
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,694
- LISTEN,
I SAW SOMETHING LAST NIGHT

181
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,096
I JUST CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND.

182
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,664
- UH-HUH.

183
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,899
- I FIRED A DOZEN ROUNDS
AT OUR CAR THIEF,

184
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:58,303
AND IT WAS
LIKE THEY SPARKED OFF OF HIM.

185
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,306
- HUH, WELL, I MEAN,

186
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,310
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
WEARING SOME KIND OF BODY ARMOR.

187
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,977
- ON HIS FACE?

188
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,182
- UM--
- HEY.

189
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,951
BARRY.

190
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,252
HI, BABE, I SAW THE NEWS.

191
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,187
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE,

192
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,122
WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW
IF YOU CHECKED YOUR MESSAGES.

193
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:18,156
I TRIED YOU THREE TIMES.

194
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,258
- SORRY.

195
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,761
I HAD TO WORK LATE.

196
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,929
UM, SO I HEARD
THAT THE STREAK SAVED A KID.

197
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,698
ANY COMMENT, DETECTIVE?

198
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,067
- ALL I KNOW IS OUR PERP
GOT AWAY,

199
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,235
BUT BARRY HERE IS GONNA
HELP ME FIND HIM.

200
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,837
- YEAH.
- FINE.

201
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,639
I HAVE OTHER SOURCES.

202
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,875
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

203
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:39,278
BYE.
- BYE.

204
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,947
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU TWO?

205
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,716
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
NOTHING, IT'S FINE.
IT'S--SORRY, IT'S FINE.

207
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,687
I DON'T KNOW.

208
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,724
- OKAY.

209
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,999
[elevator dings]

210
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,900
- DR. WELLS.

211
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,968
- I GUESS YOU HEARD ABOUT
BARRY'S INCIDENT LAST NIGHT.

212
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:06,004
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HIM
I THINK HE'S AT THE STATION.

213
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,972
- I ACTUALLY CAME HERE
TO SEE YOU.

214
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:11,309
I NEED YOUR HELP
SOLVING AN OLD CASE OF MINE.

215
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:12,877
- WHAT CASE IS THAT?

216
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,147
- THE MURDER
OF BARRY'S MOTHER.

217
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,958
- YOUR CHILDHOOD NEMESIS IS NOW
AN UNSTOPPABLE META-HUMAN.

218
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,993
THAT IS SERIOUSLY MESSED UP.

219
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,996
- I HAD A CHILDHOOD NEMESIS.

220
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:32,865
LEXI LA ROCHE.

221
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,133
SHE USED TO PUT GUM
IN MY HAIR.

222
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,401
- JAKE PUCKETT.

223
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,135
IF I DIDN'T LET HIM
COPY MY HOMEWORK

224
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,138
HE'D GIVE ME A SWIRLY.

225
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,140
- NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED
THAT WE'RE ALL UBER-NERDS,

226
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,707
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT TONY?

227
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,375
- GLAD YOU ASKED.

228
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,245
WE'RE GONNA TRAIN YOU, MAN.

229
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,148
<i> KARATE KID</i> STYLE.

230
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,917
BEHOLD!

231
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:54,986
I CALL HIM GIRDER.

232
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,355
- FOR THE RECORD,
NOT MY IDEA.

233
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,158
- FIGHTING IS PHYSICS.

234
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,026
IT'S NOT ABOUT STRENGTH.
IT'S NOT ABOUT SIZE.

235
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:03,161
IT'S ABOUT ENERGY AND POWER.

236
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,897
CHANNEL YOUR SPEED THE RIGHT WAY

237
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,065
AND YOU CAN TOTALLY TAKE
THIS BAD BOY DOWN.

238
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,671
NOW OBVIOUSLY YOUR GIRDER
IS A MOVING TARGET.

239
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,008
SO--

240
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:22,014
- I HAVE ICE
AND BANDAGES STANDING BY.

241
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:36,795
- [groans]

242
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,298
I'M PRETTY SURE
I JUST DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER.

243
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,066
[groans]

244
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,468
- OKAY, NOT GONNA LIE.

245
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,937
THIS IS GONNA BE QUICK
BUT EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

246
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,907
[phone ringing]

247
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,910
- OH, SPEAKING OF PAIN.
EDDIE, HEY.

248
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,511
- ALLEN, WE FOUND THE STOLEN
HUMVEE IN THE ALLEY

249
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:54,979
AT FREMONT AND LAWRENCE.

250
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:56,081
NEED YOU DOWN HERE
TO DO YOUR THING.

251
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,249
- GREAT.

252
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:00,319
I'LL SEE YOU IN A SEC.
OKAY.

253
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,889
OKAY.
LET'S DO THIS.

254
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:08,894
- SO BARRY, WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE OFF-DUTY LAST NIGHT,

255
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,230
YOU WEREN'T
VISITING IRIS AGAIN.

256
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,365
YOU KNOW, IN DISGUISE?

257
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:17,369
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE RECKLESS
AND A LITTLE CREEPY.

258
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,537
- NO.

259
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,905
- GOOD.

260
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,073
[joint pops]
- [screams]

261
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,310
- ALLEN, YOU REALLY NEED A CAR.

262
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,379
- I USUALLY
MANAGE ON FOOT OKAY.

263
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,882
WHAT DO WE GOT?

264
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,516
- THE RIG TONY WOODWARD
BOOSTED LAST NIGHT.

265
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,251
NO SIGN OF THE STOLEN ATMs.

266
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,286
PROBABLY GOT
THOSE WHERE HE'S HOLED UP,

267
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,390
THOUGH HE'S GONNA HAVE ONE HELL
OF A TIME BREAKING 'EM OPEN.

268
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,894
- I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

269
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,363
- SO, ABOUT YOU AND IRIS--

270
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,865
- LOOK, EDDIE, WE HAD A FIGHT,

271
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,500
AND I JUST DON'T REALLY
FEEL COMFORTABLE

272
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,169
TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOU.

273
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:55,006
- I GET THAT, AND I GET THAT
YOU TWO GO WAY BACK.

274
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,043
TO BE HONEST, I WAS A LITTLE
THREATENED BY YOU AT FIRST.

275
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:59,311
- YOU WERE THREATENED BY ME?

276
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,913
- SURE.

277
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,315
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN
HOW CLOSE YOU TWO ARE,

278
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,982
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE A GOOD GUY,

279
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:08,187
AND IRIS, I JUST
WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

280
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,490
FROM MY EXPERIENCE,
GOOD FRIENDS ARE HARD TO FIND.

281
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,959
- DETECTIVE.
EXCUSE ME.

282
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,062
SIR, WE RAN THE PLATES
ON THAT HUMVEE--

283
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,298
- COME ON, BARRY!
YOU CAN DO IT!

284
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,899
- BARR, FOCUS!

285
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,568
- I AM!

286
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,169
- SON, SON, SON.

287
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:27,438
YOU'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED.

288
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,607
YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS.

289
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,243
IRIS, COME HERE, SWEETIE.

290
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,179
- YOU WANT ME TO HIT A GIRL?

291
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,581
- HE WANTS YOU TO TRY.

292
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,182
- RELAX, BARRY.

293
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,317
I'VE HAD HER IN GLOVES
SINCE SHE WAS SIX.

294
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,820
SHE'S TOUGHER THAN SHE LOOKS.

295
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:53,197
- SORRY, BARRY.

296
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,033
- SON...

297
00:13:56,067 --> 00:14:00,239
SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY TO
WIN A FIGHT IS NOT TO START ONE,

298
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,875
BUT IF YOU DO
COME UP AGAINST SOMEBODY

299
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,509
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T BEAT, BE SMART.

300
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,445
IT'S OKAY TO RUN
THE OTHER WAY.

301
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,079
ALL RIGHT?

302
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,349
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

303
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:14,518
- JUDGING BY THE MUD AND KEGS
I'D SAY HE GOT HAMMERED,

304
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,120
STOLE A BIG-ASS TRUCK,

305
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,489
AND WENT JOYRIDING.

306
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,258
I BET THE KEGS ARE STOLEN, TOO.

307
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,493
RUSTY IRON ALE, IT'S A MICRO
BREWED RIGHT OVER IN--

308
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,094
- KEYSTONE, I KNOW THE PLACE.

309
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,232
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
- YEAH.

310
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,914
- BARRY DESCRIBED A TORNADO
OF RED AND YELLOW LIGHTNING

311
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,417
INSIDE A MAN IN YELLOW.

312
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,052
THEN, BAM.

313
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,519
HE'S BLOCKS AWAY ON THE STREET.

314
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,254
DOESN'T KNOW HOW HE GOT THERE.

315
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:51,956
WHEN I ARRIVED,
THE PLACE WAS A WRECK.

316
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,158
- NORA ALLEN IS DEAD.

317
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,660
- SINGLE STAB WOUND
TO THE HEART.

318
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,627
HENRY ALLEN
COVERED IN HER BLOOD.

319
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,963
- AND DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE
THAT HENRY ALLEN IS GUILTY,

320
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:03,467
NOW YOU BELIEVE THIS--WHAT,
MAN IN YELLOW IS RESPONSIBLE?

321
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,069
- LAST NIGHT, I SAW BARRY

322
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,138
RESCUE A YOUNG BOY
FROM BEING RUN OVER,

323
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,408
AND IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE WHAT
BARRY DESCRIBED HAPPENED TO HIM.

324
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,210
IT GOT ME THINKING,

325
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:16,682
WHAT IF SOMEBODY WITH BARRY'S
ABILITIES KILLED NORA?

326
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,550
- THERE'S ONE FLAW WITH
YOUR THEORY THOUGH, DETECTIVE,

327
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:22,420
AND IS THAT ALL OF THIS
HAPPENED 14 YEARS AGO,

328
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,721
WHICH IS LONG BEFORE--

329
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,356
- YOUR MACHINE GAVE BARRY
HIS POWERS.

330
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,024
- AN ACCIDENT GAVE BARRY
HIS POWERS.

331
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,561
- DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE

332
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,197
THAT SOMEBODY
WITH BARRY'S SUPER-SPEED

333
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,231
COULD HAVE EXISTED
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION?

334
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,336
- DETECTIVE, I DEAL
IN PROBABILITIES AS A SCIENTIST,

335
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,705
AND IN THIS CASE...

336
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,674
IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

337
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,584
- GENTLEMEN, CCPD.

338
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,086
ANY CHANCE
SOME OF YOUR MERCHANDISE

339
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,120
WAS STOLEN LAST NIGHT?

340
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,456
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

341
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,593
- HOW ABOUT THIS GUY?
YOU SEEN HIM?

342
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,163
- YOU KNOW TONY, DON'T YOU?

343
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:11,370
- HEY.

344
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,005
ALLEN, COME ON!

345
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,222
ALLEN, YOU OKAY?

346
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,256
- OH, NEVER BETTER.
- GET UP.

347
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,625
- I DIDN'T DO NOTHING, MAN!

348
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,159
- SO WHY'D YOU RUN?

349
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,562
- LOOK, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!
- WHAT WAS?

350
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:40,032
- TONY FALLING, OKAY?

351
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,768
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,
WE DIDN'T KILL HIM!

352
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,302
- KEEP TALKING.

353
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,172
- ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO,
KEYSTONE IRONWORKS.

354
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,240
BOSS IS HANDING OUT PINK SLIPS.

355
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,110
TONY GETS HIS,
AND HE JUST SNAPPED.

356
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,178
HE STARTED BEATING THE CRAP
OUT OF THE GUY.

357
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,149
WE PULLED HIM OFF,
AND THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.

358
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,651
SOME KIND OF POWER SURGE.
AND THEN TONY

359
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,254
WENT OVER THE RAILING RIGHT
INTO A VAT OF MOLTEN SCRAP.

360
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,689
JUST GONE.

361
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,525
- LUCKY FOR YOU
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

362
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,727
- WHAT?

363
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,528
- HOW'D YOU GET IN FRONT OF US?

364
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,530
- SHORTCUT.

365
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,736
- ♪ WHEN I WAS JUST A BOY,
MY MAMA...♪

366
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,373
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU,
WHERE'S YOUR SHADOW?

367
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,673
- WHAT SHADOW?

368
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,544
- BARRY.
HE HASN'T BEEN IN ALL WEEK.

369
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,511
- GETTING HIS FIX
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

370
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,247
- TOO BAD.

371
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,250
HE'S CUTE, I KIND OF MISS
HAVING HIM AROUND.

372
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:37,723
- IRIS?
LONG TIME NO SEE.

373
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:49,733
- I GOT TO SAY,
IRIS, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

374
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,202
- THANKS, TONY.

375
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,305
UM, YOU TOO.

376
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,638
- OH, YEAH.
I KEEP IN SHAPE.

377
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:56,575
I GOT A GYM AT MY PLACE.

378
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,576
BEEN LIVING OUT IN KEYSTONE
ON THE WEST SIDE,

379
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,213
AND YOU SHOULD, UH--
YOU SHOULD STOP BY SOMETIME.

380
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,182
- SO, UH,
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

381
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:06,717
- NO, I CAME TO SEE YOU.

382
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,252
- HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

383
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,888
- I'VE BEEN READING UP
ON THE STREAK.

384
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,856
FOUND YOUR LITTLE BLOG.

385
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,192
WHY ARE YOU WRITING
ABOUT THIS GUY?

386
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,794
- PEOPLE SAY THAT HE'S A HERO.

387
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,196
- I SAY HE'S A COWARD,

388
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,798
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT HE
TOOK A BEATING LAST NIGHT

389
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:24,503
AND RAN OFF LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.
YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT THAT.

390
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:28,173
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

391
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,541
WHO LEATHER BOY IS?

392
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,776
- NO CLUE.

393
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,778
SO, UM,
IF YOU DON'T WANT A DRINK

394
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,413
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO WORK.

395
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:38,884
- ACTUALLY I'D PREFER TO BUY YOU
A DRINK.

396
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,519
WHAT TIME YOU OFF?
- THANKS, TONY,

397
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,622
BUT I DON'T THINK
MY BOYFRIEND WOULD APPROVE.

398
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,891
HE'S A COP, LIKE MY DAD.

399
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:48,492
- I NEVER REALLY DID LIKE COPS
TOO MUCH.

400
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,662
- IRIS!

401
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:57,234
- WELL HE'S PICKING ME UP
FOR THE POLICEMAN'S BALL.

402
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:58,769
WALL-TO-WALL COPS.
CAN'T SWING A CAT.

403
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,906
I SHOULD PROBABLY CALL
HIM TO SEE WHERE HE IS--

404
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,409
- GIVE ME THE PHONE, IRIS.
NOW!

405
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:16,754
I'M SORRY.
UH, FOR THE DAMAGE.

406
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,791
WE'LL PICK THIS UP
SOME OTHER TIME.

407
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:23,862
- [breathes heavily]

408
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,836
- BARRY!
CHECK IT OUT!

409
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,338
THE GRAVEL
YOU PULLED FROM TONY'S RIDE?

410
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,374
IT CONTAINS 76.8% HEMATITE.

411
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,577
CONSISTENT WITH THE MINES
AT KEYSTONE IRONWORKS.

412
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,846
- WHICH CLOSED
DOWN TEN MONTHS AGO.

413
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,447
IT'S THE PERFECT HIDEOUT.

414
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,617
- BARRY, DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS?

415
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,954
"I HAVE INFO ABOUT SOMEONE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

416
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,355
"HE WAS HERE.

417
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:54,358
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME."

418
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:57,663
NOW WHO COULD SHE BE
TALKING TO?

419
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:11,976
- I GUESS YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

420
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,311
- ARE YOU OKAY?

421
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,847
- COP'S DAUGHTER.
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

422
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,650
- NOT WITH THIS GUY.

423
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,019
- I KNEW HIM WHEN WE WERE KIDS.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ME.

424
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,721
HE WANTED TO IMPRESS ME,

425
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:25,456
BUT HE IS FIXATED ON YOU,
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

426
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,025
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT?

427
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:29,493
- HE SAID HE HAD A PLACE
OUT IN WEST KEYSTONE.

428
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:32,764
BRAGGED ABOUT HOW BIG IT WAS,
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE.

429
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,834
- I DO.
- WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

430
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,034
HIS HAND.

431
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:41,439
IT TRANSFORMED
LIKE AN IRON FIST.

432
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,607
HE'S LIKE YOU, ISN'T HE?

433
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:47,612
- YES, AND WRITING ABOUT ME
IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO YOU.

434
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:48,913
- I KNOW,
BUT MAYBE I COULD TALK--

435
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,349
- NO!
HE'S TOO DANGEROUS.

436
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,619
[knocking on glass]

437
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,587
- DAMN, THAT'S MY RIDE.

438
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,623
EDDIE INSISTED ON A DETAIL.
[whoosh]

439
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,726
I HAVE TO...GO.

440
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:07,265
- BARRY, TALK TO US.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

441
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,436
- DUDE, DON'T RUN ANGRY.

442
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,539
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DEFEAT HIM YET.

443
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:54,445
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE PLACE.

444
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,586
- YOU'RE TRESPASSING, FREAK!

445
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:05,723
THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN.

446
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:14,832
- BARRY?
- BARRY, WHERE ARE YOU?

447
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,567
CAITLIN, OVER HERE!

448
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,704
- BARRY?
PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING!

449
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:23,775
SAY SOMETHING
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

450
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:27,846
- OW.
- GET HIM OUT OF THERE!

451
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,012
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

452
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,715
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

453
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,917
I TOLD YOU
THAT WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY

454
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,451
TO DEAL WITH HIM.
- I'LL HEAL.

455
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:35,886
- YOU CAN'T HEAL
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.

456
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,122
HE COULD HAVE KILLED YOU.

457
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:39,723
- I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW!

458
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,126
IN THE PAST 36 HOURS
I'VE HAD MY ASS

459
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,996
HANDED TO ME TWICE BY THE GUY
THAT TORTURED ME AS A KID.

460
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,965
I COULDN'T STOP HIM THEN,
AND I CAN'T STOP HIM NOW!

461
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,602
EVEN WITH MY POWERS
I'M STILL POWERLESS AGAINST HIM.

462
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:52,770
- NOT NECESSARILY.

463
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,038
CISCO?

464
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,839
ANY MATERIAL,

465
00:22:55,873 --> 00:23:00,010
IF STRUCK AT A HIGH ENOUGH
VELOCITY CAN BE COMPROMISED.

466
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:03,114
- WE RAN AN ANALYSIS ON
THE METAL IN TONY'S FOOTPRINT.

467
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,582
BASED ON ITS DENSITY
AND ATOMIC STRUCTURE,

468
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:08,552
IF YOU IMPACT IT
AT JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE,

469
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:13,024
AT JUST THE RIGHT SPEED, YOU
COULD DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

470
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,793
- HOW FAST WOULD I HAVE TO GO?

471
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,627
- FACTORING IN THE METAL'S
TENSILE STRENGTH,

472
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,498
ESTIMATED DERMAL THICKNESS,
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, AIR TEMP,

473
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,168
YOU'D HAVE TO HIT HIM
AT APPROXIMATELY...

474
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,637
MACH 1.1.

475
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,707
- YOU WANT BARRY TO HIT
SOMETHING AT 800 MILES AN HOUR?

476
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,576
- 837, ACTUALLY.

477
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,777
- THAT'S FASTER THAN THE SPEED
OF SOUND.

478
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,045
- I KNOW.

479
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,914
HE WOULD CREATE A SONIC BOOM,

480
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,851
WHICH, AS I'VE SAID BEFORE,
WOULD BE AWESOME.

481
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,519
- I'VE NEVER GONE THAT FAST.

482
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:43,120
- YET.

483
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:46,089
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY
ENTERTAINING THIS IDEA.

484
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:49,059
I MEAN, HE'D NEED
A STRAIGHT SHOT FROM MILES AWAY

485
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:51,796
- YEAH, 5.3 MILES,
THEORETICALLY.

486
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:56,567
- DO IT RIGHT,
YOU'LL TAKE HIM DOWN.

487
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,503
- DO IT WRONG,

488
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:02,673
YOU'LL SHATTER EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY.

489
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:08,712
- BARRY.

490
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:09,881
- JOE, I'VE BEEN
BEATEN UP ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

491
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,982
I GOTTA--
- HEY, WAIT.

492
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,919
AN ANONYMOUS TIP LED US
TO TONY WOODWARD'S HIDEOUT.

493
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:16,721
THE PLACE WAS TRASHED.
WHAT HAPPENED?

494
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,722
- HE SHOWS UP AT JITTERS
TO SEE IRIS.

495
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,557
I HAD TO GO AFTER HIM.
- IRIS, WHERE IS SHE?

496
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,825
- SHE'S FINE, SHE'S FINE.

497
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,028
EDDIE PUT A DETAIL
ON HER TO BE SAFE.

498
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,096
I THOUGHT I COULD
HANDLE HIM THIS TIME.

499
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,699
I TRIED.

500
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:30,134
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT THIS PUNK
PUT YOU THROUGH,

501
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:34,105
BUT YOU CAN'T LET EMOTION
CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.

502
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:36,240
- THE TOLLBOOTH CAMERA
GOT A SHOT OF WOODWARD.

503
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:37,975
STOLEN CAR HEADED OUT OF TOWN.

504
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,577
STATE POLICE ARE TAKING OVER.

505
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,580
WE LOST HIM.
- DON'T WORRY, EDDIE.

506
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:43,780
THEY'LL GET HIM.

507
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:44,983
- I WANTED
TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

508
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,252
- NOT HALF AS MUCH AS I DID.

509
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,987
- LET'S GO, ALLEN.

510
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,020
- GO WHERE?

511
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,089
- BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

512
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,591
I NEED TO HIT SOMETHING.
- WHAT?

513
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:54,992
- I DON'T THINK HE MEANT
HIT YOU.

514
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,229
GO.

515
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:09,139
- SO I HEARD YOU AND THIS
WOODWARD GUY HAVE A HISTORY.

516
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,741
HEY, ALLEN.

517
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,544
IT'S OKAY.
TRUST ME.

518
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,711
I HAD MY FAIR SHARE OF BULLIES
AT SCHOOL.

519
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,980
- YEAH, SOMEHOW I FIND
THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

520
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:21,285
- I WAS SHORT, FAT,
AND THE SON OF A POLITICIAN

521
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:23,253
WHO CLOSED THE FACTORY
IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT,

522
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:26,892
SO NOT SO POPULAR.

523
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:31,628
- SO WHAT'D YOU DO ABOUT IT?

524
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:33,698
- I GOT MY ASS KICKED.

525
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,903
A LOT, UNTIL MY GYM COACH
TOOK PITY ON ME.

526
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,638
SHE SAID THE KEY
TO FIGHTING IS PATIENCE.

527
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:43,641
HERE.

528
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:47,077
A LOT OF GUYS WASTE ENERGY
TRYING TO LAND THE MOST PUNCHES.

529
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:51,215
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE,
BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE IT COUNT.

530
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:54,586
CHOOSE YOUR SPOT
AND DRIVE THROUGH IT,

531
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:57,955
LIKE IT'S SIX INCHES
BEHIND THE TARGET.

532
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,097
HARDER.

533
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:14,038
HARDER!

534
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,876
[coughs]

535
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,215
- THE SEAM
WAS STARTING TO SPLIT.

536
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:25,683
[chuckles]

537
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,687
- APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN.

538
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,223
- HMM, WELL THESE DAYS
IT'S RARE TO FIND SOMEONE

539
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:36,394
HAPPY TO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

540
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:41,031
- WELL, OUR CONVERSATION
YESTERDAY GOT ME THINKING.

541
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,835
YOU SAID, AS A SCIENTIST,
YOU LOOK FOR THE PROBABLE?

542
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,102
- THAT'S RIGHT.

543
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,372
- AND WE BOTH RECENTLY
HAVE SEEN THINGS

544
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:50,708
THAT HAVE REDEFINED
WHAT IS POSSIBLE.

545
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,876
- YES, WE HAVE,
AND WE BOTH KNOW

546
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,012
THE DIRECT CAUSE
OF THOSE THINGS.

547
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,846
- YOUR ACCELERATOR EXPLOSION.

548
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,850
- EVOLUTIONARY LEAPS FOLLOW THE
CREATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

549
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,018
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

550
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,354
- LIKE THE ROOMBA.
[laughs]

551
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:08,058
- YES, LIKE THE ROOMBA.

552
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:11,229
- SO HUMOR ME HERE.

553
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:12,929
- HMM?

554
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:17,668
- IF WE KNOW THAT META-HUMANS
WERE CREATED

555
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,371
BY THE PARTICLE ACCELERATOR
AND TESTIMONY SHOWS

556
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:23,074
THAT A META-HUMAN MAY HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER

557
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:27,912
OF BARRY ALLEN'S MOTHER 14 YEARS
AGO, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT...

558
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:31,081
WAY BACK THEN
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN

559
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:36,086
ANOTHER
PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

560
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,456
- ANOTHER PARTICLE ACCELERATOR?
- HMM.

561
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,160
- I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY, DETECTIVE,

562
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:45,762
AND IF THEY WERE I DON'T RECALL
ANY DARK MATTER LIGHTNING STORMS

563
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,298
BEFORE I MOVED TO TOWN.

564
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,300
DO YOU?

565
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:55,807
- NO, NO, I DON'T.

566
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,343
WHEN DID YOU MOVE TO TOWN,
DR. WELLS?

567
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:10,855
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER

568
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,355
TO THAT QUESTION, DETECTIVE.

569
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:17,828
THIS WHOLE "HELP ME SOLVE
THE MURDER OF NORA ALLEN,"

570
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,364
YOU WERE NEVER
LOOKING FOR MY HELP, WERE YOU?

571
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:24,935
- YOU OPENED YOUR LAB A MONTH
AFTER NORA ALLEN'S MURDER.

572
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,738
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

573
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,274
IN CENTRAL CITY BEFORE THAT?

574
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,212
- I WAS STARTING OVER.

575
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,417
- STARTING WHAT OVER?

576
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,987
- HERE I THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST TWO GUYS

577
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,123
HAVING A FRIENDLY DRINK.

578
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,490
YOU WANT ANSWERS, DETECTIVE?

579
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:48,492
TESS MORGAN, LOOK HER UP.

580
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,866
- [exhales]

581
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,440
- UNIT 52, THIS IS DISPATCH.

582
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:04,908
REQUESTING STATUS UPDATE
ON THE WEST HOUSE.

583
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,745
- UNH!

584
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,758
- HEY, IRIS.

585
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:30,433
- NICE, ALLEN.
- YEAH.

586
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,069
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

587
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,504
- HEY, NEXT TIME
WORK ON YOUR SPEED.

588
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:36,874
- YEAH, I'LL DO MY BEST.

589
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:39,143
- THAWNE, ALLEN.

590
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,244
THE UNIT WATCHING JOE'S
DAUGHTER, THEY'VE BEEN ATTACKED.

591
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,980
IRIS IS MISSING.

592
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:48,552
- GO, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL CALL JOE.

593
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,889
- LET'S ADJUST THE IMPACT ANGLE
BY .2 DEGREES,

594
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,225
UP THE SPEED TO 838.

595
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:58,296
BAM.

596
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:01,031
OUCH.
- OUCH?

597
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,066
- GUYS, YOU THERE?

598
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:03,466
- YEAH, MAN, WHAT'S UP?

599
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,169
- TONY TOOK IRIS.

600
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,503
I NEED YOU TO DO WHATEVER YOU
CAN TO HELP ME FIND HER.

601
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,206
ALL RIGHT?
SATELLITES, SECURITY CAMERAS.

602
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,174
HACK 'EM ALL.
- WE'RE ON IT.

603
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:16,280
- WHAT'S WRONG?

604
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,122
- REMEMBER THIS PLACE, IRIS?

605
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:27,458
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE,
TONY?

606
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,460
YOU FINALLY GONNA
GO FOR THAT G.E.D?

607
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,194
- YOU WANT A PLAN?
HOW'S THIS?

608
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,462
YOU USED TO WRITE
ABOUT THE STREAK, RIGHT?

609
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,332
NOW YOU'RE GONNA WRITE
ABOUT ME.

610
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,334
- YOU JUST ABDUCTED ME, TONY.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

611
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:39,569
- BECAUSE THE STREAK IS DEAD.

612
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,205
- NO.

613
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:43,975
- SQUASHED LIKE A LITTLE BUG
BY ME.

614
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,476
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT
THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

615
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,044
YOU'RE GONNA
TELL THE WHOLE WORLD

616
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:49,946
THAT THERE'S A NEW BIG MAN
ON CAMPUS!

617
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,450
AND I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

618
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:53,951
- YOU COULD HAVE
ANYBODY WRITE ABOUT YOU, TONY.

619
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:55,653
WHY ME?

620
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:59,189
- 'CAUSE I LIKE YOU, IRIS.
ALWAYS HAVE.

621
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,997
- YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID
SOMETHING.

622
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,231
[fire alarm blaring]

623
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:10,368
- YOU TRY ANYTHING
LIKE THAT AGAIN

624
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:14,438
AND I'M GONNA LEAVE
MORE THAN A BRUISE!

625
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,507
- EDDIE, ANYTHING YET?

626
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,509
- WE HAVE ROADBLOCKS
ON EVERY MAJOR ARTERY.

627
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,176
UNITS ARE SEARCHING.

628
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,614
- WE WILL FIND IRIS, JOE.

629
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,553
- YOU DON'T THINK
HE'LL HURT HER, DO YOU?

630
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:33,156
- SIR, SIR, WE GOT A FIRE ALARM
CALL AT CARMICHAEL ELEMENTARY.

631
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,393
- DISPATCH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
WE'LL SEND BACKUP WHEN WE CAN.

632
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:36,961
- THAT'S THE SCHOOL
YOU AND IRIS WENT TO.

633
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:40,430
- AND TONY.
- GO.

634
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,139
- TONY, TURN YOURSELF
IN BEFORE THINGS GET WORSE.

635
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,539
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

636
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,275
- YEAH, IT IS.

637
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,411
COPS ARE ALREADY LOOKING FOR ME,

638
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:56,113
SO GET READY TO COVER
THE SHOWDOWN OF A LIFETIME

639
00:31:56,145 --> 00:32:00,283
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING OUT
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

640
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:03,487
- GOOD,
'CAUSE YOU JUST FOUND ONE.

641
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,655
- YOU JUST WON'T STAY DEAD.

642
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:08,192
COME TO SAVE
YOUR LITTLE FAN GIRL?

643
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,093
- THIS IS BETWEEN US.

644
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:13,630
LET HER GO.

645
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,500
- OH, I COULD,
BUT I'D RATHER MAKE HER WATCH

646
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:21,338
WHILE I BREAK EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY.

647
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:32,317
- WAIT HERE.
- OKAY.

648
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:41,591
- TOO SLOW, TIN MAN.

649
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,595
- AAH!
- I'VE KNOWN GUYS LIKE YOU.

650
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,629
PEAKED IN HIGH SCHOOL.
NEVER GOT OVER IT.

651
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:49,200
ALL THESE POWERS,
AND LOOK AT YOU!

00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:52,502
BULLY THEN, BULLY NOW.

653
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:12,757
- HE'S HURT.
- NO!

654
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,768
- IF YOU DO COME UP
AGAINST SOMEBODY YOU KNOW YOU

655
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,101
CAN'T BEAT, BE SMART.

656
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:28,405
IT'S OKAY TO RUN THE OTHER WAY.

657
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:38,215
- THERE GOES YOUR HERO.

658
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,253
- HE MADE IT OUT.

659
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:47,290
BARELY.

660
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,396
- WHY DID HE STOP?

661
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,798
- HE'S MILES AWAY.

662
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:59,737
5.3 MILES AWAY.

663
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,746

- NO WAY.

664
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:11,347
HE'S GONNA DO IT!

- NICE CROSS.

- YEAH, I THINK I BROKE MY HAND.
- OH, ME TOO.

675
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,509
- HEY!
WHAT IS THIS?

676
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,244
WHERE THE HELL AM I?

677

- SOMEWHERE YOU'LL NEVER
HURT ANYONE EVER AGAIN.

678
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:19,516
- WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

679
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:25,722
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

680
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:27,223
- ALLEN?

681

- THE THING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU, TONY,

682
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,229
IT HAPPENED TO ME TOO,

683
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:34,164
BUT IT DIDN'T JUST
GIVE US ABILITIES.

684
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:37,167
IT MADE US MORE OF WHO WE ARE.

685
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,235
YOU GOT STRONG.

686
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,571
I GOT FAST.

687
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:45,242
FAST ENOUGH TO BEAT YOU.

688
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:49,813
YOU USED YOUR GIFT
TO HURT PEOPLE.

689
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,248
NOT ANYMORE.

690
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:53,851
- ALLEN.

691
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,385
