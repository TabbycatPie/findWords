7
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,130
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,330
That woman running around

9
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,380
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

10
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,910
Sure it was. Who else would it be?

11
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,060
That's why I'm talking to you.

12
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,710
Who are we running from?

13
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,030
His name is Ra's Al Ghul,

14
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,100
and he's marked me

15
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,830
and my family for death.

16
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,740
I heard a rumor you were leaving town.

17
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,850
Happy to say that those rumors were false.

20
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,280
Ra's is going to come for me,

21
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,520
and he will learn the truth about Sara.

22
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,670
Then he will come for Thea.

23
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,040
That's why I have to kill him.

24
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,220
You couldn't before.

25
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,140
This time, I will have you to train me.

26
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,990
Dinah Laurel Lance...

27
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,270
Selfish bitch.

28
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,920
You're not a hero.

29
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,780
You're a liar.

30
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,310
A fraud.

31
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,670
And an addict.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,620
Sara...

33
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,130
Sara, please, please.

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,390
I'm your sister.

35
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,040
Then why are you trying to take my place?

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,520
What the hell do you think you're doing?

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,350
Your job, apparently.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,460
I told you that I didn't want you out here.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,670
And I told you that it wasn't your call to make!

41
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,490
Will you think for a second about what it would do

42
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,130
to your father if something happened to you?

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,450
What you're doing is selfish.

44
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,540
Fighting for your city isn't selfish.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,870
It's what a hero would do.

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,570
You're not a hero.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,580
Maybe it's best if we stay out of each other's way.

48
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,900
How did it go out there?

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,970
We ran into Laurel.

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,860
Again.

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,830
Diggle, how could you sign off on her doing this?

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,590
Oliver, you might not notice,

53
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,950
but she's not exactly lobbying for anyone's permission.

54
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,060
She has yours.

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,060
Well, not at first,

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,710
but she can definitely hold her own out there.

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,080
You have a visitor.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,070
Or as I like to call him, your new BFF.

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,510
I see things are still running smoothly down here.

60
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,490
What do you want?

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,730
It's been weeks since your return.

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,370
I thought it past time we spoke.

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,050
Nanda Parbat is remote,

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,440
but I wouldn't delude yourself into thinking

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,230
that Ra's Al Ghul missed your televised return

66
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,420
to Starling City.

67
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,540
Your point, Malcolm?

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,170
We can't merely wait for Ra's to mobilize his forces.

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,800
It's time to bring Thea into the fold.

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
She's not ready to know my secret.

71
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,280
I disagree.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,610
But in any case,

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,190
if we have to protect Thea

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,160
and to defeat the League,

75
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,430
the three of us need to join forces.

76
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,700
But I don't see how we can do that

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,730
if she is still to believe that her brother

78
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,200
is a reformed playboy and failed businessman.

79
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,130
Oliver, I told you before,

80
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,390
if Thea finds out you've been lying to her all this time,

81
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,250
you will lose her...forever.

82
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,530
How's Tatsu?

83
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,360
She'll be better when we're far away from here.

84
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,850
Your bow. If you want anything else,

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,660
take it quickly. We're leaving in five minutes.

86
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,710
We're not coming back.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,420
We can't just run.

88
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,010
Waller knows I tried to steal the virus

89
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,390
to get Tatsu back. Even if she didn't,

90
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,160
Chien Na Wei knows where we live.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,700
We have to go.

92
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,320
Look, Maseo, we--

93
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,410
You stay, Waller will torture you to find us.

94
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,110
Contact your family, contact the press.

95
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,520
Once the world knows Oliver Queen is still alive,

96
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,130
it will limit A.R.G.U.S.'s options,

97
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,840
make it more difficult for Waller to assassinate you.

98
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,290
Well, that's reassuring.

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,870
What are you going to do?

100
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,130
I'm going to take Akio and Tatsu

101
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,250
on the ferry to Shanghai.

102
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,840
And from there, we will disappear.

103
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,350
You saved us.

104
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,580
Now save yourself.

105
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,990
Reaction to sentencing, Mr. Zytle?

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,190
The Roman governor Porcius Festus maintained

107
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,820
that the accused

108
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,310
has the right to face their accuser.

109
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,190
Now, where is my accuser?

110
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,300
I speak, of course, of the Arrow.

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,750
Excuse me, Mr. Zytle has no further comments.

112
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,800
A.D.A. Laurel Lance. Take him to the van. Thank you.

113
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,300
Stay back!

114
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,730
Alderman, stay back!

115
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,460
Where's Zytle?

116
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,120
So you still haven't told me...

117
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
what did you think of my set last night?

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,380
Because fangirls on Vine called it "Epically epic".

119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
More like epically profitable.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,150
It's kind of hot when you talk business in numbers.

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,020
Chase. God, if you ever really want to kiss me again,

122
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,100
you're going to have to work on your game.

123
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,960
Later, Princess.

124
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,370
Ollie.

125
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,750
Hey, Speedy.

126
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,580
I'm so happy you're home.

127
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,210
What?

128
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,210
I have to show you something.

129
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,570
Where are we going?

130
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,690
Basement.

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,940
I thought that you said that it was flooded.

132
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,950
I lied.

133
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,280
Ollie...

134
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,510
What's going on? You're kind of...

135
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,430
kind of making me nervous.

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,430
I know that this isn't going to mean much.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,250
I've given you no reason to believe me when I say it.

138
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,820
But I lied all of this time

139
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,650
to protect you.

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,340
You're...

141
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,140
you're him.

142
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah.

143
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,380
That night with the... the hoods, and...

144
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,570
that woman in black, that...

145
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,800
Was Ra's al Ghul's daughter.

146
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,830
That was you.

147
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,810
All those times I got so mad at you

148
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,070
for being... a flake,

149
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,900
or telling me something I knew

150
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,260
that had to be a lie.

151
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,330
You were saving someone's life.

152
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,670
Thank you.

153
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,480
Thank you, Ollie.

154
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,650
Thank you.

155
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,330
You know how many times I've wished

156
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,430
that I could thank the Arrow for things he's done for the city?

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
Probably as many times as

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,330
I've wished we could have this conversation.

159
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,890
Did mom know?

160
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
The night that she died,

161
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,240
she told me that... she'd known for a while.

162
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,850
I was worried that you'd be angry.

163
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
Only 'cause you broke my window.

164
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,050
Although I did kind of kick your ass.

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,250
You didn't.

166
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,500
But you did have a good teacher.

167
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,250
You were looking for Malcolm that night.

168
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,640
We know about each other.

169
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,030
Wait, Malcolm knows that you're the Arrow?

170
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,350
I am amazed that he didn't tell you.

171
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,190
Then why did you... tell me?

172
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,330
Why now?

173
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,080
Because Ra's Al Ghul is coming for us.

174
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,500
All of us. And the only chance

175
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
that we have to survive

176
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,790
is to work together.

177
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,350
To trust each other.

178
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,510
He's right.

179
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,830
No.

180
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,840
No, no, he's not.

181
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,210
I turned my back on everyone I know,

182
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,800
including my own brother,

183
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,530
because you told me there was nobody else I could trust.

184
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,450
I was only trying to protect you.

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,870
Yeah, by driving a wedge between me and Ollie?

186
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,710
You manipulated me.

187
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,510
- Thea... - Let her go.

188
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,740
Yeah?

189
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
You've reached Moira Queen.

190
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,300
Please leave a message.

191
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,200
Mom, it's me. I'm alive.

192
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm, uh, I'm in Hong Kong.

193
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,180
I know it sounds crazy, but I'm alive,

194
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,990
I'm in Hong Kong, and I need your help.

195
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,620
I want you to call Ned Foster,

196
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,080
you tell him to issue a press release.

197
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,660
Tell everyone.

198
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,140
And you tell Thea.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,940
I'm coming home. I love you...

200
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,300
What do we know?

201
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,170
Apparently the Federal Marshal guarding Werner Zytle

203
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,170
just started shooting while Zytle waltzed off in the panic.

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
This is my favorite part.

206
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,920
That's pretty convenient.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,490
Guy decides to wig out, and Zytle takes advantage.

208
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,800
It's not convenient, it's planned.

209
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,110
Those are the affects of his vertigo.

210
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,870
Zytle was in a full set of restraints.

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,060
How did he even manage to dose a federal agent?

212
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,460
He didn't. One of the reporters did.

213
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,910
What's wrong? Was my form off?

214
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,370
She's right. About the reporter.

215
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,450
- We need a name-- - A name and address on our clumsy reporter.

216
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,570
I'm on it.

217
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,070
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,410
- I'm coming with you. - No, you're not.

219
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,860
I just gave you your only lead!

220
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,240
Can I talk to you for a second? Alone?

221
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,570
I know what you're going to say,

222
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,290
but I risked my life for this city while you were gone.

223
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,620
That should earn me some respect.

224
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,840
This isn't about respect,

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,880
and it's not about you risking your life.

226
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,530
I understand that you miss Sara.

227
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,690
And I understand that when you go out there like this,

228
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,770
all of that pain goes away.

229
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,810
It's the only time it ever does.

230
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,710
And that relief isn't real.

231
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,030
It's a drug.

232
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,610
If you're implying...

233
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,670
You are an addict.

234
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,730
And just like with booze and pills,

235
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,370
that high that you're chasing every night

236
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,570
is endangering your life.

237
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,730
Go to hell, Oliver.

238
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,170
You don't get to play that card with me.

239
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,370
Ever.

240
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,950
And if there is anyone who is using adrenaline

241
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,820
to hide the pain of real feelings and real life,

242
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
it's you.

243
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,380
Oliver, Felicity tracked down the reporter's work address.

244
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,050
Anthony Walker! Where's Werner Zytle?

245
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,080
He's not, he's not here.

246
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,490
You helped him escape today!

247
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,540
Zytle, he threatened my wife.

248
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,670
Said he could get to her, that he'd kill her

249
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,660
if I didn't do this, then--

250
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,690
Do what?

251
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,470
Kill you.

252
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,850
- I'm so sorry. - Anthony...

253
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,140
Give me the detonator.

254
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,970
He'll kill my wife.

255
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,640
We can protect her.

256
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,450
I promise.

257
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,290
Now hand me the detonator.

258
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,680
God forgive me.

259
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,260
I will weep for thee.

261
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,650
Ollie?

262
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,170
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

263
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,370
Can't sleep.

264
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,900
Apparently insomnia is a common side effect

265
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,100
of finding out your brother is a vigilante.

266
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,050
You smell like smoke.

267
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,960
Korean barbecue?

268
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,610
C4.

269
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,540
It's nice that we can tell each other this stuff now.

270
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,210
It is, actually.

271
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,450
You always had the lamest excuses.

272
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,040
Lame excuses are sort of an occupational hazard.

273
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,670
What was tonight's hazard?

274
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,160
Roy and I were looking for the man

275
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,580
that escaped from the courthouse earlier today.

276
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,290
Found a bomb instead.

277
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,400
Yeah, I don't know how you do it.

278
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,070
Just risk your life out there for people every night.

279
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,900
It's my job.

280
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,070
It is my job to keep the people of this city safe.

281
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,100
And that includes you, too, Speedy.

282
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,740
Listen to me.

283
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,180
I'm always going to hate Malcolm Merlyn.

284
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,900
But right now, he is a necessary evil.

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,140
We can take care of ourselves--

286
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,390
Not against Ra's Al Ghul.

287
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,510
You have to trust me on this.

288
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,720
I do.

289
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,350
But I don't trust him.

290
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,390
I can't.

291
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,550
And I won't.

292
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,900
Ten minutes.

293
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,830
I'm impressed.

294
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,520
I know special forces who can't last longer than three.

295
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,380
Eventually, though,

296
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,680
everybody breaks.

297
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,470
Tell me where the Yamashiros are, and it will stop.

298
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,660
My family's going to be looking for me.

299
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,940
Everyone is going to be looking for me!

300
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,170
Because your mother issued a press release?

301
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,470
We erased your message before she could hear a word of it.

302
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,960
Be glad.

303
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,590
If she had heard it, your mother would be dead right now.

304
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
You would never risk the exposure.

305
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,790
You're right.

306
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,580
Your mother's too public a figure.

307
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,740
But your sister, on the other hand.

308
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,700
What's her name? Thea?

309
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,050
Did you know she's developed something

310
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,080
of a substance abuse problem since you've been gone?

311
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,760
I guess the strain of losing two family members

312
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,910
must have been too much for her to bear.

313
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,200
One day, someone may just find her in the back of a car,

314
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,380
dead with a needle in her arm.

315
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,870
Poor Speedy.

316
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,490
You stay away from my sister.

317
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,740
I will, if you answer one question.

318
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,070
Where are the Yamashiros?

319
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,790
The ferry to Shanghai.

320
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,820
Knock knock.

321
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,980
You know, half the department

322
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,310
is still talking about the way you clocked that marshal.

323
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,870
Those boxing lessons look like they're paying off.

324
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah, I guess so. Are those the cargo manifests

325
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,490
- for the whole city? - Yeah, yeah.

326
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,550
Although, you know, I got to ask, what do you need these for?

327
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,930
Just a RICO case that I'm second chairing.

328
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,900
Right.

329
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,770
- Dad? - Yeah, sorry. I just...

330
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,340
Have you heard from Sara lately?

331
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,940
No. Why?

332
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,760
I ran into her a few weeks back.

333
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,410
And something just felt a little... off.

334
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,020
Then I ran into that friend of hers.

335
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,490
You know, the one with the, the boy hair?

336
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,300
Sin.

337
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,810
Yeah, Sin, that's it.

338
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,030
She said something strange.

339
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,130
She said that the woman in black isn't Sara.

340
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,680
That doesn't make any sense.

341
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,600
No.

342
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,580
I mean, look, I just want to talk to her,

343
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,170
you know, Sara or not.

344
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,450
But look, don't worry, I said I'd start taking it easy,

345
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,410
I meant it.

346
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,580
I'll get out of your hair.

348
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,110
Now I've been wondering,

349
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,890
how do you decide between the red hoodie

350
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,470
and the one with the mask?

351
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm glad you know.

352
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,270
I feel pretty lame

353
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,570
for not recognizing my own brother

354
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,170
just because he's wearing a hood.

355
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,670
I can't believe you knew before I did.

356
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,610
He saved my life, Thea.

357
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,700
He saved a lot of people's lives.

358
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,750
He thinks we need Merlyn's help.

359
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,330
And what do you think?

360
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,270
I think I want to get as far away

361
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,580
from Malcolm Merlyn as I possibly can.

362
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,010
Well, there's your answer right there.

363
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,530
Sorry.

364
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,990
May I borrow him for a second?

365
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,270
Apparently, he's been more yours than mine lately, so...

366
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,040
What happened?

367
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,800
One of our trackers sent a signal from the Starling City Docks.

368
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Except we don't have any tracking devices in the field.

369
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,930
Unless we do.

370
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,910
It's Laurel.

371
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,730
You tagged Laurel with a tracer?

372
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,210
If she's going to be reckless, I need to know what she's doing.

373
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,370
Well, she's definitely doing something.

374
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,210
I'm just not exactly sure how reckless it is.

375
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,340
I ran the manifests on all

376
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,400
these shipping containers that you see here.

377
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,770
One of these leads back to Zytle's old supplier.

378
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,790
Looks like Vertigo's back in business.

379
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,390
She's going to get herself killed.

380
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,420
Suit up.

381
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,960
Wonderful seeing you again.

382
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,850
Ooh, I fancy the new outfit.

383
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,990
Feeling my Vertigo, dear.

384
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Wonderful.

385
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,510
Dinah Laurel Lance.

386
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,870
Selfish bitch.

387
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,380
You're not a hero.

388
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,530
You're a liar.

389
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,530
A fraud.

390
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,870
And an addict.

391
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,290
Sara...

392
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,170
Sara, please, please.

393
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,210
I'm your sister.

394
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,070
Then why are you trying to take my place?

395
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,820
Get away from her!

396
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,630
You should be dead!

397
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,650
I salute your persistence!

398
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,530
Help me!

399
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,790
Help!

400
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,650
Help me, please.

401
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,800
Need an IV.

402
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,070
- Watch her. - You're going to be OK.

403
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,060
It's going to be OK.

404
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,250
Why did I have to die?

405
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,040
Sara?

406
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,650
If you wanted to be me, you could have.

407
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,090
I didn't have to die.

408
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,310
I am so sorry! I am so sorry!

409
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,150
Sara! I am so--

410
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,060
Ollie?

411
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,170
I'm-- I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk.

412
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,960
You need to go back upstairs.

413
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,440
Now!

414
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,620
Don't talk to her like that. You brought her in;

415
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,090
you don't have the right to kick her out.

416
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm not. I'm protecting her.

417
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,940
By telling her what to do?

418
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,630
Work with Malcolm Merlyn, let him get his hooks deeper--

419
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,910
Enough. She's my sister.

420
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,580
She makes her own choices, Oliver!

421
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,020
It's OK. I-- we can talk later.

422
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,770
I just-- just, is Laurel OK?

423
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,870
Is she a part of this, too?

424
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,320
She's going to be fine.

425
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,500
I promise. Just...

426
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,400
please go back upstairs.

427
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,400
What the hell was that?

428
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,100
You think you're the only person who can stand up to Thea?

429
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,430
I'm trying to figure out why you're standing up to me!

430
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,070
All right, maybe we just need to throttle back.

431
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,940
No. We need this. Oliver, you were gone.

432
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,680
Dead. At least we thought you were,

433
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,410
and we had to go on with our lives.

434
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,870
And doing that meant not doing things your way.

435
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,780
Fine! I'm back now.

436
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,080
That doesn't mean that we can go back.

437
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,510
And you do not have the right to come back here

438
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,430
and question everyone's choices.

439
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,030
Just let me know if there's any change in her condition.

440
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,130
Hey, how's it going?

441
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,680
What's that for?

442
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,680
My life has been really complicated lately,

443
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,540
so I-- I just need something simple.

444
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,420
So...

445
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,900
This seat taken?

446
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,730
It's a free country.

447
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,580
Apparently.

448
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,630
The first time that we went after Zytle,

449
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,890
I told you that this was my crusade.

450
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,070
Doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

451
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,250
You're right. It isn't.

452
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,850
Diggle, I get that I was gone for--

453
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,540
No, you weren't gone-- you were dead.

454
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,410
And all of us, including me,

455
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,450
we were ready to hang it up.

456
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,380
Why didn't you?

457
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,790
Because I realized we weren't just fighting for you;

458
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,280
we were fighting for ourselves, too.

459
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,310
And that includes Roy.

460
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,770
And, yes, that includes Laurel.

461
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,990
She's not a soldier.

462
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,690
Neither were you.

463
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,980
That's not the same thing, and you know that.

464
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,100
What I know, Oliver, is that you started something.

465
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,570
Something strong enough to live on past you.

466
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,590
The question is,

467
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,530
can you live with what it's become?

468
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,250
Oliver.

469
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,880
Are you all right?

470
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,890
I told them you were on the ferry.

471
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,070
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,340
They tortured you.

473
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,510
I sold you out.

474
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,850
No, you didn't.

475
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,450
Because we were never going to Shanghai.

476
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,810
I lied.

477
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
A precaution just in case you were captured.

478
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,520
Then how'd they find you?

479
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,420
They didn't. When I found out you'd been taken,

480
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,350
I came back.

481
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,400
You're an idiot.

482
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,630
Maybe.

483
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,260
But I will not let you face Waller alone for my actions.

484
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,450
So now we're both going to get tortured, or worse.

485
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,670
Great plan.

486
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,480
I must speak with Agent Waller.

487
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,030
Hey! Why did you--

488
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,710
How are you feeling?

489
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,510
When Zytle hit me with Vertigo, I...

490
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,500
I saw Sara.

491
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,450
She was alive.

492
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,880
And she was calling me a fraud.

493
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,100
I was crazy to think that I was fit to wear Sara's jacket.

494
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,930
Much less follow in her footsteps.

495
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,920
You're right.

496
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,900
I hope I'm not out of line here,

497
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,330
but...

498
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,600
I think Sara wore her mask just as much to hide her demons

499
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
as she did to help people.

500
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,430
And I don't see that with you.

501
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,580
You have a light inside of you that Sara never had.

502
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,430
So...

503
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,020
Maybe you should stop trying to be Sara...

504
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,510
and just be yourself.

505
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,480
Thank you.

506
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,500
What's that?

507
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,290
One of the chemical drums Zytle stole tonight just sent out a GPS signal.

508
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,150
Why?

509
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,610
Cause he just opened it.

510
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,130
I dig your place.

511
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,590
I'm sorry I interrupted the tour.

512
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,470
Pretty sure you saw everything you needed to.

513
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,590
You want a drink?

514
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,820
Sure.

515
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,370
This was nice.

516
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,440
I almost took it personally when you said I was simple.

517
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,710
Well, I never said that you were simple.

518
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,850
What?

519
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,990
Nothing. It...

520
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,120
It's just something my father once said.

521
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,300
We were sitting in this little taberna in Corto Maltese,

522
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,390
drinking this amazing Carmnre,

523
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,310
and he said that for centuries,

524
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,190
noblemen have been using the rich aroma of red wine

525
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,500
to cover up a very different scent.

526
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,760
Cyanide.

527
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,660
Tell me who you are and what the hell you think you're doing here!

528
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,970
Serving my master, Ra's Al Ghul.

529
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,130
Please!

530
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,510
Don't struggle. I can do this so you won't feel a thing.

531
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,050
Get away from her.

532
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,920
If you beg forgiveness for trying to harm my daughter,

533
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,310
I'll grant you a quick death.

534
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,140
I'd never give you the satisfaction, Al Sa-Her.

535
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,940
You're unarmed and you have nowhere to run.

536
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,280
But there's some place I can go where you won't dare to follow.

537
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,710
Daggett Pharmaceuticals. 5th and Kingsley.

538
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,990
Looks like Zytle found a place to change those chemicals

539
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,360
into some new Vertigo... and he's got hostages.

540
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,080
Where's Roy?

541
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,050
I can't reach him.

542
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,360
Laurel.

543
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,530
Oliver.

544
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,550
There isn't anything that you can say to me

545
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,700
that I don't already know.

546
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,580
Actually, there is.

547
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,440
I must once again thank you

548
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,110
for letting us use your laboratory this evening.

549
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,880
And my sincerest apologies to your colleague here.

550
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,850
But mistakes will not be tolerated.

551
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,870
Werner Zytle...

552
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,430
This ends now.

553
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,550
As you wish!

554
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,740
May I suggest a grand finale--

555
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,380
chlorine triflouride.

556
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,450
Oliver, I'm registering an enormous spike in thermal activity.

557
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,810
Oliver, the whole place is going to blow.

558
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,400
You have to get out of there!

559
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,680
Not yet.

560
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,210
Go! Run! Now!

561
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,690
Please! Help!

562
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm surprised.

563
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,150
Usually women don't return

564
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,260
for a second go.

565
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,870
Hi, sis.

566
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,880
You're not her. You're...

567
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,710
You're not real.

568
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,720
Oh, I'm quite real.

569
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,430
You lied to me, Laurel!

570
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,780
Straight to my face, my own daughter!

571
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,140
Sara was my daughter, I deserved to know! I had a right!

572
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,900
To grieve, to mourn!

573
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,680
Who do you think you are to take that away from me?

574
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,740
Who do you think you are?!

575
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,970
I'm--I'm sorry!

576
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,170
I know you are.

577
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,610
She says she's sorry, but she'll do it again.

578
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,890
You keep my own daughter's death a secret

579
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,780
because you think I'm too weak for the truth?!

580
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,540
You think you can wear my mask?

581
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,700
You think you can be me?!

582
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,500
No.

583
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,320
And I'm done trying to be.

584
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,750
Oliver, are you there?

585
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,030
It's over.

586
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,780
No, it's not. You have to get home.

587
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,910
It's Thea.

588
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,910
See? All good.

589
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,370
Is everything ok?

590
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,670
Oh, yeah, just the usual insurance policy

591
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,180
search and seizure.

592
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,240
Seems like I'm a high risk case.

593
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,710
I wonder what gave them that idea.

594
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,650
What's a matter? You OK?

595
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,940
There's...

596
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,610
There's something that I have to tell you.

597
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,740
And I didn't tell you--

598
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,120
I didn't tell you before,

599
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,760
because I was worried about your health.

600
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,970
But... I realize that...

601
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,050
that you deserve to know.

602
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,170
I already know it.

603
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,840
Sara's off God knows where, and yet there's another blonde

604
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,510
in a mask running around tuning up the bad guys,

605
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,480
and it's you, isn't it?

606
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,750
Sweetheart, come on.

607
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,450
It's all right. It's OK.

608
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,650
It's OK, honey.

609
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,430
I mean, look, I am pissed as hell.

610
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,730
But, you know, we'll figure it out. We figure out everything.

611
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,040
No. No, no, daddy, that--

612
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,950
that isn't what I was going to tell you.

613
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,290
What I was going to tell you

614
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,660
is about Sara.

615
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,480
No.

616
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,160
Dad...

617
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,780
No.

618
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,770
- No. - Dad...

619
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,390
Daddy, I'm sorry.

620
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,920
Not my baby, not again.

621
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,710
Oh, God.

622
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,500
Thea?

623
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,550
It's OK. You're OK.

624
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,970
I thought that I was stronger.

625
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,400
I thought that I could keep myself safe.

626
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,500
Who was he?

627
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,340
One of Ra's agents.

628
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,070
Roy...

629
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,100
could you give us a minute?

630
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,610
Really hope you're not expecting a thank you.

631
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,590
No parent needs gratitude for saving their child.

632
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,790
I didn't ask to be a part of this.

633
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,800
I didn't ask for any of this.

634
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,720
Maybe you're right.

635
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,710
Maybe we can't do this without him.

636
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,260
But I am never going to forget the things you've done.

637
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,260
Or the person that you are.

638
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Understood.

639
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,470
But before we can begin,

640
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,460
there's something that only the two of you can do.

641
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,940
Ra's Al Ghul preys upon the fears of his enemies.

642
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,210
Conquer your own fear,

643
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,730
and you eliminate that critical advantage.

644
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,070
For you, there is only one place

645
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,190
on earth uniquely suited to doing that.

646
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,580
So you're leaving again?

647
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,620
She's got a point, man. You just got back.

648
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,980
It's just for a few days.

649
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,020
Ordinarily, I wouldn't do this.

650
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,300
But it's for Thea.

651
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,790
And if you've shown me anything,

652
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,150
it's that the city is more than safe in your hands.

653
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,600
All of your hands.

654
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,250
Thank you.

655
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,000
Ollie told you we're heading out for a bit?

656
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,550
You cool with it all?

657
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,750
After the whole chase thing,

658
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,250
I think it's going to be a little while

659
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,430
before I'm cool with anything.

660
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,450
What was that for?

661
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,680
Take your pick. Saving my life,

662
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,440
or standing up to Oliver about Malcolm.

663
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,340
I should get going.

664
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,700
Come on, Speedy, we have four more miles

665
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,130
to make before night fall.

666
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,730
God.

667
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,490
I get that Malcolm wants to whip us into shape

668
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,840
so we can face the League, but don't you think

669
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,390
it's a little bit excessive?

670
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,350
We've been here for two hours. Are you complaining already?

671
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,930
I--I started thinking it after the first ten minutes.

672
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,760
Well, give it time.

673
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,860
Eventually this place will feel like home.

674
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,630
It does not look like home.

675
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,000
It was for me. For other people,

676
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,820
this is Purgatory.

677
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,170
You're not dead, if that's what you're wondering.

678
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,330
Once again, you have the good fortune

679
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,560
of being uniquely qualified to help me.

680
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,230
Me? Why?

681
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong. We've tracked here here.

682
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,610
Here? Where are we...

684
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,650
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.
