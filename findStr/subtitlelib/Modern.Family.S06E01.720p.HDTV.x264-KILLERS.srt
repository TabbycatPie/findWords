在经历了状况频出的婚礼
After a storybook wedding

14
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,500
和梦幻的蜜月之后
and a magical honeymoon,

15
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,740
米奇尔和我终于喜结连理
Mitchell and I are finally newlyweds.

16
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,790
你不觉得坐在你自己的椅子上
Are you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable

17
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,830
更舒服一点吗
in your own chair?

18
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,380
别再说什么"你的""我的"了
There's no more "My chair" Or "Your chair."

19
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,170
几星期前  我们度完蜜月回来
So we got back from our honeymoon several weeks ago,

20
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,140
感觉就像还未...
and it feels like it never --

21
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,110
还未结束吗  老天呐
Never ended? Oh, my gosh.

22
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,530
感觉我们同心同德
It's like we have one mind and one heart.

23
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,710
还同椅
And one chair.

24
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,790
结婚三周月纪念日快乐
Happy three-month anniversary.

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,260
是今天吗
Oh, is that today?

26
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,140
我们公司今天有个无聊的鸡尾酒会
So, listen, I have this boring cocktail thing at the office,

27
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,230
但我应该六点就能到家了
but I should be home by 6:00,

28
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,120
然后我们可以直接去参加派对
and then we can head to the party.

29
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,840
给你的  小爸  大爸送的  又来了
For you, dad. From dad. Again.

30
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,650
花吗  但你昨天刚送花给我了呀
Flowers? But you just got me flowers yesterday.

31
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,790
你昨天早餐也吃了麦片啊
Well, you also had cereal yesterday.

32
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,620
我不介意今天可以再吃一点
And I wouldn't mind having some today.

33
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,190
怀念以前家里没这么多蜜蜂的时候
Sure was nice when this house wasn't full of bees.

34
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,820
女士要再来点糖浆吗
More syrup for milady?

35
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
何乐而不为  谢谢  您真好
Why, thank you, kind sir.

36
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,570
克莱尔  你和卢克做的曲奇饼还有吗
Claire, do we still have any of those cookies that you and Luke baked?

37
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,420
我们是那种拿曲奇饼当早餐的家庭吗
Are we the kind of family that has cookies for breakfast?

38
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,600
当然  我们就是
Yes, we are!

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,320
好耶  好耶
Yeah! Yeah!

40
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,780
有蝴蝶
A butterfly!

41
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,320
天呐
Oh, my god!

42
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,360
我们度过了
We are having...

43
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,460
有史以来最完美的
...the most perfect summer...

44
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,420
夏天
...ever.

45
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,000
别误会
Don't get me wrong,

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
邓菲家的生活还是很欢乐的
the Dunphys have had some great days.

47
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,020
只是这种时光总是断断续续的
We just have a little trouble stringing them together.

48
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,610
我们的最好纪录是连续八天的幸福日子
Our record was eight consecutive blissful days --

49
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,550
那是在2007年12月
December 2007.

50
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,910
简直是我们的光明节
It was our Hanukkah.

51
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,600
这个夏天  邓菲家所有人都相处融洽
This summer, all the Dunphys are just clicking.

52
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,730
没错  海莉和卢克和睦相处
Yeah, Haley and Luke are getting along,

53
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,070
艾丽克斯去给穷人盖房子了
Alex is off building houses for the poor.

54
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,770
我知道那听起来挺可怕的  但是她喜欢
Which I know sounds awful, but she loves it.

55
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,000
我的时尚博客人气暴涨
My fashion blog is blowing up.

56
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,890
我搞起了视频聊天秀
I started doing these live video chats,

57
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,890
现在我的频道有五万多订阅者
and now I have over 50,000 subscribers!

58
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,810
而且  我的头发状态好极了
Oh, plus, my hair has never looked better.

59
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,870
我不信教
I'm not a religious person...

60
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,730
但我就是幡然醒悟了
but I just woke up.

61
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,520
菲尔搞起了园艺
Phil has been gardening.

62
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,830
而我也有时间跟朋友小聚  读读名著
I've had time to catch up and read the classics.

63
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,020
那是在她不需要帮我完成
...when she isn't busy helping me

64
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,030
我的魔镜消失魔术的时候
with my magic-mirror disappearing trick.

65
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,900
我刚要说  突然之间  我爱上了魔术
I'm just gonna say it -- suddenly, I love magic.

66
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,140
我才不管现在是不是中午
I don't care if it's the middle of the day.

67
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,350
我只想把你关进箱子
I just want to put you in a box

68
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,700
往你身上插"剑"
and stick swords in you.

69
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,860
让这个夏天更加梦幻的是
If this summer wasn't magical enough,

70
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,930
我都还没吃到过一个坏李子
I haven't had a single bad plum!

71
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,060
天呐
Oh, my god!

72
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,370
这个拉链呢
So, the zipper --

73
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,390
天呐
oh, my god!

74
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,500
天呐
Oh, my god!

75
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,650
曼尼
Manny!

76
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,690
曼尼
Manny!

77
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,220
来  跟你的兄弟姐妹们聊聊
Come! Talk to your cousins!

78
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,390
你们好
Hola!

79
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,140
曼尼  你为什么把他们冻起来
Manny, why you freeze the Colombians?

80
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,360
如果我跟其中一个聊起来
If I talk to one of them,

81
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,680
我就得跟其他50个聊
I have to talk to 50 of them.

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,540
就当作是生日礼物啊
Just do it as a birthday gift.

83
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,240
你总是这样
You always do this.

84
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,580
你的生日在下个星期呢
Your birthday's not till next week.

85
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,590
不是我的生日
Not mine.

86
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,410
今天是你萝莎丽奥婶婶82岁生日
It's aunt Rosario's 82nd birthday today.

87
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,860
所以那些山羊才都戴着派对帽
That's why all the goats are wearing the party hats.

88
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,090
你看
Look!

89
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,970
曼尼
Manny!

90
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,430
大家好
Hi, everyone.

91
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,690
新眼镜是不是又漂亮又时髦
Pretty snazzy new cheaters, huh?

92
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,760
才五块钱
Five bucks.

93
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,670
很值  对吧
I know, right?!

94
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,500
我老公年纪是比较大
My husband is an older man,

95
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,300
但他还不是老头子
but he's not an old man.

96
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,930
但穿上运动服  现在又戴上老花镜
But with the track suit and -- and now the glasses,

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,070
他最近好像不再努力打扮了
it's like he just stopped trying lately.

98
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,250
生活不能只求舒适啊
Comfort is not everything.

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,410
成人礼后  我的脚趾就再没知觉了
My toes have been numb since my quinceanera.

100
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,910
我们五点再去酒吧
We don't have to be at drinks till 5:00,

101
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,890
我要去办点事
so I'm gonna run a few errands,

102
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,350
戴眼镜去兜兜风
take these bad boys for a spin.

103
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,740
杰  你为什么不穿我给你买的新衣服
Ay, Jay, why don't you wear that new outfit that I just got you?

104
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,010
那条多余的拉链显得太花哨了
Uh, a little flashy, that extra zipper.

105
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,930
就像一部没有目的地的楼梯
Like a staircase to nowhere.

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,900
是啊  但会让你看起非常
Yeah, but it makes you look very --

107
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,780
亲爱的  我很抱歉  掉在你脚趾上了
Honey, I'm so sorry. Right on your toes.

108
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,260
没关系  你可以把公用电话砸我脚上
It's fine. You can drop a pay phone on my foot.

109
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,240
我一点感觉也没有
I don't feel a thing anymore.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,060
现在  我可爱的助手来协助我了
And now, as my lovely assistant joins me,

111
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,560
我要开始念咒语了
it's time to chant the incantation

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,420
将这位美女送到第六次元
that will send this fair maiden into the sixth dimension.

113
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,480
借梅林的帽子  格拉曼思雅的女巫之名
By the hat of Merlin, by the witches of Gramanthia,

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,830
我们为您奉上精彩的表演  消失
we do make this offering to you -- be gone!

115
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,230
成功了吗  我消失了吗
Did I do it? Did I disappear?

116
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,280
差一点  露出了点头
Almost. Just a little bit of forehead.

117
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,420
我可以再蹲低点
Oh, I can scrunch down.

118
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,410
这就是热爱
There's love.

119
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,360
你们好啊
Hey, guys.

120
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,300
太贴心了  你把筛粉机带来了
Sweet! You brought the sifter.

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,920
我可以做大黄派了
Now I can start my rhubarb pie.

122
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,650
我能帮你摘大黄吗
Ooh, can I help pick the rhubarb?

123
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,080
带路吧  小猫咪
Lead the way, kitten.

124
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,260
有人要吃李子吗
Anybody want a plum?

125
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,080
不用了
I'm good.

126
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,430
我给你拿瓶无醇啤酒
I'll grab you a roadie.

127
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,870
这么问可能不太合适
There is no easy way to ask this,

128
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,230
但你们这是嗑药了吗
but are you all high?

129
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,590
才不是  米奇尔  我们很幸福
No, Mitchell. We're happy.

130
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,200
我正在努力逃离幸福
Oh, I'm trying to get away from "Happy."

131
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,180
好吧  用最简洁的方法
All right, in the briefest possible way,

132
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,410
你直接告诉我是怎么回事吧
why don't you let me know what's going on?

133
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,760
小卡拒绝结束蜜月
Okay, Cam refuses to let the honeymoon end.

134
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,290
我收到了无数的花  和肉麻短信
I have a house full of flowers, endless romantic texts.

135
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,290
我知道  我听起来像个不懂感恩的混蛋
I know, I know, I sound like an ungrateful jerk.

136
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,080
是的
You do.

137
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
累死人了
It's exhausting.

138
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,410
更别提我完全无法给他对等的爱
Not to mention impossible to reciprocate.

139
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,650
天呐
Oh, my god!

140
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,220
总之
Um, anyway,

141
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,200
你觉得我该不该跟他温柔地说下
do you think that maybe I should talk to him gently

142
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,780
让他适可而止
about taking it down a notch?

143
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,920
绝对不行  下场会很惨烈
No, absolutely not. That never ends well.

144
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,970
显然你看成了"刻薄点"
Clearly you thought this said "Be mean."

145
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,980
[你是我的]

146
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,600
-菲尔  亲爱的  -不
- Phil, honey, no. - No.

147
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
好吧  别担心  我...
It's -- okay, don't worry, I...

148
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,510
那都不是情人节呢
And it wasn't even Valentine's Day.

149
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,970
所以你的建议是按兵不动
So your advice is to do nothing.

150
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,450
是的  米奇尔  虽然这听起来很可怕
Yes, Mitchell, as horrible as this sounds,

151
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,510
但你得忍气吞声  让自己被他宠爱
you need to suck it up and let yourself be loved,

152
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,760
小卡最后会降低浪漫程度的
and Cam will end up dialing back the romance.

153
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,330
你可能还会怀念过去呢
You might just miss it.

154
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,150
我就是
I know I do.

155
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,320
好了  给我的小蜜桃一个李子
Here we are. A plum for my peach.

156
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,670
是吗
Do you?

157
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,510
给你
Here you go.

158
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,650
谢谢
Thank you.

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,710
他没事吧
Is he okay?

160
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,640
他是米奇尔
He's Mitchell.

161
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,770
我甚至都不想聊那事
Look, I didn't even want to talk about it.

162
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,290
咱家现在顺风顺水的
We've had such a great thing going on here.

163
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,170
我可不想让那种负能量进屋
I don't want to let that kind of negativity in the house.

164
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,080
艾丽克斯
Alex!

165
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,980
我们以为你下周才回来呢
We didn't think you were coming back until next week.

166
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,510
我提前回来了 
I got a ride home early.

167
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,550
这简直是最烂的夏天
This has been the worst summer ever!

168
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,030
当心点  你个蠢货
Careful, you idiot!

169
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,770
你才是蠢货
You're an idiot!

170
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,790
昨晚我的帐篷坏了
And last night, my tent ripped,

171
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,480
所以我不得不
so I had to sleep

172
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,440
靠着一辆面包车睡在一块胶合板下面
under a plywood board leaning up against a van.

173
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,460
递我一张纸巾吧
Pass me a napkin.

174
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,040
夫人的胳膊断了吗
Is milady's arm broken?

175
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,220
你的胳膊就要被我打断了
Yours is about to be.

176
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,530
祖国珍贵的花朵
Aww, precious flowers.

177
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,190
反正老鼠那么多  我也睡不着
Not that I could sleep with all the rats.

178
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,720
顺便说一句
And, by the way,

179
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,590
如果你们开始咳血  那是我的错
if any of you start coughing up blood, my bad.

180
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,470
我觉得我带回了瘟疫
I think I brought back the plague.

181
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,560
我在干嘛呢
What am I doing?

182
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
我把书包忘在车道了
I think I left my backpack in the driveway.

183
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,340
别踢我
Stop kicking me!

184
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,760
是你在踢我
You're kicking me!

185
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,870
对不起  我今天有些烦躁
I'm sorry. I'm just fidgety today.

186
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,870
没关系
It's okay.

187
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,190
吃块曲奇饼会有帮助
A cookie might help.

188
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,610
这是你想要的纸巾
Here's that napkin you wanted.

189
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,470
我拿了信
I got the mail!

190
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,180
给我一张
Would it have killed you

191
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,930
没沾番茄酱的纸巾你会死吗
to give me one without ketchup on it?

192
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,690
走开
Move!

193
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,880
你那边够宽敞了
You have room!

194
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,420
不  搬走  你都40岁了
No, move out! You're 40!

195
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,000
好了  够了
Okay. That's enough.

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,580
卢克  你去给花园浇水吧
Luke, why don't you go water our garden.

197
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,390
海莉  消失一会儿吧
Haley, just disappear for a minute.

198
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,460
反正你也帮不上忙
Well, it's not like you could help with that.

199
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,850
说到人家痛处了
Abracad-ouch.

200
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,740
艾丽克斯回家了真好  对吧
Well, it's great having Alex home, huh?

201
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,820
太棒了
So great.

202
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
你不会觉得是她让我们...
You don't think that she's the reason why we --

203
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,550
不  我不觉得
No. No, I do not.

204
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,730
我们都知道这个迷人的夏天
We both knew that this charmed summer

205
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,190
迟早会遭遇不顺
had to have a bump in it somewhere.

206
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,950
是啊
Yes. Yeah.

207
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,320
艾丽克斯回家
And it's not like Alex coming home

208
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,800
又不会让我们的快乐咒语顿时失效
could suddenly throw off our whole happy mojo.

209
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,370
那李子好吃吗
How's that plum?

210
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,140
挺好吃的  天呐
Great. Oh, my god.

211
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,890
-她来了  -她来了
- There she is! - There she is!

212
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,580
你回家真是太好了  亲爱的
Oh, so happy to have you home, honey.

213
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,310
天呐  是只蝙蝠
Oh, my god! It's a bat!

214
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,690
怎么回事
What's happening?!

215
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,010
把它弄出去
Get it out of house!

216
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,990
弄出去
Get it away!

217
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,800
难以置信
This is unbelievable.

218
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,010
干洗工又搞丢了我的一件衬衣
The dry cleaner lost another one of my shirts.

219
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,850
你知道那件好看的
You know that nice,

220
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,110
红白蓝相间的夏威夷衬衣吧
red-white-and-blue Hawaiian one?

221
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,740
是啊  那件真的不错
Yes, that was a very nice one.

222
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,420
这是他搞丢的第四件夏威夷衬衣了
That's the fourth Hawaiian shirt he's lost.

223
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,050
我告诉你
I'm telling you,

224
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,550
这事要发展成罪案新闻报头条了
this is a "Dateline" story waiting to happen.

225
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,970
跟你们大家聊天很开心
Great talking with you all,

226
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,130
但有人想打个招呼
hey, but someone wants to say hi.

227
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,070
不要
No, no!

228
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,500
杰
Jay!

229
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,390
大家好
Hi, guys.

230
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,170
还是不会说西语
Nope, still don't speak Spanish.

231
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,800
但是看到你们还是好高兴啊
Always so much fun seeing you guys, though.

232
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,790
听着  我...
Listen, I --

233
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,130
-歌洛莉亚  -怎么
- Gloria? - Hmm?

234
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,040
你表弟穿着我的那件
Your cousin's wearing

235
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,830
黑黄桃色相间的夏威夷衬衣
my black, yellow, and peach Hawaiian shirt.

236
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,490
拜托  杰
Ay, please, Jay!

237
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,420
好像全世界
Like you're the only man

238
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,390
就你有那件衬衣一样
in this whole wide world that owns that shirt.

239
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,680
这种独特的设计不仅会
These designer specs don't

240
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,970
让我的眼睛显得很明亮
just make my eyes pop.

241
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,000
我还能看见左边口袋上被雪茄烫的印迹
I can see the cigar burn I put on the left pocket.

242
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,920
这是个巧合
It's a coincidence.

243
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,840
还有很多衣服呢
There's a lot of those.

244
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,430
比如说你叔叔的帽衫
Like according to your uncle's hoodie here,

245
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,430
他穿的是我在布坎南高中的田径队队服
he was on my track team at Buchanan High.

246
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,710
各位  这样吧
Hey, guys. Tell you what.

247
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,510
不如我们换换口味  尝尝美国食物
Why don't we sample some American food for a change?

248
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,850
你把我的衣服寄去了哥伦比亚吗
So, you're sending my clothes to Colombia?

249
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,740
只是旧衣服啦
Just the old ones, and --

250
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,350
他们寄回来了大部分衣服
and they send most of them back.

251
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,720
原来如此
And there it is.

252
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,640
你对我的穿衣风格有意见吗
Do you have a problem with the way I dress?

253
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,090
杰  我非常爱你
Jay, I love you very, very much.

254
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,280
我也非常爱你  但我问的不是这个
And I love you very much, but that wasn't the question.

255
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,390
只是有时候我觉得
It's just that sometimes I feel like

256
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,350
你可以在穿着打扮上做出更大的努力
you could make a bigger effort on your appearance.

257
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,280
你终于说了
And there it is.

258
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,010
别再这么说了
Please stop saying that.

259
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,840
我最近就是觉得
It's just that I feel that lately

260
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,500
你不再用心为我打扮自己了
you don't make an effort to look good for me,

261
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,140
但我从来都为你精心装扮自己的
and I'm always making an effort to look my best for you.

262
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,780
为我吗  是嘛
For me? Sure.

263
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,300
怎么了
What?

264
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
我们直说吧  你不是在为我装扮自己
Well, let's face it, you don't really doll up for me --

265
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,270
你是为了自己
you do it for you.

266
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,050
你做头发  做指甲
You get your hair done, you get your nails done.

267
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,850
所以我不打扮自己你也没问题吗
Oh, so you wouldn't mind if I stopped fixing myself up?

268
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,290
没问题  因为我爱的是你
No, because I love you for you.

269
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,360
既然我们要说实话
And since we're being honest,

270
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,170
其实我有时认为
I actually think sometimes...

271
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,460
你有点打扮过度了
you overdo it.

272
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,020
你终于说了
And there it is.

273
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,250
这句话不是这么用的
You're using it wrong.

274
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,040
不  这很好
No, this is good.

275
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,960
知道你一点也不在乎非常好
It's good to know that -- that you don't care.

276
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,490
我以后可以节省很多时间了
This is gonna save me so much time in the future.

277
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,090
很好
Good.

278
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,970
很好
Good!

279
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
曼尼
Manny!

280
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,900
为什么
Why?

281
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,220
我不管俗不俗气
I don't care if it's cliché?

282
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,540
我就是很喜欢小乳蛋饼的便捷
I love the convenience of a nice mini quiche.

283
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,700
你那里有一点
You got a little, um...

284
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,850
不  好吧  好极了
Oh, no. Okay. Perfect.

285
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,670
新人还能再尴尬一点吗
Can the new guy embarrass himself any more?

286
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,990
大律师
Hey, counselor.

287
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,550
我要怎么做你才能把外套脱掉呢
What do I have to do to get you to drop that suit?

288
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,650
小卡  你怎么来了
Cam, what are you doing here?

289
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,830
给我的"抱抱老公"惊喜啊
Surprising my "Hugsband"!

290
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,420
这个词我还是第一次听说
I'm hearing that term for the first time.

291
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,340
是啊
Yeah.

292
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,310
你们什么时候回来
So when will you guys be back?

293
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,730
看来有人准备要取悦女同胞了
Looks like somebody's entertaining a lady friend.

294
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,310
也许你会给她斟一杯曼尼・施维滋美酒
Maybe you'll pour her a nice, tall glass of Manny-Schewitz?

295
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,780
你知道吗  有时候直接回答问题比较好
You know what? Sometimes just a straight answer.

296
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,130
歌洛莉亚  能给我个大概的时间吗
Gloria, can I get an E.T.A.?

297
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,230
这些都是重要的客户
These are important clients.

298
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,220
我希望我们到的时候他们还活着
I'd like them to still be alive when we get there.

299
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,100
好了  我准备好了
Okay! I'm ready.

300
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,840
真的吗
Seriously?

301
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,750
怎么了
What?

302
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,940
不  对不起
Ay, no! I'm so sorry!

303
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,930
我忘了是要和你的客户喝东西
I forgot this was drinks with your clients.

304
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,140
等等  好了
Hold on. Okay.

305
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,450
我准备好了  走吧
I'm ready now. Let's go.

306
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,500
你好呀  大明星
Hey, there, superstar.

307
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,520
白痴
Moron!

308
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,020
蠢货
Derp!

309
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,590
你不在的时候这里真是大不相同
It really hasn't been the same here without you.

310
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,500
你在看什么呢
So what do you got there?

311
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,050
大学宣传册
Oh, college brochure!

312
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,050
你要选学校了
You're gonna have your pick of schools.

313
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,120
你是我们的小天才
You're our little genius.

314
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,060
我只是希望
I just hope --

315
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,220
什么  克莱尔  你希望什么
What, Claire? What do you hope?

316
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,230
你的记录那么完美
Well, you have such a perfect record,

317
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,950
我希望他们不会给你不好的评价
I hope they don't hold it against you

318
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,340
因为你这周确实
that this week you kinda... well...

319
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,910
我不想用"半途而废"这个词
Don't want to say "Quit."

320
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,950
你已经用了
You just did.

321
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,730
你是想把我送回那个地狱吗
Are you trying to send me back to that hellhole?

322
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,180
不  宝贝  你是团队的一部分
No! It's -- honey, you're part of a team,

323
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,090
有人在指望着你呢
and there are people relying on you,

324
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,450
所以当你像这样消失时
so when you just up and vanish like that,

325
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,710
就好像
it sort of -- it --

326
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,630
菲尔
Phil?

327
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,220
菲尔
Phil?!

328
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,480
你妈妈只是觉得这不像你
Your mom just feels like it's unlike you

329
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
你不是会撒手不管的人
to walk away from something.

330
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,210
至少我还能离开
At least I could walk away.

331
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,350
跟我住一个帐篷的人把脚钉在了地板上
My tent-mate nail-gunned her foot to the floor.

332
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,620
她就那样一边原地打转一边叫
She was just walking around in a circle screaming

333
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,140
直到有人发现了她
until someone found her!

334
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,790
为什么你们这么想赶我走
Why do you guys want to get rid of me so badly?

335
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,070
没人想赶你走
No one wants to get rid of you.

336
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,180
只不过是再呆七天
It's just seven more days.

337
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,970
善始善终会让你感觉很好的
You'll feel good about finishing something you started,

338
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,740
然后你就可以跟我们一起度过
and then you join us for the perfect little summer

339
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,990
这完美的夏天了
we're having here.

340
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,770
直到一小时前都很完美
Were having until an hour ago.

341
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,770
海莉
Haley!

342
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,420
天呐  好吧  我懂了
Oh, my god. Okay, I see what this is.

343
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,890
我不在你们都会高兴一点
You all are happier when I'm not here.

344
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,840
不  不是这样的
No, that's not true.

345
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,340
省省吧
Save it!

346
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,410
我会搭车回去的
I'll get a ride back up there

347
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,850
然后你们所有人就能继续
and you all can continue to enjoy

348
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,630
享受你们完美的小夏天了
your perfect, little summer!

349
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,460
-艾丽克斯  宝贝  -别理我
- Alex, honey! - Leave me alone!

350
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,490
电影台免费了
We just got free Cinemax!

351
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,250
这是米奇尔在亲一只海豚
Here's Mitchell kissing a dolphin.

352
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,280
这是他在亲一只老虎
Oh, that's him kissing a tiger.

353
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,590
我就是那只老虎
I'm the tiger.

354
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,130
我们太开心了
We have fun, you know?

355
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,400
我们可以带配偶来的吗
Were we supposed to bring our spouses?

356
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,960
小卡  小卡  听着
Hey, Cam? Cam, hey, look.

357
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,430
这活动只限员工参加
Um, this is kind of work-only.

358
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,780
拜托  他们都没发现我在这
Oh, please. They don't even know I'm here.

359
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,850
我喜欢这首歌  我们跳舞吧
I love this song. Let's dance.

360
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,040
不  不  没有人跳舞
No, no. Nobody's -- nobody's dancing.

361
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,350
用屁股来交流吧
Shh. Say it with your hips.

362
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,630
好吧
O-kay.

363
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,240
别这样  小卡
Hey, uh, no, Cam. Um...

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,510
你知道我爱你  对吧
You know I love you, right?

365
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,660
第一个用正确的方式爱我的人
First man that ever did love me right!

366
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,300
我们很开心
We have fun.

367
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,650
确实是  我们是的
We do, we do, we do.

368
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,060
所以  我在想  也许
Um, so, look, I-I was thinking that maybe...

369
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,450
我们可以把浪漫行为减少一点
we could turn the romance down

370
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,430
就一点点
just a little bit, you know?

371
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,170
因为这些事变得有点
Because it's been getting a little bit --

372
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,080
我不想说是过分了  但是
I-I-I don't want to say over the top, but it --

373
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,610
好吧  如果你想继续跳舞的话
Okay, I'm gonna need your help

374
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,220
我需要你也动起来
if we're gonna keep dancing here.

375
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,850
我感觉到你生气了
I feel like you're mad.

376
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,800
我们搞了个非正式的投票
So, we had an informal vote over there...

377
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,730
我们没有在跳舞了
We're not dancing anymore.

378
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,960
那就好
Oh, good.

379
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,740
你知道赫布可能会来的  对吧
You know Herb might stop by, right?

380
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,110
他给公司新闻简报拍照配图
He takes the pictures for the company newsletter.

381
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,230
知道  我很喜欢看《赫布宣传报》
Yes, I love "Herb's blurbs."

382
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,020
好了
Well...

383
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,840
到大门了
Here come the doors!

384
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
一般高档的地方都会有的
Usually all the good places have them!

385
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,970
我要开门了哦
I'm going to open them!

386
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,710
你真是个绅士  杰
Oh, you're such a gentleman, Jay.

387
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,530
我好像没带钱包
I think I forgot my wallet.

388
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,980
别担心
Oh, don't worry.

389
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,970
我腰包里有钱
I have some money here in my fanny pack, huh?

390
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,430
看在上帝的份上  好吧  你赢了
For god's sake, fine. You win.

391
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,670
我喜欢你打扮漂亮的样子
I like it when you make yourself pretty.

392
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,650
我赢了
I win!

393
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,790
我刚说过你赢了
I just said you won.

394
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,410
杰  我发现你不再为我打扮时
Ay, Jay, what you're feeling right now

395
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,060
跟你现在的心情是一样的
is what I feel when you stop trying to look good for me.

396
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,490
我知道的
No, I get it.

397
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,170
那你为什么不打扮了
Then why did you stop trying?

398
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,310
因为
Because...

399
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,590
算了吧  理由太蠢了
Oh, forget it. It's too stupid.

400
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,040
告诉我
Tell me.

401
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,420
几个月以前
A couple of months ago,

402
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,960
我在巴尼百货店买衣服
I was shopping at Barneys --

403
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,700
你知道我喜欢赶时髦
you know I like to stay current.

404
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,840
当我走出更衣室的时候
Anyhow, I'm coming out of the dressing room,

405
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,140
我看到两个年轻人在笑我
and I see these two young guys laughing at me,

406
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,280
像是在说"一把年纪了还赶时髦"
you know, like "There's the old guy trying too hard."

407
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,930
我当然很生气了
You know, of course I get mad.

408
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,540
可我却开始觉得
But I start thinking,

409
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,290
他们说得没错  杰
"They're right, Jay.

410
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,860
你老了  就别装嫩了
You're old. Just be old."

411
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,390
听着  杰・普里契特
Listen to me, Jay Pritchett!

412
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
很多人以为
A lot of people assume

413
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,710
我嫁给你是为了钱
that I married you because of your money,

414
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,810
这只是其中非常非常小的一部分
and that's only a very, very small part of it.

415
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,900
这点我们需要再聊一下
I'd like to go back to that.

416
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,190
我嫁给你是因为你很性感
I married you because you were sexy.

417
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,460
现在依然如此
You still are.

418
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,430
谁知道能保持多久呢
Who knows for how long that's gonna last,

419
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,930
我们俩都一样
for either of us.

420
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,210
所以我们都要为对方努力
So we have to keep making an effort for each other.

421
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,720
下次去巴尼百货  我陪你去
Next time you go to Barneys, I go with you.

422
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,580
说不定你只是选错衣服了
Maybe you're just making the wrong choices.

423
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,020
至少选你选对了
Not always.

424
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,100
你想喝点东西吗  我可以换件衣服
You want to have a drink? I can change.

425
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,530
不  我还是发短信跟他们说我病了吧
No, I think I'll text them, tell them I was sick.

426
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,850
我们回家吧  你刚说我很性感
Let's go home. You said I was sexy.

427
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,690
好了  再见  罗莎  谢啦
Okay, bye, Rosa. Thank you.

428
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,660
小卡
Cam!

429
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,170
怎么了  哥们儿
What's up, dude?

430
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,080
你叫我什么
Seriously?

431
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,830
怎么  你觉得这个也太浪漫了吗
What, is that too romantic for you?

432
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,150
他不爱我
He loves me not...

433
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,370
他不爱我
He loves me not...

434
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,580
他不爱我
He loves me not.

435
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
我们能聊聊吗
Okay, can we talk?

436
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,060
不行  我有点忙
Actually, no. I'm kind of busy.

437
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,690
你大概忘了今天是我们结婚三周月
I'm assuming you forgot it's our three month-iversary.

438
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,350
我傻不拉几地布置了一番
Well, I foolishly set up a celebration

439
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,470
不过放心  我会清理掉的
that I will kindly get rid of.

440
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,190
小卡
Cam!

441
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,150
不  我没忘
No, I didn't forget,

442
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,230
但我想跟你说的就是这个
but that's what I want to talk to you about.

443
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,630
你有点太
You've been a little bit --

444
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,320
瞧  这就是我要说的
See, look. This is what I'm talking about.

445
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,220
你又给了我一个礼物
You got me another present.

446
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,430
别碰它
Don't touch that.

447
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,220
我的心啊
Oh, my -- my heart!

448
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,260
你哪有心啊
What heart?

449
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,010
小卡  不是吧
Cam! Come on!

450
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,030
好吧  听着
Okay, listen.

451
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,630
我知道能和你在一起我是多么幸运
I know how lucky I am to have you,

452
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,180
但是我承受不了你这么高强度的感情
but I can't possibly keep up with this level of affection...

453
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,340
天呐
Oh, boy.

454
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,370
我道歉  我是个禽兽
I apologize! I'm a monster!

455
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,450
不  很明显我才是禽兽
No, obviously, I'm the monster.

456
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,930
很明显
Obviously.

457
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,450
我能指出
You know, can I just point out

458
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,970
我们在卡波圣卢卡斯的时候
that when we were in Cabo,

459
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,510
你没有介意那些花啊
you didn't seem to mind all the flowers...

460
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,030
是的  可是
Yeah, but --

461
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,680
或是背部按摩
or the back rubs,

462
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,500
或是我对你的感情
or the attention.

463
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
那  那是我们的蜜月啊
Well, that -- that was our honeymoon,

464
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,830
没错  我很喜欢  可都过了好几周了
And, yes, I loved it, but it was weeks ago.

465
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,510
也许我们中有人不希望那种感觉结束
Well, maybe some of us don't want it to... end!

466
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,820
可是最终还是要结束的啊
Well, it has to eventually end.

467
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,080
好吧  小卡
All right, Cam --

468
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,980
这口红是你的吗
Did you have this lipstick or --

469
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,470
要知道  我觉得
You know, personally,

470
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,510
我很遗憾你这么保守
I feel sorry for you that you're so shut off

471
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,850
连一点浪漫的举动都
that a few simple romantic gestures --

472
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,000
天呐  我看的这是什么
oh,my god! What am I looking at here?

473
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,890
我想是我太疯狂
Well, I guess I'm crazy,

474
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,300
自从我们结婚以后
because I've taken pictures of you sleeping

475
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,960
我每晚都会拍你睡着的样子
every night since we got married

476
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,290
因为你是我的梦中情人
because you're the man of my dreams.

477
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,280
问个问题  如果我是你的梦中情人
Okay, super quick -- if I was the man of your dreams,

478
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,990
睡着的那个人不应该是你吗
wouldn't you have to be the one sleeping?

479
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,610
不要再说了[拉那条线]  米奇尔
Don't pull that thread, Mitchell.

480
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,780
我正好想问  这条线是什么
Speaking of which, what is this?

481
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,340
不要拉那条线  米奇尔
Don't pull that thread, Mitchell.

482
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,400
小卡  拜托
Oh, Cam, come on!

483
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,190
连你也得承认这有点过分了吧
Even you have to admit this is excessive.

484
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,710
过分  你真这么觉得
Excessive? Really?

485
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,330
你被丘比特的神箭射中了
Struck by Cupid's magic arrow.

486
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,460
结束了  莉莉
It's off, Lily.

487
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,880
不是吧  跟罗莎排练了两个小时呢
Seriously? Two hours rehearsing with Rosa?

488
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,530
小卡  你到底怎么了
Cam, what is going on with you?

489
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,160
我们刚刚经历了最浪漫的一年
We just had the most romantic year ever,

490
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,420
策划了我们的纪念日  婚礼还有蜜月
planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon,

491
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,360
我担心一旦松懈下来
and I'm just worried if we let this go,

492
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,470
我们就再也浪漫不起来了
we'll never get it back.

493
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,650
这些又不会就这么结束了
Well, that doesn't all just end.

494
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,880
已经发生过一次了
It did once.

495
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,810
我们刚住在一起的前两年
You know, the first two years we were together,

496
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,850
我们是那么的浪漫
we were insanely romantic.

497
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,920
然而后来就只剩孩子和工作了
Then it became about parenting a-and working.

498
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,020
直到过去这年我们又重新找回了浪漫
And this last year, we got that back,

499
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,220
我才发现是我没有坚持努力经营浪漫
and I just realized I've dropped the ball.

500
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,290
不
Oh, no.

501
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,190
也许不应该由你一个人
Well, m-maybe you -- you shouldn't be the only one

502
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,350
负责经营浪漫
carrying the ball.

503
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,480
要是你把这个责任递给我呢
What if you did a give-off to me?

504
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,090
是交给你
A hand-off.

505
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,410
好把  那
Okay, what -- yeah.

506
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120
那要不我
Look, w-what if I...

507
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,880
试着变得浪漫些
tried to become a little bit more romantic?

508
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,840
那会是什么样呢
What would that even look like?

509
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,760
听这歌  听这歌
This song... this song...

510
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,720
是我向你提出同居那晚放的歌
Was playing the night I asked you to move in.

511
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,630
在苹果蜜餐厅
At that Applebee's.

512
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,050
你还欠我一支舞呢
I believe you owe me a dance.

513
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,200
是的
Yes.

514
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,480
这戏演完了没
Are we almost done with fairy time?

515
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,590
-莉莉别这样  -莉莉  这很没礼貌
- Lily, of all... - Lily, that's offensive.

516
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,440
我只是想换掉这身衣服
I just want to get out of this costume.

517
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,710
这样啊  当然可以了
Oh. Oh, of course.

518
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,780
这衣服看着确实不舒服
Now, that does look uncomfortable.

519
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,410
可以直接扯下来
They snap off.

520
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,230
扯下来就好  小意思
They snap off. Oh, that's easy.

521
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,600
马上就有人来接我了
My ride's on its way.

522
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,250
别担心  我会在屋外等
Don't worry, I'll wait outside on the curb.

523
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,460
宝贝  没人赶你走
Honey, nobody wants you to go.

524
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,040
哪怕你真的是灾星  也是我们的灾星
Yeah, even if you are bad luck, you're our bad luck.

525
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,220
你这话算哪门子道歉
You realize that is in no way an apology, right?

526
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,980
关键是  我们真的
The thing is that we are really --

527
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,760
别说了
Please stop talking.

528
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,770
我这个夏天到哪儿都是外人
I spent this entire summer as an outsider.

529
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,790
就连建房子  他们也是让我修外墙
They literally made me build the outside of the house.

530
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,670
就连回到自己家  都还...
And then I come back here and I --

531
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,270
你怎么开着摄像头
Why is your webcam on?

532
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,170
你是要偷拍我吗
Are you trying to humiliate me?

533
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,620
亮灯表示开着吗
That light means it's on?

534
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,920
我关掉网页时
It doesn't automatically turn off

535
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,180
摄像头不会自动关掉吗
when you go to a different web page?

536
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,220
不会  想想你把电脑放在床上
No, and considering you keep your laptop on your bed,

537
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,530
看得到你换衣服
right by where you change,

538
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,640
看得到你洗澡出来
and when you come out of the shower,

539
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,910
谁知道还能看到啥
and who knows what else...

540
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,470
大家都知道能看到啥
Everyone knows what else!

541
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,640
难怪你有五万个订阅者
It's probably why you have 50,000 subscribers.

542
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,800
你们真应该感到羞愧
Hey! You should be ashamed of yourselves!

543
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,790
好啦  好啦  还开着的
Yeah, yeah. Still not off.

544
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,240
你怎么关的
How do you do that?

545
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,640
慢着  有股味道
Wait, what is that smell?

546
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,030
你爸和卢克在做大黄派
Your father and luke are making a rhubarb pie

547
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,850
用的我们自家种的大黄
from rhubarb we grew in our own garden.

548
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,090
你走之前一定要尝尝
You're not leaving until you try it.

549
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,750
不不不  是烟味
No, no, no, no, no. I smell smoke.

550
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,270
我还没开烤炉呢
Well, I didn't turn the oven on yet.

551
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,840
你开了吗
Did you?

552
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,510
还没
No.

553
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,490
完了  完了
Oh, no, no!

554
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,580
我昨晚泡澡时打算看《战争与和平》的
I tried to start that stupid "War and Peace" again

555
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,410
结果在浴缸里睡着了
last night in the bathtub, but then I fell asleep.

556
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,450
书掉进了水里
It dropped in the water

557
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,180
我想着把它烘干
and I thought I would just dry it out.

558
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,230
快躲开
Take cover!

559
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,980
-好  好  -快躲开
- Okay! Okay! - Take cover!

560
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,130
天哪
Oh, god!

561
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,310
破烂玩意儿
Damn this thing!

562
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,680
没人看见烤炉亮着灯吗
Did nobody notice the oven light?!

563

别走  别走
No, no, no, no.

570
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,630
-别走  让我说  -别走  宝贝

Spoon time, people.

听着  宝贝  你想走可以走
Look, you can leave if you want to, sweetheart,

576
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,990
但我们得让你高高兴兴地走

尝尝我们的爱

581
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,960
你们把大黄的叶子去掉了吧
You took the leaves off the rhubarb, right?

582
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,480
叶子可是有毒的  会毒死你们的
They're incredibly poisonous. You all could die.

583
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,890
别吃  艾丽克斯说它有毒

我们也听见了

是个愚蠢的夏天
It was a stupid summer.

591
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,840
没有你在旁边取笑我
Without you here to shame me,

592
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,180
我已堕落到看完全部《贵妇的真实生活》
I watched every "Real Housewives" episode

593
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,880
正经书却才看了两页

求你别走

你们知道天窗没关吧
You know the attic window is open, right?

598
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
还真不知道
We really didn't.

599
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,080
我们看谁先爬上楼
I race you up the stairs.

600
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,110
先去换件漂亮衣服吧
Why don't you slip into something less comfortable?

601
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,000
好
Okay!

602

惊喜哦

603
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,360
我觉得  我们以后是不是别玩惊吓了
Just a thought -- maybe we should stop doing these.

604
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,260
你们搞什么
What's going on?

605
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,480
这还看不出来吗
It seems pretty obvious.

606

我故意把派对提前了一星期
I had to throw the party a week early

607
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
好真的给她一个惊喜
to really surprise her.

608
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,380
我们该担心吗
Should we be concerned about her?

609
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,350
当年老妈就是这么一走了之的
That's kind of similar to the way mom left.

610
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,220
歌洛莉亚和我在穿着打扮上闹别扭
Gloria and I got in this whole thing about how we dress.

611
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,900
说来话长
Long story,

612
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,440
我估计她要花点时间打扮一下

我里面穿着这身衣服呢
I had this outfit underneath.

615

你不会真以为
Did you really think

616
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,720
我会穿成那样进酒吧吧
that I was gonna walk into a bar looking like that?

617
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,050
谢谢
Gracias!

618
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,450
这些年害我好苦啊
All these years,

619
