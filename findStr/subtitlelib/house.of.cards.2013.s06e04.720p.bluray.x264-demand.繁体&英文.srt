00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,060
眼下的情況太不正常了
this isn't normal, what's going on.

157
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,180
我接受這個職位的時候
When I accepted my position,

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,990
是為了協助您推進您的計劃
it was to work with you and your agenda,

159
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,780
而不是
not...

160
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
而不是
not...

161
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,720
本屆內閣的某些
Certain members of our Cabinet

162
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,000
與國安部事務有關的人
in positions related to National Security

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,740
已經就敘利亞問題進行了多次密會
have had several secret meetings regarding Syria.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,670
佩特羅夫總統已經知道
President Petrov has become aware

165
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,110
他們計劃排遣雇傭兵進入該地區的事
of their plans for sending private contractors to the region.

166
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,480
女士
Ma'am...

167
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,280
五角大樓一些高層
there are officials in the Pentagon,

168
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,670
克里姆林宮里也有人非常希望能避免一場
people at the Kremlin, who would very much like to prevent

169
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,530
-代理人戰爭  -諾拉  謝謝你的坦誠
- a proxy war... - Nora, I appreciate your candor,

170
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,340
但馬克會處理的
but Mark has this.

171
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,370
女士  內閣都成了他的了
Ma'am, the Cabinet is his.

172
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,780
他知道我們該怎么做
He knows what we need to do.

173
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,940
我之所以懷疑你想競爭議長  是因為
What makes me suspect you're vying for speaker is

174
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,760
盡管領跑選手天天換
the frontrunners change day to day,

175
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,510
但是大家心中的次選始終沒變過
but everybody's second choice remains the same.

176
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,380
-就是你  -布雷特  難道你會讓賢
- You. - Brett, are you saying you wouldn't do it,

177
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,470
拒絕黨內征召嗎
if the party asked?

178
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,570
這說明黨還沒昏了頭  分得清好壞
If the party knew what was good for them.

179
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,270
這位是道格拉斯·斯坦普  他現在是顧問
This is Douglas Stamper. He's coming on as a consultant.

180
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,350
大家都認識
We've met.

181
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,060
弗蘭西斯當黨鞭時認識的約拿
Jonah, back when Francis was whip,

182
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,200
而你  當年還只是端咖啡的小廝
and you, back when you were getting us coffee.

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,190
我倒確實想知道  議員先生
I do wonder how he'd feel with some

184
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,300
對他署名的一些法案到底有什么看法
of the legislation the good congressman is putting his name on.

185
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,660
三權分立是憲法之本
Constitution was built on checks and balances.

186
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,870
還有人民的意愿
And the people's will.

187
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,640
總統是誰并不重要
It's not about who the President is.

188
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,530
重要的是政府變成了什么樣
It's about what the office has become.

189
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,320
先生們  容我失陪一下
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me for a minute,

190
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,610
我答應了布雷特介紹些溫和派民主黨議員給他認識
I promised Brett here I'd introduce him to a blue dog Democrat,

191
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,070
如果我找得到的話
assuming I can find one.

192
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,790
沒想到還能再見到他
I never thought I'd see him again.

193
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,990
他去復健了
He was in rehab.

194
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,340
又開始戒酒了
And is back in the program.

195
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,110
那些指控都撤銷了
Those charges were dropped,

196
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,270
但還有一樁案子追著他呢
but he's still got a case chasing him.

197
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,800
要我猜  那案子怕是沖著總統去的
If anything, my bet is that case is chasing the President.

198
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,770
佩特羅夫離開大廳了
Petrov is no longer in the main room.

199
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,700
西格森國務卿還和戴維斯女士在一起
Secretary Siegerson is still with Ms. Davis,

200
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,380
副總統正要出去
while the vice president's exiting.

201
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,490
國土安全部部長的卡弗蒂
And Homeland Secretary Cafferty

202
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,690
剛和總統密語了好一陣子
was just whispering with the President.

203
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,500
而道格·斯坦普在和助理局長格林說話
As for Doug Stamper, he's with Assistant Director Green.

204
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,490
我想知道當時誰和杜蘭特在一起
I want to know who Durant was with,

205
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,930
什么時間去了哪  直到她被宣布死亡
when and where, leading up to the moment she was pronounced dead.

206
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,810
如果我去打聽的話
If I start asking around...

207
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,740
只會問來更多問題
Questions bring more questions.

208
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,110
-這是公開調查嗎  -不是
- Is this an open investigation? - No.

209
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,000
不過我會提醒著點和我共事的探員
But for any agent I work with, I'll be the red flag.

210
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,840
道格  我知道得越多  對你我就越有利
Doug, the more I know, the better it is for both of us.

211
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,110
你相信我嗎
You trust me?

212
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,310
你總是堅持到底
You've always followed through.

213
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,040
那就聽我的
Then do as I say.

214
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,680
你發現了什么
But what did you find?

215
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,910
他招了嗎
Is he talking?

216
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,230
好的  有什么新情況就向我匯報
All right. Get back to me when you know anything more.

217
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,360
無論什么時候
Day or night.

218
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,880
有什么事嗎
Is everything okay?

219
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,290
是關于湯姆·耶茨的
That was about Tom Yates.

220
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,690
他的信用卡最近發生了一筆消費
There's been a recent charge on his credit card.

221
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,640
就在布拉格的馬克大酒店
The Grand Mark in Prague,

222
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
只不過并不是湯姆
except it wasn't Tom.

223
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,620
他沒進行那筆消費  其他的也不是他
He didn't make the charge. Or any of the others.

224
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,910
-有人偷了他的  -他的身份
- Somebody stole his... - His identity.

225
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,950
我們現在不知道真正的湯姆·耶茨去了哪
As of now, we have no idea where the real Tom Yates has been.

226
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,670
但愿他沒事
Well, I hope he's safe.

227
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,330
不管他在哪
Wherever he is.

228
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,440
我也是
Me too.

229
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,020
1945年產的木桐·羅斯柴爾德
1945 Mouton-Rothschild.

230
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,380
V標
"V" Label.

231
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,740
羅斯柴爾德訂了這瓶酒  來慶祝盟軍
Rothschild commissioned it to celebrate the Allied victory

232
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,660
在偉大衛國戰爭中的勝利
in the Great Patriotic War.

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,690
你是指第二次世界大戰
You mean World War II.

234
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,600
不知道她是想留著慶祝什么
I wonder what she was saving this for.

235
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,380
要不要嘗嘗
Should we?

236
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,440
拜托  你心底里總還有點玩心吧
Come on. There must be some mischief in you somewhere.

237
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,780
你反對嗎
Do you object?

238
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,630
我沒資格
Not my place.

239
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,770
那你有什么資格
And where exactly is your place?

240
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,790
我明確要求和你們總統會面
I specifically asked to meet with the President.

241
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,940
這里肯定有個開瓶器吧
There must be a corkscrew somewhere, hmm?

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,550
她藏了這么多酒  怎么可能沒有開瓶器呢
She wouldn't keep these bottles in here without one.

243
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,080
-說到敘利亞  總統先生  -請先等等
- When it comes to Syria, Mr. President... - A moment, please.

244
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
先生
Sir...

245
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,380
我們唯一的目標就是保持穩定
our only goal is stability,

246
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,130
為敘利亞人民謀求和平  繁榮
peace, prosperity for the Syrian people.

247
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,700
我們得重新接觸  重開談判
We need to re-engage. We need to re-start talks...

248
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,690
談判
Talks?

249
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,190
就知道談
Talk, talk, talk.

250
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,200
然后一轉臉就去和奈克西斯幕后交易
While you're busy making side deals with Nexis

251
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,380
還有你們那群共和黨朋友
and the rest of your Republican friends.

252
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,510
謝潑德家族
The Shepherds.

253
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,790
他們才是你的主子  是不是
That is who you really work for, isn't it?

254
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,690
我們可以凍結資產
We can freeze assets,

255
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,460
重新啟動制裁
put sanctions back into place.

256
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,380
這會兒
Must be about...

257
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,890
大馬士革是晚上七點半
7:30 at night in Damascus.

258
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,430
如果我們無所作為
If we do nothing,

259
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,630
到天亮  我們兩軍的遭遇戰就會開始
by dawn, skirmishes between our troops and yours will begin.

260
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,970
等到俄軍打死幾個你們美軍士兵
And once Russian soldiers start killing American soldiers,

261
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,110
亂局就會繼續擴大
the chaos will continue.

262
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,770
或者
Or...

263
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,110
我們現在就鋪開敘利亞地圖
we can pull out a map of Syria, right here, right now.

264
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,370
而你和我  亮出帝國主義者的本色
And you and I, like the imperialists we are,

265
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,130
瓜分各自的利益吧
can decide who gets what.

266
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,190
好嗎
Shall we?

267
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,290
我去和總統談談
I'll speak to the President.

268
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,840
誰能拍板
Whoever decides...

269
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,980
你就找誰說去吧
is who you should speak to.

270
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
真是可惜
What a shame.

271
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,590
太可惜了
What a shame.

272
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,760
我和道格談過了  他問了我
I talked to Doug. He asked me,

273
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,120
一開始我還以為他是想掩蓋
and at first I thought he was just covering his tracks,

274
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,150
他與國務卿之死的瓜葛  但是
as far as the Secretary's death, but...

275
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,920
現在我也不知道
Now I wonder...

276
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,790
他的問題是何用意了
the nature of his questions.

277
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,190
女士  我打了幾個電話
Ma'am, I've made some calls.

278
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,270
有些細節對不上
There are some inconsistencies.

279
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,340
她離家的時間  死亡的地點
When she left her house. Where she died.

280
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,380
-等等  什么意思  -我并不是說是假的
- Wait, what are you telling me? - I'm not saying it isn't true...

281
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,440
你等等  慢點說
Just a second, back up.

282
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,200
我只是說還很難確定
It's just hard to be certain is all I'm saying.

283
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,730
-我要你去找到他  -我不能再和他說話了
- I'd like you to go find him. - I can't talk to him again.

284
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,740
我是擔心他會起疑
My fear is he'll become suspicious.

285
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,590
他知道我一向聽話
He knows me as someone who does what he's told.

286
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,920
我不明白  如果不是他  那么
I don't understand, If it's not him, then...

287
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,960
她到底是怎么死的
how did she die, for God's sake?

288
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,330
女士
Ma'am...

289
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,460
我也不知道
I don't know.

290
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,830
謝潑德先生希望你隨時匯報最新情況
Mr. Shepherd would like to be kept informed in real time.

291
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,210
我都有數
It's under control.

292
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,460
那你就更應該跟我們通氣了
Then it shouldn't be a problem to keep us included.

293
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,250
你知道我認識謝潑德家多少年了嗎
Do you understand how long I've known the Shepherds?

294
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,020
不管你和佩特羅夫談什么  都得要他點頭
Whatever you discussed with Petrov needs to be run by him.

295
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,070
我給你上一課  格雷森先生
Let me enlighten you about something, Mr. Grayson.

296
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,700
我和比爾·謝潑德
I do not need you to convey

297
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,710
用不著你在中間傳話  明白了嗎
a message between me and Bill Shepherd, okay?

298
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,290
那更好  只要您  請原諒我唐突
Well, that's preferable, as long as, and forgive me,

299
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,850
不背著他擅自決定敘利亞的事
you make no decisions when it comes to Syria without his say-so.

300
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,300
-步子別邁得太大  先生  -到此為止
- Don't get over your skis, sir. - We're done here.

301
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,570
-我不認為  -副總統說了  到此為止
- I don't think... - The vice president says we are done.

302
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,690
道格·斯坦普
Doug Stamper.

303
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,100
琳達  你還好嗎
Linda. How are you?

304
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,390
-葬禮你沒去  -我去遲了
- You weren't at the funeral. - I arrived late.

305
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,080
退出政壇了吧
Out of politics, I understand?

306
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,740
沃克總統給我安排了很好的去處
President Walker made sure I had a soft landing.

307
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,050
我現在在科羅拉多一所大學
I'm at a university in Colorado,

308
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,630
是個山清水秀的好地方
where the water is fresh and the air is clean.

309
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,540
-聽起來很危險  -沒錯
- Sounds dangerous. - It is.

310
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,370
讓你頭腦太清醒
To think that clearly.

311
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,990
你還好嗎
How are you?

312
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,230
你看過什么了
What have you read?

313
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,810
關于你的嗎
About you?

314
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,700
差不多都看了
Most of it.

315
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,920
至少過去三個月的
The last three months of it.

316
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,190
你所謂的供詞
About your supposed confession.

317
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,050
既然你都看過了  我還有什么好補充的呢
What more could I possibly add that you haven't already read?

318
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,590
能看到的是一回事  真相又是一回事
There's what you read, and there's the truth.

319
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
我并不覺得羞愧
I'm not ashamed.

320
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,340
休養的時光讓我發現了真正的自我
The time away led me to finally realize who I am.

321
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,210
議員知道你的事嗎
Does the congressman know about you?

322
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,060
我是說  真的知道嗎
I mean... know.

323
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,900
有我的幫助  他會成為下一任眾院議長
With my help he's gonna be the next speaker of the House...

324
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,350
我和聯邦檢察官是法學院同學
I went to law school with the US Attorney.

325
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,330
她等夠了
She's tired of waiting.

326
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,030
她明天會簽發一張給你的傳票
She's issuing a subpoena with your name on it sometime tomorrow.

327
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,760
跟她說實話吧
Tell her what you know.

328
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,070
這樣你還有幸存的機會  道格
You have a chance to survive all this, Doug.

329
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,720
塔爾圖斯  是吧
Tartus, da?

330
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,820
但舍棄海岸其余的部分
But the rest of the coast...

331
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,610
我們承受得了嗎
can we afford to let it go?

332
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,790
再見
Goodbye.

333
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,260
能行
It could work.

334
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,860
佩特羅夫計劃把海軍基地
Petrov has plans to expand the Naval base

335
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,310
擴建到塔爾圖斯港
to the port of Tartus.

336
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,510
他支持敘利亞當局的唯一原因
The only reason he's propping up the regime

337
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,280
就是因為他們控制著海岸
is because they control the coast.

338
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,510
他需要港口
He needs the ports.

339
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,440
只要拿港口挾住他
Force him to fight for those

340
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,350
他就會對敘利亞其余地區放手
and he'll leave the rest of Syria alone.

341
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,820
馬克
Mark...

342
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,200
機會來了
the moment is here.

343
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,300
他人在這兒
He's here.

344
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,940
時機不等人啊
It can't wait.

345
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,330
我還是不明白
I still don't understand how

346
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,610
為什么條件還沒有談妥  就已經...
agreements which haven't even been finalized yet...

347
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,900
-不重要  他聽到風聲了  -誰透的風
- Doesn't matter. He got wind of it. - From who?

348
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,870
重點在于  他是個貪婪的
The point is, is he is a greedy...

349
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,920
王八蛋  沒錯
Motherfucker, yes.

350
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,030
貪婪的王八蛋總是會察覺
And greedy motherfuckers always find out.

351
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,930
他不達目的不罷休
He's relentless.

352
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,800
我在西北庫爾德人區待過兩年
I spent two years in the Kurdish northwest,

353
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,070
給東南叛軍賣過武器
outfitted rebels in the southeast.

354
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,440
我知道佩特羅夫能打的所有招數
I know every angle Petrov will keep in play.

355
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,680
他對對手的猶疑極其敏感
He has a sixth sense when it comes to hesitation.

356
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,960
如果你需要我參與...
If you need me to be in there...

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,130
你就是做不到  是不是
You just can't do it, can you?

358
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,330
-什么  -沒什么
- What? - Nothing.

359
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,870
-馬克  -你就是不肯放手信任別人
- Mark... - You just can't step back and trust.

360
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,850
我信任你  馬克
I trust you, Mark.

361
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,230
但是后座總統
But if the backseat president

362
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,260
想掌權  你就得坐到駕駛席上
is gonna take the wheel, you gotta drive.

363
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,030
你和我孤零零一個人是有原因的  簡
There's a reason you and I are alone in the world, Jane.

364
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,630
是  好的
Yes, of course.

365
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,450
-多久沒見了  -就好像一輩子
- How long? - A lifetime.

366
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,050
你搬到西部去了吧  能多陪陪兒子了
You moved out west, right? More time with your son.

367
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,760
只要他肯陪我
As much as he'll give me.

368
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,170
-他還喜歡斯坦...  -克萊爾
- And is he still enjoying Stan... - Claire.

369
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,530
總統女士
Madam President,

370
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,140
我們之間用不著來這套虛的
we don't need to exchange pleasantries.

371
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,430
我如今常想  另一種可能是什么樣子
These days I tend to think a lot about what might have been.

372
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,170
我想道歉
I'd like to apologize.

373
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,690
-為什么  -我最大的悔恨
- For what? - My one regret.

374
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,950
我應該去加夫尼的
I should've been there in Gaffney.

375
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,890
說真的
Honestly,

376
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,650
我心里一直放不下
it's been haunting me.

377
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,060
有件事該告訴他的
There was something he needed to know.

378
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,400
那是個錯誤
It was a mistake.

379
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,980
沒有讓弗蘭西斯當國務卿
Overlooking Francis for secretary of state.

380
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,900
-琳達  都過去了  -不對
- Linda, it's water under the bridge. - No.

381
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,910
不對
No.

382
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,150
如果沒有當初
If we hadn't,

383
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,560
可就說不準了
I don't know.

384
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,030
也許一切都會不一樣了
Maybe everything would have been different.

385
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,980
對誰而言呢
For who?

386
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,450
整個國家
This country.

387
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,440
當然  現在我也沒法對他說了
Obviously, there's no way for me to tell him that now.

388
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,100
但至少我還能對你說
The least I can do is tell you.

389
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,360
你不必這樣的
There is no need for that.

390
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,420
他那些罪行  你打算怎么撇清關系
How do you expect to separate yourself from his crimes?

391
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,250
雖然我們容忍政治變得如此腐敗
As corrupt as these politics we put up with have become...

392
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,670
但反對你的人怎么會不加以利用呢
how can the people against you not use it?

393
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,040
你以為你能清白脫身  克萊爾
You thought you got away with it all, Claire.

394
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,390
但結果還不一定呢
But that remains to be seen.

395
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,490
發生的一切  都是該發生的
Everything happens exactly as it should.

396
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,360
見到你很高興
Nice seeing you.

397
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,410
你在想什么呢
What are you up to?

398
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,500
我在想生死之事
I'm thinking about mortality.

399
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,630
我想今天好多人都在想這件事
I think a lot of us are doing that today.

400
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,630
一會兒要開個會
We're about to have a meeting.

401
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,170
我參與不了  維克多太了解我了
I can't be a part of it. Viktor knows me all too well.

402
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,350
有我呢
I'm on board.

403
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,630
我知道  克萊爾  我告訴馬克不必擔心
Claire, I see you. I told Mark not to worry about it.

404
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,390
但我感覺未必...
But I have an inkling that's not necessarily...

405
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,550
少說什么感覺吧  簡
Spare me your inkling, Jane.

406
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,700
這個交易是為了你好
This deal is for your own good.

407
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,530
是為了整個地區
It's about the whole region.

408
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,890
事關我們的存在  我們的權威
Our presence. Our authority.

409
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,690
重活交給馬克和瑪茜去干吧
Mark and Marcy can do the heavy lifting.

410
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,210
今天就幫我阻止戰爭吧
Help me prevent a war from happening today.

411
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,290
再有任何動蕩  所有人都輸
Any more instability and everybody loses.

412
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,770
幫我避免這種局面吧
Help me avert that.

413
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,160
我向你保證
I promise you...

414
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,870
我會逐漸瓦解比爾和安奈特·謝潑德的影響力
I will chip away at Bill and Annette Shepherd.

415
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,300
因為要想把他們徹底扳倒
Because the only way to truly take them down

416
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,840
就只能步步為營
is one piece at a time.

417
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,130
你認為凱茜到底發生什么了
What do you think really happened to Cathy?

418
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,940
好吧
Okay.

419
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,400
你大概是運氣好吧
I guess you got lucky then.

420
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,670
沒人運氣那么好
No one is that lucky.

421
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,120
總統愿意對海岸歸屬不持異議
the President is willing to leave the coast uncontested.

422
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,230
-塔爾圖斯港  -已經是我們的了
- Tartus... - That port is already ours.

423
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,600
你們可以繼續保留
And will remain so.

424
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,380
我們的軍力將遠離西海岸
We'll keep our forces away from the entire Western coast.

425
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,940
這樣你們就可以自由進出地中海
This will give you unfettered access to the Mediterranean.

426
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,410
-不行  -先生  第六艦隊已經出發了
- No. - Sir, the Sixth Fleet is en route.

427
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,030
-不行  -如果你想引發海軍對峙的話
- No. - If you want a naval standoff...

428
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,230
打住  咱們都不要裝了
No! Let's not pretend.

429
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,960
對你們而言真正重要的是從中取利...
What's really at stake here is your country lining its pockets and...

430
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,290
總統女士
Madam President,

431
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,920
總統先生
Mr. President,

432
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,880
-副總統要求我參會  -格雷森先生
- the vice president asked me to join. - Mr. Grayson...

433
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,910
我代表的是一家
On behalf of a company

434
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,050
-在中東有業務的公司  -你說什么
- with subsidiaries in the Middle East. - Excuse me.

435
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,490
我們希望談判結果能照顧到我方利益
We want to ensure that we're part of the solution.

436
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,800
這將向全世界發出信號  俄羅斯回來了
This will signal to the world that Russia is back.

437
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,450
-俄羅斯回來了  -副總統先生
- Russia's back? - Mr. Vice President,

438
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,500
正在談判的一些條件還需要進一步討論
there are terms being negotiated here that need to be discussed...

439
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,480
天啊
Christ!

440
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,120
要是杜蘭特國務卿還在
If Secretary Durant were here,

441
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,060
我們早就過了假模假式的環節
we'd be long past this posturing

442
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,990
-去解決真正問題了  -沒錯  區域和平
- and dealing with the real question. - Yes, peace in the region.

443
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,920
和平  不是吧
Peace? Really?

444
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,760
你想用和平來決定
You want to use peace to decide

445
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,560
誰來重建這個пиздеть
who will rebuild this pizdets?

446
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,560
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't understand what that means,

447
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,900
-總統先生  -意思是糞坑
- Mr. President. - That means clusterfuck.

448
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,340
先生  維持區域穩定對大家都有好處
Sir, stability in the region helps all of us.

449
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,130
你們想把西部給我  拿走東部
You want to give me the West and take the East?

450
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,700
真是第一次聽說
That's a first.

451
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,690
那么我的條件如下
So, here's what I want.

452
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,940
港口我們當然要
The ports, yes, of course.

453
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,120
但我還要求俄羅斯
But I also want Russian

454
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,440
獨占所有近海石油和天然氣開發
exclusivity on all offshore oil and gas exploration.

455
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,190
-這個得商量一下  -閉嘴吧你
- I think we need to wait. - Shut up.

456
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,420
我們不能進得去
We can't be in a position where we can get in,

457
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,750
卻不能把資源帶出來
and we can't get our resources out.

458
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,240
歷史留給我們的經驗  就是
If history has taught us anything, it's that

459
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,390
美國人總有辦法全身而退
the Americans always find a way to leave,

460
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,370
無論代價多大
no matter what it costs them.

461
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,810
那么
So...

462
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,900
有什么想法嗎  總統女士
thoughts, Madam President?

463
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,460
有話說嗎
Anything?

464
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,420
我同意副總統的看法
I concur with the vice president.

465
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,420
看來我們還有很多需要考慮
I believe we have much to consider.

466
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,730
示弱太累了
Playing incompetent is so exhausting.

467
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,410
這一份是總統今晚
Here's a copy of the President's remarks

468
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,160
在國務卿追悼會上的講話復本
for the secretary's memorial this evening.

469
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,560
我已經有一份了
I already have a copy.

470
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,880
這一份有她在車上做的修改
It includes the changes she made in the car.

471
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,730
好的  謝謝
Right. Thank you.

472
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,440
話說湯姆·耶茨真的失蹤了嗎
Is it true Tom Yates is missing?

473
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,900
看來是
I believe so.

474
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,650
他真的和白宮里的什么人有一腿嗎
Is it true he had an affair with somebody in the White House?

475
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,390
是你嗎
Was it you?

476
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,190
什么
Excuse me.

477
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,560
我會看一看的
I'll look through this.

478
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,280
謝謝
Thank you.

479
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,830
-我不喜歡撒謊的人  -我也是
- I don't like liars. - Me neither.

480
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,220
你為什么讓我以為...
Why would you let me believe...

481
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,490
你似乎想讓我為凱茜的死負責
It seemed like you wanted me to be the one responsible for Cathy.

482
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,980
這可能對你有幫助
That it might be useful to you somehow.

483
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,860
每次我想抽身  就會出什么意外
Every time I plan to quit, something happens.

484
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,850
弗蘭西斯一定對我很失望
Francis would certainly be disappointed in me.

485
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
不是好習慣
Terrible habit.

486
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,790
不過我戒酒時幫了我的忙
Helped me though when I quit drinking.

487
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,070
不要對聯邦檢察官開口  道格
Don't say anything to the US attorney, Doug.

488
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,870
她在和謝潑德家族合作
She's working with the Shepherds.

489
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
我今晚就赦免你
I pardon you tonight,

490
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,060
她手上你的任何把柄就是我的問題了
and anything else she has will be my problem.

491
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,850
我永遠都是你的問題
I'll always be a problem for you.

492
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,850
你還想要我怎樣  道格
What do you want from me, Doug?

493
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,420
現在籌碼都在你的手上
You're the one with all the leverage here.

494
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,650
科爾議員  我讓他跟我一起競選2020
Congressman Cole. I'll put him on my ticket 2020.

495
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,430
馬克一定會走人  我能肯定
Mark won't survive, I'm sure of it.

496
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,310
2024年  布雷特·科爾就是總統
2024, Brett Cole will be the President.

497
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,300
你就能重回白宮
And you will be back in the White House.

498
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,770
我們可以把他推上總統寶座
We can make him president,

499
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,860
就像我們幫弗蘭西斯那樣
just like we did with Francis.

500
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,100
和科爾搭檔的話就是正副不同黨了
Cole will mean a split ticket.

501
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,780
也許這正是我們國家最需要的呢
And that might be the very best thing for this country.

502
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,430
那你也得赦免弗蘭西斯
Pardon Francis as well.

503
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,600
那我就會被彈劾
If I do that, I could get impeached.

504
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,810
不會
No.

505
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,990
你總能活下來  你已經證明了這一點
You're a survivor. You've proven that much.

506
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,650
赦免他
Pardon him as well.

507
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,000
比爾絕對無法接受
Bill's gonna hate anything

508
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,030
跟克里姆林宮任何形式的合作
even approaching a partnership with the Kremlin.

509
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,980
記仇的是他妹妹
It's his sister who holds a grudge.

510
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,650
但你還是沒有選擇
But still, you have no choice.

511
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,300
以我的經驗  一旦混亂演變成了萬劫不復
I mean, in my experience, once the chaos tips into forever,

512
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,370
你也會一無所獲
you've got nothing.

513
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,370
而我們離萬劫不復就差一點了
And we're very close to forever.

514
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,140
她什么都沒說
And she said nothing.

515
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,910
你真的很在意  是不是
It really bothers you, doesn't it?

516
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,540
那些讓你看不透的人
When you can't figure a person out.

517
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,130
-尤其是你喜歡的  -天啊  你說什么呢
- Especially when you're attracted. - Oh, my God, what are you...

518
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,170
我和克萊爾·安德伍德沒有私情
I am not involved with Claire Underwood.

519
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,940
我說的是安奈特
I'm talking about Annette.

520
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,930
我現在和任何人都沒有戀愛關系
I'm not involved with anyone at the moment.

521
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,920
每次看見你們兩個在一起  都讓我想起往事
Every time I see the both of you together, it brings back memories.

522
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,150
真沒想到你也會從幕后走上前臺
Never thought you'd step out from behind the scenes.

523
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,200
只要我能為國出力就行  議員
Well, wherever I can do the most good, Congressman.

524
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,530
他可真是一點都沒變
He hasn't changed. Not at all.

525
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,900
是好事  也是壞事
Blessing and a curse.

526
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,510
你為我做的一切  我都沒忘
I haven't forgotten everything you did for me.

527
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,980
不管有我沒我  你都成功進了眾議院
Oh, you made it to the House with or without me.

528
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,420
是你帶我上的道
You showed me the way.

529
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,490
那么
Well...

530
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,730
我一直想來打個招呼
I've been meaning to say hello,

531
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,030
自從你脫黨加入對方之后
ever since you left the party and went to the other side.

532
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,270
簡
Jane.

533
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,270
得有十多年沒和他說話了
Haven't spoken to him in over a decade.

534
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,320
他知道了
He knows.

535
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,970
他知道我參與其中了
He knows I was involved.

536
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,310
難道你沒有嗎
Well, weren't you?

537
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,410
你我都有啊
Weren't we?

538
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,430
你上次去我家是什么時候
When's the last time you were in my house?

539
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,030
別
Don't.

540
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,710
馬克  我不會再去了
Mark, I'm not going back there.

541
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,610
不是
No, no,

542
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,190
和湯姆·耶茨有私情的是新任新聞發言人
Tom Yates was sleeping with the new press secretary

543
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,480
就在白宮里
in the White House.

544
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,240
他拿東部換西部
He traded the East for the West.

545
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,720
是  所有近海油氣開采  先生
Yes, all offshore oil and gas exploration, sir.

546
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,610
他們說我們仍可以進入
They're saying we'll still have access,

547
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,660
但所有通過地中海的航運都會受影響
but all shipping through the Mediterranean will be affected.

548
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,650
而且無法否認  我們將得看他們的臉色
And there's no denying we'll be somewhat at their mercy.

549
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,050
因為根本沒時間請示您
Because there wasn't time to consult you.

550
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,180
佩特羅夫加了碼
Petrov upped the ante

551
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,220
似乎副總統要讓步了
and it looks like the vice president is going to cave.

552
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,870
這個問題不難回答  斯圖爾特小姐
It's not a complicated question, Miss Stewart.

553
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,830
你有沒有和他上床
Were you sleeping with him?

554
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,840
難道還要我說
Do I need to say

555
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,360
本屆政府是在你身上賭了一把嗎
this administration has taken a huge chance on you?

556
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,060
-你們到底有沒有  -跟你沒關系
- Were you sleeping... - It is none of your business.

557
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,840
那就不言自明了
That answers that, then.

558
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,020
這種事正是白宮需要...
This is exactly the kind of thing the White House needs...

559
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,540
避免的
to avoid.

560
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,940
湯姆·耶茨又失蹤了
And Tom Yates is missing.

561
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,090
只會讓整件事情變得更加可疑
Which only makes the whole story more problematic.

562
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,810
我完全不知道這些流言是哪來的
I have no idea where any of this is coming from.

563
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,910
那我建議你否認的方式更有說服力一些
Well, I suggest you find a more convincing way of denying it.

564
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,780
因為你最大的弱點就是不會撒謊  是不是
Because your inability to lie is a liability, right?

565
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,120
我們的總統又在哪呢
Now, where is our president?

566
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,260
你怎么不告訴他們是我邀請你來的呢
Why didn't you tell them I invited you?

567
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,140
你沒有出賣我
You didn't rat me out.

568
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,110
你這口氣像黑幫  總統女士
You sound like a gangster, Madam President.

569
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,500
大概是好奇吧
Curiosity, I suppose.

570
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,160
我想看看你怎么做
I wanted to watch you

571
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,900
聽聽他們怎么說
and hear them.

572
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,460
你的副總統主子太多
Your vice president is serving too many masters.

573
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,990
很奇怪吧
Strange, hmm?

574
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,990
弗蘭西斯剛走  凱茜也走了
Cathy passing away so soon after Francis.

575
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
俗話說  死人成三
Death usually comes in threes.

576
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,150
直到又死了第四個  第五個
Except when it comes in fours or fives.

577
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,570
你現在自由了嗎  總統女士
Are you free now, Madam President?

578
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,530
還沒有
Not quite.

579
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,860
他們的提案  你滿意嗎
Were you happy with what they proposed?

580
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,840
我主要是好奇
Mostly, I'm just curious.

581
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,970
好奇什么
About what?

582
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,250
好奇你有什么提議  所以你才邀請我來吧
What you're about to offer. That is why you invited me.

583
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,320
所以我才應邀前來
And that is why I said yes.

584
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,890
奈克西斯安保公司
Well, Nexis Securities

585
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,390
或任何與謝潑德無限責任公司有關的承包商
or any other contractor connected to Shepherd Unlimited

586
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,430
在我任內都將被禁止進入敘利亞
will never be allowed in Syria while I'm president.

587
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,730
這個手段很強硬啊
That's a strong declaration.

588
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,270
有關投標將經過我的批準
Bids will be contingent on my approval.

589
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,370
油氣和港口可以都歸你
You can have the oil and gas, the ports.

590
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,240
以及轉運資源利潤的20%
And 20% of profits from the resources passing through.

591
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,420
這
That's...

592
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,680
還真是慷慨啊
That's quite a taste.

593
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,300
沒準你真是黑幫呢
Maybe you are a gangster.

594
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,250
那么你打算
And how will you...

595
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,980
怎么為自己的立場辯護呢
defend your position?

596
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,810
和平
Peace.

597
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,190
咱們兩個國家這一百年來
Isn't that what our two countries

598
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,910
不是一直以此為借口來開脫
have used to justify what we've done

599
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,740
我們在那個地區做的事嗎
in the region for over a hundred years?

600
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,460
和平言過其實了  克萊爾
Peace is overrated, Claire.

601
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,540
我的副總統的承諾也是一樣
So are my vice president's promises.

602
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,120
但你的開價似乎太大方了
And yet, yours seem too generous.

603
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,540
你丈夫肯定會被這一天的
Your husband would have lost himself

604
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,200
榮耀沖昏了頭
in the brightness of this day,

605
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,750
被他追求的形象蒙住了眼
blinded by how he needed to be seen.

606
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,380
這總讓他代價慘重
That always cost him.

607
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,840
容我問下
Can I ask?

608
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,590
既然你已經知道了
If you knew this...

609
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,020
為什么還要嫁給他
why did you marry him?

610
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,720
你真的知道嗎
Do you even know?

611
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,830
后來才發現
As it turns out...

612
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,880
我丈夫也只是實現目的的手段而已
my husband was a means to an end.

613
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,480
告訴你主子  我不會作證了
Tell the people you work for that I'm not going to testify.

614
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,420
等等
A second.

615
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,500
賽斯
Seth.

616
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,670
賽斯  你聽見了嗎
Seth, do you hear me?

617
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,540
走開吧  道格
Back off, Doug.

618
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,730
不管你告訴他們什么  都跟我無關
Whatever you told them, I'll have no part of it.

619
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,630
聯邦檢察官可以給我發傳票  她可以...
The U.S. Attorney can subpoena me. She can try to...

620
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,650
我不干了
I'm done.

621
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,670
你真是不識好歹啊
You wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked you in the face.

622
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,650
我都不知道我為什么要幫你
I don't know why I'm trying to help you.

623
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,480
你已經不在白宮了  道格
You're not in the White House anymore, Doug.

624
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,390
你去哪了
Where were you?

625
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,780
總統也有三急的  馬克
Even presidents need to pee, Mark.

626
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,750
最近有一些流言
Look, there's a rumor flying around.

627
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,550
-是好事嗎  -很容易打消
- Was it good? - It's easily dismissible.

628
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,770
我還和國安局談了談  沒用的  克萊爾
Then I talked to NSA. It's not gonna work, Claire.

629
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,120
白宮緋聞解決不了這件事的
Some White House affair is not gonna make it go away.

630
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,910
死去的人并不會徹底死去  馬克
The dead never really stay dead, Mark.

631
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,500
他們會活在愛他們的人心中
Not for the people who loved them.

632
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,390
-抱歉  -抱歉
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

633
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,900
你又長高了嗎
Did you get taller?

634
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,660
是啊
Yes.

635
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,250
真奇怪
So strange

636
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,220
有拿破侖情結[矮子更暴力]的人居然會長高
for someone trapped in a Napoleon complex.

637
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,700
可惜你的個性和外表不相稱  簡·戴維斯
If only your personality matched your looks, Jane Davis.

638
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,900
我實在是沒想到  你居然會把談判
I was surprised you left negotiations

639
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,300
交給你的代理  西格森小姐
to your surrogate Ms. Siegerson.

640
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,130
自己的意見還是自己來說比較好
Always best to speak for oneself.

641
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,780
你還有臉說我
That's rich, coming from you.

642
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,300
說一套做一套簡直是你的母語
Doublespeak is your mother tongue.

643
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
那巧言詭辯便是你的母語了
And subterfuge is yours.

644
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,050
你和你的那些機構
You and your agencies, hmm?

645
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,190
中情局不過就是文化恐怖分子
The CIA is nothing short of a cultural terrorist.

646
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,200
你這樣的人
It's men like you...

647
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,480
闖進自己一無所知的國家
Barging into countries you know nothing about.

648
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,600
-你真是讓我受不了  -亂中取利
- You get under my skin. - Profiting from destabilization.

649
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,970
留下的只有一片廢墟
Leaving nothing but ruin in your wake.

650
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,180
-簡直是毒藥  -結果你們還生氣了
- It's chemical, it's... - And then you're offended...

651
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,640
你們生氣的是  是我的軍隊  我的空襲
You're offended when it's my men, my air strikes,

652
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,090
-恢復了秩序  -毒藥
- that bring some kind of order. - Chemical!

653
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,310
你就是一個穿著定制西裝的共產黨
You are nothing but a communist in a handmade suit.

654
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,540
一頭豬
A pig!

655
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,810
這么情緒化
So emotional.

656
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,470
情緒化可談不成事的  簡
Emotions make deals come apart, Jane.

657
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,250
告訴我
Tell me,

658
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,310
我憑什么要相信你參與的交易
why should I trust any deal that involves you?

659
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,670
我將不眠不休
I will not rest

660
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,130
直到把你扳倒  維克多
until you're done, Viktor.

661
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,470
直到你死
Dead and buried.

662
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,870
-混蛋  -那...
- Bastard! - Then I guess...

663
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,740
你就熬著吧
you'll never rest.

664
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,590
好了  我的指令很明確
Okay. My directions were clear.

665
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,760
-當然  -那你還有哪里不懂的
- No doubt. - So where's the confusion?

666
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,590
大概是不太明白什么事是你希望發生的
Well, I'm guessing somewhere between what you wanted to happen

667
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,850
什么事是必須發生的吧
and what had to happen.

668
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,530
如果你不希望我打給比爾
If you didn't want me to call Bill,

669
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,810
那你就不該給我聯系他的理由
you shouldn't have given me a reason to.

670
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,050
你根本沒資格參與談判
There was no place for you in that room.

671
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,400
除非你給我足夠的尊重
And unless you show some proper respect,

672
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,190
否則我讓你滾出華盛頓
no place for you in this whole fucking town.

673
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,700
我會親自確保這一點
I'll see to that personally.

674
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,270
我記住了
I'll keep that in mind.

675
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,030
從現在起  乖乖待著  閉上嘴巴
From now on, stay in your lane, keep your mouth shut,

676
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,680
除非我讓你開口  聽見了嗎
unless I say otherwise. You got it?

677
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,630
再說一遍  聽得很清楚
Again, coming in clear,

678
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,650
但我才不在乎
but not a dent.

679
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,640
沒關系  我們會處好的
It's okay, we'll get there.

680
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,340
就算處不來  我有什么好在乎的
Even if we don't, fuck do I care?

681
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,560
我又不為你工作
I don't work for you.

682
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,450
我和你都是他的人
We both work for him.

683
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,980
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper.

684
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,570
我們一般只在精心安排的場合才見面
We usually meet under more orchestrated circumstances.

685
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,320
當然  這次也算是精心安排了
Not that this isn't one of those, as well.

686
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,000
你最近都在忙些什么
Where do you find yourself these days?

687
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,700
為一位很有上進心的眾議員做顧問
Consulting for an ambitious Congressman.

688
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,950
中期選舉要到了
Midterms are coming.

689
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,510
我想
I bet...

690
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,850
他肯定不知道你對黑暗多么適應吧
he has no idea how well you see in the dark.

691
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,900
你最怕的是誰
Who do you fear most?

692
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,570
在所有人中
Out of all of them.

693
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,560
她
Her.

694
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,010
這種場合  我也吃不下去
I can't eat at these things, either.

695
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,420
餐點做得非常好看
The spread looks lovely. Everything.

696
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,790
你們真是盡心了
You all did right by her.

697
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,300
我什么都沒做
Well, I didn't do a thing.

698
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,540
都是斯坦安排的
Stan took care of all of it.

699
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,010
你還好嗎
How you holding up?

700
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,670
我就是想不通
I can't make sense of it.

701
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,480
我父親也是這么走的
My dad went the same way, you know?

702
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,510
一輩子沒生過病  結果
Never sick a day in his life. And then...

703
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,640
正開著車呢就走了
Right when he was driving,

704
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,410
-車子歪到了對向車道上  -天啊
- just drifted onto oncoming traffic. - Jesus.

705
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,260
-我的天  -我還得趕緊抓住方向盤
- Oh, my goodness. - I had to quickly grab the wheel

706
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,240
把車拐到路邊上
and swerved us over to the shoulder.

707
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,540
你那時多大
How old were you?

708
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,050
12歲
Twelve.

709
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,450
12歲  挺難過的吧
Twelve. That's rough.

710
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,550
幾歲不難過呢
It's all rough.

711
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,770
12歲  21歲
Twelve. Twenty-one.

712
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,180
51歲
Fifty-one.

713
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,000
你不可能準備好的
You're never ready.

714
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,340
周三下午她打電話給我
Wednesday afternoon she calls me, as she does.

715
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,050
說她頭疼
Said her head hurt.

716
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,680
好像是偏頭疼厲害了  所以她
Like migraine bad, so she...

717
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,870
要去見她的私人醫生
was headed to her personal doctor.

718
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,020
我回電過去問她的情況
I call back to see how she was doing.

719
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,010
斯坦就告訴我了
Stan hits me with it.

720
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,270
她連辦公室都沒撐到  人在車里就沒了
She didn't even make it to the office. It happened in the car.

721
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,270
所以我就搭最早的飛機過來了
So, I got on the first flight out.

722
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,530
沒事的
Hey, it's okay.

723
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,190
道格說得對
Doug's right.

724
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,880
哭出來吧
It's fine, let it out.

725
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,870
飛機降落時  就全都安排完了
By the time I landed, it was all done.

726
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,820
遺體也
Body was...

727
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,370
就是送去...
whatever, at the place...

728
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,000
火化了
to get cremated.

729
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,720
也沒做尸檢  什么都沒有
No autopsy, nothing.

730
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,540
斯坦做得急匆匆的
Stan made it happen so fast.

731
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,810
只有我控制不住情緒
And I'm the only one who can't keep shit together.

732
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,370
但我就是
But it's just...

733
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,760
連最后一面都沒見著
I never got the chance to see her.

734
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,270
都沒來得及告別
To say goodbye.

735
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,990
實在抱歉  讓你們見笑了
I'm sorry. You all didn't ask for any of this.

736
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,130
-不會的  -我們理解
- No. Please. - We get it.

737
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,240
是  道格·斯坦普和總統似乎很合拍
Yes, Doug Stamper and the President seem very much in sync.

738
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,570
我本想出席國務卿的追悼會
I was hoping to attend the secretary's memorial as well,

739
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,340
但我的時間太緊
but my time is limited.

740
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,980
你遠道而來就已經意義重大了
It was meaningful that you traveled all this way.

741
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,050
你說的話  我一直在考慮
I've been thinking about what you said to me.

742
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,020
我接受
I accept.

743
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,690
我真是太高興了
I'm so happy to hear that.

744
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,580
還有  湯姆·耶茨
One other thing. Tom Yates.

745
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,560
他的事  都是你政府做的
Your government was behind whatever happened to him.

746
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,870
做總統就不能有人性
Presidents aren't allowed to be human.

747
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,050
你必須得選  要權力  還是愛
You have to choose. Power or love.

748
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,610
選哪個從一開始就非常明顯了
That was very clear from the beginning.

749
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,560
原諒我吧  湯姆·耶茨
Forgive me, Tom Yates.

750
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,130
我就要極盡污蔑你
I'm about to drag you through the mud

751
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,210
否認你我之間的感情
to deny we ever happened.

752
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,590
我要再次殺死你
I'm killing you for the second time.

753
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,040
總有一天  你會安息的
One day, you'll rest in peace.

754
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,100
總統女士
Madam President.

755
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,760
女士  有件事我要告訴您
Ma'am, I have to tell you

756
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,860
-最近有一些流言  -我知道
- there are rumors circulating... - I know, I know.

757
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,860
如果您需要我辭職
If you need me to resign...

758
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,840
凱爾茜  你什么都不用做
Kelsey, you're not going anywhere.

759
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,250
愿意的話就去我那  待多久都行
You can stay at my place as long as you like.

760
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,030
太感謝了
I appreciate it.

761
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,370
在貝爾波特待了半個月
Two weeks in Bellport

762
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,670
我可是山窮水盡了
tapped me out.

763
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,690
你們報社可以補助一些啊
Well, your paper will cover some of that.

764
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,310
他們可沒報銷這回事  湯姆
They don't do expenses, Tom.

765
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,200
而且我媽錢也不多了
And my mom didn't have much to leave.

766
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,610
我喜歡這篇文章
I liked the piece.

767
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,800
很有力
It was strong.

768
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,040
打算怎么跟進
What's your follow-up?

769
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,380
環保署又沒人能證實
Well, it's not like anybody at the EPA can confirm.

770
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,520
既然郵件是真的  那就肯定有人收到了
Well, if the emails exist, they went to somebody.

771
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,700
是  可我唯一的消息源不接電話
Yeah, but my only source won't return my calls.

772
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,290
他每天還得上班
He's gotta show up to work every day.

773
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,160
他害怕  也該害怕
He's afraid. He should be.

774
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,130
不如就從應用入手吧
Follow up with the app.

775
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,680
格雷森在場  慫恿驚魂未定的人們注冊
Grayson was there, signing up people who were very scared.

776
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,810
他們利用了危機
They took advantage of a crisis.

777
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,670
-謝潑德家族  -不道德  但也不違法
- The Shepherds. - It's unethical, but it's not illegal.

778
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,290
該死
Oh, shit.

779
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,120
賓夕法尼亞大道封路了
They shut down Pennsylvania Avenue.

780
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,180
這上面說走馬薩諸塞大道
It says to take Massachusetts.

781
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,910
好
All right.

782
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,950
今天是凱茜·杜蘭特的追悼會
It's Cathy Durant's memorial today.

783
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,110
死的人越來越多了
The bodies are adding up.

784
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,010
湯姆  一開始我們以為這么做是正確的
Tom, from the very beginning, we did what we thought was right.

785
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,500
至少當時是正確的
At the time, anyway.

786
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,520
所以我們才都淪落到這輛車里了嗎
Is that how we ended up in this car together?

787
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,390
你不能怨你自己
Look, you cannot blame yourself for...

788
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,130
怨我做得還不夠嗎  為什么不呢
For not doing enough. Why not?

789
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,090
我為什么不怨自己
Why shouldn't I?

790
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,070
瑞秋·波斯納
Rachel Posner?

791
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,230
有人頂著她的名頭
Somebody with her name

792
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,210
在新墨西哥到處消費
is bouncing checks in and around New Mexico.

793
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,220
是  如果什么都查不出來呢
Yeah. And if it leads to nowhere?

794
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,300
你以后有沒有可能
Will you ever be able to...

795
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,880
放棄
leave it?

796
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,670
如果事實越來越查不清楚的話
If the truth starts to fade away?

797
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,470
說實話
Truthfully...

798
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,060
我也不知道
I don't know.

799
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,930
布加耶夫聯系我了  20%
I just heard from Bugayev. 20%?

800
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,540
我還沒告訴馬克和其他人
I haven't told Mark and the rest yet.

801
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,900
你肯定會成眾矢之的的
Just know you'll be crucified.

802
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,100
和我現在的處境有什么不同嗎
Yes, and how will I feel the difference?

803
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,880
你不應該把我排除在外
You shouldn't have excluded me.

804
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,500
你和克萊爾是怎么回事
What's going on with you and Claire?

805
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,980
我只能假設  你入院期間
Look, I can only assume while you were away

806
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,410
有人替你解釋過什么叫瘋狂
somebody broke down the definition of insanity.

807
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,440
如果沒有  那我提醒提醒你
If not, here's a refresher.

808
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,560
瘋狂就是一遍遍重復同樣的蠢事
Doing the same shit over and over

809
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,590
期望著會有不同的結果
and expecting different results.

810
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,410
我不知道她究竟對你說了什么
Yeah, I don't know what she told you

811
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,540
會引發這么嚴重的失憶癥
to induce such amnesia,

812
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,320
但如果你真的還想走上那條路的話
but if you're seriously looking down that road again,

813
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,310
那關于弗蘭西斯的遺囑  有件事你應該知道
there is something that you should know about Francis' will.

814
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,390
她告訴你遺囑里寫什么了嗎
Has she told you what's in it?

815
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,640
誰告訴你的
Who told you?

816
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,030
換了是我  就不會問這個問題
If I were you, that's not the question I'd be asking right now.

817
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,530
我會問  "她為什么不告訴我真相"
I'd be asking, "Why is she keeping me from the truth?"

818
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,940
他留給你的可不止兩個袖扣
He left you more than those cuff links.

819
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:49,930
不客氣  道格
You're welcome, Doug.

820
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,340
安德伍德總統
President Underwood,

821
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,770
我是布雷特·科爾
Brett Cole.

822
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,470
我認識你
Yes, I know who you are.

823
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,370
我就當這是褒揚了
I'll take that as a compliment.

824
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,290
總統女士  您應該上臺了
Madam President, you should make your way to the stage.

825
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,830
好的  謝謝你
Yes, of course. Thank you.

826
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,860
道格
Doug.

827
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,090
-有空談談吧  -好的  女士
- Speak soon? - Yes, ma'am.

828
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,860
你有什么需要告訴我的嗎
Anything you need to tell me now?

829
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,750
沒什么  沒有
Nope, nothing.

830
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,920
你父親的那個故事  是真的嗎
That story about your father, is that true?

831
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,880
有關系嗎
Does it matter?

832
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,740
如果是真的  那說明了很多
Well, if it's true, it explains a lot.

833
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,250
如果是假的  也說明了很多
If it's not, it explains a lot.

834
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,110
-謝謝您能來  -節哀順變
- Thank you for coming. - Sorry.

835
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,180
謝謝
I appreciate it.

836
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,770
請節哀順變
So sorry.

837
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,350
見到你很高興
Good to see you.

838
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,180
三十年兢兢業業  在險惡的外交戰場
To weather the slings and arrows of 30 years of service

839
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,470
她那標志性的堅強和正直  卻不失分毫
and not lose a fraction of one's signature grit and integrity,

840
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,630
這已經不只是一份遺產
that's not a legacy,

841
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,570
更是一個奇跡
that's a miracle.

842
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,170
凱瑟琳·杜蘭特不只是一位國務卿
But Catherine Durant wasn't just a Secretary of State.

843
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,450
更是我的姐妹
She was a sister.

844
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,520
為什么還沒有人去家里
Why isn't someone on the house right now?

845
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,180
那你聽錯了
Well, then you heard wrong.

846
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,500
沒錯  全天候
That's right. Day and night.

847
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,430
沒錯  每分每秒
Yes, every second

848
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,760
直到他搭C130飛到瑞士
until he is on the C-130 to Switzerland.

849
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,000
不行不行  不要預計
No, no, no. No ETAs.

850
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,590
把日期時間說準了
Hard dates and times.

851
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,010
沒錯
Correct.

852
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,950
不
No.

853
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,280
我親自去安納西接他
I'll be the one to intercept him in Annecy.

854
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,470
好  好的
Yes, of course.

855
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,980
錢一匯過來  我就付給你
As soon as the money is wired, you'll be taken care of.

857
00:50:49,550 --> 00:51:49,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}自特朗普在2016年大選中意外擊敗希拉里
成為美國史上最大的政治黑馬后  希拉里所在的民主黨
就一直指責特朗普團隊在競選期間
暗中勾結俄羅斯  破壞大選的公正性
特朗普2017年炒掉聯調局局長科米后  司法部成立了"專案組"
任命前聯調局局長穆勒為獨立檢察官  領導對"通俄門"指控的調查
經過一年多的調查  穆勒及其團隊已經對17個人進行了正式的起訴
包括俄羅斯網絡黑客  前特朗普競選團隊成員  以及前競選組織主席
另外紐約州的司法部還對特朗普的私人律師進行了起訴
過去一年里  穆勒團隊的主要策略是以輕罪起訴被調查的嫌疑人
想靠給這些人施壓  來換取他們的合作
讓他們供出一些特朗普的猛料來換取自身的自由

859
00:51:49,550 --> 00:52:49,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}同時穆勒還在爭取直接詢問特朗普的機會
數月來一直在同白宮特朗普的律師團商談相關的詢問具體方式和時間
而支持特朗普的一些司法評論人士一直警告特朗普不能輕易上鉤
因為在接受特別檢察官詢問時  稍有不慎  很容易被定下個"妨礙司法"罪
當年比爾·克林頓總統同白宮實習生有染的丑聞被曝光后
并不是因為"生活問題"
而是因為接受大陪審團詢問時"妨礙司法"而被彈劾
目前美國媒體認為
在11月初的中期選舉之后  穆勒的調查將進入收尾階段
屆時專案組是否會對特朗普進行起訴  將會成為全球媒體關注的焦點
而既然民主黨已在中期選舉中奪回了眾議院控制權
即使穆勒的調查結論
無法確定特朗普競選團隊是否同俄羅斯有暗中交易
民主黨仍很有可能會尋找機會啟動彈劾特朗普的程序
