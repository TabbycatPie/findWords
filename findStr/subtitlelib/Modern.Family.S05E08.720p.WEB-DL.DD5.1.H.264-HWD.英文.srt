1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,320
How the hell did they lose our reservation.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,410
Dad, you were married to mom for thirty years.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,740
It's just a couple of nights on the couch.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
I'm gonna call for the Con.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,110
I'm gonna try to squeeze them on that $9.95 wifi fee.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,130
They're selling air.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,130
ClosetCon is the premier north American trade show

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,750
for the closet industry.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,080
I stopped going years ago

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,790
'cause it's a trade show for the closet industry.

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,880
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,930
This schedule is incredible.

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,420
Dad, there's a 10:45 session

14
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,830
on sustainable materials.

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,520
We have got to hit that.

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,360
Mm, but it overlaps with the 11:00 a.m. panel on paneling.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,020
And a breakout session on shoe storage.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,860
Little advice --

19
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,530
the convention floor is for suckers.

20
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,110
All work is done at the bar --

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,240
Unless Tony G. and Layla are singing standards,

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,520
in which case, no work -- prepare to be entertained.

23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,930
Dad, I came here to learn,

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,050
not sit at the bar and drink.

25
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,840
You do what you want. I'm getting a scotch.

26
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,030
Well, I do need to meet everybody.

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,740
Ooh, good. Breakfast.

28
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,700
Breakfast? Try lunch.

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,510
- We wake up early on the farm. - Sure do.

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,270
There's our sleepy city mouse.

31
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,100
Let's get you all squared away here.

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,270
Yeah, I-I got it. No, I got it.

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,320
Down here. I'm good. I'm good. Now, I know --

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,100
You know, I forgot how

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,850
much work there was to be done around here.

36
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,660
I've been mending fence all morning.

37
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,140
Been mending, have you?

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,110
Missouri.

39
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,220
Misery.

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,500
- What a pig sty, huh? - Cute.

41
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,210
Daddy went to town, he's gonna be there till super,

42
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,670
so I'm helping mama slop the pigs.

43
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,950
You want to -- you want to pitch in?

44
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,360
I don't know, I just ate that bacon, so...

45
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,660
How's that gonna look?

46
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,930
Want to ring the dinner bell, "Little bomber"?

47
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh, that's actually really quaint.

48
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,110
Is it one of those little triangle thi--

49
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,760
Loudest call in the tri-county area.

50
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,860
Do it again!

51
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,110
No, sweetheart. I think once was enough.

52
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,300
There's actually an animal that runs toward that sound, huh?

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,690
Hello, hello!

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,800
- Did you make the reservation? - Yeah, 7:00.

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,750
Fun family time with this little newsy

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,390
and a steak dinner.

57
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,380
Who says people at the closet convention get all the fun?

58
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,160
No one. No one says that.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,490
I am telling you, the way he looked at me

60
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,450
when I came to the door -- it is so on.

61
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,240
Kind of seemed like he was just delivering pizza,

62
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,220
and you were giving him money.

63
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,430
What are you guys talking about?

64
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,940
Chuck, the pizza guy from last night.

65
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,670
He's shy and thoughtful

66
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,030
and wears a Princeton sweatshirt --

67
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,080
Hardly Haley's type.

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh, my God. You love him.

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,040
What? No! I d-- how would you say I love him?

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,420
He's been to our house exactly three times.

71
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,120
That's ridiculous, Haley! Don't even look at me.

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,270
This is so stupid.

73
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,010
She loves him.

74
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,500
Hey, "Manimal." How was picture day?

75
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,460
You know what's super-helpful?

76
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,670
When the guy in line behind you calls you "Mount Sweatmore."

77
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,140
I was trying to relax you.

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,810
It was right in front of you

79
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,040
-- "Brad Pitt-Stains."

80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,930
- Come on, Luke. - It's okay.

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,750
New security system?

82
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,800
You can see the backyard,

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,820
the front door, the garage -- everywhere.

84
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,370
Yeah, can't take any chances

85
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,800
since mom gave birth to

86
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,310
the hope diamond over there.

87
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,110
There is a room off the kitchen at Jay's house

88
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,520
that's always locked.

89
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
I try it every time I'm there.

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,090
I've spent countless hours imagining that that room

91
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,850
is a house of treasure...

92
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,120
a palace of ceaseless wonder.

93
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,990
It's real.

94
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,050
Hello, old friend.

95
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,260
Would you look at that?

96
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,450
What?! That's coconuts!

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,260
No!

98
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,660
Is that --

99
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,940
A replica of Apollo 13.

100
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,910
Look at the detail.

101
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,290
You can almost see the astronauts

102
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,860
drinking teeny, tiny Tang.

103
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,290
- Can I hold it? - No.

104
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,070
You have any idea how valuable this is?

105
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,020
And your fingers are covered in cheese dust.

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,630
There.

107
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,480
- No! Luke, please! - Hey, guys. Knock it off.

108
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,740
Don't worry, Gloria. I got it.

109
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,740
Nobody panic!!

110
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,000
This is a collector's edition. It's 40 years old!

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,490
We're gonna have to improvise.

112
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,220
Gloria, call the steakhouse and cancel.

113
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,120
Manny, find some glue.

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,510
Luke, let's get these parts into the garage.

115
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,710
I know this seems impossible,

116
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,890
but we can do this!

117
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,720
Hello. Houston's?

118
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,990
We have a situation.

119
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,410
Hi. We're with ClosetCon. All-access.

120
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,410
She doesn't care. You're the only dope wearing that here.

121
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,010
- Give it to me. - No. I like it.

122
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,910
Hey. Joel.

123
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,390
Looking good, my friend.

124
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,540
Took a bath on automated closets.

125
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,510
People aren't ready for that.

126
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,550
Jay Pritchett. Get your cute butt over here.

127
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,130
- Who's that? - An old friend.

128
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,370
I'm gonna go say hello. Why don't you get us a couple drinks?

129
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,760
Yeah. I'll do that.

130
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,600
Hi. Can I get a scotch and a white wine?

131
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
Wow, rowdy crowd, huh?

132
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,740
Trade shows -- people get away from their families,

133
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,460
- get a little liquored up. - Yeah, I get that.

134
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,370
Let's just say when the nametags go on,

135
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,630
the wedding rings come off.

136
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,430
I am not so on board with that.

137
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,850
Hey, there.

138
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,400
Classy.

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Let me just fix this. You're looking so great.

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,650
My mom was pretty self-involved,

141
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,220
and my dad traveled a lot for work.

142
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,400
So, yeah, I did wonder if... you know.

143
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,240
And not that I could blame him.

144
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,240
My friend Alison's mom

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,030
greeted her every day after school

146
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,020
with a big hug and a giant smile,

147
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,920
And I always thought, "Yeah...

148
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,080
wouldn't mind a piece of that."

149
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,780
- So, are we doing this? - I'll bring it to your room this afternoon.

150
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,460
We have a little tradition at ClosetCon for rookies,

151
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,790
which Claire is this year.

152
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,980
We take a skeleton. We hide it in their closet.

153
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,810
They open the door and scream,

154
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,870
and we all have a good laugh.

155
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,320
Can't take full credit for the idea.

156
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,330
We stole it from CabinetCon.

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,100
Hot cider.

158
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh, yes. Thank you, Barb.

159
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
- Thank you so much. - It's chilly.

160
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Mmm. Wow, that's got a kick.

161
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,620
That'll be the rum.

162
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,150
I can feel it warming up your belly.

163
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,900
Yeah, still in my mouth and throat.

164
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,610
Well, what's that?

165
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,550
Boy, it starting to get nippy, huh?

166
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,270
You guys want to walk down to the duck pond?

167
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,580
Um -- that sounds lovely. I'll get the gun.

168
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,970
- Are y'all coming? - "Y'all"?

169
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,970
- We don't say "Y'all"! - Yeah, we do.

170
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,210
No, well, yeah, we say it... here, but not normally.

171
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,100
Well, did you ever think this is how I really talk

172
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,640
and that I talk different-like when I'm not here?

173
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,610
Y'all fighting?

174
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,680
No, no, sweetie, we're just having a conversation

175
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,230
about how your daddy can be so stuck-up.

176
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,490
Cam, that's really mature.

177
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,760
Use our daughter to get your little digs in.

178
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,110
I would never do that, sweetie.

179
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,100
You don't think I notice

180
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,880
how condescending you are when we come here?

181
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,820
You just set on the porch. You roll your eyes.

182
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,690
You don't participate in anything.

183
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,830
And, yeah, I said "Set."

184
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,470
But that's how we talk here.

185
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,470
I'm from this place. I'm proud of this place.

186
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,310
And it hurts me that the man I love just thinks it's some big joke.

187
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,440
Come on, sweetie.

188
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,870
Lord a'mercy.

189
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,780
Ugh. I'm starving. What are we gonna do about dinner?

190
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,150
I checked with dad, and I ordered a couple pizzas from Theo's.

191
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,250
I knew it! You're stalking my pizza guy!

192
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,110
He is not into you, okay?

193
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,080
Does he call you "Brown eyes"

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
and give you extra mozzarella sticks?

195
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,270
Okay, that's it, you two!

196
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,220
You cannot fight over men like it's jewelry or shoes.

197
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,730
If you're both interested, no one makes a move.

198
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,600
Sisters before misters!

199
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,920
- Stalker! - Trollop.

200
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,630
Ha-ha, don't know what it means --

201
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,830
- What did you do?! - Nothing!

202
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,080
Aah! Yes, you did! You turned it on,

203
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,140
and now the propeller's all tangled up!

204
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,100
Why would I do that?

205
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,350
'cause my pizza guy is coming,

206
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,690
and now I have airplane in my hair!

207
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,280
I swear I didn't, Haley. Okay.

208
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll get it out. Oh, my god, ow!

209
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,820
- What is happening?! - I don't know!

210
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,950
Ohh, you find a little toy?

211
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,340
Hey, was that aunt Marge

212
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,760
just tearing down the driveway?

213
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,080
Yes. And she dropped off a little present.

214
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Is that my Cam Cam?

215
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
- Gram gram! - Oh, you.

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,070
There have been some storm warnings,

217
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,120
so Marge thought she'd be safer over here.

218
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,490
But she dropped her off so fast

219
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,430
that we didn't even have a chance to straighten up.

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
We never told gram about the gay.

221
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,140
You know, after they reach a certain age,

222
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,790
you worry that it could

223
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,390
be the thing that sends them over the edge,

224
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,950
And she's been on the edge for a long time.

225
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,010
We're actually on deathbed number two.

226
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
Mitchell. Mitchell.

227
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,220
Okay. W-what's this?

228
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,270
This is me ready to slop, bale, or milk something.

229
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,000
You don't need to do that.

230
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
No, I -- Cam, I-I know.

231
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,200
I know I gave you hell for being who you really are,

232
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,920
- and I want to make that up to you. - Yeah, but you know what?

233
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,430
Putting on my sister's Sunday overalls is gesture enough.

234
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,320
- What's this? - Oh, it's my chewing straw.

235
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,720
- It's not straw. - Oh, it's just show -- for show.

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,140
- Hey. Come on, come on. - You know, you love the man,

237
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,650
- you love the world he comes from. - Yeah, but you know what?

238
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,930
I don't know if it's these farming clothes or what,

239
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,740
but I am feeling so close to you right now.

240
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,170
- Well, that's so sweet. - Now give me a kiss.

241
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,460
No, not right now.

242
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,440
Well, don't make me rassle you down.

243
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,960
Who's this?

244
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Oh, dear.

245
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Uh...well, grams, this is Bud, our new farmhand.

246
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,120
Bud?

247
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,610
Yeah, Bud's a little simpleminded

248
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,430
on account of getting mule-kicked, isn't he?

249
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,200
And you know the rules on being in the house, Bud.

250
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Now, go on outside.

251
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,700
We're gonna milk the cows in a few minutes.

252
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,410
Get on out there. Have a treat afterwards.

253
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,140
Here's what we've got to work with.

254
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,480
Nicely done. I've got Florida on the line.

255
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,780
Dad, I'm flying you in. You're the model expert.

256
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,530
What are we looking at, son?

257
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,610
Holy Moses.

258
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,920
More like Apollo 1,300 pieces!

259
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,350
In space, I guess no one can hear you be hilarious.

260
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,250
I need you to focus.

261
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,930
- If Jay sees this... - I know!

262
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,180
Dad, you've got three good men here depending on you.

263
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,870
Say no more -- I'm gonna tap a button now

264
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,740
that's either gonna make you

265
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,670
larger on my screen or --

266
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,690
We've lost Florida.

267
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,690
Yeah, yeah. Bring the skeleton up now. I just got to the room.

268
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,860
Hey, dad.

269
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,160
Hey, honey.

270
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.

271
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, well, the lecture got done a little early,

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,180
and I was kind of the star of the evening.

273
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,980
I got a huge laugh when I coined the phrase

274
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,550
"Shelf-esteem."

275
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,430
Huh? Yeah?

276
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,770
Okay, I'll text it to Phil.

277
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,270
Why don't you go down to the lobby? You'll get a stronger signal.

278
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,960
- Oh. Hello. - Rita.

279
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,440
-This is my daughter, Claire. - Hi.

280
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Claire, this is Rita.

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,300
Your dad and I go way back.

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,290
First time we met, I told him

283
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,370
he needed a course in "Hanger" Management.

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,590
It's still funny.

285
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,960
Seriously?

286
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,140
Her husband's in the garment business.

287
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,870
He made me a suit.

288
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,020
I make the closets, and he fills them.

289
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,010
Match made in heaven.

290
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,840
Honey, they're kind of sticklers at that restaurant.

291
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,250
Why don't you grab our table? I'll put this in the room.

292
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,060
Uh, okay. Will do.

293
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,760
Um, really nice to meet you.

294
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,550
See you downstairs.

295
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,860
I actually am gonna take the stairs.

296
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,480
That elevator is slow.

297
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey, was it just me,

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,690
or was she looking at me weird?

299
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,920
I did kind of sense that.

300
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,470
You don't think she knows about our deal?

301
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,560
How could she? It was 20 years ago.

302
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,180
And I never told anyone.

303
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,660
Would she even care?

304
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,340
That I tried to get rid of the man she ended up marrying?

305
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,590
Well, it's not like you took a hit out on him.

306
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,880
You had me offer him a job

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
in the greatest state in the union.

308
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,860
Okay, Tex.

309
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,700
If I never said anything, how could she know?

310
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,480
You're not the first one I approached.

311
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,150
You're just the first one who said yes.

312
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,610
- I'm done. I'm done - Come on.

313
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,840
Please, just be Bud -- for a couple days.

314
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,090
You can do some chores, maybe I can

315
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,940
berate you a little bit to really sell it.

316
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,800
Do you hear how insane you sound?

317
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,860
Chores?

318
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,710
All right, you know what?

319
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,510
You -- you deal with your grandmother however you want.

320
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,050
- Lily and I will just go get a hotel room. - No, you can't.

321
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,590
Fine. Motel, silo --

322
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,170
whatever you got around here.

323
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,440
No, that alarm means there's a tornado coming right now.

324
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,730
Oh, god. Well, where's lily?

325
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,390
I hope she's not still out in the field.

326
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,030
Lil-y-y-y-y!

327
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,980
You can't just call her like a pig!

328
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,240
Lil-y-y-y-y-y!

329
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,210
Okay, this is just a farm thing,

330
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,170
not, like, a mall thing.

331
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,250
- What's that, city voice? Hmm? - Just go.

332
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,360
This is really in there good.

333
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,160
Get her off of me.

334
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm getting dumb through osmosis.

335
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,030
I don't have osmosis.

336
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,910
Oh, great. Chuck's here with the pizza.

337
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,660
Gloria, can you please get it?

338
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,890
No. You two be nice to each other

339
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,460
and figure it out.

340
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,490
Oh, hey, Chuck.

341
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,050
I didn't think you'd be working tonight.

342
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,250
Hey. What are you doing here?

343
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,850
Oh, this is my grandfather's house.

344
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,030
There's a pool. Do you swim?

345
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,260
You look like you swim.

346
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,730
I do.

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,630
Oh, thanks.

348
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,380
You okay?

349
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Oh, yeah. Totally. Just a cramp.

350
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,860
I work out. One second.

351
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,980
- You little... - Shut up.

352
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,870
Hey, you.

353
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,570
Hey, brown eyes.

354
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,210
Okay, cool. Thanks. Bye.

355
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,420
Bye!

356
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,940
- What? - Shut up, dork.

357
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,540
Don't be nervous, honey.

358
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,970
There's nothing to be scared of.

359
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,560
Take it easy, mama. Don't break a hip.

360
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm telling you right now.

361
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,120
I am not pretending to be something I'm not,

362
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,050
especially in front of our daughter.

363
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,440
Oh, so I can't kiss you in front of your dad for six years,

364
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,030
and you can't give me two days?

365
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,110
We're saving an old lady some unnecessary upset.

366
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,590
Why don't you give her a little credit?

367
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,850
She might be more open-minded than you think.

368
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,330
Well, you're a cute little Chinese thing.

369
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,560
Actually, gram, she's, uh, from Vietnam,

370
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,240
and her name's Lily.

371
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,820
Dad, how long do we have to stay down here?

372
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
"Dad"?

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
Okay, well, I guess there's no way around this.

374
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,230
Ac-- actually, ma'am...

375
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,710
...she's my kin.

376
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,270
So, you got a Chinese wife, Bud?

377
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,920
No, I-I-I went to vietnam,

378
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,340
and I did myself some adopting,

379
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,950
And now I'm raising her all by my lonesome.

380
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,440
Well, I never thought I'd live long enough to see that.

381
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,050
None of us did.

382
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,680
But I guess there's nothing more important than family...

383
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,610
no matter how they come.

384
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,840
Well, that is mighty open-minded of you.

385
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,560
Some folks 'round these parts don't share that progressive--

386
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,450
I say progressive-- sensibility.

387
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,840
To each his own.

388
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,160
But I do wish I had another

389
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,260
little one like that to spoil.

390
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
What if I told you you did have a great-grandbaby?

391
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,430
- What? - Cam...

392
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,410
It's okay, mama.

393
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,860
What if I told you I was in love,

394
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,450
and that I've never been happier in my entire life,

395
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,820
and that I'm about to get married?

396
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,590
I can't think of anything better.

397
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,930
And what if I told you the love of my life

398
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,820
is this man standing right here?

399
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,880
Then I'd know why god sent us this tornado.

400
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,850
Damn.

401
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,640
After the initial shock, gram softened a bit.

402
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,530
She even agreed to attend the wedding.

403
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,060
Standing outside with a sign.

404
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,460
Baby steps, Mitchell. Baby steps.

405
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,240
And... our antenna is...

406
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,020
- reattached. - Yes!

407
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,290
Oh, this is useless.

408
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,670
Hey, I don't want to hear talk like that.

409
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,400
If you want inspiration, think about Apollo 13.

410
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,940
Jay didn't give up when he first put together this model.

411
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,970
It was hard and complicated, and back then,

412
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,840
the print on the instructions was tiny,

413
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,190
but he persevered.

414
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,400
Also, the astronauts on the actual Apollo 13

415
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,580
didn't give up when their actual lives were in danger.

416
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,460
Them, too, but they had a lot of other people helping them out.

417
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,700
We're on our own here.

418
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,150
Okay, I figured out what we need

419
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,240
to reattach that damn landing module.

420
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,220
Glue won't work.

421
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,430
We need a very thin filament--

422
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,050
thinner than thread.

423
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
I know what will work.

424
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,070
Well, I need to go check on something.

425
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,610
I told my date I'd be back in a jiff.

426
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,500
Back in a jiff.

427
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,280
Nothing to do but wait.

428
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,250
Why are we making ourselves crazy, Phil?

429
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,910
I don't know. I just hate disappointing Jay so much.

430
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,920
He is not an easy guy to please.

431
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,510
I know, but when you do, it's pretty sweet, ain't it?

432
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,670
Sure is.

433
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,650
You're lucky to have a dad like that.

434
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,470
Hard not to be hurt by that, son.

435
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,810
How have I never noticed how loud you breathe?

436
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,560
Aw, don't beat yourself up-- that'd require you

437
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,100
to notice something that isn't about you.

438
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,590
Oh, my god, you are such a loser!

439
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,730
I can't be stuck to you all day!

440
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,290
Okay, that's it! I cannot listen to this anymore!

441
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,850
I'm going to cut you two out of there.

442
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,170
No! Gloria, no! My hair!

443
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,150
- Too late! - Okay, okay! Just cut mine.

444
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah, cut hers! Wait. Why?

445
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,550
No one cares what I look like, anyway.

446
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,080
You don't really think that.

447
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,220
Yeah, well, kind of.

448
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,260
You didn't see the way that Chuck was looking at you?

449
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,970
Wait, you actually think I'm a threat?

450
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm not gonna say that out loud.

451
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,900
Aww, that's so sweet.

452
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,640
Well, if I ever had a boyfriend,

453
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,880
I wouldn't trust him with you for five seconds.

454
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,840
Okay. Let's finish this job.

455
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,910
Gloria, no, you can't cut--

456
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,600
And there you go.

457
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,800
That's it. That was easy.

458
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,260
Why did you wait an hour to do this?

459
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,420
Why did you wait 15 years to do that?

460
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,000
At least this way, nothing bad happened

461
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,490
to anyone's pretty hair.

462
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,870
Oh, honey. I didn't hear you come in.

463
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,330
- How was the rest of your night? - Let's see.

464
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,900
After you bailed on me,

465
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,410
Mark from Closetopia yakked my ear off,

466
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,450
and then told me I look like Heidi Klum,

467
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,220
which is such an obvious come-on.

468
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,370
Mark's gay.

469
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,100
Well, in that case, my night stank.

470
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,400
And I didn't bail.

471
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,560
I know a lot of people here. They pulled me away.

472
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Hey, these robes are terrific.

473
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,710
You know, there's one for you in the closet.

474
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,510
You ought to put it on.

475
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,780
I don't want a robe.

476
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,480
Dad, were you avoiding me tonight?

477
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,680
Why would I avoid you?

478
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,220
Trust me -- soft, like butter.

479
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Right in there.

480
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,790
Don't make me ask.

481
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,930
What are you talking about?

482
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,560
You and Rita 20 years ago --

483
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,300
- It's okay. I know. - Oh, geez.

484
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,370
I get it. Things happen.

485
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,470
- Really? - It was a long time ago.

486
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,660
Well, I appreciate it.

487
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,830
I just want to say I'm not proud of it.

488
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,450
If I had known him then like I know him now,

489
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,780
I never would have tried to get rid of Phil.

490
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,720
Good night.

491
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,530
"Get rid of Phil"? What are you talking about?

492
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,470
What are you talking about?

493
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,980
You and Rita had an affair.

494
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,590
No, we didn't. That's crazy.

495
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,010
Well, okay, good night.

496
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,100
"Get rid of phil" -- what does that even mean?

497
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,070
It doesn't mean anything. You had just started dating.

498
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,610
You know I was never hot on the guy.

499
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,850
I told Rita to offer him

500
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,220
a sales job in Texas.

501
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,180
I remember that, but that wasn't when we were dating.

502
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,570
- We were engaged. - Doesn't matter.

503
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,070
Phil didn't take the job anyway.

504
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,590
If anything, my little test

505
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,910
proved how much he loved you.

506
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,210
You're welcome. We'll talk in the morning.

507
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,370
Oh, how dare you -- "You're welcom" please.

508
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,940
Oh, I can't even be in the same room with you.

509
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,460
- Where is my coat? - Uh, Claire.

510
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,460
Ugh, unbelievable.

511
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,510
"I don't like my son-in-law,

512
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,220
so I'm gonna ship him off to Texas."

513
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,390
Real mature way to deal with your problems, dad.

514
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,790
- I get that point. - Yeah. Real mature.

515
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,660
- That's real mature, too. - That's tradition.

516
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,590
- It's the skeleton... - In the closet. Oh, I get it.

517
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,690
I'm really sorry, but before you go storming out of here,

518
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,760
you want to talk about a certain phone call I got

519
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,690
from immigration a few years ago?

520
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,570
I had just started dating Gloria.

521
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,180
They were acting on an anonymous tip.

522
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,340
It's very late.

523
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,410
We have a very big day tomorrow.

524
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,730
You know, Claire, I've really come to like Phil.

525
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,660
I know.

526
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,450
And the irony is,

527
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,690
he would really love that skeleton gag.

528
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,910
Try it out on him. You got

529
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,370
to take care of that thing till next year.

530
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,370
Oh, god.

531
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,730
Wait, before you turn that out,

532
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,750
have we talked about everything we need to?

533
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,430
'cause I want everything out in the clear here.

534
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,910
Yeah. We have.

535
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,300
Good night.

536
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,030
I did make out with Rita once about 15 years ago.

537
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,100
Good night.

538
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay.

539
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,420
All that's left...

540
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,710
is to reattach the lander to the command module.

541
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,250
We got one shot at this, fellas.

542
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,530
If we fail, jay's gonna burn up on re-entry into this house. Am I right?

543
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,670
Hole in one, son!

544
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,630
Thanks, dad.

545
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,990
Boys, if this thing goes sideways,

546
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,580
I don't want you to be here to see it.

547
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,410
- So go on. - But, dad --

548
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,580
No, you listen to me!

549
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay, Phil.

550
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,110
Okay, Philip.

551
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,690
Steady.

552
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,780
He's locked in.

553
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,220
Not now, nerves.

554
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,930
Hold.

555
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,370
Hold.

556
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Be a hero.

557
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,090
Bring her home.

558
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,140
I guess I'll call a cab.

559
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,320
So long, Jeanine.

560
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,250
Is it? Is --

561
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,030
It is!

562
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,510
Splashdown!

563
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,930
Son of a bitch, he did it.

564
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,780
Yeah! Gloria, get in here!

565
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,760
There we go!

566
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,210
- Dad, you did it! - Yes, I did!

567
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,850
I love it! I love it!

568
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,840
I love it!

569
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,840
Phil, honey. Come to bed.

570
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,140
This robe feels like butter.

571
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,450
I missed this, honey.

572
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,110
That yoga's really paying off.

573
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,590
Hey, whoa. Slow down, baby.

574
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,800
You can't gun a cold engine.

575
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,240
But if you're -- then who's --

576
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,370
When did you know?

577
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,170
When it didn't complain about my socks.

578
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,150
You checked the closet, didn't you?

579
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,610
Every night before bed.

580
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,900
I really don't understand it. It's so silly.

581
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,470
I mean, if somebody really wanted to kill you,

582
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,790
obviously they'd just hide under the bed.

583
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,220
Good night.

584
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,250
Damn it.
