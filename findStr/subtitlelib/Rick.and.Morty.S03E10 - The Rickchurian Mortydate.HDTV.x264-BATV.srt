Come on, football!
Go, go!

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,322
Oh, come on.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,947
Play football!

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,588
Aaah!

5
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,377
So, you're mining stuff
to craft with

6
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:22,877
and crafting stuff to mine with?

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,829
- Uh-huh.
- Did your dad write this game?

8
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:25,887
Mean.

9
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,510
Gentlemen, you're needed
by a friend in Washington!

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,447
How clandestine.

11
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,328
If they can teleport,

12
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:38,769
- why did we take...
- I just work here, Steve,

13
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,127
same as you!

14
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,119
All right.
All right, all right.

15
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,736
- Mr. President.
- It's about time, gentlemen.

16
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,331
- Rick, do you need to drink in here?
- Yes.

17
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,432
Here's the adventure.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,236
Some kind of alien...
googa

19
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:52,297
has infested
the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

20
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,174
I want it hunted down
and taken out.

21
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:55,627
Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

22
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:57,197
Naturally, you'll forget
you saw them,

23
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,361
along with, in order of
national embarrassment,

24
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:01,538
the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

25
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:03,471
and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

26
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,104
He didn't free them all.

27
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,498
And let me know
when you're done.

28
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:07,578
Maybe then we could
get a selfie?

29
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,885
Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

30
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:11,947
Is it a peace one
or a regular one?

31
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:24,166
Ugh. This sucks.

32
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,366
God, tell me about it.

33
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,006
Oh, man.
If you're not into it...

34
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:28,754
What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

35
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,877
- It's lame.
- You're into lame stuff, Morty.

36
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:33,080
I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

37
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:35,088
to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

38
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:37,541
Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

39
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,330
He treats us like Ghostbusters.

40
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,222
- We should talk to him.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

41
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,621
Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

42
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:44,650
that thinks he runs the world

43
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,068
and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

44
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,291
It's either that
or more of this.

45
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,682
Third choice...

46
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,415
- "Minecraft."
- You like it now?

47
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:53,513
Got to be honest, Morty.

48
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,635
It's growing on me.

49
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:56,093
Notify the president.

50
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,179
What do I tell him?

51
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:58,439
Tell him the truth.

52
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,072
Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

Should we drone-strike

- That would prove them right!
- And blow him up.

Give me the phone.

78
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,602
We're holding all

- Awesome.
- Yello?

81

Hi, guys.
U.S. President calling.

82
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:21,922
- How's it going?
- Oh, hey.

83
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,930
Just hard at work
on this sex tunnel gagoo.

84
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,989

new archnemesis, you know?

85
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,075
It might take a while.

86
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,434
What do you think,
Morty... a month?

87
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,211
Fingers crossed, a month,
yeah.

88
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:32,582
You lying dicks!

89
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,239

93
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:40,302
Okay, obviously, this looks
bad, Mr. President.

94
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,677
I mean, what doesn't look bad

95
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:42,826
through an illegal
spy satellite?

96
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,196
Don't high-road me.

97
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:45,977
The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

98
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,441
- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

99
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,825
And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

100
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,165
America returns that favor

101
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:53,591
by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

102
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,364
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, God.

103
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,094
We... We didn't know
you saw it that way.

104
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,935
Well, it's nobody's fault.

105
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,786
We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

106
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:01,900
Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

107
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:04,574
when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

108
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,771
Especially, you know,
when it turns out

109
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,811
you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

110
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,435
an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

111
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:13,696
As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

112
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,743
we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

113
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,219
like, if you tried.

114
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:19,625
You know, it wouldn't go well.

115
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,618
Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

116
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:26,571
I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

117
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,497
Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

118
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:29,946
Which we'll never have to.

119
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,907
By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

120
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,564
You know, we're...
we're happy to do that.

121
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,029
Yeah, but not because
it contains America...

122
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,688
because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

123
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:40,349
But feel free to call us, you
know, as... as, like, friends.

124
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,782
Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie...

125
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,844

00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,187
Not needed here. You can leave
and nobody will care.

176
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:02,179
Have you never heard
that before?

177
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:03,796
Do you even know how to take out
this kind of threat?

178
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:04,971
We're not taking it out.

179
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,612
We're going to shrink down and
approach them diplomatically.

180
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,718
- You shrink with pills?
- Are you still here?

181
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,758
Shouldn't you be going down
to your next version of Earth

182
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,874
with your selfie-craving
star-sidekick?

183
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,640
- Whoa!
- We're allowed to be here.

184
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,179
You aren't president
of the Amazon.

185
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,862
Yeah, I learned about
your job in school.

186
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,121
You're a civil servant.

187
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,596
We're technically your boss.

188
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,807
Oh, please, Morty.

189
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,417
You pay as many taxes
as you have pubes.

190
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:31,179
Oh, I got pubes,
Commander-in-Queef.

191
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,288
- You want to count them?
- Commander-in-Queef.

192
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:35,206
That's it! Do it!

193
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,749
Recognize the rare element
Sanchez-eum?

194
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,300
We've been preparing for a Rick-level
eventuality for some time.

195
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:42,629
You mean you've been ordering
other people to prepare for it

196
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,416
while you sat on your ass
at peace summits.

197
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,463
Peace summits are important!

198
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:46,541
Oh, yeah!
They work great!

199
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,226
We're really drowning
in peace!

200
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:49,944
- You suck!
- You suck!

201
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,651
Task Force Alpha,
prepare to shrink.

202
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,651
Is there a Task Force Alpha
health plan, by the way?

203
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,038
Because if those pills are based
on subatomic compression,

204
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:58,621
you could get a more
curable cancer

205
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,518
just walking through
the mushroom clouds.

206
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,526
God damn it!
I'll do it.

207
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,255
Whoa.

208
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:05,706
Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

209
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,761
And you two aren't
American anymore!

210
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,518
I can say that.
You're expatriated!

211
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,581
If you step foot
on homeland soil again,

212
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,260
I'll treat it as an invasion.

213
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,586
Is this supposed to be painful?

214
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:15,741
Painful to watch.

215
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,338
Oh, such lame shrinking.

216
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,409
Oh, his clothes
stay the same size?

217
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:22,222
Oh! '70s shrinking,
party of one.

218
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,057
Eat my shrinking ass!

219
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,010
There he goes. All right.
Let's get out of here, Morty.

220
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:30,588
What the hell?!

221
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,901
I made Sanchez-eum up,
dumbasses.

222
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,870
Don't believe everything
you read on Wikipedia.

223
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:35,937
Stand down.

224
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,573
He's not afraid of pirates.

225
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,528
Oh! Run, Morty!
That part was true!

226
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:58,554
- I-I can't talk now, sweetie.
- Oh, when can you?

227
00:08:58,612 --> 00:08:59,952
Good point.
What's up?

228
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,562
Remember a little while ago
when you said that, if I wanted,

229
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,312
I could, like, leave Earth
and wander the infinite cosmos

230
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,781
to figure out who I am and that
nobody would ever know I'd left

231
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,091
because you could
replace me with a clone?

232
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,503
- Mm-hmm.
- Am I the clone?

233
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:12,890
- Sorry. What?
- Am I the clone?

234
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:14,402
Did the real me choose to leave,
and I only

235
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,378
think I chose to stay because
that's what I need to think

236
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,091
because I'm
the replacement Beth?

237
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,206
- No.
- Okay.

238
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:24,518
And one more thing.
If I were a clone, would you tell me?

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,523
Beth, you know, when...
when smart people get happy,

240
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:29,596
they stop recognizing
themselves.

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,057
And you are very smart because
you're very much my daughter.

242
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,698
Oh, God. You're right.
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,870
Thank you, Dad.

244
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:38,007
- All good?
- Totally.

245
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,502
I'm fine now.

246
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:42,648
And just to be sure, you're not
pretending to be convinced you're real

247
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,570
because you're actually
convinced you're a clone

248
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,305
and you're now terrified
that becoming self-aware

249
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:48,206
would mean I'd have
to terminate you?

250
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,115
- No.
- Okay. Glad I could help.

251
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,303
See you soon.

252
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,041
Aaaaaah!

253
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,150
Where do I go?

254
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:09,273
What does th... What... What...
What... What does this mean?

255
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,385
This means nothing.

256
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,140
Pull forward and park.

257
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:13,948
Then say that, God damn it!

258
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,273
Sorry.

259
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,791
Bad day.

260
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,468
I am Presidentress of
the Mega Gargantuans.

261
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,885
We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

262
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:26,643
Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

263
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,811
which is basically the world,

264
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,182
but you didn't hear that
from me.

265
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,893
- I've come to...
- I know who you are.

266
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,781
We've already agreed
to a ceasefire

267
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,515
with your ambassadors,
Rick and Morty.

268
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,453
Rick and Morty were here?
Of course they were here.

269
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,245
They can shrink
instantly and teleport.

270
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:40,321
They told me to give you this.

271
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,721
They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

272
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,557
and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

273
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,745
Are there pants?

274
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,821
They said you'd prefer
just a shirt.

275
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,932
Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

276
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:54,870
Rick and Morty escaped.

277
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,706
No shit.
Take me to the Pentagon.

278
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:58,174
We're at war
with Rick and Morty.

279
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,839
You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

280
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:02,276
I have pants at the Pentagon,
Rhonda. It's in my contract.

281
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,271
I mean you need to call
a press conference.

282
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,948
Israel and Palestine have
announced a permanent ceasefire.

283
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,741
What?
They signed something called

284
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:11,081
"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

285
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,554
Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

286
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,663
took them
to a "Star Wars" cantina,

287
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,526
where they smoked
perspective-enhancing

288
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,733
alien pheromones
through a laser hookah.

289
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,143
I still say it has to be Putin.

290
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:22,851
It was Rick and Morty,
you dunce!

291
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,094
But you're getting
the credit, sir.

292
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,085
Your approval rating
just hit 100%

293
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,437
Why would Rick
and Morty want that?

294
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,995
Because they're assholes!

295
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:32,573
I'm flattered, but it takes a whole
team to achieve what we did today.

296
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:33,846
Thank you.

297
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,874
Well?
They haven't been back home, sir.

298
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:38,361
We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

299
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,390
God damn it!
They're right here!

300
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,515
They're here, God damn it!
Code Red! We need backup!

301
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:43,671
Everybody relax.

302
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,016
Just waiting for you
in the only room

303
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,495
you can't blow up or spy on.

304
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,382
So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

305
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,867
but now you have
everything you want,

306
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,148
so you can forget we exist,

307
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,179
and we'll return the favor.

308
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,611
You couldn't say that in a text?

309
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:56,182
Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my...

310
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,745
Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

311
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,370
My grandson has
worked hard for you,

312
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,051
and I feel like
he's earned a selfie.

313
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:04,128
Honestly, I could take it or leave
it at this point.

314
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:05,038
You're taking it.

315
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,023
No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

316
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,132
Get out of my office!

317
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,671
Seriously?
You're that stubborn?

318
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,492
He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

319
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:12,659
Uh, from selfies?

320
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,319
From subordination
to hostile powers.

321
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,218
Uh, does China know about
that deal-breaker?

322
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:17,862
China doesn't piss
on the White House.

323
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,804
Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

324
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,179
- Get out.
- Not without a selfie.

325
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,460
- Arrest them.
- Son, you have a right to refuse his order,

326
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,218
and I guarantee you're going
to die if you touch me,

327
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,273
and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

328
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,385
Don't do it.

329
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,481
- Whoa, Rick!
- Okay.

330
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,411
What was that?

331
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:31,551
- Death.
- What kind?

332
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,749
- Instant.
- There was no sound.

333
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,475
- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

334
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:35,953
It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

335
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,991
It's called a deterrent.

336
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,373
You couldn't just knock him out?

337
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,295
How is knocking out a deterrent?

338
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,788
Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

339
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:42,920
Nobody wants to be dead.

340
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,374
You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

341
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,889
- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

342
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,156
I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

343
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,444
Uh, I don't need a selfie.

344
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,781
And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

345
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:50,788
and you aren't leaving.

346
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:53,288
- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

347
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,218
because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

348
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,295
Am I getting a selfie?

349
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:57,664
- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

350
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:58,741
- Exactly.
- See?

351
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,811
Does anyone have a shot?

352
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,892
Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

353
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,788
But I wouldn't recommend...

354
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:04,846
Open fire!

355
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:06,354
God, you are dumb!

356
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:07,453
Get the President out of here!

357
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,116
- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

358
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:10,390
Because if there isn't
someone in here

359
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:11,742
that they're not
supposed to kill,

360
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,523
they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

361
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,619
As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

362
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,334
if it isn't in
a selfie with him,

363
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:18,831
I'll be here.

364
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:20,623
- Jesus!
- He's not a god!

365
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,889
You don't know what I am!

366
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:23,046
And you don't know
what I can do!

367
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,384
- Jesus! It's... It's cool, Rick!
- I'm Doctor Who in this

368
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,697
I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

369
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,506
We could be clones
controlled by robots

370
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:30,858
controlled with special headsets

371
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,171
that the real Rick and Morty
are wearing

372
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,324
while they're
your mother!

373
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:34,386
I'm going to kill you!

374
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,077
Then come to 312 Olive Street!

375
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:37,328
- Is that her address?
- You don't know

376
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:38,733
because you're a bad son!

377
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,886
Ow!
Take him down!

378
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,268
Semper fi!

379
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,398
Aaaaah!

380
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,198
<i>Number three, The Twister.</i>

381
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,808
Ow! Damn it.
<i>Number four...</i>

382
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,554
<i>The Hanky Panky.</i>

383
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,179
Beth?

384
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,379
My dad might have cloned me,
and I might be the clone.

385
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,247
And he says I'm not, but that's
what he'd say to a clone.

386
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:55,320
Typical.

387
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:56,990
<i>Number six, The Texas Ripple.</i>

388
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,078
You look like you to me.

389
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,418
What are you, an idiot?

390
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,157
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

391
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,402
That was so rude.

392
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,642
I came to you for help, and now
I'm insulting your intelligence.

393
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,036
And look where
intelligence gets you.

394
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,344
Well, don't knock intelligence,
because right now

395
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,058
I'd love to understand
how I can help you.

396
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,688
I can't be in charge
of that, Jerry.

397
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,231
My mind, my ideas are all
part of the variable.

398
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,086
The only constant is you.

399
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,582
You know me inside and out.

400
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,668
Do what you have to do.

401
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,793
Okay. Sit down.

402
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,315
Now cross your legs.

403
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,890
That leg on top. Good.

404
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,746
Oh, what is this?

405
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,141
Senior year,
I took you on a date

406
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,518
to the Milwaukee
Symphony Orchestra

407
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,318
performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

408
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,993
At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

409
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,043
when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

410
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,344
are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

411
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,180
I realized my palms
were so sweaty,

412
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,674
I would never get
to hold your hand.

413
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:49,168
But I was desperate
to touch you,

414
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,225
so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

415
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,257
But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

416
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,038
so I started
kind of jiggling it,

417
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:56,776
whipping it without
moving too much.

418
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,302
But you started looking over,
and I thought,

419
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,391
"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

420
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,664
and I'll never get to touch her.

421
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:03,182
But I still have time
to touch her."

422
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,678
But my hand had Snickers on it,

423
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,143
and the brass section
was swelling

424
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,796
because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

425
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,853
And I just thought, " it.
Lips don't sweat."

426
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,549
Wow. Yeah.

427
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,736
I'll never forget that feeling.

428
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:18,580
You're the real thing.

429
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:20,252
Then that settles it,

430
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,926
because my memory
is of hating that night.

431
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,369
But now, reliving it,
all I can feel is how lucky I am

432
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:31,278
to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

433
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,479
Simple twice.

434
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,743
This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

435
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,884
because this woman loves you.

436
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,870
Uh... well,
vive la différence.

437
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,385
Okay. That was lame.

438
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,878
Listen, I... Words.

439
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,174
Don Cheadle.

440
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,526
You have the right to get
the out of my office!

441
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,049
You have the right
to kiss my dick!

442
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,760
Give me the thing.

443
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,682
Ugh!

444
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,589
Oh!

445
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,034
Ugh!

446
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,471
Oh!

447
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,328
Ugh! Ugh!

448
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,108
Ohh!

449
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,168
Submit!
Submit for the selfie!

450
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,378
I yield! I yield!
Take the selfie!

451
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,766
Okay. Morty, get in there
and say, "Cheese."

452
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:14,712
Morty?

453
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:16,501
Morty, come on!

454
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,571
God damn it!

455
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,305
Rick, don't get mad,
but I-I stole your portal gun.

456
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,658
What the Morty?!

457
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,321
I told you I didn't want
the damn selfie 800 times!

458
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,162
Look, whatever the hell
is going on between you

459
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,041
and the president,
it's got nothing to do with me.

460
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:32,774
So where did you go?
I can't tell you.

461
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,110
Rick, did you tell my mom
she might be a clone?

462
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,857
No! I told her she wasn't!

463
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:38,438
Well, isn't that
what you'd tell a clone?

464
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,638
Oh, for Christ's sake.

465
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:41,712
Rick, my mom and dad
are getting back together.

466
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:43,212
What? No!
She's not a clone!

467
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,302
Well, she says it doesn't
matter if she is or isn't

468
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,739
because now she loves my dad,

469
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,391
and she wanted me
and Summer to come home,

470
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,378
and we're hiding from you
so you don't kill her

471
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,071
if she's a clone in a place

472
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:53,559
I picked that
you will never find.

473
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,250
So don't look for us.

474
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,586
Come on, bitch!

475
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,700
Oh, you come on, bitch.

476
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,388
I'm out. I'm done.

477
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,670
I've got to...
I've got to go.

478
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,001
So I win. Then I'm in charge,
and you can't leave.

479
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,640
You're a terrorist.
You're an enemy of the state,

480
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,381
and you kicked me in the balls
10 minutes ago!

481
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,168
The office of the President
can't coexist

482
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,098
with a living god
that won't submit to it...

483
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,668
I mean, besides Poseidon.

484
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,278
But he's locked up
in Area 51 already,

485
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,547
so that doesn't really count.

486
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,166
Mr. President,
I'll make you a deal.

487
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,199
If you let me use
your ghetto-ass off-brand

488
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,090
deficit-tripling teleporter,

489
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,591
I can go take care of something,
and you'll never see me again.

490
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:28,618
Yes. Deal.
Invisi-troopers, stand down.

491
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:30,548
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't want to hear it.

492
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,309
You know I could see them
this whole time, right?

493
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,766
Don't push it, Sanchez.

494
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:45,602
He found us!

495
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,825
I told you
we shouldn't have gone

496
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,301
to the same cabin as last time!

497
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,270
Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

498
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,551
Dad, if you're my dad.

499
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:54,801
Of course, you're not my dad.

500
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,660
You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

501
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:58,570
I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

502
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:02,181
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

503
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,723
But I don't relate to her.

504
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:07,395
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

505
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:08,728
So if you kill me, fine.

506
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:09,840
You're not killing her.

507
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,568
But you're killing
a real family.

508
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:14,096
And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

509
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,809
Aren't there, like,
infinite time lines?

510
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,250
Can't you just move to one
where I don't know I'm a clone

511
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:20,649
and where a different
but identical version

512
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:23,078
of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

513
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,238
of a daughter can keep
making you proud

514
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,067
by being somewhere else?

515
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,218
Beth, you crazy bitch.
You're my daughter.

516
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,918
I brought this here
to kill Jerry.

517
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,059
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!

518
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,824
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You win, Jerry. You win!

519
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:40,426
No amount of genius can stop
your dumb mediocre vacuous roots

520
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,520
from digging into everything
and everyone around you

521
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:45,273
and draining them of
any ability to fend you off.

522
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:48,210
Well, it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

523
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,268
I appreciate it.

524
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,520
Morty, where's my portal gun?

525
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,613
Let's get out of here.

526
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:52,746
I'm staying here, Rick.

527
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,738
Are you... Ugh!

528
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:55,868
Nobody gets it.

529
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,359
Nothing you think matters
matters.

530
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,491
This isn't special.

531
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,114
This... This is happening
infinite times

532
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,426
across infinite realities.

533
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:02,937
Including this?

534
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:04,952
Yes!

535
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:08,188
Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

536
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,418
Are you going to stay?

537
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:10,851
There's infinite
time lines, Morty.

538
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,153
Why would I stay in the one
where I trashed the White House,

539
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,740
became an enemy of America

540
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:17,905
and the lowest-status character
in my idiot family?

541
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:21,412
Because of the fart?

542
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:23,238
There's still some rubble
over there.

543
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,890
I don't think you've
ever understood

544
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,562
what "Secretary of the Interior"
means!

545
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:30,148
Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

546
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,679
but not the one that did this.

547
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,757
We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

548
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,132
like hermit crabs, I think.

549
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm fly-fishing Rick.

550
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,091
You can distinguish me from the Rick
that you had a falling-out with

551
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:42,988
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

552
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:44,488
I hope I can be of service

553
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:46,452
if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

554
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:48,569
Friends?

555
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,148
Sounds good to me.

556
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,796
Kids, dinner!

557
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,128
I got Panda Express!

558
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,428
Did you get sugar chicken?

559
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:56,981
That's kind of the only
thing they have.

560
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,960
I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

561
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,269
I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

562
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,361
Stop it.

563
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:05,413
Here's your
stupid hat, dipshit.

564
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:07,501
Dad, you can't talk to
Jerry that way anymore.

565
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,437
We're a real family now.

566
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:11,560
In many ways, things
will be like season 1

567
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:12,878
but more streamlined.

568
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:15,023
Now Jerry and I are happily
married parents,

569
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:16,824
and the idea
that I was motivated

570
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:18,655
by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

571
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,874
Eschewed?
You've never used that word.

572
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,398
Maybe you are a clone.

573
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:25,163
It's not like
Rick would tell us.

Ooh-wee!
What a season!

578
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,515
Sorry I never showed up,
but I got married.

579
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:07,675
I had a baby.

580
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,710
I went back to school
and got my G-E-E-E-D.

581
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:13,116
What did you do
while you were waiting?

582
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:16,944
Hopefully you didn't just
around and waste your life.

583
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:18,507
Ooh-wee!

584
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:23,748
See you for Season 4 in,
like, a really long time!

585
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:27,458
I might even have
a big white Santa Claus beard

586
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,628
and... and... and a...

587
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:32,015
and a couple of grandkids

588
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,780
and all that kind of stuff.

589
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,874
See you... See you then!
