1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,795
- What?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,381
It's just that
we just started this shift

3
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,624
and that's your second one.

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,278
What are you,
the coffee police now?

5
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,409
No, I'm just saying.

6
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:19,647
All this caffeine
you're drinking

7
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:20,779
is starting
to explain a lot, though.

8
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,022
What's the drill today?

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,154
Albany Park.

10
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:25,610
Voight wants us
to knock on some doors,

11
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,157
see if we can't
find any witnesses

12
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,724
to that string
of home invasions.

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,073
Right.

14
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,224
One of my homies at patrol
told me about this.

15
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,989
Two guys masked up, silver SUV.

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,393
Yeah, apparently
last night's hit

17
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,557
was the third one this week.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,960
Crawford's nervous enough
about it,

19
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:38,188
he wants Intelligence
to take over.

20
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,735
- So here we go.
- We can do that.

21
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,302
For the record,

22
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,583
I don't have a problem
with coffee.

23
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,932
I have problem without coffee.
Copy that.

24
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,307
Let's go.

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,873
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Sarge.

26
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,792
- Okay.
- Damn.

27
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,577
Sorry about that, sir.

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,275
- It's all right.
- There's coffee on my floor.

29
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:01,887
You gonna clean that up?
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,151
What'd you do now?

31
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:06,153
It's all right.
Just had a little spill.

32
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,502
Nah, that ain't okay.

33
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,112
He's the worst recruit
I've ever had.

34
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,113
Get something and clean this up.

35
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,767
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

36
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,377
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,683
Man, it was just an accident.

38
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,269
Think you're being
a little tough on the kid.

39
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,642
No, I ain't.

40
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:19,296
Look, everybody has the right
to be dumb.

41
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,907
That kid abuses that privilege,
know what I mean?

42
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,301
Dumbass.

43
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,738
I remember the time.

44
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,088
I'm telling you, dog,

45
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,456
you definitely gotta
do it that way.

46
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,744
It's stress...
Recovery, more stress.

47
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,224
Make them tough, dog.

48
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,810
Doesn't make them tough,
though, really.

49
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,551
I mean, you know, the blues
don't need your approval.

50
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,118
I'm not saying
that they need my approval.

51
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,101
I just don't like the bullying
of recruits.

52
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,580
See? It's not bullying.

53
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:44,321
But I understand
why you'd say that

54
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,236
because you didn't have
to do the dance,

55
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,585
so you don't like the moves.

56
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,804
Shot fired in the 3000 block

57
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,458
of South Wells Street,
Albany Park.

58
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,024
That's two blocks away.

59
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,417
50-21 Ida, we're close by.

60
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,246
We're gonna roll on that job
in plain clothes.

61
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,682
Help me, please!

62
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,380
I need help!

63
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,642
- Stop, stop!
- Please!

64
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,165
- Hands up.
- Stay right there.

65
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,079
- Put your hands up!
- Stay right there.

66
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,254
You stay right there.

67
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,405
I got him, I got him, I got him.

68
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,257
Are you hit? You cut?

69
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,129
No, it's not mine!
It's my uncle's blood!

70
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,434
He's been shot!

71
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,132
50-21 David,
we need backup and an ambo

72
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,611
to the 3000 block
of Wells Street.

73
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,067
Where's the shooter?
Is he still inside?

74
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,136
No, there were two guys!

75
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,137
They robbed us
and shot my uncle!

76
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,399
Which way did they go?

77
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,637
They drove off in a silver SUV

78
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,358
with some patches on it
going that way!

79
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,273
Be advised:
Silver SUV fled this location.

80
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:24,796
Vehicle matches the description

81
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,624
from the earlier
Albany Park crime broadcast.

82
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,515
- Okay, where's your uncle?
- Inside our restaurant!

83
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,975
All right, you stay right there.

84
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,587
You get him, and I need you
to go around the back!

85
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,938
Ready?

86
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,682
Chicago PD!

87
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,689
- Clear.
- Clear.

88
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,126
- Right, right, right.
- Okay.

89
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,697
Body.

90
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,893
He's still breathing.
You clear the place.

91
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,460
I got him, all right?
I got it, I got it.

92
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,007
Sir, my name is Officer Ruzek.

93
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,313
We got an ambulance on the way.

94
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,010
Hey, just keep breathing,
all right?

95
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:06,142
Okay?

96
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,756
Is that... Is that who shot you?

97
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,541
Say it again.

98
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,326
- I don't understand...
- How we looking?

99
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,806
Kev, where is the ambo?

100
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,373
Squad, what's the ETA on ambo?

101
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,654
Hey, listen,
do you speak English?

102
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,854
Can you tell me in English?
Tell me the name.

103
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,206
Come on, man, come on.
Ccandle...

104
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,211
- Come on.
- C-candles...

105
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:38,348
Damn it.

106
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,225
All right, we're running
point on this now,

107
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,400
so what do we got?

108
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,358
Victim's name is Nikolay Lukov.

109
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,751
He had just opened the place up.

110
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,100
He was tallying receipts in here

111
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,904
when a couple guys came in
and they robbed him.

112
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,384
And like the previous
robberies in the area,

113
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,061
the offenders fled
in a silver SUV

114
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,454
with patches on the side.

115
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,345
Looks like they've gone
from hitting residences

116
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,283
to hitting restaurants now.

117
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,502
How much they get?

118
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:02,957
Owner said
there was about 14 grand

119
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,113
being prepared for deposit.

120
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,854
Any witnesses?

121
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,745
No other employees were here,
but we do have the owner's son.

122
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,032
17 years old. His name is Peter.

123
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,816
He actually flagged us down.

124
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,359
He said when he walked up,
the offenders fled

125
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:14,752
and he did catch a glimpse
of one of them

126
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,517
when they took
their ski mask off.

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,127
Described him as male,
white, 30s.

128
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,695
All right, we bag his hands,
do a GSR test?

129
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,392
Yep, it came back clean.

130
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,283
All right, so let's canvass
the neighborhood for witnesses.

131
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,569
Grab POD footage,

132
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,136
and check all suspicious persons

133
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,877
in service clothes too.

134
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,401
Maybe somebody saw
the offenders casing the place.

135
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,403
Copy that.

136
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,579
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

137
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,668
- So can I take him home now?
- All right, listen...

138
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,889
- What's up, boss?
- Listen, this is Vasil.

139
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:41,846
He owns the place.

140
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,761
His... his brother was the victim.

141
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,198
I'm very sorry for your loss.

142
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,765
Yeah.

143
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,899
I understand my brother
said something in Bulgarian.

144
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:54,424
Yeah, um, look,
I'm definitely butchering it,

145
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,122
but it was
"koopi-she-something."

146
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,081
Sorry, I can't understand that.

147
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,344
"Koopi-she-Chevy," maybe?
Something like that?

148
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,911
When I asked him
to say it in English,

149
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,261
I think I heard him whisper
the word "candles."

150
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,785
Was it...

151
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,503
Yeah, that sounds about right.

152
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,790
- Yeah.
- Okay, what's that mean?

153
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,793
It means,
"Buy yourself candles."

154
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,057
Okay, why do you think
he'd say that?

155
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,189
It's an old phrase.

156
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,409
Um, loses something
in translation,

157
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,802
but it's about forgiveness.

158
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,676
I'll ask around,
see if anybody saw anything.

159
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,156
Well, that's all right.
My people are all over that.

160
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,942
Most of us around here
are from the Balkans,

161
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:35,944
Sergeant Voight.

162
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,642
If anyone in this neighborhood
saw anything,

163
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,471
they wouldn't share it with you.

164
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,212
Well, this isn't the Balkans.

165
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:46,041
Chicago's a little different.

166
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,956
Is it?

167
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,003
Let's go.

168
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,834
All right, where we at on this?

169
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,184
We knocked on a few doors,
came up dry.

170
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,727
You would have thought that
somebody would have looked

171
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,163
out the window or heard
the shots or something,

172
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,363
but nobody saw anything.

173
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,688
Or if they did,
they ain't sharing.

174
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,801
All right, so street PODs?

175
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:07,865
Most of them
have been vandalized,

176
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,151
made inoperable by the locals.

177
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,998
Patrol did say
this neighborhood is notorious

178
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:11,893
for not cooperating.

179
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,373
It's been like that for years.

180
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,698
All right, I'm gonna go back,
talk to this Vasil.

181
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,027
Encourage him to work with us.

182
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,552
Meanwhile, looks like
we're back at square one,

183
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,467
so let's restart
at the beginning.

184
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,816
Hey, I just got a call

185
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,992
from a CI
who's been asking around.

186
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,473
He said he got word
that a silver SUV with patches

187
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,146
was just dropped off
at an auto salvage yard

188
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,824
on the South Side.

189
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,063
Okay, well, that might be our
offender's ride right there.

190
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,611
All right,
so you and Kev chase it.

191
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,575
Yo, my man.

192
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,403
My man, you the owner?

193
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,665
Nah, fam.

194
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,884
Let me...
Let me go get him for you.

195
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,384
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah, you got it.

196
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,367
- Yeah.
- Kev.

197
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,716
You see this?

198
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,110
Silver SUV,
Bondo patch on the side there.

199
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,111
Could we be this lucky?

200
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,155
I think we got a winner.

201
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,635
We just gotta confirm it.

202
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,463
Convenience is king, though.

203
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,596
Hey!

204
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,206
Leave it alone.

205
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,555
Relax, man. We're cops.

206
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,098
Are you the owner?
Yeah, I know who you are.

207
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,123
Now get off my property.

208
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,777
What's all this attitude about?

209
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,866
People like me being tired
of cops like you.

210
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,217
Listen, pal,
we're investigating a murder.

211
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,934
We think this vehicle might
have been involved, all right?

212
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,762
If you ain't got a warrant,
you need to leave.

213
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,744
No, we don't need a warrant
to be here.

214
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,442
It's private property,
so, yeah, you do.

215
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,073
my friend,
you sweating the small stuff

216
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,640
that we don't really care
that much about.

217
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,294
We just want to make sure
you got the paperwork for this.

218
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,580
I'm not your friend.

219
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,024
Now leave
before I file a complaint.

220
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,670
You got quite the lip on you?

221
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,933
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

222
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,066
You know
there's too much heat on you.

223
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:41,025
We got him.

224
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,592
All right, then.

225
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,681
It's not a problem.
We'll come back.

226
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,770
I'm gonna see you again.

227
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:49,947
You'd better have a warrant
if you do.

228
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,739
What's this? Vasil asked for it.

229
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:02,133
Well, thank you.

230
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,701
My people talk to you yet?
Not yet.

231
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,182
I heard someone was
coming by in a few,

232
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,575
but I don't know anything.

233
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,491
Well, they're gonna want
to talk to you anyway.

234
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,623
Okay.

235
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:20,935
She's a good-looking girl,
am I right?

236
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,763
Seems nice.

237
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,635
My son... she's too old for him,

238
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,073
but it doesn't stop him
from trying.

239
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,771
How's he doing? Is he okay?

240
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,121
He was close to Nikolay,

241
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:36,080
so that wound won't heal
for many years.

242
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,131
To my brother's memory.

243
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:55,665
- What is that?
- Rakia.

244
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,841
It's meant to be sipped.

245
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,322
That's good to know.

246
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,239
- Let me ask you something...
- Yeah.

247
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,025
How are we supposed
to help you...

248
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,201
Or anybody
in this neighborhood...

249
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,160
If no one's willing
to talk to us?

250
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,641
If someone saw something
that would help,

251
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,120
I'd know about it.

252
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,905
No, if someone sees something,

253
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,863
they talk to us, not you.

254
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:23,345
I'm... I'm afraid that's not
how this neighborhood works.

255
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,347
I told you
the first time we met:

256
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,088
People here are guarded.

257
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,873
They come from
an ex-Communist state.

258
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:33,573
They don't trust the police
and their street cameras.

259
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,576
They have had
their fill of both.

260
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,708
So let's change that.

261
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,668
Fine, then it starts with us.

262
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:46,977
Listen, Vasil,
this kind of thing

263
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:50,241
doesn't happen
in a vacuum, okay?

264
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,461
Somebody had to
eyeball this place

265
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,245
before they robbed it.

266
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:58,249
So if any of your employees
haven't been interviewed yet,

267
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,643
we need to do that, not you.

268
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,427
Okay?

269
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,084
Thanks.

270
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,699
All right, here's our guy.

271
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:15,266
Jagoff's going mobile.

272
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,922
50-21 David to unit standing by,

273
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,011
suspect vehicle is westbound
from the location.

274
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,274
If you see a violation,
shake him.

275
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,712
21-13, copy that.
We got you covered.

276
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:29,454
Let's go.

277
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,935
- Any luck?
- Yeah, had a .380.

278
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,652
Idiot tried to tuck it
underneath the seat

279
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:34,721
when I walked up.

280
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:35,939
Ooh, all right.

281
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,090
You just made up
for spilling my coffee.

282
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,681
I didn't really
do too much, sir.

283
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,074
Sure about that?

284
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,989
'Cause you're the one
writing the paper.

285
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,862
Hey, enjoy that paperwork.

286
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,126
Pay attention.

287
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,824
Yes, sir.

288
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,565
- Hi.
- This is entrapment.

289
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,543
Well, you play stupid games,
you win stupid prizes.

290
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,701
Here's the deal: You tell me
about the crushed SUV

291
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,896
and I'm gonna forget
about the fact

292
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,617
that you're chopping up
stolen rides.

293
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,098
No, you can forget it.

294
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,709
I ain't telling you or your boy
nothing about my business.

295
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,711
- "My boy"?
- You calling me a boy?

296
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,235
Yeah, consider me "not woke."

297
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,325
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
you watch your mouth.

298
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,808
You wanna play with me?

299
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,724
You spit on me?

300
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,770
What'd I tell you
about stupid games?

301
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:24,727
- All right, okay!
- You wanna play with me?

302
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,033
Okay!

303
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,445
The next thing I hear
out of your mouth

304
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,513
are some answers, yeah?

305
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,385
- All right!
- All right.

306
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,822
Damn.

307
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,519
It... it was a white dude,
all right?

308
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,086
I'd never seen him before.

309
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,784
Didn't get a look at his face.

310
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,699
He gave me a grand
to crush the car.

311
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,483
Okay, any papers?

312
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:44,529
No, the plates and VIN
were already removed.

313
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,096
And that's all I know, I swear!

314
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,882
- How'd he leave?
- Uber or Lyft.

315
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,884
He was using an app.

316
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,366
- Was that so hard?
- Hey.

317
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,720
I'm sorry I put hands on him.
You see what he did?

318
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,638
You know, he's got
a little split on his lip.

319
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:09,380
All good, no big deal.
So what now?

320
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,426
Well, he gave us
workable information,

321
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,819
so I think we just kick him.

322
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,211
Might as well.

323
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,823
- Nah, can't do that.
- You mean seriously?

324
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,347
Seriously.
Cruz saw how it went down.

325
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,020
Gotta take him down,
book him for the gun.

326
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,350
Well, the split lip.

327
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,457
I mean,
we're chasing this murder.

328
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,353
I don't have time
to write up paper.

329
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,355
Okay, we'll say
the recruit did it.

330
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,749
Got clumsy putting the offender
in the back seat.

331
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,707
That what happened, Leavins?

332
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,883
- Sir?
- That what happened?

333
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,232
Yes, sir.

334
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,775
No, I'm just gonna
write up the paper.

335
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,496
- It's fine.
- No, we got this.

336
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,715
Go ahead and do your case.

337
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,258
He doesn't know
what he's agreeing to.

338
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,738
Kid, you sure
you're all right with this?

339
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,590
Bruh, he is.

340
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,070
I asked him, not you.

341
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:49,072
And I'm speaking for him.
We got this.

342
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,857
Listen, if I ask him a question,

343
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,120
you don't get to
answer it for him, all right?

344
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,832
What is your problem?

345
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,486
I don't have a problem,
all right?

346
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,618
But I don't like
putting people in situations

347
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:14,813
that they don't want to be in.

348
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,796
Okay, you know what?

349
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,842
Screw it,
I'll write the damn paper.

350
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,931
But you need to
mind your own business.

351
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,454
How I treat and train my recruit

352
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,414
don't have anything
to do with you.

353
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,854
Bruh, your guy.

354
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,826
- Who's this guy?
- Gregory Barnes.

355
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,175
He's 26, no criminal record.

356
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,109
We think this is the guy
that dropped off the SUV.

357
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,353
It was his Uber account
that requested the pick-up

358
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,615
at the auto salvage yard.

359
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,660
He got family,
work ties to Albany Park?

360
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,575
None that we can find.

361
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,970
Let's bring him in.

362
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,497
Hey, I need a word.

363
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,722
Yeah?

364
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,029
Guy with the bloody lip
is filing a CR.

365
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,596
- What?
- Really, for that?

366
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,425
Yeah, his lawyer's
making a lot of noise.

367
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:24,080
All right, well,
did... did you file the report?

368
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,691
Yeah, and I made myself
the hero,

369
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,694
which means I'm the only one
that lied.

370
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,567
All right, listen, man,
I didn't mean for that...

371
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,308
Well, it happened,

372
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,286
and the recruit didn't
get dirty writing the report,

373
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,314
which means he has no incentive
to back me up.

374
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,098
You think he'll roll?

375
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,187
He's a recruit, bruh.
What you think?

376
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,667
Catches a beef,
gets caught lying,

377
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,147
he's off the job for good.

378
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,496
No recourse.

379
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,672
There a problem?

380
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:51,847
No, boss.

381
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,544
All right, what's the hold up?

382
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,199
Let's go.
We're right behind you.

383
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,074
Look, I already asked Platt
to try to fix this.

384
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,206
If she can't,
stick to what's in the report.

385
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,530
It's our word
against the suspect

386
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,036
and the recruit's.

387
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,006
So you seriously...
You don't think

388
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:16,480
we should have our FOP reps
on standby just in case?

389
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,309
I think we sit tight.

390
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,658
Platt says she's got it.

391
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,502
You know she runs it
with the blue and whites.

392
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,857
Sergeant, we're trying
to get patrol out here

393
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,467
to cover the back,
but no one's acknowledging.

394
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,841
Yeah, well,
we don't have time to wait,

395
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,627
so let's go in and get Barnes.

396
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,064
50-21 Ida,
requesting a few units

397
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,196
to our location.

398
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,241
Non-emergency backup.

399
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,291
Any units, come back.

400
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,641
Is this a joke?
That's our guy right there.

401
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,209
Yep, that's Barnes.

402
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,646
Let's go.

403
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,257
We got eyes on Barnes.

404
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,626
Walking through the parking lot
of the building.

405
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,565
We're gonna grab him up.

406
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,481
Gregory Barnes.

407
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,962
Chicago PD.

408
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,138
- He's running.
- We got a runner.

409
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,188
- Gun, gun, gun!
- Got it!

410
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,334
Hands behind your back.

411
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,166
Anyone hear sirens?

412
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,559
'Cause I don't.

413
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:39,259
Come on.

414
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,870
Why'd patrol screw us
not rolling backup?

415
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:45,917
I don't know,
I might have caused an issue.

416
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,877
- Do I need to get involved?
- No, I'm gonna handle it.

417
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,444
All right, good. Do that.

418
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,403
Yeah.

419
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,251
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about,

420
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,973
all right? I didn't rob anybody.

421
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,409
Then why were you
carrying a gun?

422
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,108
Protection.
It's a tough neighborhood.

423
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,285
What about the SUV you dumped
at the auto salvage yard?

424
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,373
What about it?

425
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,288
I mean, some guy
sold it to me cheap.

426
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,898
It was a bucket
that was barely running.

427
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:12,379
Worth more in scrap metal.

428
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,641
You see, that's funny,

429
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,122
because the guy
at the salvage yard

430
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,317
said it was you that paid him,
not the other way around.

431
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,214
Well, he's lying.

432
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:24,695
So what's the name of the guy
you sold it to?

433
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,654
I dunno, some black dude.

434
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,743
Never seen him before or since.

435
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:32,442
Of course not.

436
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,880
Listen...

437
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,535
They ain't just robberies
once a man dies.

438
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,103
You understand?

439
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,887
So if you weren't the shooter,

440
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,412
now's your chance
to speak your piece.

441
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:50,112
No more questions.
I want a lawyer.

442
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,160
Okay, anything else?

443
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,031
I mean, Barnes grew up
in Chicago,

444
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,338
but since he's got
no criminal record,

445
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,296
there's no associates
in our database.

446
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,578
The guy flies under the radar.

447
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,386
There's no social media
footprint either.

448
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,867
- And the gun he tossed?
- Not reported stolen.

449
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,149
And the ballistics
doesn't match,

450
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,889
so unless we can tie him down
on the robbery

451
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,413
in a more specific way,
we've got nothing

452
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,873
but a misdemeanor
gun charge on him.

453
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,355
What about Vasil's son?

454
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,661
I mean, he said
he saw one of them

455
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,707
taking off his mask.

456
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,057
All right, arrange for a lineup.

457
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,629
All right, take your time.

458
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:29,780
If you need to see him
in profile,

459
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:30,848
we can do that for you.

460
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,895
Okay, Peter?

461
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:36,985
So it's one of them?

462
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,161
That's for him to tell us.

463
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,250
Peter?

464
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,863
I'm just not sure.

465
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,667
Well, there's no rush.
We got plenty of time.

466
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,737
Have a look.

467
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
I don't...

468
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,578
I just don't see the guy.

469
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,362
I'm just not sure.

470
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,756
It's okay.

471
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,975
You tried.

472
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,202
Boss, I found
something interesting

473
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,726
when I was transcribing the
restaurant employee statements.

474
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,164
Vasil's bartender,
Chelsea Roberts,

475
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,340
shared the same street address
as Barnes,

476
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,995
an apartment complex
over in Canaryville.

477
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,475
Well, that's huge.

478
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,781
It was years ago

479
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,237
and they lived
in separate apartments, but...

480
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,133
But they knew each other.

481
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,743
Take a look at Chelsea Roberts'

482
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,136
social media account.

483
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,399
This is her with Barnes
like three months ago.

484
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:46,533
Call down to Trudy.
Put a hold on Barnes.

485
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,578
Have Halstead and Upton
bring her in.

486
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,408
Hey, Sarge, we need to
put a hold on Barnes.

487
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,497
How long ago?

488
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,978
All right, thank you.
He bonded out an hour ago.

489
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,762
All right,
you and Kev go grab him.

490
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:01,374
Nice work, Rojas.

491
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,246
Yeah, this is Kev.
Tell Voight we came up dry.

492
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,640
Barnes isn't at home,
but we'll track him down.

493
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:07,858
All right.

494
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:10,034
Landlord said Barnes stopped by,

495
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,167
grabbed a few things,
and then he took off.

496
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,474
Well, that man ain't stupid.
He know we on his ass.

497
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,259
Yeah, she also said
she's looking out her window,

498
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,174
she sees a suspicious white guy

499
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,482
sitting in his car
watching Barnes.

500
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,571
Could be the partner in crime.

501
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:25,963
Yeah, one would think,

502
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,767
except Barnes didn't seem
to know he was there.

503
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,837
Barnes takes off, car follows.

504
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,282
Why am I here? What's going on?

505
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,198
Why don't you tell us
about Gregory Barnes?

506
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:48,682
Barnes?

507
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,120
I... it doesn't sound familiar.

508
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,340
Doesn't sound familiar?

509
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:57,125
Why are you draped all over him
in that picture?

510
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,215
Somebody had to tell Barnes
and his partner

511
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,086
who the Albany Park targets
would be, Chelsea.

512
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,307
And a bartender
in a place like that

513
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,092
probably heard a lot of locals
bragging about stuff.

514
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,635
I don't know
what you're talking about.

515
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,095
A man has died, Chelsea.

516
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,620
Are you sure you want to
keep playing this game with us?

517
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,062
I didn't know
anyone would be killed.

518
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,760
- But they were.
- I...

519
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,245
I shouldn't have told him
about the... the money

520
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,029
that the owner kept
at the restaurant,

521
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,118
but Peter kept bragging

522
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,904
about how well
the place was doing and I...

523
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,083
And I was scared...

524
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,912
for the future.

525
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:47,088
Yours or his?

526
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:51,614
The baby's.

527
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,401
Chelsea, you're pregnant?

528
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,580
Eight weeks.

529
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:03,626
The best thing you can do
for that child and for yourself

530
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,280
is just tell us everything.

531
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,152
I... I want to, but I think

532
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,596
I should probably
just get a lawyer.

533
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,112
Sure, you can do that.

534
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,595
We can't help you
after that, though,

535
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:15,899
so it's up to you.

536
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:17,988
I... I can't go to jail.

537
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:20,208
You're gonna go
to jail, Chelsea,

538
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,142
but what you say to us now
will make a big difference

539
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,560
as to how much time
you're gonna spend there.

540
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:28,477
When's the last time
you saw Barnes, Chelsea?

541
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,991
- Body.
- Clear.

542
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,080
- Clear.
- Clear!

543
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,274
No sign of forced entry,

544
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:27,599
so the shooter probably knocked
on the door.

545
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,799
Smart move hitting him here.

546
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,690
There's usually no cameras
in a place like this.

547
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,194
Yeah, but why kill him?

548
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,675
Partner probably got nervous
after the arrest.

549
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,633
Waits outside Barnes' apartment,

550
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:40,767
follows him to a seedy motel,
pops him, ties off the caper.

551
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,682
All right, well,
let's get the techs in here.

552
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,248
Hopefully they can
find some prints

553
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,599
and we can untie this thing.

554
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:52,561
- Hey, you got a minute?
- For you, Trudy?

555
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,737
I think I got ten. What's up?

556
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,827
You picked up a complaint
on a training officer

557
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,656
by the name of Werner.

558
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:06,227
Yeah, I did.

559
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,621
I haven't had a chance
to give the file a read yet.

560
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,058
What's your interest?
He's one of mine.

561
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,320
Good police.

562
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,322
Intelligence walled off
the arrest to him.

563
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,846
If you dig too deep,
others are in the line of fire.

564
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,110
It'll get messy.
These things always do.

565
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,505
So can we police our own?
Maybe make this go away?

566
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,638
"Go away"?

567
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,249
No, not if there's
any substance to it.

568
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,598
This guy's lawyer,

569
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:32,296
he's gonna want
to get his pound of flesh.

570
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,256
Well...

571
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,434
We've got history, you and I.

572
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,615
Best I can offer...

573
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,444
And I'm only floating this
because of that...

574
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,665
Low-ball plea.

575
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,449
Let me know
what that would consist of.

576
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,669
I'll see what I can do.

577
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,285
All right, what do we got?

578
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,828
The techs couldn't find
any comparable prints

579
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,157
in the motel room.

580
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,700
Ballistics confirmed
that it's a 9-millimeter,

581
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,223
but it doesn't match
any in the system.

582
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,510
So nothing.

583
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,946
- I might have something.
- Okay.

584
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,861
I took a deep dive
into Barnes' cell records.

585
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,839
Figured if he's got
a new friend like Chelsea said,

586
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,318
that number would have
just started popping out

587
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,343
on his cell phone.

588
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,520
- You get a name?
- Yes.

589
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,391
Jack Cranston.

590
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:25,654
Recently paroled from
Stateville for armed robbery.

591
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,806
Exchanged gunfire with cops
last time they arrested him.

592
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,397
All right, let's get his address

593
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,833
from his parole officer.

594
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,662
I want a confirmed visual
before we grab him.

595
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,977
You got anything?

596
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,762
Nah, negative.
No sign of him yet.

597
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,374
Hey, we've lost the eye.

598
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,768
There's a delivery truck that
just landed and blocked us.

599
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,529
Does it look like
he's gonna stick around?

600
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,512
Nah, just dropping off.
His hazards are on.

601
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,652
Is that Cranston?

602
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,437
I... I can't tell.

603
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,178
Let us know
if you want us to do a pass.

604
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,895
No, that'll take too long.
I'm just gonna do a walk by.

605
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,834
All right,
Hailey's stepping out on foot.

606
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,358
She's gonna get a visual.

607
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,336
It's Cranston.
We should move on him.

608
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,998
Get down, get down!

609
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,001
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
- 10-1, 10-1!

610
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,588
Shots fired at the police!
Get out of the car.

611
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,700
Out of the car.

612
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:55,894
Get around back,
get around back!

613
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,659
- Get down!
- Get down, get down!

614
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,661
Stay down! Stay down, stay down!

615
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,185
Moving!

616
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:03,970
Down!

617
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,842
Stay down, stay down!

618
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,454
Moving! Back, back, back!

619
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,065
Cover me, cover me!

620
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,807
- I got you, I got you.
- CPD, I got you, I got you.

621
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,635
Moving!

622
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,855
Come on, come on.

623
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,610
Where the hell's patrol?

624
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,744
We need backup!
We're still being fired on!

625
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,615
I'm moving! I'm moving!

626
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,753
Cranston!

627
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,232
Cranston, Chicago PD!

628
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,886
Come out with your hands up!
You're done!

629
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,758
Drop your weapon and step out!

630
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,716
Cranston!

631
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,762
Cranston!

632
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:09,296
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

633
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:21,569
Bro, what you got?
No containment?

634
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,571
He's gone.

635
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,497
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

636
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,194
We've done
a thorough grid search.

637
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:41,763
- How'd he break containment?
- There was none.

638
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,504
Adam.

639
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,945
You do realize that if patrol
had actually rolled on this,

640
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,860
we would have
the son of a bitch right now?

641
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,819
I know.

642
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,951
Look, whatever this is
between you and them,

643
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:59,172
just put it to bed,
and do it fast.

644
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,565
Yes, sir.

645
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,353
Werner.

646
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,100
- What's up, Sarge?
- We need to end this crap.

647
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,842
Okay, but I never told anyone
not to roll

648
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,191
when Intelligence needed backup.

649
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,540
You didn't have to.

650
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,891
They did it
out of respect for you.

651
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,067
I talked to IAD.

652
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,721
Plead to unreported force

653
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,854
and you'll only get
a three-day suspension.

654
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,334
If I do that, I lose
my training officer status.

655
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,950
Better I take the chance the
recruit sticks to the report.

656
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:41,649
And if he doesn't?
Werner, he's a recruit.

657
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,322
They're gonna press him hard,
and guess what?

658
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,306
He probably can't stand you,
so why would he be willing

659
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,047
to put his career
on the line for this?

660
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,180
Look, I shouldn't be
in this position.

661
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:54,705
But you are.

662
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:57,099
- What's this?
- It's from Ruzek.

663
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,448
There's a week's pay in there.

664
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,755
It is more than enough
to cover the three days,

665
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,802
and after you do 'em,
you contest the judgment.

666
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,544
By then, eye will be off this
and IAD will clear it.

667
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,677
Listen to me, Werner:

668
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,157
It's gonna take a bit,

669
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,334
but I can make you whole
on this if you let me.

670
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,075
I will, and thanks.

671
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:19,948
But this Ruzek guy
showed me no respect.

672
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,796
Thinks he's a big shot
'cause he works upstairs.

673
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,170
We're both blue.
Why's he get a pass?

674
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,827
Okay, what do you need?

675
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,180
I gotta go.

676
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,753
- Vasil, thank you.
- Is there news?

677
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,104
We realize this is a bad time,

678
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,889
but we'd like to show
some photos to Peter, please.

679
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,717
Look, we're trying
to build a case

680
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,937
against the second member
of the robbery crew.

681
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,287
An ID from Peter
would solidify it.

682
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,419
It's important.

683
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,465
Hey, Peter.

684
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,079
They want to
show you some pictures.

685
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:06,473
All right, why don't you
just take a look?

686
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:10,172
We think, one of these guys
might be the second robber.

687
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,006
Any of them look like the guy
that pulled up the ski mask?

688
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm not sure.

689
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,360
Just take your time.
Why don't you look again?

690
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,235
Don't recognize them.

691
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,150
Sorry.

692
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,804
- Go check on your aunt.
- Thank you.

693
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,806
- Anything else?
- No.

694
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,592
I know how hard this is, but...

695
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:40,855
is he okay?

696
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,727
He thinks it's his fault
my brother's dead,

697
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,947
that his mouth
brought us this misfortune.

698
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:49,255
So the answer's no.

699
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:50,996
He's not okay.

700
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,346
None of us are.

701
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:01,006
- Sarge, take a look at this.
- What do you got?

702
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,572
I pulled the POD footage
to find out

703
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,661
how in the hell
Cranston broke containment.

704
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,013
- You zoom in on the plate?
- I did.

705
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,971
It's registered to a woman
named Gina Morales.

706
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:11,712
She and the car resurface yet?

707
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,627
No, and the GPS is disabled.

708
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,020
So he's still got her.

709
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,283
Think so. I put out a BOLO.

710
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,024
Yeah, and check
her home address.

711
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,089
See if someone has her number.
We can ping and track her cell.

712
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,463
Yeah, good.

713
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:27,554
You ever had to
do a notification like this?

714
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:28,990
It's never easy
to tell somebody,

715
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,601
"Hey, your loved one's
been kidnapped."

716
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,344
Maybe we won't have to.
Isn't that her car?

717
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,911
It is.

718
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,739
All right,
so either he let her go

719
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:39,890
and she was too scared
to report it, or...

720
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:40,959
Cranston's in the house.

721
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,570
Take the back, I got the front.

722
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,404
It's him! Let's go!

723
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,237
Don't move! Drop the weapon!

724
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,717
Drop the weapon!

725
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,809
Make me do it.

726
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:10,640
Smart move.
Walk down the stairs.

727
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,428
On your knees.

728
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,995
On your knees!

729
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,561
Go.

730
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,623
Gina.

731
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,539
This is Officer Rojas
with Chicago PD.

732
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,802
- My God.
- You're safe.

733
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,153
My God, thank you.

734
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,941
Armed robbery,
kidnapping, and murder.

735
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,639
That's a felony trifecta.
"Murder"?

736
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,510
Sit down.

737
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,077
Look, I don't know
what he told you,

738
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,471
but it was Barnes
that shot that old man, not me.

739
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,300
- Barnes? Barnes...
- Sit down!

740
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,998
Look, you don't believe it,
put me in a cell with him.

741
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,173
I'll wear a wire.

742
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,131
You can hear it
with your own ears.

743
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:07,195
The hell are you talking...

744
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,370
You want to be in a cell
with Barnes?

745
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,004
Yeah, he's an idiot.

746
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,571
He panicked.

747
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,853
Gun went off when he was trying
to push the old man away.

748
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:15,270
I mean, Christ,
I had to tell him

749
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,924
to get rid of the gun
after he'd used it!

750
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,666
He was gonna hold onto
the damn thing.

751
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:20,754
Come on!

752
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,669
Don't... don't play me for stupid!

753
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:25,541
I know you picked him up
yesterday.

754
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,196
You're trying to tell me
it wasn't you followed Barnes

755
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,677
from the motel
after he made bail?

756
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,680
What are you talking about?

757
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:35,769
Look, either this guy
is a hell of an actor

758
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,163
or he really doesn't know
Barnes is dead.

759
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,338
Maybe he doesn't.

760
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:40,817
His cell phone GPS
puts him at home

761
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,037
during the time
of Barnes' murder.

762
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,430
You're sure about that?

763
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:47,998
Yeah, she's right.

764
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,088
You said the landlord saw
a guy stalking Barnes

765
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,437
right after he bailed out.

766
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,526
Yeah, but we couldn't confirm
with the footage

767
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,789
from the street PODs
outside Barnes' apartment.

768
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:58,705
There was no sign of Cranston
or his car.

769
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:03,797
Well, maybe we're not
looking for Cranston.

770
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,626
Let's pull all POD footage
from in and around that motel.

771
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:25,427
I let myself in.

772
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,349
Dad, is everything okay?

773
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,438
Go upstairs.

774
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,921
I said go upstairs.

775
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,110
What's this about?

776
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:02,029
Your brother's last words.

777
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:04,162
"Buy yourself candles," right?

778
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,296
See, I think he meant it
as a curse.

779
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,169
Like, candles for your funeral.

780
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,434
He wasn't asking
for forgiveness.

781
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,262
It was a plea
for vengeance, right?

782
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,654
He was dying.

783
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:21,048
What type of man
wouldn't want vengeance?

784
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,536
I just found that
under Peter's mattress.

785
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:38,239
It's a 9-millimeter.

786
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,502
Same caliber used
to kill Barnes.

787
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,943
What's the chance
the ballistics will match?

788
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:51,557
It's mine.

789
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,951
Then why would you put it
under Peter's mattress?

790
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,913
You want a confession,
I'll give you one.

791
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,484
It's my gun.

792
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:08,487
I'm the one who killed that man.

793
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,317
But you didn't. Your son did.

794
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,710
Peter did recognize Barnes
in that lineup.

795
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:18,453
He just said he didn't
because he wanted revenge,

796
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,282
to earn back your respect.

797
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,502
I've already told you,

798
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,765
I'm the one who did it,

799
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:28,420
and you got no evidence
my son is involved.

800
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:33,947
Vasil, I got POD footage
of Peter...

801
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,123
sitting in his car...

802
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:41,433
A block from the motel
where Barnes was murdered.

803
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,053
A man's dead, Vasil.

804
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,837
I can't just ignore that.

805
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,448
Why?

806
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,974
Is Chicago worse because of it?

807
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,066
Please...

808
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:09,678
this is on me.

809
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,550
Even though I didn't
pull the trigger,

810
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,248
I'm the one responsible.

811
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,260
Come on.

812
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:36,575
Hey, Hank? Can I have a sidebar?

813
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,926
Give me a minute, Jay.
I'll catch up.

814
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,319
What do you got?

815
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,583
Um, I couldn't completely
resolve the Ruzek issue.

816
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:48,630
Werner has an ask that
is way beyond my paygrade.

817
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,546
Tell me.

818
00:38:56,421 --> 00:39:00,294
"I was born for the storm
and the calm does not suit me."

819
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,993
You ever hear that saying?

820
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,039
No.

821
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,607
Well, is that
what this is, Adam?

822
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,565
You just can't take the calm?

823
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:15,440
I don't know, boss. I'm sorry.

824
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,094
Thought I could handle it.

825
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,140
But you didn't.

826
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:25,667
This thing between you
and patrol...

827
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:26,886
it has got to end.

828
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,018
I know, I want it to.

829
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,673
I mean, I'll do anything. Yeah?

830
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,328
Well, that's good to know.

831
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,463
Follow me.

832
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,468
God.

833
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,481
You know,
Werner's losing his badge

834
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:57,699
for three days over this.

835
00:39:57,743 --> 00:39:59,092
I know, I know.

836
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,268
I gave him money to try
and take the sting off that.

837
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,140
Yeah, well, he wants more
than your money.

838
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:19,242
Are you serious?

839
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:25,379
It's about respect.

840
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,045
He's a big guy, Sarge.

841
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,134
Yeah.

842
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,312
You're not asking me
to lose this, are you?

843
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,401
No.

844
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,100
Never.
