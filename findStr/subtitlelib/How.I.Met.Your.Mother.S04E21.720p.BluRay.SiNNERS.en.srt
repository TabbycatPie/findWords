1
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:04,763
Great. So, I'll give you a call.

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:06,968
- Hope you do.
- All right.

3
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:11,966
- Look at this.
- Hey, I just got that girl's number.

4
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,009
Check it out. Holli.

5
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:15,368
Nice!

6
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:19,141
Girls whose names end in "L-Y"
are always dirty.

7
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:23,049
- Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily...
- Hey!

8
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:26,516
Yeah, no, it's true.

9
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,948
Don't even get me started on girls

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,324
whose names should end in "Y,"
but instead end in "I."

11
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,693
Those girls are like roller coasters.

12
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,028
You got to wait in a long line,
but once you get up there,

13
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:40,364
you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.

14
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:44,540
Hey, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call her right now.

15
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:48,509
I'm gonna do that whole,
"Hey, remember me? It's been so long. "

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,507
- See, it's funny, because I just saw her.
- Dude, you can't call her.

17
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:55,277
You have to wait three days
to call a woman. That's the rule.

18
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,616
Barney, that rule is completely played out.
Girls know exactly what you're doing.

19
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,814
Hey! I got a new rule.

20
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:05,190
It's kind of crazy, but I call it,
"You like her, you call her. "

21
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,464
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
I don't speak I-never-get-laid.

22
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:14,495
Barney, the three-days rule is insane.
I mean, who even came up with that?

23
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:16,931
Jesus.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,838
Barney, don't do this. Not with Jesus.

25
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,045
Seriously. Jesus started the whole
wait three days thing.

26
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:27,378
He waited three days to come back to life.
It was perfect.

27
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:28,882
If he'd have only waited one day,

28
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,885
a lot of people wouldn't have even heard
that he died.

29
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,421
They'd be all, "Hey, Jesus, what up?"

30
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:37,323
And Jesus would probably be like,
"What up? I died yesterday. "

31
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:41,328
And then they'd be all,
"You look pretty alive to me, dude. "

32
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:43,831
And then Jesus would have to explain
how he was resurrected,

33
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,161
and how it was a miracle.

34
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:49,136
And then the dude would be like,
"Okay, whatever you say, bro. "

35
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,665
Wow, ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.

36
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,766
And he's not gonna come back
on a Saturday.

37
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:57,209
Everybody's busy doing chores.

38
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,247
Working the loom, trimming their beards.

39
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,217
No. He waits
the exact right number of days.

40
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:04,910
Three.

41
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:09,014
Okay, I promise, I'll wait three days.
Just please stop talking.

42
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,060
Plus, it's Sunday,
so everyone's in church already.

43
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:15,528
They're all in there,
"Oh, no, Jesus is dead. "

44
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:19,466
Then, bam! He bursts through
the back door, runs up the aisle.

45
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,063
Everyone's totally psyched. And FYI,
that's when he invented the high-five.

46
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,802
Three days, Ted.
We wait three days to call a woman,

47
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:31,103
because that's how long
Jesus wants us to wait.

48
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:34,573
True story.

49
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:52,861
Okay, fine. I promise.
I won't call Holli for three days.

50
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,897
<i>But I never said anything about texting.</i>

51
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,769
<i>I started things off
with something cute and charming.</i>

52
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,933
<i>"I was thinking about you,</i>

53
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:03,069
<i>"so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text. "</i>

54
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:07,377
<i>And the moment I hit "Send,"
I realized it wasn't cute at all.</i>

55
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,444
<i>It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.</i>

56
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,954
<i>And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it...</i>

57
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:17,893
Oh!

58
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:20,019
No!

59
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,789
<i>you can never get it back.</i>

60
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,197
<i>And then, you wait.</i>

61
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,026
<i>And just when you've decided
never to text anyone ever again...</i>

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,938
<i>HOLLl: "I've been thinking about you, too,</i>

63
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:37,001
<i>"and how weird is it that you texted me
while I was in the bath?"</i>

64
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:44,953
- What was that?
- What?

65
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:48,046
- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.

66
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,625
Not that. You made your naked lady noise.

67
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,127
- What?
- Whenever you see a naked lady,

68
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,992
you make the noise...

69
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,234
- I don't do that.
- Really?

70
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:03,898
Oh God, sorry, Lily.

71
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,335
<i>While the men are out hunting,</i>

72
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,641
<i>the women of New Guinea's
indigenous Korowai tribe</i>

73
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:15,047
<i>wash their clothes in the river.</i>

74
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:24,123
That's totally a boob.

75
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,689
Is that Holli who keeps texting you?
Didn't you promise to wait three days?

76
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,267
To call, yes. Texting is totally different.

77
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:35,804
Okay, well, just try to keep
the naked lady noises to a minimum.

78
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:38,237
I don't make a naked lady noise.

79
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:41,070
Really?

80
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,942
<i>Holli and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.</i>

81
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:55,214
<i>And we spent the whole next day
texting each other, too.</i>

82
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:56,848
<i>She seemed perfect.</i>

83
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:01,220
Oh wow. Holli just told me
what she's wearing right now.

84
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,695
It is pretty hot.

85
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,791
Yeah, whatever it is,
I can guarantee you she's not wearing it.

86
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:09,167
- She's lying to you to make you like her.
- How do you know that?

87
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:10,296
Mmm.

88
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,738
Because no woman
in the history of the world is ever

89
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:15,367
"just sitting around
reading architecture magazines

90
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,878
"in my old cheerleader uniform. "

91
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:22,146
Okay, maybe she's lying
about the architecture magazines.

92
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,444
Mmm-hmm.

93
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:28,182
Oh, no.

94
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,849
- Oh, no, this is bad.
- What?

95
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,895
She just sent me a text
that was clearly meant for someone else.

96
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:40,230
"Hey, baby, I picked up some take out
from Generro's. Be home soon. "

97
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay, yes, this sounds bad,
but let's think about this, okay?

98
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:47,573
It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.

99
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:49,041
Scroll down.

100
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,675
"And then I want you
to do me on the couch. "

101
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:57,242
Okay, maybe not a sick dad.

102
00:05:57,752 --> 00:06:00,653
Or a very sick dad. Am I right?

103
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,117
Sorry.

104
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,687
Hey, guys.

105
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:10,397
What is this?

107
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,896
Oh. It's some take out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.

108
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:18,898
That's weird. Holli just texted Ted
something about take out from Generro's.

109
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,376
Wait a second.

110
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,740
You sons of bitches!

111
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,104
What?

112
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:28,014
You're Holli.

113
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,969
So Ted hasn't been texting Holli at all?

114
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,560
He's been texting you two?

115
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,732
Look, we knew he'd try to call her
before the three days,

116
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:44,573
so I swiped his phone
and I changed her number to my work cell.

117
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,580
We were just gonna bust on him
for calling her too soon,

118
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,014
but then he started texting her.

119
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,282
"Texty text"?

120
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,819
Oh Ted. Oh poor, sweet Ted. We should...

121
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,223
- We should tell him it's us.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,386
Or...

123
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,798
We pretend we're Holli,
and we're in the bath.

124
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,762
Yeah, that's better.

125
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:14,939
That was fun.

126
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,704
- We should tell him that it's us.
- Yeah, we should.

127
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,870
Or...

128
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,543
We tell him our favorite color is red,

129
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,516
and we think the "cowboy" look
is very sexy.

130
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:26,653
Yeah, that's better.

131
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:31,681
<i>I'm wearing them right now,
and they do look sexy.</i>

132
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,353
- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!

133
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,157
That was awesome!

134
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:42,896
But it's time to tell him
who he really put those boots on for.

135
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,767
Yeah. Or...

136
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,398
We just took off our shirt.

137
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,071
Yeah, that's better.

138
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:55,008
You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?

139
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:58,447
I don't think
we're wearing anything underneath.

140
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:00,042
God, we're hot.

141
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,282
Now he's only wearing the cowboy boots!

142
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,293
- It is on!
- It is so on!

143
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:11,092
Okay, tell him that we're slowly
slipping out of our...

144
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,861
What are we doing?

145
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,732
I think that we're

146
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,898
about to have sex with Ted.

147
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:28,704
So you did this to him all day?
That's just mean.

148
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:32,308
No! No, no,
it was actually for his own good.

149
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,514
We're protecting him from himself.
He really likes this girl.

150
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,090
He had that look in his eye.

151
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:41,355
Yeah, that crazy "I'm about
to move too fast and screw this up" look.

152
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:43,828
It was actually the same look he had
on his first date with you.

153
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,956
- We all remember how that went.
- Yeah.

154
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,094
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

155
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,208
Yeah, well, I think I was a special case.
This Holli is no Robin Scherbatsky.

156
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:59,374
And what is the deal with her hair?
I mean, newsflash,

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,347
they make conditioners
that don't leave a buildup.

158
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,781
I'm so bad.

159
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:06,779
Look, it's been a while
since Ted really liked someone.

160
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:09,481
He's clearly got a lot of crazy stored up.
We just...

161
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,353
We thought
we'd get him to say, "I love you"

162
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,256
before he makes contact with this girl.

163
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,558
And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.

164
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,531
Yeah. One, he joked about getting married.

165
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,397
"You like architecture?
We should get married.

166
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:26,337
"Ha-ha. LOL. Just kidding. Question mark. "

167
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,766
Two, he made a crazy
way-too-soon trip suggestion.

168
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:32,575
"I like beer, too.

169
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,841
"We should totally
go to Germany together.

170
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,611
"LOL. JK. LOL."

171
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:42,813
And three,
he got way too personal way too soon.

172
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:46,149
"Yeah, my parents got divorced
a couple years back.

173
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,989
"It was really tough.

174
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,255
"LOL."

175
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,625
And he clearly doesn't know
what LOL means.

176
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,098
Yeah, but here's the real problem.

177
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:57,796
Ted wasn't saying, "I love you"
as easily as we thought he would.

178
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,668
Then we met Stan.

179
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,676
Why are you making so much noise, man?

180
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:14,054
So we explained everything to him,
and when we were done,

181
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,588
something amazing happened.

182
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,518
Why don't you tell Ted
that just knowing he's out there

183
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:22,289
thinking about you, caring about you,
makes you feel safe?

184
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:26,126
So all your fears,
all your yesterdays wash away,

185
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:29,498
and only hope remains
in the promise of his embrace.

186
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:36,468
- Wow. Go, Stan! Who is this guy?
- He's a security guard who works nights.

187
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,238
And he eats lunch at MacLaren's
every day.

188
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,939
- And he wasn't done.
- Not by a long shot.

189
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,977
You make me thank God
for every mistake I ever made

190
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,851
because each one led me down the path
that brought me to you.

191
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:51,020
That's, like, really nice, man.

192
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,188
Whatever. It's okay.

193
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:58,257
<i>HOLLl: "And when we finally come
together, I want you to hold me. "</i>

194
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:01,459
Hold me all night. Stroke my hair.

195
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,761
Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.

196
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,840
Until there was only now.

197
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:10,707
You and I and now.

198
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:12,503
Yes!

199
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:17,547
You want me to text that to Ted.
I know that.

200
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:22,221
<i>HOLLl: "I do not ask
of the night explanations</i>

201
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:25,019
<i>"I wait for it and it envelops me</i>

202
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:30,821
<i>"And so you and bread and light
And shadow are"</i>

203
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,595
That's Pablo Neruda.

204
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,094
I don't know
what bread was doing in there,

205
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:39,331
but that touched me here

206
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,303
and here.

207
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,210
Well, if Ted won't say it, I will.

208
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,811
I love you.

209
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:51,549
That's cool.

210
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,351
- Still nothing, huh?
- Maybe he's not in love with us.

211
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:59,153
How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.

212
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,818
I don't get men.

213
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,487
Gotta head to work.

214
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,224
Will you be back?

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll be back when the wind
and fates and chance bring me back.

216
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,234
Which will be tomorrow.

217
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,204
It's cheese steak day.

218
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,713
Wow! It sounds like
you were all over this guy.

219
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,111
Hope his girlfriend didn't get jealous.

220
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:24,616
Did he mention a girlfriend, or...

221
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,814
It was all going great,

222
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,583
until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily

223
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,090
- and ruined everything.
- Well, it doesn't matter, okay?

224
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:35,390
It's over now. I gotta get going,
but here's what's gonna happen.

225
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:39,865
You're going to call him right now,
tell him what you did, and apologize.

226
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,559
- You got it?
- Yes.

227
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,364
Or...

228
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:50,310
Holli explained everything.
It was all just a misunderstanding.

229
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,709
- Everything's great now.
- Really?

230
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,513
How did Holli explain her way
out of that one?

231
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:59,313
Well, apparently, her dumb friend Marsha
accidentally used her phone

232
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,548
- to text her husband, Billy.
- Marsha and Billy.

233
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,056
No one sprained any muscles there.

234
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,891
And now we are better than ever.

235
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,389
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

236
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:13,557
but I think I might actually
be falling for this girl.

237
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,795
- You're falling for Barney and Marshall.
- What?

238
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:19,372
They didn't believe
that you could wait the three days,

239
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:22,909
so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.

240
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,035
Holli is Barney and Marshall.

241
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,613
Wait, that whole time, it was them?

242
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,373
<i>So Holli wasn't in the bath?</i>

243
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:37,184
<i>Or sitting by her window, looking up
at the stars, thinking about me?</i>

244
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:45,261
<i>Or lounging in her old cheerleader uniform,
reading architecture magazines?</i>

245
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:51,364
Yeah. I don't think
they actually did those things.

246
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:53,463
They were just at the bar.

247
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,769
- Right.
- But, yeah, it was them.

248
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,402
- Unbelievable!
- I know.

249
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,378
So you might as well tell them
you're on to them.

250
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,540
Yeah.

251
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:04,375
Or...

252
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,651
I text them something
that'll really mess with their heads.

253
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,953
Oh I gotcha. Okay. How about,

254
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,322
"I haven't told any of my friends yet,
but I only have three months to live"?

255
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:21,424
Not bad. How about,
"I once killed a man with a shovel,

256
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,935
"and those feelings
are creeping up again"?

257
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:28,441
Uh-huh. I liked that thing someone said
before about having three months to live.

258
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:33,036
How about, "I've never told anyone this,
but I slept with my best friend's mom"?

259
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,980
That is good,
but I feel like we keep coming back

260
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,074
to that three-months-to-live thing.

261
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,619
- Wait. I think I got it.
- Yeah?

262
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,714
He texted back!

263
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:48,284
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.

264
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,391
"I mean, we barely know each other.

265
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,862
"But what the hell, I'll just say it. "

266
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,401
This is it, dude.
Here comes the "I love you. "

267
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,835
- I wish Stan were here.
- Stan.

268
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,240
- Whoa!
- What?

269
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:08,142
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend. "

270
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:18,051
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend. "

271
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,120
Why in the world would Ted text
a girl he barely knows

272
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,129
that he sometimes
has gay dreams about me?

273
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,324
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll.

274
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,726
You? He's clearly talking about me.

275
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:34,171
- Dude, it's me. I'm his best friend.
- Okay. One, that has never been proven.

276
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:38,574
Two, if anyone were to have gay dreams
about one of us, it would be me.

277
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,604
I mean, look at me. Now look at you.

278
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:45,681
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.

279
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:49,750
Here's the thing, Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.

280
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,751
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next
to this business on a Sunday morning?

281
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,385
Wrapped in a comforter,
and it's raining outside,

282
00:15:56,496 --> 00:16:00,990
and there's muffins warming in the oven.
I'm cuddly, bitch. Deal with it.

283
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,068
I work out every day.

284
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,900
If there is one thing we know about Ted,
it's that he likes a nice body.

285
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:08,530
This body would rock his world.

286
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:11,405
Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.

287
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:15,311
There are things I could do to him
that would blow his mind...

288
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,475
Why do we keep trying
to have sex with Ted?

289
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:21,576
I don't know. It's weird.

290
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:25,856
Crazy, right?
Ted's having gay dreams about me?

291
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,019
And by me, he means M-E,
Marshall Eriksen,

292
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,120
star of Ted's gay dreams.

293
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,030
Who cares? So Ted has gay dreams
about one of you guys.

294
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:39,502
It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.

295
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:42,335
That's, like, shocking, right?

296
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:47,372
Whoa! Take a look at this guy.
How's it going, best friend of 12 years?

297
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,380
Well, it's kind of weird,

298
00:16:52,118 --> 00:16:55,576
but I had this crazy dream the other night.
It's a little embarrassing.

299
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:58,088
You can tell us, Ted. This is a safe space.

300
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,183
Yeah, your feelings
are perfectly natural, buddy.

301
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,353
Okay. Here's what happened.

302
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:05,464
So I'm at the...

303
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:08,625
<i>And then I proceeded to waste
a half hour of those bastards'lives,</i>

304
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,201
<i>telling them about this dream I had</i>

305
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:14,034
<i>where I ate dinner with my top five
favorite architects throughout history.</i>

306
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,903
And then, at the end of the meal,

307
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:19,307
Frank Gehry slides the check
over to I.M. Pei, and he says,

308
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:23,041
"Buddy, tonight, your name is I.M. Paying. "

309
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,083
Buckminster Fuller almost did a spit take.

310
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,783
And then I woke up.

311
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,848
So, that's it?

312
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,125
No other dreams?
Nothing confusing or erotic?

313
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:40,890
No.

314
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,927
Okay, how about this? Ted, you know how,
at some point in the future,

315
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,868
- machines will rise up against us?
- Sure.

316
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:50,306
Okay. So the machines,
they've killed everybody,

317
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,908
and all that's left is you,

318
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,269
me,

319
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,379
and Barney.

320
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,382
Which one of us would you, like,

321
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:03,783
get with?

322
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,352
And why do I have to
"get with" one of you?

323
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:11,426
The machines are forcing you.

324
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:14,762
They want to watch.
That's just how they get down.

325
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:19,833
That's a tough one.
I guess it would have to be...

326
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:24,068
Holli.

327
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,676
Robin told me what you guys did.

328
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,508
That's why I made up
the gay dreams thing.

329
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,844
- Guys, this is Holli.
- Hi.

330
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,875
And I didn't wait
your precious three days to call her.

331
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,477
I knew where she worked,
so I tracked her down.

332
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:40,821
- Let me ask you. Did I call you too soon?
- I love that he called me right away.

333
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:43,020
I found it very romantic.

334
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,790
And by the way,
I don't sit around my apartment

335
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:48,799
reading architecture magazines
in my old cheerleader uniform.

336
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,960
I do that completely naked.

337
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,941
So Holli and I are going out to dinner.

338
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,308
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.

339
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:04,647
I'm sorry, buddy.
We were just trying to help you.

340
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,184
And, also, it was really fun.

341
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:13,114
I don't need your help, okay?
I can take care of myself.

342
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,689
And, yeah, maybe there are some girls

343
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:17,695
who wouldn't like it
that I called them right away

344
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:22,632
or said things too soon, but guess what?
Those aren't the right girls for me.

345
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:27,172
Maybe the right girl is the one
who loves that I do those things because...

346
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:29,605
That's just who I am,
and I'm not gonna change

347
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,405
because of some stupid three-days rule.

348
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:37,679
Oh! And Holli spells her name with an "I."

349
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:42,449
<i>So I had proven
that the three-days rule was wrong,</i>

350
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,716
<i>and I was out to dinner with a pretty girl.</i>

351
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,792
<i>And until right now, I've never told anyone</i>

352
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:48,917
<i>the truth about what happened
on that date.</i>

353
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:52,964
That's so funny! I love indie music, too.
We should get married.

354
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,154
Ha, ha.

355
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,733
Just kidding.

356
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,196
Or am I?

357
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,437
Just kidding again!

358
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,699
That's it.
We're totally going to Brazil together!

359
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,435
And I went to my doctor this morning,
and he said it is all cleared up,

360
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:06,170
so I'm good to go.

361
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,380
I think I'm in love with you, Ted.

362
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:13,009
<i>In the end, I didn't need to wait
three days, but Holli really, really did.</i>

363
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,219
<i>Like a lot of rules,
there are times to follow them</i>

364
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:19,223
<i>and times to not. But I will tell you this.</i>

365
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:23,353
<i>When I got your mother's number,
I called her right away.</i>

366
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,898
- Stan!
- Hey, fellas.

367
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,661
- Stan, aren't you working?
- Took the night off.

368
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,763
- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah!

369
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:38,037
- I can't. Got a date. You ready, baby?
- Yep.

370
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:39,903
What the...

371
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:43,743
Wait, wait. Couldn't you guys
just stay here and do your date with us?

372
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,544
Yeah, it'll be fun!

373
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:49,082
Look, I'm laughing!
It's fun here! You like magic?

374
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:52,455
Fellas, it's time we said goodbye.

375
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:55,085
I mean, we shared
a very special afternoon together,

376
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:59,494
and that's something I will always cherish.
I'll never forget you guys.

377
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,024
- Do you even know their names?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?

378
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:06,036
- No. That's Marshall. He's married to Lily.
- You like chicken wings?

379
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,230
Oh, yeah!
