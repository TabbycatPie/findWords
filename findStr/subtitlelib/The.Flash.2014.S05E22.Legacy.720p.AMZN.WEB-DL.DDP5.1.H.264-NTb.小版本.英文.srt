1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,540
Previously on "The Flash."

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,360
You're no longer you.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,620
You're a part of a negative force.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,650
Thawne's Speed Force is fueled by negative emotions.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,670
- What do you do? - Trust me,

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,130
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

7
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,110
You're not super satisfied with your secret identity.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,130
Are you saying I don't want to be Vibe?

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,320
There won't be any future for any metas

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,860
if we don't get rid of that dagger.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,700
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,110
it's this Mirror Gun.

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,930
It works.

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,260
Follow my instructions

15
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,610
and we'll defeat Cicada,

16
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,690
destroy her dagger,

17
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,920
and save your father.

18
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,210
Thawne is manipulating her.

19
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,660
He's on death row, how is he manipulating her?

20
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,300
Something doesn't add up.

21
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,700
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

22
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,010
Don't shoot it!

23
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,550
I always wanted to be a hero,

24
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,120
to use my extraordinary abilities to help people.

25
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,870
That's why I came here.

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,490
To meet my family, to stop Cicada,

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,130
help fix the Flash's legacy,

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,750
and save him from disappearing in the future.

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,240
I believed I could do the impossible,

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,600
but I never imagined it would turn out like this.

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,920
No, no! What's he doing?

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,540
Cicada--Thawne, dagger.

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,660
How's Ralph?

37
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,100
I've never seen anything like it.

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,310
I can't quite figure it out.

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,270
His cells are kinetically inverted.

40
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,890
It's like they're the reverse of themselves.

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,390
Should've spent more time trying to figure out

42
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,810
how this thing works.

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,780
I just don't understand

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,470
why he would jump in front of that blast.

45
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,790
I mean, why would he do that?

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,950
That's the question, isn't it?

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,370
That's the question.

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,120
In other news, Cicada deuce is still MIA.

49
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,510
All right, we should get to CCPD,

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,860
see if we can find anything that could help us track her.

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,700
What?

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,910
I'm supposed to meet up with Kamilla later.

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,920
I thought things were going really well for you two.

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,960
They are.

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,380
I just haven't told her about

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,880
my vibratory alter ego yet.

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,690
Cisco, if you're serious about being with her,

58
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,630
you have to tell her the truth.

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,450
I know.

60
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,560
All the metas that we couldn't cure,

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,410
we got safely evacuated

62
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,890
and they're waiting at a protected holding facility.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,450
Nice work, both of you.

64
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,870
Well the work's not done yet.

65
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,460
I mean, the metas are safe for now,

66
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,790
but Cicada's still out there,

67
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,390
so the people are still in danger.

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,880
Fill me in on the details.

69
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,850
I'm ready for this nightmare to end.

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,140
It should've been over already.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,370
Nora, look,

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm sure Ralph had a good reason.

73
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,140
Until we figure out what it is,

74
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,550
we just gotta concentrate on this, all right?

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,460
Wait a second.

76
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,070
What is that?

77
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,850
Looks like wood.

78
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,770
From what?

79
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,310
I mean the floor is marble,

80
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,480
furniture's untouched,

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,290
and the skylight's made of glass and metal.

82
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,510
Well if it didn't come from Cicada's point of entry...

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,590
She must've brought it from somewhere else.

84
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,470
What do we do now?

85
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,010
You know what to do.

86
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,420
Hit them when they least expect it.

87
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,850
When they least expect it.

88
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,860
The Time Sphere.

89
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,470
If I repair it,

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,370
I can bring the last of the virus back

91
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,990
to the night of the Particle Accelerator.

92
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,710
When meta-humans first appeared in Central City...

93
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,360
And the Flash becomes a hero to stop me.

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,210
Destroy the meta-humans before they destroy the world.

95
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,220
They'll be born only to die.

96
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,810
Definitely some kind of wood fragment.

97
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,300
And you think those will lead us to where Cicada's hiding?

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,670
We can find out.

99
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,090
We can cross-reference this,

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,520
see what kind of wood it is,

101
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,340
then see where we end up.

102
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,640
Is there any progress on Ralph?

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,010
No, he's still unconscious,

104
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,320
and I can't figure out a way to reverse his cells.

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,870
So I guess that means we still don't know why

106
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,860
he jumped in front of that Mirror Gun, do we?

107
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,940
We do.

108
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,740
We do...

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,700
because Dibny solved the greatest mystery of all.

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,530
The Flash legacy, how to stop Cicada,

111
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,530
repentance for his past sins--

112
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,460
all the reasons Eobard Thawne was helping you.

113
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,650
And stopping Dad from disappearing in the future.

114
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,970
Disappearing in the future is part of it, hmm?

115
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,280
But this has nothing to do with your father.

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,660
The real reason that Thawne wishes to defeat Cicada

117
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,950
and destroy Cicada's dagger

118
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,710
is because this dagger

119
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,460
is the only thing keeping the Reverse-Flash in prison.

120
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,920
Guess this is it.

121
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,890
Looks like it, doesn't it?

122
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,700
I almost forgot.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,960
I contacted the Flash Museum,

124
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,880
had them send something over for today.

125
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,540
I thought it should be buried for good...

126
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,410
along with you.

127
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,370
Consider it a parting gift.

128
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,700
Destroying Cicada's dagger in the past

129
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,530
will save Thawne from dying in the future?

130
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,320
That's right.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,860
Cicada's dagger has been dampening

132
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,690
Thawne's powers all this time.

133
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,940
So if we get rid of the dagger now,

134
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,910
it disappears in the future?

135
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,350
And Thawne gets out of Iron Heights.

136
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,050
A reverse time hack.

137
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,660
Everything you said about Thawne is true.

138
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,170
The only person he ever helps is himself.

139
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,510
Nora, this is not your fault.

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,860
Yes, it is.

141
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,320
Now the question we have to ask...

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,840
do we stop Cicada or do we stop Thawne?

143
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,750
No, we're not gonna let thousands of meta-humans die,

144
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,320
now or in the future.

145
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,420
We find Cicada.

146
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,620
We destroy the dagger once and for all.

147
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,780
You gotta get out of here.

148
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,710
No, we gotta wait for the results--

149
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,780
We can handle it until you get back.

150
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,300
Go see Kamilla.

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,540
How do you choose?

152
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,000
That's more of a question for Iris than for me.

153
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,490
She seems to be happy with my photos.

154
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,140
I was kinda hoping she'd send me over to CCPD

155
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,610
to take photos of the meta-humans

156
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,820
when they were getting that cure.

157
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,720
Can you imagine being there when that Cicada guy attacked?

158
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,950
Cicada woman, actually.

159
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,680
A woman?

160
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,110
Her name's Grace Gibbons.

161
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,740
Her uncle was the first Cicada.

162
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,720
She killed him after he took the meta-human cure.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,520
The cure that I made.

164
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,060
The cure you made?

165
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,720
You're serious.

166
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,680
That's the scientific project you've been working on?

167
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,770
At S.T.A.R. Labs.

168
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,020
You never told me your lab was S.T.A.R. Labs.

169
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,720
There's a lot I haven't told you.

170
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
What is that supposed to mean?

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
You're Vibe.

172
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,840
Look, Kamilla,

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,940
I've seen firsthand how hard it is

174
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,620
to have two lives like this.

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,530
And I tried to separate you from that,

176
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,160
but I don't want to keep this from you anymore.

177
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,690
I can't keep lying to you like this.

178
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,500
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,980
Cisco, wait.

181
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,600
I totally get it.

182
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,930
I've read a lot of comic books.

183
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,240
I know all the tropes that go with

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,300
revealing secret identities.

185
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,420
But in real life, I would never expect you

186
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,560
to tell me something like this right away.

187
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,530
You're amazing, you know that?

188
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,430
Cisco, this isn't about me.

189
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,360
It's about you.

190
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,330
If being Vibe is a part of the life you want,

191
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,440
I would never get in the way of that.

192
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,220
You know you really are a lot like me.

193
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,570
Trusting.

194
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,480
And you always blame yourself when things go wrong.

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,780
How do I fix this?

196
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,620
I don't know if you can, Nora.

197
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,570
You made a mistake,

198
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,350
you know?

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,580
A big mistake.

200
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,130
Sometimes in life, all we can do is just

201
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,020
live with the consequences.

202
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,180
So what you have to ask yourself is

203
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,850
what kind of hero are you gonna be?

204
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,970
One who takes a do-over after every mistake,

205
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,010
or one who lives with it and moves forward?

206
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,640
Nothing?

207
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,920
Nope, I still cannot figure out how to reset

208
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,190
his cells back to normal.

209
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,760
He's till Humpty Dumpty'd, huh?

210
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,630
Yep.

211
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,900
He hasn't been this much of a mess

212
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,700
since he first got his powers.

213
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,310
Since...

214
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,450
And what did you do to help him then?

215
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,850
We introduced a stabilizing enzyme that reset

216
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,090
his body back to its original form using vulcanization...

217
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,110
and muscle memory.

218
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,660
Muscle memory.

219
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,170
Well then it appears all that we need to do

220
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,270
is wake him up.

221
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,850
How would you suggest we do that?

222
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,260
Simple.

223
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,060
We blast him.

224
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,500
We blast him?

225
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,620
If you blast him, the vibrational jolt,

226
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,080
it will be more than enough to kick-start his consciousness.

227
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,990
I'm sure of it.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,650
Can't we just play some Gaga

229
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,690
and hope he wakes up?

230
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,670
Gaga is not the solution to everything.

231
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,600
You have to blast him.

232
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,990
Allez, young Ralph Macchio, please.

233
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,330
Be careful. This could get a little ugly.

234
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,090
Okay.

235
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,250
Sorry, deuce.

236
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,610
WrestleMania!

237
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Voil¨¤! Good as new.

238
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,990
Blasted why you happen what?

239
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,800
B-b-blasted why you happen what?

240
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
Except for the language skills.

241
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,960
Those will return, probably.

242
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,390
Everybody going, where is?

243
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,420
Everybody going where--every--

244
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,650
What is it?

245
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,310
It's the wood particles you guys found.

247
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,220
"Swish ash."

248
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,980
Part of the flowering ash trees indigenous to Europe,

249
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,210
but also make up our biggest wood space

250
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,910
not 12 miles from Central City.

251
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,760
Kolins Woods.

252
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,160
That's where Cicada almost killed me.

253
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,790
That's also one of the largest wooded parks

254
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,510
in the country.

255
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,740
- We need a better plan. - I've got one...

256
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,630
that can stop Cicada and Thawne.

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,250
Out to sniff?

258
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,930
So really we're using her Cecile?

259
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,350
Well, she is a highly sensitive empath

260
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,520
and Cicada emanates hate.

261
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,960
DA Cecile Horton will serve

262
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
as our early warning detection system.

263
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,670
If we're lucky, Cicada won't see what's coming.

264
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,050
Then once we find Cicada to entrap her,

265
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,390
we give Young Grace the choice to take the cure.

266
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,210
And hopefully, when she's no longer a meta...

267
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,780
That bitch will cease to exist.

268
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,110
That way we can stop her without destroying

269
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,290
the dagger and Thawne never goes free.

270
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,650
Now all you have to do is help Grace

271
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,620
make the right choice.

272
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,850
What do I say?

273
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,740
Whatever's in your heart. She'll listen.

274
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,280
What a bunch of sentimental crap.

275
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,240
You two sound like a friggin' Hallmark movie.

276
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,710
I hear ya, sister.

277
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,460
I think we're close.

278
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,750
You good?

279
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,730
Oh, yeah, jeez, sorry.

280
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,940
Uh, this way.

281
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,720
Here we go.

282
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,730
The Sphere is ready.

283
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,740
We can leave.

284
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,660
Guys, we found her. Get ready.

285
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm actually glad you found me before we left.

286
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,270
Now I can end your lives twice today.

287
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,790
Not on my watch.

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,740
- We got her. - Nora, you're up.

289
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,230
If you can connect to Grace as an adult,

290
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,710
you can connect with her as a child.

291
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,800
You just have to tap into her anger.

292
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,210
You can do this.

293
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,430
You shouldn't have come back here, Nora.

294
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,710
I had to, Grace,

295
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,050
because a lot of people are gonna die unless you help me.

296
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,540
If I can help it, you'll be the first to die.

297
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,000
Uh, the force field's integrity

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,390
just went down to 86%.

299
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,070
Grace, I know you think

300
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,270
your uncle wanted all metas dead,

301
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,560
but he was a meta.

302
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,930
That's why he took the cure

303
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,720
and why he wants you to have it too.

304
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,060
You're a meta, just like your uncle.

305
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,290
No I'm not! Take it back.

306
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,340
70%... 52...

307
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,980
Don't listen to her, Gracie.

308
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,160
This hate. It's consuming you,

309
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,910
turning you into a monster.

310
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,010
And what's worse, you're all alone.

311
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,860
Uncle Orlin wouldn't leave me.

312
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,130
He had no choice.

313
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,870
Take the cure just like your uncle did.

314
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,560
No.

315
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,230
40%.

316
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,080
Nora's gotta convince Grace now.

317
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,540
Metas killed your parents, Gracie.

318
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,050
They all deserve to die.

319
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,390
Don't believe him, Grace.

320
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,920
This is just in your mind.

321
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,010
She's right, Gracie.

322
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,700
It's why you created him.

323
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,590
He's the man who took care of you.

324
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,980
19%.

325
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,760
I know a part of you knows that this is wrong.

326
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,010
But the other dark part of you is out there

327
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,070
in the real world killing innocent people.

328
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,080
You can make a choice to stop it.

329
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,780
How?

330
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,850
Wake up and take the cure.

331
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,920
Shut up.

332
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,750
You can do this, Gracie.

333
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,870
Get ready.

336
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,470
Grace.

337
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,380
- Gracie. - Grace.

338
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,910
- Grace. Grace - Grace. Grace.

339
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,170
- Grace!

340
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,050
Okay, I don't want people to die.

341
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,490
I'll take the cure.

342
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,220
Thank you.

343
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,000
Here she comes.

344
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Okay.

345
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,020
Did it work? Guys, what's happening?

346
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,330
Joe, no!

347
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,200
Now I'll finish what I started.

348
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,930
It didn't work.

349
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,460
That shard in her head.

350
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,390
It's still part of the dagger.

351
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,960
Its dark energy is enough to counteract the cure.

352
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,110
If we want to cure Grace, we must destroy that dagger.

353
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,650
You took my family away from me, Flash.

354
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,270
Now watch me take yours.

355
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,850
No!

356
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,000
Barry!

357
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,700
Just in time.

358
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,210
Gentlemen.

359
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,640
I hate to inform you, but...

360
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,280
you're all dead.

361
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,250
Thawne...

362
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,620
I--I can help you.

363
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Isn't this ironic?

364
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,170
Time to repent.

365
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,250
Consider this a parting gift.

366
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,150
Just...in...

367
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,820
Well, well.

368
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,790
It appears as if someone has figured out how to reverse time.

369
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,590
Clever girl.

370
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,280
We figured out everything.

371
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,460
Oh, really?

372
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,920
What have you figured out?

373
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,910
We figured out why you sent Nora back,

374
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,890
why you had her punch DeVoe's satellite--

375
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,210
to create a Cicada we could stop.

376
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,380
Right?

377
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,950
A dagger we could destroy.

378
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,780
It was the dagger that was keeping you in prison all along, wasn't it?

379
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,790
That's right.

380
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,380
15 years.

381
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,650
The second time I've been stuck somewhere against my will for 15 years.

382
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,890
Boring.

383
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,290
Except for your visits, of course.

384
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,880
You're leaving out the most delightful part:

385
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,180
how you both helped me escape.

386
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,730
We helped you?

387
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,880
That's right. When you traveled to the Time Vault, remember that?

388
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,400
Oh, we need help trying to figure out how to drain dark energy

389
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,730
from the "One who got away."

390
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,830
Cicada!

391
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,150
Remember that? When you blurted that out

392
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,520
in the middle of the Time Vault, so that years later,

393
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,100
when I ended up with Cicada's dagger strapped to my chest,

394
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,030
I knew exactly what I had to do:

395
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,020
get Nora Allen to trust me. Easy.

396
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,900
Just like when I got you to trust me,

397
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,160
and then everything starts falling into place.

398
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,220
Why?

399
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,740
Because I am the only speedster

400
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,620
that knows how to manipulate the timeline

401
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,290
to get what I want,

402
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,930
orchestrate the changes that I need,

403
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,400
some of which...

404
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,070
are happening right now,

405
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,090
to ensure one thing:

406
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,670
that I go free.

407
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,040
We don't need a dagger to stop you.

408
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,220
Well then,

409
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,510
let's just see how much your father taught you.

410
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,090
I guess you're not as good a teacher as I am.

411
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,650
You can't save him, Nora.

412
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,470
No matter what you do,

413
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,670
no matter what you try, the Flash will always vanish.

414
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,030
That is his legacy.

415
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,880
Is this nice?

416
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,450
Team Flash, back together again...

417
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,860
with a new guy.

418
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,520
Ralph Dibny.

419
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,240
Welcome. You should be dead.

420
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,850
Yeah, I guess we have that in common.

421
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,310
We'll take care of that in a moment.

422
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,100
Iris. Always a pleasure.

423
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,900
Frost.

424
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,900
Cisco.

425
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,610
It warms my heart to see you again.

426
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,930
I want to apologize for--

427
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,900
But had I not done that,

428
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,500
you never would've had the means to become extraordinary.

429
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,870
I don't need powers for that.

430
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,250
Now!

431
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,550
It's not my father's legacy that's gonna disappear, Thawne.

432
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,730
It's yours.

433
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,980
Nora!

434
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,770
So close, Little Runner.

435
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,990
It was never going to work anyway.

436
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,410
Mom? Dad?

437
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,450
- No, no, no, no. - Mom, what's happening?

438
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,870
- A new timeline is setting in. - What?

439
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,870
A new timeline that you created when you destroyed the dagger!

440
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,390
I'm sorry, Little Runner,

441
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,010
for trading you in like this.

442
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,460
But I had to be sure that I could go free.

443
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,130
You can still save her, Barry.

444
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,830
There's still time. You can still save her.

445
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,830
How?

446
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
The Negative Speed Force.

447
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,920
She has to go there.

448
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,960
It's the only place immune to timeline changes.

449
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,250
But you have to go now.

450
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,780
You have to go, Barry!

451
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Or we lose her forever.

452
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,070
That's right. I've grown fond of her too.

453
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,160
In many ways.

454
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,320
She's shown me what it's like to have a daughter.

455
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,170
See you in our next crisis.

456
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,770
I can't do this.

457
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,860
Yes you can, yes you can. You have to, all right?

458
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,310
Just hold on a little longer.

459
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,070
No, Dad, I can't.

460
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,070
Nora!

461
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,210
I can't.

462
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,530
- Nora, what are we doing? - It's too late.

463
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,770
No, it's not. We gotta go back.

464
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,820
- Dad, no. - Barry, you have to take her back.

465
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,570
I know, I know.

466
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,060
- Mom, Mom. - I know, I know.

467
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,660
Nora, you have to go back now.

468
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,690
No!

469
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,690
If I go back in, the Negative Speed Force

470
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,620
will be a part of me forever.

471
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,700
No, we'll get it out of you, Nora.

472
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,380
We can get it out. We can save you. Please, I promise.

473
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,700
Mom, you can't.

474
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,470
Mom, you can't.

475
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,740
None of you can.

476
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,750
It's making me like Thawne.

477
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,640
Full of anger and hate.

478
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,880
I--I don't want that to be my legacy.

479
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
- This is all on me. - No.

480
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,170
All of it.

481
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,980
My mistake.

482
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,940
And I'm not gonna make another one.

483
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,200
Sometimes all you can do is live with the consequences.

484
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,850
Oh my god.

485
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,200
It's okay. It's okay.

486
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,600
It's okay.

487
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,190
We love you.

488
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,130
Thank you for everything.

489
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,250
We are so sorry.

490
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,410
We have to believe that we'll see her again.

491
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,780
We will.

492
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,700
Nora...

493
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,010
made sure that we didn't lose everything tonight.

494
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,210
She saved every meta in the city.

495
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,290
And she gave Grace a new future.

496
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,610
Gave all of us, right?

497
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,530
Especially me.

498
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,750
Without Nora, I never would've met the love of my life, Renee.

499
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,280
And you wouldn't have stopped your 38th Cicada.

500
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,050
Or your 39th.

501
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,130
Right.

502
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,200
It's been quite a journey.

503
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,230
Pleasure.

504
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,800
An honor, Flash.

505
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,460
We never could've solved this mystery without you.

506
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,380
Well, don't be too sure.

507
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,500
You already have a master detective in your midst.

508
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,140
Congratulations, Adult Giraffe.

509
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,690
Well done, Sherloque.

510
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,370
Sherlock.

511
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,560
Well, all right then. Without further ado.

512
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,060
Mes amis.

513
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,950
Good luck, Team Flash.

514
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,620
It's Singh.

515
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,920
Yeah, he, uh--he wants us to meet him in CCPD

516
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,680
and bring Barry.

517
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,530
Yeah, go.

518
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,000
I kinda want to be alone anyway.

519
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,800
Is everything okay?

520
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,880
What Thawne said...

521
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,990
I don't want that.

522
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,300
I don't want the extraordinary thing about my life

523
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,780
to be my powers.

524
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,050
No one feels that way.

525
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,540
Here's the thing.

526
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,840
I do.

527
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,410
All these years I thought that

528
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,690
Vibe was the person I was supposed to be.

529
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,930
I think it's time Cisco finally got his turn.

530
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,120
So what does that mean?

531
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,480
It means I want to take the cure.

532
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,350
- If you do this... - There's no going back.

533
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,310
I know.

534
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,350
Killer Frost and I are really gonna miss Vibe.

535
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,810
Me too.

536
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,750
How do you feel?

537
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,970
Scared.

538
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,810
But I'm hopeful.

539
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,070
Before I forget,

540
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,470
I left you something in the workshop.

541
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,100
Just, you know, my way of saying thank you.

542
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,810
For what?

543
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,790
Being a great friend.

545
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,470
Well, Grace Gibbons is currently scheduled

546
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,960
to meet with our county counselor.

547
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,640
And as soon as possible, we'll get her in

548
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,230
with a good foster family.

549
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,630
Look, I won't keep you long,

550
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,050
but I just want to thank you

551
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,960
for being at the forefront with Cicada.

552
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,740
Just doing our job, sir.

553
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,640
Well, you went way beyond just doing your job.

554
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,320
And I know you did it because of

555
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,420
how much you care for the people of this city,

556
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,650
which is how I know I can leave it in your capable hands.

557
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,600
What do you mean, leave it?

558
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,420
The mayor's offered me the job

559
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,580
as the new chief of police.

560
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,720
What?

561
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,320
- Dave. - David.

562
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,970
- Congratulations. - That's great.

563
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,510
Thank you, thanks.

564
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,680
Of course that leaves me responsible for finding my own replacement.

565
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,060
And, uh...

566
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
I would like that to be you, Joe.

567
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,050
Re--replace you?

568
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,810
As--as captain?

569
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,480
Captain Joe West.

570
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,360
Oh, I like the sound of that.

571
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,200
And don't worry.

572
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,660
If things get dicey, as they tend to around here,

573
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,190
you'll have plenty of help.

574
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,130
Isn't that right, Flash?

575
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,570
Oh come on, Barry.

576
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,330
I'm a detective too.

577
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,110
Sir.

578
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,440
Congratulations.

579
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,800
I'll do my best.

580
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,580
Now I know what my dad meant

581
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,710
when he said being a parent is like wearing your heart

582
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,380
on the outside of your body.

583
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,210
Yeah.

584
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,540
Thawne got away.

585
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,290
Again.

586
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,810
Nora's gone.

587
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,940
Should feel like a loss but,

588
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
I also feel...

589
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,730
- Pride? - Pride, yeah.

590
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,120
She did good.

591
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,660
Yeah.

592
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,710
She was the best of both of us.

593
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,150
She was my legacy all along.

594
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,500
And us, together, as a family,

595
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,280
that's how I want to be remembered.

596
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,550
As a good man,

597
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,860
a loving husband...

598
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,310
A supportive father.

599
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,990
You're already all of those things.

600
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,640
Nora felt that way too.

601
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,420
Time language.

602
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,030
No matter what changes with the timeline,

603
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,090
that'll never change.

604
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,870
We'll always have this to remember her.

605
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Hi, Mom and Dad.

606
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,720
If you're watching this,

607
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,930
it means that something went wrong.

608
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,840
But I don't want you guys to be sad.

609
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm not.

610
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,490
I always wanted to be a hero,

611
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,060
to use my extraordinary abilities to help people.

612
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,160
That's why I came here:

613
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,460
to meet my family, stop Cicada,

614
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,700
help fix the Flash's legacy,

615
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,830
and save him from disappearing in the future.

616
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,460
I believed I could do the impossible,

617
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,870
but I never imagined it would turn out like this.

618
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,630
I'm glad it did.

619
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,170
I wouldn't change anything

620
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,770
about my time with you,

621
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,980
my sweet parents,

622
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,810
the most important people to me in the world.

623
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,790
I wish I could be there to celebrate every new chapter,

624
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,870
to witness every success.

625
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,350
Just know...

626
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,520
that no matter where I go in my life,

627
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,380
you'll always be my side.

628
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,520
Because of you,

629
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,430
I know I will never, ever, truly be alone,

630
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,510
and I will feel your love and support like a warm hug

631
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,510
comforting me,

632
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,460
pushing me to be the best person I can be.

634
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,970
Thank you for everything...

635
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,630
For making me a hero.

636
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,290
For loving me even if I wasn't perfect.

637
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,060
Please remember that I love you both.

638
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,360
And I always will.

639
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,530
No matter what the future breaks.

640
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,460
Incoming time flicks.
