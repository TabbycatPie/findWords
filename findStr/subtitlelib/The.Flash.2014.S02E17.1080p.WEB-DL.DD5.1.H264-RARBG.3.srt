1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,666
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:05,703
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,290
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,327
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:15,863
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,965
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:21,202
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,605
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:28,009
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:31,012
Let me get this straight.

12
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,980
You're the doppelganger of our Dr. Wells.

13
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,882
Yeah, but that Dr. Wells'
body had been taken over

14
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,518
by the Reverse Flash,
who was really Eobard Thawne.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,853
Eddie!

16
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:40,088
Stay with me, okay? Stay.

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,656
Eddie's his ancestor.

18
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,491
If Eddie dies, then
Thawne will never be born.

19
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,626
He'll be erased from existence!

20
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:49,330
Hartley Rathaway. I couldn't have built

21
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:50,932
the particle accelerator without him.

22
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,167
- Cisco, what did you see?
- I saw Jay.

23
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,635
He's Zoom.

24
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:02,009
I let it happen again.

25
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:04,679
I trusted someone I shouldn't have.

26
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,915
Jay Garrick. Zoom.

27
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,585
Just like I trusted Harrison Wells,

28
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:13,121
or Eobard Thawne.

29
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,089
You see what I mean?

30
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,392
I made the same mistake twice.

31
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:18,993
I thought they wanted to teach me how

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,396
to use my powers, train me to get faster,

33
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:24,298
but they didn't come here to help me.

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,933
They came to use me

35
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,603
and take everything I love away from me.

36
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,104
But no more.

37
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:31,372
I'm gonna crack the code.

38
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,508
Figure out how to improve my speed.

39
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,310
I'm gonna train harder,
get stronger, and run faster

40
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,146
than anyone's ever run before.

41
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:41,115
And then I'm gonna stop Zoom.

42

43
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,163
Yo.

44
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,931
Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet?

45
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,900
No, sorry. It keeps me motivated.

46
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,169
Well, it's giving me daymares.

47
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,137
This is everything I could find

48
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,339
even remotely related to increasing speed.

49
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,775
How are these supposed to help

50
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,577
apply the speed equation to you?

51
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:10,812
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

52
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,296
I think I found something interesting.

53
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,897
Good interesting or bad interesting?

54
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,165
'Cause that word could go either way.

55
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,734
After running some comparative data,

56
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,770
it appears that you, Reverse Flash, and Zoom

57
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,706
are moving your legs
at essentially the same speed.

58
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,942
Then why are they so much faster than him?

59
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,710
Best I can tell, with each stride

60
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,879
their feet spend less time on the ground,

61
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,881
thus propelling them forward much faster.

62
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:34,118
By almost 30%. Great.

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,954
All right, well, I got to make
up that difference somehow.

64
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,859
Barry?

65
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,828
Look, after what that monster did,

66
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,564
I want to stop Jay
just as badly as you do...

67
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,133
Right.

68
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,402
But what if the reason you
haven't been able to run

69
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:55,606
as fast as him yet
is because you just can't?

70
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,214
Barry, you know what happened
to Jay is not your fault, right?

71
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,483
Well, I should've known better.

72
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,852
You? With Wells last year,

73
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,187
I should've learned my lesson

74
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:14,091
and dug deeper into Jay, but... I didn't.

75
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,492
Come on, Joe.

76
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,462
Point being is nobody saw this coming.

77
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,963
Nobody.

78
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,507
So I...

79
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,411
kind of went on a date.

80
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,615
- With who?
- The new editor at CCPN.

81
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,317
Scott Evans.

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,019
Your boss?

83
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,987
Okay, it wasn't like that.

84
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,190
He's a really nice guy.

85
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:50,627
He's sweet and smart and, um...

86
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,999
What?

87
00:03:56,001 --> 00:04:00,370
It just... it all makes me
think about Eddie.

88
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:03,507
I think about him every day, Barry.

89
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,311
It just feels wrong.

90
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,213
I know for a fact that Eddie would want you

91
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,414
to find love again.

92
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,216
Yeah, I know, but...

93
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,418
Look, Iris.

94
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,324
You're the only person who's gonna know

95
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,060
when you're ready to move on, but until then

96
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:28,265
don't keep yourself
completely closed off, you know?

97
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,568
You're gonna miss out on something great.

98
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,170
Yeah.

99
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,274
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

100
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,976
No, no, you're just in time.

101
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,844
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

102
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,346
Dad! Mittens!

103
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,884
So... my advisor loved my engine designs

104
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,086
and even asked me to help her out with one

105
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,922
- of her engineering projects.
- Okay, big man on campus.

106
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,524
It's not that big a deal.

107
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,125
It's a great opportunity,
and you should take it

108
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,627
because life doesn't
give those out all the time.

109
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,529
Isn't that right, Barry?

110
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,763
Yeah.

111
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,398
Yeah. What is the project about?

112
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,733
It's trying to push the speed limits

113
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,368
with smaller propulsion systems.

114
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,537
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Where do you even start?

115
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,138
Well, I really like to read the journals

116
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,574
of the classic engineers,
so their engine designs,

117
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,176
how they increase horsepower,

118
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,378
and learn from the best, I guess.

119
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,913
You read their journals?

120
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,514
Mmm. I mean, it's not like I can

121
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,183
just go and talk to Enzo Ferrari

122
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,685
or Ferdinand Porsche 'cause
they dead, but...

123
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,391
You know, doesn't mean
they can't still teach me.

124
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,725
I got to go.

125
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,360
You haven't even touched your food.

126
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,996
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just, um...

127
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,098
I just realized the key
to a case I've been working on,

128
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,602
so I'm gonna just... thank you, Wally.

129
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,571
Whoo! Um, sorry, guys.

130
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,973
I'll be... I'll be back later.

131
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,943
That dude gets weirder every time I see him.

132
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,344
Yeah.

133
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,780
You mean the "old" Harrison Wells?

134
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,415
As in Eobard Thawne?

135
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,650
You want him to teach you how to run faster?

136
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,519
- Oh, that's rich.
- How are you gonna do that?

137
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,688
By running back to a time last year.

138
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,989
And what about the other you,

139
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,424
the one from that other timeline?

140
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,292
I'll knock him out with something.

141
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,027
I mean, he's not like he'll see me coming,

142
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,829
and then I'll have Wells teach me.

143
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,564
Barry, that's crazy.

144
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,000
Nothing I've read is pointing
me towards a solution,

145
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,935
and if there's anybody that's figured out

146
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:15,872
the key to getting faster
without V-9, it's him.

147
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,978
What do you guys think?

148
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,847
Your plan is asinine.

149
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,752
Did you find Jesse?

150
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,922
Does it look like I found Jesse?

151
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,024
How many times have you
traveled through time?

152
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,559
- A few.
- Do you have any idea

153
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,060
how many things you could screw up?

154
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,363
All I need is one
conversation with Dr. Wells.

155
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,131
- He's not Wells.
- Thawne.

156
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm Wells! This man has been studying you

157
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,236
for 15 years... for 15 years...

158
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,071
and you don't think
he's gonna know who you are?

159
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,973
Barry's pretty good
at impersonating himself.

160
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,541
You should've seen him
over there on Earth-2.

161
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,777
I was like, "Somebody
get this man an Oscar."

162
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,846
He will know, Allen. He will know.

163
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,147
All right, then what am I supposed to do?

164
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,615
I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?

165
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,150
Do you know the answer to this equation?

166
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,486
If Thawne figures out that it's you,

167
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,321
the timeline will be altered.

168
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,956
People can die.

169
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,524
Others could live, and no one will know

170
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,593
who or what will be affected,
but I promise you,

171
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,729
when you come back,
things will be different.

172
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:15,999
And only you will know
what those differences are.

173
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,868
Well, if that's what I
have to do to stop Zoom,

174
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,670
then so be it, because if I don't,

175
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,539
and Zoom gets my speed
before I learn how to stop him,

176
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,709
everybody I care about,
everybody in this whole city...

177
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,412
their world will never be the same anyway.

178
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,087
Um...

179
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,655
Do you really think you can do this?

180
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,524
Yeah, I do.

181
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:45,295
When I went back last year
and I saw my mom die,

182
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,897
it didn't affect the timeline.

183
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,032
Yeah, but you haven't really time traveled

184
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,168
on purpose like this before.

185
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,770
I have to do this, you guys.

186
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:56,106
Okay, let's go for it.

187
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,241
Okay, you're gonna go back to the time

188
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,910
when Wells was distracted by the return

189
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,179
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

190
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,448
This is the first time
we found out Wells knew

191
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,051
the accelerator might explode,
and we were all angry with him,

192
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,786
so anything that might seem odd

193
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,923
about your behavior
Wells should attribute to that.

194
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,725
Also remember:

195
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,494
Do not underestimate Hartley.
He almost killed you.

196
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,496
This is a tranq dart that
should knock "old" you out

197
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,099
for about six hours,
which lines up perfectly

198
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,401
for when you're going back,
because not much was happening

199
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,371
until Hartley attacked
the Cleveland Dam that night,

200
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,273
so that should give you time to
learn what you need and return.

201
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,376
One more thing. You cannot tell us

202
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,112
the truth about Wells, no matter what.

203
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,448
You must keep the timeline intact.

204
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,117
It's gonna be hard to course correct

205
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,952
if anything gets altered,
so get what you need

206
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,954
and come back, preferably to this moment,

207
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,690
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off some

208
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,959
kind of "12 Monkeys" time loop
you'll never get out of.

209
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,460
Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,562
- No pressure.
- Yeah. Cool.

211
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:56,767
So, we'll see you in, like, two seconds.

212
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,270
Time travel's so weird.

213
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,440
- Godspeed, Barry.
- I'll be fine.

214
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,075
What could go wrong?

215
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,458
Eddie!

216
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,037
Oh, no. I'm too early.

217
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,506
You know my name? I know some names too.

218
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,242
This is not a good start.

219
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,159
Caitlyn Snow.

220
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,795
Cisco Ramone. Harrison Wells.

221
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,298
Gah!

222
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,768
Something's interfering with his comms.

223
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,802
Barry!

224
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,010
Come on! Damn it.

225
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,912
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

226
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,881
Whatever Hartley's using
must be shorting out his comms.

227
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:09,816
I can hear the radio waves...

228
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember this.

229
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,686
Emanating from your suit.

230
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:14,054
This could still work.

231
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,956
About 1,900 megahertz.

232
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,024
Are they on the other end listening?

233
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:20,760
Will they hear you die?

234
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:22,662
No. They're gonna hear you...

235
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,331
- Get your ass kicked.
- Get your ass kicked.

236
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,067
Okay.

237
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,210
Is that all it takes to scare you off?

238
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,013
And he chose you over me?

239
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,148
My comms? Who are you?

240
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,051
I don't have time to explain
this to you right now.

241
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:06,873
I don't understand. You're me.

242
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,210
I'm sorry, but I have to do this.

243
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,579
This'll all make sense eventually.

244
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,125
Where are you, oh, chosen one?

245
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,669
Got ya again.

246
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:38,638
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says, huh?

247
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,340
Smart enough to have figured out

248
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,108
who Harrison Wells really is.

249
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,977
You see, I know his secret.

250
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,313
Barry, are you there?

251
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,415
Yeah, yeah, I'm back.

252
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,351
I'm bringing Hartley in.

253
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:02,062
Scanners picking up foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

254
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,930
- Take 'em out.
- I can't.

255
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,399
I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

256
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,368
My hearing was severely damaged.

257
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,571
Without these, I am in pain
you can only imagine.

258
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,544
Cisco, see if the devices in his ears

259
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:22,315
are generating any low level
electromagnetic pulses.

260
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:24,718
You want me to scan for E-bombs?

261
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,586
I just... I mean, don't you think

262
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,888
that could've been what was
interfering with the comms?

263
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:34,060
Well, well.

264
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:36,129
Trying to go all
"Mission Impossible" on us?

265
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,231
Use those things to bust out of here?

266
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,604
Pump in some sound stimuli
to counteract his tinnitus.

267
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,706
Then we'll make some
nonexplosive replacements

268
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,108
for him.

269
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,542
Deal with you later.

270
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,083
Take them out, Hartley. Now.

271
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,953
Dr. Wells.

272
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,222
That was quite an observation you had

273
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:04,958
about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

274
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,195
Yeah, it just seemed too easy
taking him down, you know?

275
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:11,831
Mm-hmm, well, the likely reason for that

276
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,001
is you're getting faster.

277
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,937
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

278
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,607
It occurred to me that maybe
we've been going about

279
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:24,110
improving my speed the wrong way.

280
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:25,812
How so?

281
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:28,314
Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved

282
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,917
in running, and I was thinking

283
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,520
that there's just as much
science involved in speed

284
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,555
as anything physical or technical.

285
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:38,892
I just can't figure out how
to apply it to me when I run.

286
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:42,896
Thought if anybody could
help me, it'd be you.

287
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:47,333
This is quite the... speed equation

288
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,903
you've concocted here, isn't it, Mr. Al?

289
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:53,373
Yeah, I've been doing
a lot of reading in my downtime.

290
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,710
What on earth inspired you
to adopt such a...

291
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,915
what should we call this...
unorthodox approach?

292
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:06,152
I just know that I'm not
the fastest man alive,

293
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,688
and I need to be faster, a lot faster,

294
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,558
if I'm ever gonna be able
to take down the Man in Yellow.

295
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,130
So what do you think? Can you help me?

296
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,879
Let me see what I can do.

297
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,251
Hey, Joe.

298
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,819
Hey, Eddie.

299
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,187
Must have been a good lunch.

300
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:42,989
Iris is the first girlfriend

301
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:45,725
I've ever lived with, so it's
all very new and exciting.

302
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:48,795
New? Yes. Exciting? No.

303
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:51,564
Sorry. Somehow I keep
forgetting you're her dad.

304
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:53,900
Hey, try to remember for both our sakes.

305
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,135
Come here.

306
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,638
I was thinking about
what you said about Wells,

307
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,407
how there's something off about him.

308
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,643
I need you to do something
for me, off the books.

309
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,144
Joe, come on.

310
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:07,914
Just trust me, Eddie.

311
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,017
Okay. What?

312
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,553
Go back to his house. Search everything.

313
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,730
Someone there?

314
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,868
What the hell?

315
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,076
CCPD.

316
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,479
I'm sure they have it handled, right?

317
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:15,782
No.

318
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,250
You need to go.

319
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,521
Run, Barry.

320
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,916
Is everyone okay?

321
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,123
- Barry.
- Yeah?

322
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,658
- You should cover that up.
- Oh, right, yeah.

323
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,996
- Thanks.
- Joe.

324
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:20,366
No sign of it outside. It just disappeared.

325
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:22,869
- Hey, Bar.
- Hey, Eddie.

326
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:26,839
Any idea what that thing could be?

327
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:32,378
No, I don't know. Not yet.
If I figure it out I'll let you know.

328
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,581
Things just keep getting more
and more strange in this city.

329
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,817
Yeah, they do.

330
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:40,319
I'm gonna check in with Iris,
let her know I'm okay.

331
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:42,355
- Great.
- All right, see ya, Bar.

332
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,927
What the hell's going on with you?

333
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,529
What are you talking about?

334
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,064
Look, I know you told Iris
that you love her,

335
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:57,036
but you said you'd moved past
this whole Eddie and Iris thing.

336
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,339
I have, Joe. I have.

337
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,074
Then why are you being so weird to Eddie?

338
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,043
Okay, um, look. I'm sorry.

339
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:07,380
Let me just take care of all this, okay?

340
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,382
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

341
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:12,451
Fine. But soon.

342
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,124
Soon, yeah.

343
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:25,565
What's going on?

344
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,700
Oh, you know, just trying to figure out

345
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,635
how to find this Dementor that's apparently

346
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:31,604
roaming through Central City right now.

347
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:34,841
I assume that was the cause
of the CCPD alarm.

348
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:37,310
Yeah, actually, it attacked my lab.

349
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,779
- You saw it?
- No, I didn't see it, no.

350
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:42,348
I di... um... well, I didn't get there in time,

351
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,851
but I have seen it before.

352
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:46,986
Where?

353
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,488
It was earlier today,
actually, when I was running

354
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,424
to take Hartley down.

355
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,327
Uh-huh. You're just mentioning this now?

356
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,662
I... I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was

357
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,431
some sort of illusion.

358
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,932
- I don't know.
- Okay, well, we need to find it

359
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:01,434
before it hurts somebody.

360
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:03,169
- Can you track it?
- What is it with you guys?

361
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:05,171
It's like you think I have ESP or something.

362
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,206
I can't just magically sense
where things are.

363
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,609
- What can you do, Cisco?
- I'm thinking I can reconfigure

364
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:11,477
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to look for it.

365
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,579
Um, it might take some time though.

366
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:14,947
Do it.

367
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:18,117
In the meantime, Mr. Allen, come with me.

368
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,619
Have a seat.

369
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,454
Is this about the speed equation?

370
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,923
As a matter of fact, it is.

371
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:25,458
Oh, great. Okay, good.

372
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,327
- So you figured it out?
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,434
Yes. I've figured it out.

374
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:55,388
Now, who are you?

375
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,425
I mean, who are you really?

376
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:03,696
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

377
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:06,065
None of it adds up.

378
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:10,803
The interference with the comms,
the speed equation,

379
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,372
the Time Wraith.

380
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,042
That's what we call them. Time Wraiths.

381
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:18,844
Scary, aren't they?

382
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,714
I thought, "Oh, no,
a Time Wraith has found me."

383
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,683
But then I thought, "No, no, no."

384
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,685
You know what you're doing.

385
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,253
Now, the Time Wraith is after someone

386
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:31,590
who's travelled through time...

387
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:35,428
and doesn't know what they're doing.

388
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,333
Dr. Wells, come on. It's me.

389
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,268
It's... it's Barry. I don't...

390
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,703
Really?

391
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:46,939
You are good.

392
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,342
You are good, and I would
believe you, except that...

393
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:54,547
Nothing?

394
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,683
I move like this, you barely flinch.

395
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,155
You know who I am.

396
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:08,794
Don't you?

397
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,963
Oh!

398
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,733
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

399
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:15,301
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen

400
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:18,437
how to phase through objects... yet.

401
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,578
Let me out of here, Thawne.

402
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:34,186
I know. You're upset.

403
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:36,956
But it does me good to hear that name again.

404
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,359
Now, onto the bigger question.
Why are you here?

405
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:42,595
Because I want to go faster,
and you're the only one

406
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:45,331
who can teach me.

407
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,200
You're the only one
who's figured out the equation.

408
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:51,137
The Speed Force.

409
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:53,672
You've manipulated it.

410
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:55,107
How did you do that?

411
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,484
No.

412
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:08,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

413
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:11,957
No.

414
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:15,528
You'd only come here
if something went wrong.

415
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,232
If you're still alive, then that means...

416
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:30,776
I haven't beaten you.

417
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:34,814
If you're still alive...

418
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:39,585
that means my plan fails.

419
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:42,922
And if my plan fails,

420
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:45,925
I don't get to go home, and if
that's the case, well, then...

421
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,860
No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey!
It's the opposite!

422
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:49,228
It's the opposite!

423
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,263
It... you trick me. You harness my speed.

424
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:53,299
We turn on the accelerator to create a path

425
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,733
for you to go home.

426
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:56,969
I go back in time.

427
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:59,605
You go back to yours.

428
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,507
You won.

429
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,845
Yeah.

430
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:09,582
Then why are you here? Why are you here now?

431
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:12,785
Because when I got back,
a singularity had formed.

432
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,854
And now the only way for me
to learn how to get faster

433
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:18,624
and stop the singularity
from happening was to come here.

434
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,359
Now.

435
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:22,361
Well, that's good to know.

436
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,204
There's just...

437
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:39,011
Just one thing that occurs to me.

438
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,916
I don't need you.

439
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:47,119
Do I?

440
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:50,122
Not this you certainly.

441
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,591
Oops.

442
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:55,161
You probably should've thought of that

443
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:57,530
before you came back here.

444
00:23:57,532 --> 00:23:59,498
Shame...

445
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,802
You ran all the way back here

446
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:06,172
just to die.

447
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:09,608
You kill me... Barry...

448
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,444
this Barry, your Barry,

449
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:14,980
he learns it all.

450
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:17,983
There's a hidden letter
telling him how it ends,

451
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:21,754
how to beat you, everything.

452
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:25,925
Anything happens to me,
you never make it back home.

453
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:32,398
Go on.

454
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,134
Kill me, Thawne.

455
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:36,602
See how this all ends.

456
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:55,754
Now, you're gonna help me get faster.

457
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,797
Please.

458
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,302
I want to know how these work.

459
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,304
I'll tell you, just kill the music.

460
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,357
- Thanks.
- The gauntlets, Hartley.

461
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,858
What kind of frequency is this?

462
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,103
Cisco, it's here!

463
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,706
- It's coming!
- Inside the cell, now!

464
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,274
Uh, sorry. What's coming?

465
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,842
Um...

466
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,547
Holy Harry Potter.

467
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,049
Okay.

468
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,817
Well, isn't this fantastic?

469
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,385
Look, we're gonna be safe in here.

470
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,420
These cells are...

471
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,190
Impenetrable?

472
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,559
Barry! Dr. Wells!

473
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,760
All right. We have to help them.

474
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,195
You let it track you here.

475
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,997
Get me out of here! Come on!

476
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,233
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

477
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,502
you're all dead.

478
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,739
- Where are they?
- Okay, let's step back.

479
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,175
- You'll shatter the glass.
- You got a better plan?

480
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,910
As a matter of fact, give me those.

481
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,178
No!

482
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,715
- Now, Cisco!
- What are you gonna do?

483
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,817
These cells have speakers
linked throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

484
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,819
- Yes, and?
- I rigged these gauntlets

485
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,855
to emit a destructive signal
if ever they're disarmed.

486
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,826
If I can just find the right frequency

487
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,128
of whatever the hell that thing
is, well, let's just say

488
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,031
you'll be glad you're in here with me.

489
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,319
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

490
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,389
It's all right, Inky's gone.
I don't see anything.

491
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,857
You know, we'd be toast

492
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,525
if wasn't for Hartley and those gauntlets.

493
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,460
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

494
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,629
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

495
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,464
- Okay, I'm just saying.
- So the two places

496
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,034
this thing has attacked are here and CCPD.

497
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,536
- The common denominator being...
- Me. Yeah, I know.

498
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,104
I just... I don't know why.

499
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,473
Well, you must have done
something to piss him off.

500
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,242
- Satellite hasn't found anything.
- We need to find

501
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,943
a more permanent solution to this problem.

502
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,912
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

503
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,947
That's about as good a first step as any.

504
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:08,251
- I got some parts for it.
- Let's go for it.

505
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,285
You don't know how to stop

506
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,720
- a Time Wraith?
- None of us do.

507
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,654
That's why we always try and avoid them

508
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,423
- in our travels.
- "We"?

509
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,158
Speedsters... we're not the only
two out there, you know?

510
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,826
This isn't the first time
I've time traveled.

511
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,294
How come I've never seen one
of these until now?

512
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,530
Because you ran out of luck.

513
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,799
And Time Wraiths hate it when speedsters

514
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,001
manipulate the timeline,
and now that thing's gonna do

515
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,170
everything it can to end you.

516
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,573
Here's what we're gonna do.

517
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,642
You're gonna go to CCPD.
You're gonna see what you

518
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,744
can find to help us stop this
thing... I'll do the same here.

519
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,345
Well, what am I supposed to be looking for?

520
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,814
You're in forensics. Figure something out.

521
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,450
Hey, what about the equation?
Me getting faster?

522
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,518
If we don't stop this thing,
there's gonna be no point

523
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,087
in me teaching you anything.

524
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,295
No trace elements, no prints,

525
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,865
no sign that it was ever here
except the whole mess.

526
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,467
Any idea what it was looking for?

527
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,669
- Me.
- What, why?

528
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,771
It doesn't like something that I did.

529
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,773
And what exactly would that be?

530
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:10,580
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

531
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,148
Hey, Eddie, do you have a second?

532
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,083
I kind of got to go
check out a lead for Joe.

533
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,052
Okay, actually this is for Iris's birthday.

534
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,287
That's two months from now.

535
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,856
Yeah, no, I know. You're right.

536
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,692
I just... um, I want to make
a video montage for her,

537
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,728
just everybody in her life
and how her being in your life

538
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,664
- has made it better.
- That sounds great, yeah.

539
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,300
- I'll think of something to say. 
- Can we do it now?

540
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,202
Barry, I really got to go do this thing.

541
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,604
I... I know. I really...

542
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,405
it's just I kind of have to get it today.

543
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,940
- Sure.
- All right, great.

544
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,543
Just, um... just speak from the heart.

545
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,678
Talk as if... talk as if

546
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,682
it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

547
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,850
Okay.

548
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,888
Go ahead.

549
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,124
What does Iris mean to me? Uh, wow.

550
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,060
So can these gauntlets be salvaged?

551
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,829
Their electron guns are fried.

552
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,230
So it shorted the wave tubes...

553
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,632
- And destroyed the amplifiers.
- And destroyed the amplifiers.

554
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,300
Yeah, but to be honest with you,

555
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,903
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

556
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,806
Hartley would know. He's the one who did it.

557
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,111
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

558
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,113
But then what? That thing's gonna come back.

559
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,116
I don't know.

560
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,452
Where is he? Where's the other Flash?

561
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,223
Right here.

562
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:40,231
Okay. Not how I expected today to turn out.

563
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,866
Yeah.

564
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,501
Okay, so I'm... who are... who are you?

565
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:45,103
Who is he? Who are you?

566
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,572
What do you... I'm Barry. I'm Barry.

567
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:50,041
- Your Barry. He's...
- Your doppelganger.

568
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:52,410
No, not yet.

569
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:54,612
I am you, Barry.

570
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,581
Just... different.

571
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,983
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

572
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,185
Dude, okay, I've watched
"Wrath of Khan" with you

573
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,354
- like five times.
- Imposter!

574
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:05,590
Yeah, and every time at the
end, you turn to me and you say,

575
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:08,092
"I have been and always
shall be your friend."

576
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:12,063
Haha! You, imposter!

577
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:13,798
What is going on here?

578
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,501
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

579
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:17,669
The tranq dart that Caitlin made

580
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:19,037
was supposed to last a lot longer.

581
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,306
I did not give him a tranq dart.

582
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,607
Okay, no, yes, not you,

583
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:26,277
the you from the time that I am from.

584
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,745
The time that you are from?

585
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,314
I think what he's trying to say

586
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,115
is he's from the future.

587
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:32,283
- The future?
- Yeah.

588
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:33,451
- The future?
- Yes.

589
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,720
- Wait, the future?
- Yes.

590
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,089
Are we saying I can time-travel?

591
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:40,725
One day.

592
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:43,661
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

593
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:44,896
Well, wait a second.

594
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:46,464
Suppose we now change your emblem.

595
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:49,133
Will it be because we
got the idea from this?

596
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:51,302
- Or, I mean, that would mean...
- Stop talking.

597
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:52,904
You stop talking too, all right?

598
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,939
More you say, the more
the timeline is disrupted.

599
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:56,607
Now I'm going to assume
that your presence here

600
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,443
is the reason that thing is attacking us.

601
00:31:58,445 --> 00:31:59,744
What? What thing?

602
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:01,479
Have you ever seen "The Frighteners"?

603
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,748
It's sort of like that,
but scarier and faster

604
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,350
and it's after you... after him.

605
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:07,885
Yeah, it's been chasing me
ever since I got here.

606
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,253
Okay, so how do we stop it?

607
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:11,089
We don't know.

608
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,791
- Then what are we gonna do?
- The one thing we can.

609
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,398
What? What are we doing here?

610
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,168
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation...

611
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,005
the reason that you traveled
back to this time,

612
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:31,109
and the key to running faster.

613
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,913
Tachyon enhancement.

614
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:38,616
This was not the deal.

615
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:41,185
If you think that I'm gonna hold your hand

616
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,254
this entire way, you're sadly mistaken.

617
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,423
Everything you need is on this drive.

618
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,692
You follow its instructions,
you will enhance

619
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:51,763
the Speed Force in your system
and run faster...

620
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:53,431
than you ever thought possible.

621
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,605
If this doesn't work, I'm coming back.

622
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,974
Dr. Wells, we need you.

623
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:08,479
Time to go home, Flash.

624
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:13,885
Okay, our satellite has finally found

625
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:15,720
our floating friend and it's coming back.

626
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:17,889
- You need to go.
- I need to know how to stop it.

627
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:20,358
- Barry...
- Not now. When I get back.

628
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,527
You guys have a year to figure it out.

629
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:25,797
Okay. We'll figure something out.

630
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,267
Cisco, come here.

631
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:31,736
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

632
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:32,770
Okay? What?

633
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:35,473
It's coming.

634
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,774
You need to leave now.

635
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:37,775
Yeah.

636
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:56,727
Thank you.

637
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,938
Barry, here it comes.

638
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,060
It's not working. It's slowing him down.

639
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,996
Not for long.

640
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,231
No! Barry!

641
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:01,192
Cool.

642
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:12,803
- It's coming!
- Did you even go?

643
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,906
- The Time Wraith.
- That's a good name.

644
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:16,107
Looks like that's a yes.

645
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:18,509
Did you figure out how to stop it?

646
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:24,882
Damn! We thought so!

647
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:32,857
Barry!

648
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,275
I suddenly realized.

649
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:53,511
Low frequency, high intensity.

650
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:55,079
I knew that.

651
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:57,748
Oh, hey, Barry. How was your trip?

652
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:08,311
So aside from the fact that
a Time Wraith came over here

653
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:11,496
and nearly killed us, how did it go?

654
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:12,664
It was interesting.

655
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,201
Good interesting or bad interesting?

656
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,269
'Cause that could go either way.

657
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,439
So far so... good.

658
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:22,509
How many times do we
have to tell you, Hartley?

659
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,445
Ever since Evil Wells
got erased from existence,

660
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,880
no one speaks Latin around here anymore.

661
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:29,149
Well, as always,
it's been a pleasure working

662
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:31,251
with you all on this little project.

663
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:33,587
If you need anything in the future, call me.

664
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:34,722
I'm off to a late dinner.

665
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:37,257
Mm, dinner. Anyone special?

666
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:39,693
Very. My parents.

667
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,632
So? You got me on pins
and needles over here.

668
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,000
What about the speed equation?

669
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,468
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

670
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,170
Well, let's see.

671
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,178
Hmm.

672
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,381
Maybe it's password protected?

673
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:04,284
Oh... are you kidding me?

674
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:07,054
After everything I just went through...

675
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,956
this doesn't even work!

676
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,001
We got it.

677
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,907
- Hey.
- Hey.

678
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,677
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

679
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,345
Although it turns out it's easier to find

680
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:34,782
a two-ton gorilla on this earth
than a teenage daughter.

681
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,720
I don't know what I've done.

682
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:41,955
You did what you thought you had to do.

683
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:43,390
You risked your life to save her.

684
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:46,160
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

685
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:49,129
You acted like a father.

686
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,665
"Like a father."

687
00:37:53,302 --> 00:37:55,035
You know, my wife had to...

688
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,371
she had to talk me into having kids.

689
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:02,342
Kids, you know, they're...
they're small, loud, run around.

690
00:38:02,344 --> 00:38:05,179
All I needed was my science and my job

691
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:08,015
for my joy and happiness.

692
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:13,587
And then...

693
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:16,990
the moment we had her...

694
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:20,994
all that I wanted was her love.

695
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:24,198
Now, I don't know
if I'll ever see that again.

696
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,701
It seems every decision
I've made lately has...

697
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:30,003
backfired on me.

698
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,905
You just have to trust that,
in the long run,

699
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,407
you made the right ones.

700
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:44,518
- Hey.
- Hey.

701
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,554
I put your plate from dinner in the fridge.

702
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:48,989
Thanks.

703
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:08,709
It's been almost a year already.

704
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,577
Can you believe that?

705
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:13,347
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

706
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:18,786
Question is, when will you?

707
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,861
I don't know, Barry.

708
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:30,998
Well, um, I found something

709
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,701
that I think might help.

710
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:38,272
I was putting together
this little video montage

711
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:43,443
for your birthday last year
with everybody, and...

712
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:44,711
everything happened.

713
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:48,315
Um, but, uh, take a look.

714
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:52,119
I think it might help.

715
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,021
Okay.

716
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,459
What does Iris mean to me?

717
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:02,496
Wow.

718
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:05,132
You know, a lot of times I have a hard time

719
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:06,900
figuring out what to say to people,

720
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:10,804
but when it comes to you, Iris, I don't.

721
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:15,175
Because with you, everything
that used to feel tough

722
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,244
just doesn't anymore.

723
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:20,447
It's one of the things I love about you.

724
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:22,216
You don't need me.

725
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:24,017
You can handle anything on your own

726
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:29,323
because you're fearless and independent...

727
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:32,192
loving, kind.

728
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:36,563
You are without question

729
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:40,367
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.

730
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,338
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me

731
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,009
because each day with you is a gift.

732
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,278
So, thank you.

733
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,779
You deserve the world, Iris.

734
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:54,848
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life,

735
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,686
and no one wants that more for you than me.

736
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:03,690
Happy birthday, baby. I love you.

737
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,095
I love you too.

738
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,502
Sometimes the only way to move forward

739
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:17,371
is to revisit the things in your past

740
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,406
that were holding you back.

741
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:22,209
You have to deal with them head on,

742
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,112
no matter how scary they may be.

743
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,980
Because once we do, you'll see

744
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:29,850
that you can go further
than you ever imagined.

745
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,958
I'm coming for you.
