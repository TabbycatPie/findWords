[Will Buxton] <i>Renault haven't fought for
a world championship for over a decade.</i>

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,020
But with Nico Hülkenberg at the team,

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,100
<i>they've come on in leaps and bounds
over recent years.</i>

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,896
[Cyril Abiteboul] <i>Nico has been part
of the construction</i>

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,200
<i>of the team three years.</i>

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,060
He decided to join the team
when we were P9.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,340
[Nico] Whoo!

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,900
We've been P4 last year all together,
so he's really been part of that journey.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,696
[engineer] <i>Absolutely brilliant, Nico.</i>

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,420
<i>That was beautifully judged there.</i>

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,580
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
[Nico] Thanks, mate.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,960
[Cyril] <i>Nico is an extremely
experienced driver,</i>

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,920
<i>but he has never achieved a podium.</i>

15

[Will] <i>And for the other
driver at Renault,</i>

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,680
<i>Cyril, this year,
has employed the services</i>

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,560
of a guy who not only knows
how to get onto a Formula 1 podium,

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,440
<i>but who knows how to bring home
a Formula 1 victory.</i>

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,680
<i>And that's Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

[Cyril] <i>Our ambition, our target,
is to be the best at everything,</i>

21

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,400
[Cyril] <i>So, with Nico and Daniel,</i>

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>that's a box ticked
in relation to driver lineup.</i>

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>I think we have a team
that is definitely building its profile</i>

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,000
<i>and finally starting to believe.</i>

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Showtime.

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,560

[Cyril] <i>Daniel joining the team</i>

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,060
certainly has contributed
to set the bar very high for this season.

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
We know we are racing,
but don't hesitate to have fun.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Absolutely.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
- Life is too short...
- Absolutely.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
...to calculate.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120

[Cyril] <i>Nico, this year is the last
year of the initial term of our agreement,</i>

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,840

and he's got expectations.

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,920
[Nico] <i>For now, for me, home
is Renault and I feel pretty happy there.</i>

46

<i>The love and the fire
is still burning, so...</i>

48

that I was going to go up alongside
with Nico...

<i>and I feel more than ever
he will be at his best.</i>

51

There's not... you know,
I don't think there's really any bullshit.

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040

<i>Danny's been given the same target.</i>

66
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,920
[Cyril] Nico has the pace to be just
as quick, if not quicker, than Daniel.

67
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,900
[Nico]
How was the last lap for Danny?

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,600

<i>Well, I hope they'll be allowed
to race here. Why not?</i>

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,160
[Nico] I have to get closer than this.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is the gap?

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,800
[engineer] <i>1.3 seconds to Danny.</i>

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,860
<i>Okay, Nico, been told
you need to hold position.</i>

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,760
Nico, we need to cool the car

78
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
and that means you need to open
a two-second gap to Danny.

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
<i>Nico.</i>

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>Nico.</i>

[Nico] That's bullshit!

82
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,940
So, just tell me not to race, mate.
It's fine.

[engineer] <i>You are not racing,
you've been told to hold position.</i>

84

[Nico] <i>I was asked
not to race Daniel, not to attack him,</i>

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,216
<i>which, obviously, as a driver,
is always frustrating</i>

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
<i>to get that radio call, you know,
from the team,</i>

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
<i>'cause we're here to race
and we want to fight</i>

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,560
<i>and we want to show
we're better than the other.</i>

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,680
The team is kind of under pressure
to secure a good result, you know,

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,560
and I just wanted to bring it
over the line, to bring it home,

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,840
which I see the point,
but I also see my frustration.

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,340
[engineer] <i>I know it's a bit frustrating,
but you did a fantastic job today, mate.</i>

<i>Absolutely excellent. Thank you very much.</i>

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,920
Um...

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,200
Yeah, I mean, we talked about it
at length after the race and...

103
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,020
It was just one of those things
that can happen, but, um...

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Yeah.

105
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,980
There's not much more to say,
to be honest.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,700
[indistinct chatter]

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,280
- All good?
- Yeah. Well done, mate. Congratulations.

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,280
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,976
- No worries.
- We're back in the race now.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
Yeah. It's good for the team.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,380
- [man] Hey, Danny.
- [Daniel] Hi.

112

114
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,080
- [in French] Thank you.
- Thank you.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,960
- [man in English] Daniel, you all right?
- Cheers, man.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
There is one thing that's very strong
in our team, loyalty.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,620
Loyalty towards people and
loyalty towards Nico is extremely high.

118
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,860
<i>So, I wouldn't say that
he's suddenly been</i>

119
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,120
relinquished to a secondary role.

120
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,480
He's still the Nico of before.

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,860
[aeroplane engine starting]

122
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
[Nico] When are we getting
the Renault F1 team jet?

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,840
- [Cyril] When you do your first podium.
- [laughs]

124
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,860
[Nico] Ask him about his drivers,
what he thinks, if he's happy with them...

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
so far.

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,880
He doesn't dare to ask me directly.

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,420
So, you are acting
as a shrink for our couple.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
We are not sure where we are going.

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,560
Is it a long-term thing?

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,880
Are you ready for this?
Are we ready for this?

131
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,960
[chuckles]

132
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,040
Oh, look, the sea.

133
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,820
[Cyril] And something I want
to do differently in future is...

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,720
We had to tell the two guys
at the end of the race

135
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,200
not to race each other,

136
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,160
but we are now in a position
where I think that we can let them race.

137
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,280
Not sure about this weekend.

138
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,040
We'll see how we are
in terms of competitiveness.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,720
- Uh...
- [Nico] Yes or no?

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,280
Yes or no, but we'll know
just before the race.

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,780
We still have three days to go.

142
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,920
[interviewer] Is that all right for you?

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,400
- I'm not gonna answer that question.
- Aw!

Uh, Nico, and how's your French?

151
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,840
Yeah. Just as good as Daniel's.

152
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,160
Sounds it.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,100

your main competitor
is always your teammate.

[Alain] <i>Talking only about the drivers,
for sure, we have to be careful</i>

162

<i>that we do not have a number one
and a number two.</i>

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,060
<i>That does not exist
and we don't want to have that.</i>

164
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,460
[Daniel] What's your dream, Cyril?

165
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,160
[crowd] Ah!

166
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
[in French] That's easy... Easy.

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,640
To win with these two boys.

171

Daniel, how do you feel
being the funniest driver on the grid?

172
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,260
Thank you. I'm very funny. I agree.

173
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,760
Uh, also very good-looking.

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,860
I worked on that for a long time.

175
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,060
Uh, but without surgery. Just with age.

176
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,456

- Beautiful.

178

- [Cyril] The nose.
- Yeah!

179
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,160

could do with some work.

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,560
Well, no, you know,
frankly, the situation is clear.

334
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,480
We have a two-year contract with Daniel.
Uh...

335
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,660
Nico's contract initial term is coming
to an end at the end of this year,

336
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,340
but we need to look at the options,
like everyone is doing.

337
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,320
[reporter] And to follow up on that,

338
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,716
is there any chance
you wanna have another look

339
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,820
- at having Esteban Ocon in the team?
- [chuckles]

340
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,480
[upbeat music playing]

341
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,900
This year,
I'm the reserve driver for Mercedes.

342
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,380
[host] Esteban Ocon!

343
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,680
Toto Wolff from Mercedes!

344
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,680
[crowd cheering]

345
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,760
[Esteban] <i>Toto is the team principal,
but he is also managing me.</i>

346
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,640
Esteban, when will you
drive a Formula 1 car?

347
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Definitely, there are a lot of talks
at the moment, so...

348
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,800
Everything is following its path

349
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,360
and hopefully, you know,
we will find a way

350
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,640
<i>and I will be back in a race car
very soon.</i>

351
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,140
[commentator] <i>Now, here comes Esteban Ocon
in the Force India.</i>

352
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,400
[Esteban]<i> 2018, of course,
was not a great end of the season. Um...</i>

353
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,240
[commentator] <i>Perez gets past Ocon</i>

354
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,000
<i>as they now accelerate
towards the fastest part of the circuit.</i>

355
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,160
<i>And the two Force Indias made contact!</i>

356
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,720
[commentator] <i>Once again,
they have touched.</i>

357
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,000
[Esteban] Guys, what the fuck?

358
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,840
<i>Unfortunately, I lost the seat for 2019.</i>

359
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm so hungry to get back

360
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,080
because it's been so long
since I have been on the grid.

361
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,440
For us, it is always
about setting the right objectives.

362
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,420
And last year, we were promised a contract
for Esteban with Renault.

363
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>And then suddenly, Daniel Ricciardo
made himself available.</i>

364
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,200
<i>So, it didn't happen.</i>

365
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,540
[Esteban] <i>When you're out...
you can be out forever.</i>

366
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,841
- [man] Silly season.
- I didn't hear your silly question.

367
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,980
- Can you repeat it?
- [man] Yeah. [chuckles]

368
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,760
What's silly season?

369
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,100
I don't know. [scoffs]

370
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,600
You define silly season.

371
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,840
What is silly season?

372
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,520
[man] I don't know.
I'm not from this world.

373
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,600
No? Me neither.

374
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,460
- I just...
- [both chuckling]

375
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,680
It's when everyone mingles.

376
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
You know, it's that game

377
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,120
when everyone's standing up,
walking around the chairs

378
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,800
and as long as the music's up,
you're walking,

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,936
and then when the music stops,

380
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,760
you need to sit down as fast as possible
and take a seat.

381
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,560
That's the game we're playing right now.

382
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,060
- [man] Is it happening now?
- It's happening right now.

383
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
[Toto in French] <i>Hi, Cyril.</i>

384
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
<i>What are you doing this evening?</i>

385
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,360
[in English] Oh, okay.

386
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,500
[in French] <i>When are you leaving?</i>

387
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,320
<i>What about dinner?</i>

388
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,880
<i>Yes, that's a good idea.</i>

389
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,840
<i>Listen, I've got the cameras on me,
by the way, right now.</i>

390
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,120
<i>You know I've got Esteban in the car
with me.</i>

391
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,220
<i>But don't worry,
he doesn't know what we're talking about.</i>

392
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,320
<i>Esteban, do you want
to ask Cyril anything?</i>

393
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,160
<i>You know what I want to ask him.</i>

394
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,960
<i>He says,
"You know what I want to say to him."</i>

395
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,740
<i>Okay. Let's talk later. Bye.</i>

396
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,316
[man in English]
There's loads of rumors, always,

397
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,600
isn't there? I mean, I heard...

398
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
- I love rumors.
- [man] Yeah!

399
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,800
I mean,
I heard Ocon replacing you at Renault.

400
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
Those things.
What do you think about all those rumors?

401
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Just part of the game, part of F1,
during that silly season, somehow.

402
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,240
[man] But what's your prediction?
What do you think will happen with you?

403
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,480
No prediction for now.

404
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
This weekend, let's perform.

405
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,296
As always, the most important thing
is you need to perform.

406
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,480
Then you're attractive and sexy.

407
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,300
You're really breaking my balls here, man.

408
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,520
- [man] I know. I know.
- Fucking hell.

409
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,640
- [man] Haven't even had breakfast yet.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,800
You can be lucky.

411
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,096
I had my first coffee,
otherwise you'd be right out the window.

412
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,840
[both laugh]

413
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,600
[commentator] <i>A very wet day
here in Hockenheim.</i>

414
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,496
[commentator] <i>If there is one driver
who can take advantage</i>

415
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,616
<i>of the poor conditions today,</i>

416
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,560
<i>gotta say, Nico Hülkenberg.
It's his home race.</i>

417
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,960
It's good because we followed your advice,
to stay out or something like that.

418
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,680
- When?
- Last year, here.

419
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,980
Yeah, but it was only a few drops.

420
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,040
[commentator] <i>So, we've had huge rain
overnight and this morning as well.</i>

421
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,300
<i>Light rain for the next half an hour
to an hour is the message.</i>

422
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,860
<i>Anything could happen
here in the rain today.</i>

423
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,320
[Nico] <i>To take the podium</i>

424
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,160
<i>is what I've been dreaming about
and worked towards</i>

425
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,520
<i>since I'm eight years old.</i>

426
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,280
<i>I think I have what it takes
to put a car...</i>

427
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,100
You know, onto the podium.

428
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,640
<i>Just need to be ready, um, focused.</i>

429
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Perfect.

430
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,600
Nico, this year, is the last year
of the initial term of our agreement.

431
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,640
<i>But there is also an option in place</i>

432
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,520
<i>so that we can continue
our journey together.</i>

433
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,280
And that's why I know that, uh,

434
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,680
in everything that's happening
on track and off track,

435
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,400
he's got that in the back of his mind.

436
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,600
[Nico] <i>If I get onto the podium,</i>

437
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,660
there's options to continue with Renault.

438
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,120
<i>I know what I have to do.</i>

439
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

440
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,840
[commentator] <i>And it's lights out
and away we go. It's a tentative start.</i>

441
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,640
<i>No grip whatsoever.</i>

442
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,340
<i>Hülkenberg's down in eighth place.</i>

443
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,140
<i>Down the inside goes the Renault
of Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean</i>

444
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>and Hülkenberg and Grosjean touch.</i>

445
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,320
[Nico] I had contact with the Haas.

446
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,280
But I think the front is okay.

447
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
[engineer] Copy, Nico.

448
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,000
[commentator]<i> Oh! Off the road, there.</i>

449
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,280
<i>The McLaren is off
and Carlos Sainz has gone off the track.</i>

450
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,680
[Nico] <i>The track was wetter.</i>

451
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
You know,
those races always tend to be crazy

452
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,800
and very eventful.

453
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,980
[commentator] <i>Charles Leclerc's
going for it down</i>

454
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,460
<i>on the inside into turn one.</i>

455
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,460
<i>Magnussen cutting behind him.
Leclerc's gone a bit wide, but he's ahead.</i>

456
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,400
[engineer] <i>Nico, if you've got any pace
in hand, we need to use it now.</i>

457
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,696
[commentator] <i>And now the Renault of Nico
Hülkenberg says, "Thank you very much,</i>

458
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>Charles Leclerc,
you've just earned me a place, there."</i>

459
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,780
[engineer] Nice work, Nico.

460
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
You are now P7.

461
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
[engineer] <i>Okay, Daniel.</i>

462
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,320
<i>How's the track? How's the track?</i>

463
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
[Daniel] Struggling still.
Locking the left front.

464
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,540
[engineer] Okay, understood.

465
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,240
[engineer] <i>So, gap to Raikkonen unchanged.</i>

466
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,840
<i>Okay, Nico, overtake is available.</i>

467
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
<i>Nice work, Nico.</i>

468
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,640
So, you are P5, mate.
Great job so far.

469
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,616
[commentator] <i>That is Daniel Ricciardo</i>

470
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,460
<i>and that looks like
a massive engine problem.</i>

471
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,760
[Daniel] I have a lot of smoke
coming out.

472
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
[engineer] <i>Yeah, we may have
an exhaust leak.</i>

473
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
<i>Stop the car, please, stop the car.</i>

474
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,700
[Daniel] Yeah, it's shut off.

475
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,520
[commentator] <i>And not much really to say
about that for Renault.</i>

476
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,520
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico,
so you are P4 now, P4.</i>

477
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,116
[Nico] <i>Yeah, I was performing very well.
I had a really strong pace.</i>

478
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,380
I was well up in the field.

479
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,716
[engineer] <i>The rain
is getting a bit heavier, Nico.</i>

480
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,440
<i>If you're happy to stay on these tires,
then that's good for us.</i>

481
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,500
[Nico] Yeah, I think you're right.

482
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,680
[Cyril]<i> The team at that moment,
making all the right decisions,</i>

483
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,020
<i>perfectly in sync between the elements,</i>

484
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,420
the weather, the track conditions,
the driver, pit wall.

485
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,160
[commentator] <i>Bottas is into the pit.</i>

486
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,200
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico,
you are currently P2.</i>

487
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,060
<i>Bottas had to stop for tires.
He's behind us now.</i>

488
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,940
[Cyril]<i> I started to realize
Nico is on track for the podium.</i>

489
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,200
This is the time.

490
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,620
[commentator] <i>Nico Hülkenberg, in his home
Grand Prix, running in second place.</i>

491
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,160
[commentator] <i>Still just in that
tantalizingly close podium position</i>

492
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,560
<i>he's never been able to achieve.</i>

493
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,016
[commentator] <i>I so want Nico Hülkenberg
to finish on the podium.</i>

494

<i>He deserves a podium finish.</i>

495
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,200
<i>Maybe, just maybe.</i>

496
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
[Nico] <i>To take the podium</i>

497
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
<i>is what I've been dreaming about
and working towards</i>

498
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,700
<i>since I'm eight years old.</i>

499
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,280
[engineer] <i>Okay, let's stay focused.
Great job so far.</i>

500
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,160
<i>So, you got Verstappen,
who is the race leader, in front of you.</i>

501
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
Watch out for possible oil on the track.

502
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,880
[Nico] I'm a bit cautious with turn ten.
It's very dangerous here.

503
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,520
[engineer] <i>Copy that, Nico.</i>

504
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
[commentator] <i>It's Verstappen losing it!</i>

505
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,840
[man] Oh!

506
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
[Nico] Verstappen spun in front of me.

507
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,960
[engineer]<i> So, Verstappen has lost
four seconds to you.</i>

508
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,520
[Nico] Okay then, I think it's time to go.

509
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,520
[engineer] <i>Car looks good to us, Nico.</i>

510
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,140
<i>You're doing an excellent job,
there, Nico.</i>

511
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,760
[commentator] <i>Look! There is the Renault
of Nico Hülkenberg in the barriers.</i>

512
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,440
<i>And he's ending his home Grand Prix.</i>

513
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,880
[Cyril] <i>Uh... and that was it.</i>

514
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,760
Any chance of maybe of a podium,
gone in one blink of a second.

515
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,680
[Nico] <i>I put my wheels, you know,
across that curb,</i>

516
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,860
<i>and as soon as I went
onto that black tarmac,</i>

517
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,240
I knew that I was fucked.

518
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,320
<i>You know, and that moment was...</i>

519
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,260
Yeah, it was very detrimental. Uh...

520
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
<i>Yeah. I don't know how to describe it,
but it was... It was super difficult.</i>

521
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,860
That's something that was in his control.
He was driving the car.

522
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,520
<i>So, you can't blame the elements,</i>

523
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,480
<i>you can't blame another driver,
you can't blame the car.</i>

524
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,380
[man] Shame.

525
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
[man] Next time.

526
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
The one that got away.

527
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,680
[Cyril] Sometimes,
I wish it would go away.

528
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,976
- Sorry?
- [Cyril] Sometimes, it could go away.

529
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,080
Yeah.

530
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,280
I know, it's always bad luck.

531
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,880
And the fact that podium, once again,
became unavailable to him,

532
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,900
I started to think
that maybe there is a curse...

533
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,160
<i>or something between him
and that top-three finish.</i>

534
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,480
For the 2020 season,
we decided not to renew Nico's contract

535
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,500
and give the seat to Esteban Ocon.

536
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,440
Cyril, once you'd decided on Daniel,

537
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,600
were you always thinking
you'd come back for Esteban

538
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
at the end of this year?

539
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,496
- Can I say something before we start?
- [reporter] Yes, of course.

540
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,680
I'm really happy to have Cyril here.

541
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,360
- Um...
- [all chuckle]

542
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Not me?

543
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,580
No, you, I had all the time.

544
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,600
Very difficult to make your way
into the top three,

545
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,080
but that's obviously
what we are striving to do,

546
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,580
and I do believe that Esteban can help us
in doing that.

547
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,520
<i>- Merci.</i>
- [man] Thank you.

548
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
<i>Merci.</i>

549
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,080
I've always been looking up
to Formula 1 and aspiring to it,

550
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,900
then I've done it for ten years,
and now it's a solid stop.

551
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,560
<i>It will be quite a shock
to the system, obviously.</i>

552
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,540
<i>So, yeah, it's gonna be interesting
to see how I cope with that.</i>

553
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,880
[Claire Williams] This is all we did
at home when we were growing up.

554
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,956
[George Russell] <i>I feel like
we're amateurs.</i>

555
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,476
<i>We need to seriously pull our fingers out.</i>

556
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,760
[Will]<i> Paddy Lowe was supposed to
have designed a great car and he didn't.</i>

557
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,620
See you later, Paddy.

558
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,140
This is my place.
Obviously, got an amazing view.

559
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,140
Coming back in Toro Rosso,
I didn't feel like that was really fair.

560
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,940
[crowd cheering]

561
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,680
I've fully deserved the seat.

562
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,560
- [man yells]
- [all screaming]

563
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
[man] Fuck off!

564
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
[dramatic music playing]
