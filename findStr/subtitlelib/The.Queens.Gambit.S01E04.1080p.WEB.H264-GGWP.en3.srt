1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,416
I love…

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,625
he loves…

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,833
you love…

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,666
we love…

5
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
This is Juan Alberto Díaz

6
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,250
coming to you live from the Mexico City
Invitational Chess Tournament

7
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,666
at the Palacio Azteca where

8
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,750
the big story has been
the seventeen-year-old

9
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,708
from Lexington, Kentucky…

10
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:23,500
So far undefeated, this morning
she played the Queen's Gambit Declined

11
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,958
against the Austrian, Diedrich.

12
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,125
Facing relentless pressure
in the middle of the board,

13
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,291
Harmon had him
on his heels from the start.

14
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,916
She did it mostly with pawns,

15
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,875
and crushed his position
as one might crush an egg.

16
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,416
Diedrich played well,

17
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,166
made no blunders or anything
that could properly be called a mistake,

18
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,958
but Harmon moved with such deadly accuracy,
such measured control,

19
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,666
that his position was hopeless

20
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,000
by the 23rd move.

21
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,333
Impressive play by this young woman.

22
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,333
Borgov retreats his knight,

23
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,375
but he's really attacking
the black knight.

24
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,958
This is a very interesting position.

25
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,291
It is dangerous for both sides.

26
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,750
How is Black going to answer the threat?

27
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,666
Will he defend himself or counter attack?

28
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,750
It could go either way.

29
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,166
In Moscow, she'll be jet-lagged.

30
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,041
We can destroy her then.

31
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,666
She's getting better.

32
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,083
Have to deal with her here or in Paris

33
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,125
before she gets too strong.

34
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,041
There's talk she's a drunk.

35
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,458
Her game is almost all attack,

36
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,000
so she doesn't always watch her back.

37
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,416
When she blunders, she gets angry,

38
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,458
and can be dangerous.

39
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,583
Like all women…

40
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:15,958
She's an orphan.

41
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,666
A survivor.

42
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,500
She's like us--
losing is not an option for her.

43
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:25,458
Otherwise, what would her life be?

44
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,958
Pawn to king four.

45
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,625
She always plays
the Sicilian to that opening.

46
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,500
It's the most common opening
for White in the game of chess,

47
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:09,916
and Borgov has been called
the "Master of the Sicilian."

48
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,250
Harmon moves pawn to queen bishop four,

49
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:18,458
hoping to play him on ground
that's fresh for both of them,

50
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:22,291
that won't give him
the advantage of his superior knowledge.

51
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:30,416
And now Borgov has brought out
his king's knight to bishop three,

52
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,416
and Harmon,

53
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,916
of course,
brings hers to queen bishop three,

54
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,708
attacking the center.

55
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:44,208
But Borgov moves his bishop
to knight five

56
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,208
signaling he's going to play
the Closed Sicilian,

57
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,583
not the Open.

58
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:56,833
The Rossolimo.

59
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,666
A rare opening.

60
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,500
Harmon pushes her pawn to rook three,

61
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,625
attacking Borgov's bishop.

62
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,125
Borgov castles.

63
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,083
Harmon must now decide

64
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,541
to open the game or keep it closed.
