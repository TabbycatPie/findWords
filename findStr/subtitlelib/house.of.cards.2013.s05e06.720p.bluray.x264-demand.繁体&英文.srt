在羅德島搞出個僵局好讓他博得關注

116
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,770
武裝人員實施了登陸占領

117
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,660
你認為這些士兵是俄軍嗎
You think the soldiers are Russian?

118
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,560
他這么認為
He thinks so.

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,560
他們乘坐的是無標記的科考船
They arrived via unmarked research vessels.

120
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,690
我們聯系了莫斯科
We reached out to Moscow,

121
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,180
但他們否認與此事有任何官方聯系
but they're denying any official involvement.

122
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,330
想不到啊
Surprise, surprise.

123
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,020
這就是悍然入侵
It's a brazen act of aggression.

124
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,200
他這是心存僥幸

128
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,050
我是說  由不明力量發起的
What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica,

129
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,240
對南極洲的入侵
by powers unknown,

130
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,910
正是總統之位一事
is a direct result of the uncertainty

131
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,950
遲遲不得以解決造成的直接惡果
that our presidential situation has wrought.

132
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,250
沃茨眾議員  國會黑人黨團什么時候
Congressman Watts, since when is Antarctica a concern

133
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,300
開始這么關心南極洲的事了
for the Congressional Black Caucus?

134
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,410
我希望你不是在暗示
I hope you're not implying that the caucus

135
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,940
黑人黨團無權就國際事務發表意見
shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.

136
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,520
我希望你不是這個意思  謝謝你  蘭迪
I hope that's not what I'm hearing. Thank you, Randy.

137
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,800
我將于明天
I've called a meeting tomorrow,

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,220
召集國會黑人黨團開會  在周一總統投票前
for the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss our positions,

139
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,920
討論本黨團在國內外各項議題上的立場
both foreign and domestic, before Monday's presidential vote.

140
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,360
您是在考慮轉而支持康威嗎
Are you considering shifting your support to Conway?

141
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,970
我現在只能說
Well, all I can say at this time,

142
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,150
最重要的是團結
that the most important thing is unity...

143
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,480
以及民眾對民主制度的信心
and the public's faith in the institution of democracy.

144
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,400
就這樣
That's all for now.

145
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,050
你違反了《南極條約體系》
You are in violation of the Antarctic Treaty System.

146
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,320
那是蘇聯1959年簽訂的條約
A treaty the USSR signed in 1959.

147
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,590
我們已經是個新國家了
We're a new country.

148
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,790
所以你承認了那是你的軍隊
So you're admitting they are your troops.

149
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,570
我只是說我需要
I'm simply stating I need to

150
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,330
解釋一下由蘇聯簽訂的協議
interpret agreements signed by the Soviet Union.

151
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,930
那么
In which case,

152
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,860
你就是否定了幾十年來的裁軍進程
you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.

153
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,040
冷戰已經結束了  代總統女士
The Cold War is over, Mrs. Acting President.

154
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,730
那我們也許需要重新修訂條約
Well, then maybe we need to revisit the treaty.

155
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,730
我對那不感興趣
I'm not interested in revisiting a treaty.

156
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,010
我只關心繼續執政
I'm interested in staying in power.

157
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,490
克萊爾
And, Claire...

158
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,440
如果我能這樣稱呼你的話
if I could be so familiar.

159
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,250
在我的國家
In my country...

160
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,730
一旦你上了臺  就不會放權
once you're in office, you don't let go.

161
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,990
-維克多  -總統先生
- Viktor. - Mr. President.

162
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,190
你們美國人現在的總統可真不少
You Americans certainly have a lot of presidents these days.

163
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,990
是啊  你可能覺得我們無暇他顧
Yes, you may think that we're distracted,

164
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,740
別騙自己了
but don't fool yourself.

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,030
無暇他顧  不不不
Distracted? No. No, no.

166
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,350
分裂才對
Divided, yes.

167
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,130
美國的民主制度可比你
American democracy is stronger than your

168
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,310
利用這種小麻煩的可悲企圖強大
sad attempt to take advantage of a bump in the road.

169
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,520
弗蘭西斯  我的關注范圍
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape

170
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,770
可遠大于你們任何人的前途
that is so much bigger than any one of your roads.

171
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,590
拉斯姆森議員
Well, Congressman Rasmussen,

172
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,260
我們只是驚訝你會
we're just surprised to see you come out

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,540
站錯邊  就這樣
on the wrong end of this, is all.

174
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,700
我知道那么多年前
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard

175
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,470
丟掉了眾議院多數黨領袖的位子
losing the House majority leadership

176
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,140
一定很不好受
all those years ago,

177
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,500
但心懷怨憤
but there is a difference

178
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,310
和背叛之間還是有區別的
between being bitter and being treasonous.

179
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,710
如果你是想要新的委員會席位
If it's new committee assignments you'd like,

180
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,310
我們完全可以安排
we can certainly arrange that.

181
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,560
已經結束了
It's over.

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,340
市場一落千丈
Markets are in free fall.

183
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,060
消費者信心到了歷史最低點
Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.

184
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
這是什么  裝飾品  小玩意
What is this? A doodad? A doohickey?

185
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,350
還是什么沒用的獎品
A... pointless award?

186
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,020
我有說過我討厭沒用的東西嗎
Did I mention I hate useless things?

187
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,700
這個國家已經在崩潰了
This nation is coming apart at the seams.

188
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,640
是因為你  因為你對這個國家做的事
Because of you, because of what you've done to this country.

189
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,370
看吧
There it is.

190
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,810
正義人士總喜歡感慨他們自己中層管理者的角色
How the righteous love to bemoan their role in middle management,

191
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,600
而譴責那些真能影響世界的人
and condemn those who actually might have an effect on the world.

192
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,060
-考慮考慮黨派利益  議員  -我考慮了
- Think of the party, Congressman. - I am.

193
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,300
你覺得你來這兒能怎么樣  弗蘭西斯
What did you think would happen when you came in here, Francis?

194
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,050
你能威脅我
That you could threaten me,

195
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,620
告訴我不合作的話  全國委員會下一輪選舉
tell me the DNC'll throw money at my primary opponent next cycle

196
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,010
就把錢投給我的勁敵
if I don't play ball?

197
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,160
還是說你打算奉承我
Or were you gonna flatter me?

198
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,680
一會兒說我是"黨內長老"
"Elder of the party" this,

199
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,490
一會兒說我是"資深成員領頭羊"
"bellwether senior member" that.

200
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,010
我真有點高興
You know, I'm somewhat delighted

201
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,150
你到了這把年紀還能發展出點個性
that you developed a personality at this late date.

202
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,240
但我希望你再想想
But I would ask you to rethink this.

203
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
在你職業生涯的晚期鬧這樣的事情
To come out this way on this thing in the twilight of your career

204
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,140
只會給你的維基百科添一筆污點
will do nothing but sully your Wikipedia page.

205
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,560
你根本不明白  是吧
You have no idea, do you?

206
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,230
你在這里沒有分量了
No one hears you walking the halls of this building...

207
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,280
現在沒有了
not anymore.

208
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,890
-你在幫誰做事  -什么
- Who are you working for? - Excuse me?

209
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,460
我跟你這個軟骨頭共事了二十年
I served next to your jellied spine for two decades.

210
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,910
你從沒表現出過一點勇氣
You've never shown an ounce of courage.

211
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,550
你沒有復仇的本事
You don't have what it takes for revenge.

212
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,870
所以肯定有人給了你不少好處
So someone must have offered you something rather sweet.

213
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,550
好好重新考慮兩小時吧
Take all of the two hours you need to reconsider.

214
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,880
還有一份需要您簽字
One more thing for your signature.

215
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,610
-放在這里就可以了  -好的
- You can leave this with me. - Of course.

216
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,980
-哈維女士在等您  -請讓她進來
- And Miss Harvey's waiting. - Oh, please send her in.

217
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,420
我正要回雷伯恩大樓
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.

218
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,210
請關上門
You close the door, please?

219
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,900
重新投票我們獲勝的可能性有多大
What are our chances with a revote?

220
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,470
或者說  總統獲勝的可能性有多大
Or, rather, what are the president's chances?

221
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
我想知道
I want to know.

222
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,790
就全部50個州而言  情況不太好
If it was in all 50 states, not good.

223
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,680
他的反對率還是很高  而你依然低
His unfavorables are still high. Yours are still not.

224
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,060
但他有近30年的經驗  所以也不好說
But it's hard to argue with close to 30 years' experience.

225
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,330
也許總統是對的
Maybe the president is right.

226
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,350
或許他確實在眾議院那里把握更大
Maybe he does have a better chance in the House.

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,670
別繞彎子  莉安  告訴我你怎么想的
Don't defer, LeAnn. Tell me what you think.

228
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,570
田納西和俄亥俄的重投是他的最佳機會
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.

229
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,380
這對弗蘭克來說是最佳
While it's what's best for Frank,

230
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,500
可未必對你來說最佳
it may not be what's best for you.

231
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,100
謝謝你
Thank you.

232
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,430
你似乎是個通情達理的人
You seem like a reasonable man.

233
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
我懂得傾聽  你是指這個嗎
I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.

234
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,390
如果總統重獲職位
If the president regains his office--

235
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,390
一開口就是如果怎么行  艾力克斯
"If" doesn't make for a winning opener, Alex.

236
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,840
我來這里是因為我覺得他能贏
I'm here because I think he can win.

237
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,960
我和他之間經常會有分歧
We often don't see eye to eye, he and I.

238
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,790
但我們還是可以共事的
And yet, there are ways we can work together.

239
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,770
好吧  委員會那里可能是我錯了
Okay, maybe I made a mistake with the committee.

240
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,300
我有時候會有些自以為是
I can be self-righteous.

241
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,220
我是想清理黨派  我們的黨派
I'm trying to clean up the party. Our party.

242
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,120
結果我說錯話了
And I end up speaking out of turn.

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,910
少來"不怪你是我的錯"這一套了
It's enough with the, "It's me, not you."

244
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,020
你到底能做什么  艾力克斯
What can you deliver, Alex?

245
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,310
我可以不礙事
I can get out of the way.

246
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,470
這話太含糊  而且不夠
Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.

247
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,700
我想知道泰瑞·烏麥克和黑人黨團是怎么回事
I want to know what's up with Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.

248
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,070
總統和烏麥克議員
The president and Congressman Womack,

249
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,210
他們關系很好
they have a good relationship.

250
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,890
當然了  但我可不想看到泰瑞讓你們失望
I'm sure they do. But I would hate to see Terry let you down.

251
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,600
如果失去了烏麥克和黑人黨團  我們周一就完了
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus, we're done on Monday.

252
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,980
有幾個新人我可以搭上關系
There are a few freshmen I could reach out to.

253
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,210
他們或許能讓黑人黨團同心
They might help keep the CBC together.

254
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,110
你想當少數黨黨鞭
You wanna be minority whip.

255
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,630
如果我夠格
Only if I deserve to be.

256
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,280
我準備回去了
I'm trying to get back.

257
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,850
劉易斯議員又遲到了二十分鐘
Congressman Lewis is 20 minutes late as usual.

258
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,810
能讓他進金融服務委員會嗎
Is there a spot for him on financial services?

259
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,000
道格  待著別動
Doug, stay where you are.

260
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,050
你不是說你讓中情局別插手了嗎
I thought you said you were telling the CIA to stand down.

261
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,880
是啊
I did.

262
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,450
你保證過麥卡倫會老實的
So, contrary to your assurances that Macallan would behave,

263
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,580
現在卻出現消息泄露
we're now dealing with a leak.

264
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,380
-他不想惹麻煩  -你怎么知道他想要什么
- He doesn't want trouble. - How do you know what he wants?

265
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,550
你去找到他  帶過來
You find him and you get him here.

266
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,990
只要他知道我們讓步了
As soon as he knows we've backed off,

267
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,300
他就會消失的  我保證
he will disappear. I promise.

268
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,790
不  你的保證對我毫無意義
No, that word means nothing to me.

269
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,870
你寫好聲明了嗎
You have a statement?

270
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,540
還會不會有其他重大的
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks info dumps

271
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,820
維基解密事件
coming down the pike?

272
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,510
-你會知道的  -等我需要知道的時候
- You'll know-- - When I need to know.

273
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,110
我知道
I know.

274
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,470
也就是上了CNN的時候吧
Which is apparently whenever it hits CNN.

275
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,860
聯調局之前高度戒備  他們調查每個威脅
FBI was on high alert. They investigated every threat.

276
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,880
冷靜
Calm down.

277
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,230
我很冷靜  道格  民眾不冷靜
I am calm, Doug. The public's not calm.

278
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,820
每次失足都被強調  放大
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.

279
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,660
他們想知道選舉到底怎么回事
They wanna know what happened with their election.

280
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,840
我們正在解決
We're fixing it.

281
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,900
他們怕的就是這個
That's what they're afraid of.

282
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,900
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}雙關"選舉操縱"

283
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,940
聲明是關于聯調局的  大家都信任聯調局
The statement's about the FBI. Everybody trusts the FBI.

284
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,030
麗薩·威廉姆斯是誰
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?

285
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,130
我不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

286
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
《先驅報》有人打電話來
Somebody from the Herald called.

287
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,610
問你認不認識她
They were just wondering if you knew her.

288
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,570
不認識
I don't.

289
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,310
我需要五分鐘審閱
I need five minutes with this.

290
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,200
-給你關門嗎  -關
- Open or closed? - Closed.

291
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,360
我那份聲明怎么樣
Am I good with that statement?

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,240
我做好標記了  在我桌子上
I marked it up. It's on my desk.

293
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,590
把選舉交回給各州
Throwing the election back to the states,

294
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,120
讓我們的把握變小了
it gives us less certainty.

295
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,630
我覺得周一之前我們沒法辦妥
I don't think we can get it done by Monday.

296
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
我們都已經忙了幾周了  弗蘭西斯
We've been working at it for weeks, Francis.

297
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,810
克萊爾  別因為當職而變得小心翼翼
Claire, don't let the office make you careful.

298
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,610
國會從來沒讓我失望過
The halls of Congress have never failed me.

299
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,020
是  但那些職業政客
Yes, but the career politicians,

300
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,130
他們從沒這么步調一致過
they are more entrenched than ever.

301
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,250
現在有了新眾議院  里面的人你不認識
There's a new House, with members you don't know.

302
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
我們得把重點
We need to move the playing field

303
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,600
放回到人民的期望上
back to the imaginations of the people.

304
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
你這么相信田納西和俄亥俄的選民嗎
You have that much faith in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?

305
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,600
他們會選你的  我確定
They're going to choose you. I just know it.

306
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,580
好吧
All right.

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,110
安排會議  我會聽他們說的  你贏了
Set up a meeting. I'll hear them all out. You win.

308
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,500
是我們  是我們贏了
Both of us. Both of us.

309
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,750
晚上好
Good evening.

310
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,090
艾瑞克
Eric.

311
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,950
就像是在外面吧
Feel like you're outside?

312
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,250
你不是應該限制在三十分鐘之內嗎
Aren't you supposed to limit it to 30 minutes?

313
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
-天啊  可別  -把健身調整好就不必
- Oh, God, Jesus, no. - Not if you calibrate the workout.

314
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,090
我沒事
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

315
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,120
你要聽從你的身體
It's all about listening to your body.

316
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,900
它會告訴你什么時候該休息
It'll tell you when it's time to rest.

317
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,030
你有時也該聽醫生的  弗蘭西斯
You should listen to the doctors some of the time, Francis.

318
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,760
我確定安德伍德夫婦很擔心
I know the Underwoods were worried.

319
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,390
因為他們愿意做交易
Because they were ready to deal.

320
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,560
跟我做交易
To deal with me.

321
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,190
-你能肯定嗎  -非常肯定
- You're sure it's for real? - Sure as I can be.

322
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,040
好  再聯系
Okay, we'll be in touch.

323
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,320
好
Okay.

324
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,010
給他打回去
So call him back.

325
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,010
成功讓幾個民主黨人改主意了
Making progress on a couple of Dems.

326
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,120
阿爾斯波議員也要回心轉意了
Think Congressman Alspaugh is about to turn.

327
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,610
我們周日見他
We'll see him on Sunday.

328
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,300
為什么要等
Why wait?

329
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,890
我們明天得和國會黑人黨團見面
We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.

330
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,820
他們是安德伍德的
They're in Underwood's pocket.

331
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,190
是啊  能讓我們說句話嗎  各位
Yeah. Can you give us a second, everybody?

332
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,650
好的
Uh, sure.

333
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,500
走吧
Come on.

334
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,010
謝謝
Thank you.

335
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,600
我剛得到內部消息
I just got word from somebody inside.

336
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,390
烏麥克在失去對黨團的控制
Womack is losing control of the caucus.

337
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,980
要是你能拿下他們  周一就贏了
If you win them, you win Monday.

338
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,380
我們應該試試
We should try.

339
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,860
好吧  我們試試吧
All right, fine. Let's do it.

340
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,220
-我去安排  -今晚結束了嗎
- I'll set it up. - Are we done here tonight?

341
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,750
你還得打幾個電話
You still have a few calls.

342
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,130
馬克  我在想我們是不是能
Mark, I was thinking, maybe we could, um...

343
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,910
取消明晚在費城的活動
cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.

344
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,130
一趟出行和活動都不能取消  不應該取消
We can't cancel any trip, or any event. We shouldn't.

345
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,370
讓我們稍稍歇歇會大有好處的
A second to catch our breath would be really helpful, I think.

346
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,640
就得這樣  漢娜  需要的話你就休息一下吧
This is what it is, Hannah. If you need to take a break, you can.

347
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,550
親愛的  我們一整周都沒睡了
Darling, we haven't slept all week.

348
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
你累壞了
You're exhausted.

349
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,030
-我  只是說說  -下一個打給誰
- I... Just an idea. - What's my next call?

350
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,560
但你不快樂
But you're not enjoying yourself.

351
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,520
因為他不肯聽我的
Because he won't listen to me.

352
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,700
眾議院他贏不了
He can't win in the House.

353
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,190
我說的不是他  我說的是你
I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,490
我快不快樂又有什么區別呢
What difference does it make whether I'm enjoying myself or not?

355
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,080
這不才是最重要的嗎
Isn't that what this is all about?

356
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,250
你就不能...先體驗它一下嗎
Can't you just... live in it for a second?

357
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,440
你現在掌權了
You are in charge.

358
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,020
-對  但是  -過來
- Yes, but-- - Come here.

359
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,870
過來
Come.

360
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,220
等你明早醒來
You could wake up tomorrow...

361
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,520
你可以
and...

362
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,930
比如  喂孩子們吃飯
I don't know, feed the children...

363
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,970
挑起戰爭
start a war...

364
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,340
你知道嗎  我很抱歉
You know what? I'm sorry.

365
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,200
我不應該把我想的都說出來
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.

366
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,770
不  你說得對
No, you're right.

367
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,080
我們別談這房間外發生的事了
Let's not talk about anything that happens outside of this room.

368
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,640
制裁的目標是俄羅斯的寡頭階層
The sanctions are meant to target the oligarch class in Russia.

369
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,280
我和佩特羅夫總統談判之前
And the more members we have on board

370
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,270
我們能爭取到越多成員的支持
before I sit down with President Petrov,

371
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,040
這問題就能越快得到解決
the quicker this will resolve itself.

372
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,750
已經在做了  我們準備出售一些戰略儲備
We are. We are prepared to release some of our strategic reserves

373
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,260
以平穩油價
to keep prices down.

374
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,600
聯系卡斯皮大使  再給我爭取15分鐘
Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me 15 more minutes.

375
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,500
別把這當成是和安德伍德夫婦的交易
Uh, please don't think of this as a deal with the Underwoods.

376
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,810
說實在的  他們可能周一就走了
To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.

377
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,350
但當然了  我不希望這樣
That's not what I wish, of course.

378
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,400
但要知道  在這件事上
But know that you are

379
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,000
你更多是跟我合作  而不是跟他們
working more with me on this than with them.

380
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,200
沃茨議員
Congressman Watts.

381
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,580
州長  真高興你今天來見我們
Governor, we're so happy you could join us today.

382
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,480
我也很高興  黑人群體應該得到更好的政策
As am I. The black community deserves so much better

383
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,300
而不是弗蘭克·安德伍德失敗的政策
than Frank Underwood's failed policies.

384
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,090
這我們都同意
That we can agree on.

385
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,090
我期待你的政綱
I look forward to hearing about your platform.

386
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,120
-我們開始嗎  -不  抱歉
- Shall we? - Oh, no, I'm sorry.

387
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
我們還得再處理一些閉門的
We have just a bit more private caucus business

388
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,770
黨團議程
to attend to first.

389
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,460
你說什么
Excuse me?

390
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,930
這是國會黑人黨團的會議
This is a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.

391
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,880
我知道  所以我們才來
Well, I understand. That's... why we're here.

392
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,430
跟我說的是九點  現在已經過了一個小時了
I was told 9:00, and it's already been an hour.

393
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,520
應該叫你十點來的
You should have been told 10:00.

394
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,230
你會有機會跟我們談的
And you will get your opportunity to address us.

395
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,630
很感謝你的耐心等待
I appreciate your patience.

396
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,250
我不會低聲下氣的
I'm not gonna beg.

397
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,970
對  你要微笑
No, you're gonna smile.

398
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,560
在田納西被捕的穆罕默德·卡拉比
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested in Tennessee

399
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,450
和哈里發國并無關聯
is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.

400
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,860
你能證明這不是單純的搞錯了嗎
Can you prove it wasn't just a bureaucratic mix-up?

401
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,030
目前還沒有證據
Uh, not yet.

402
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,370
還有什么
What else?

403
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,870
最后一宗壓制投票訴訟
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit

404
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,090
被踢回了下級法院
was kicked back to the lower court,

405
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
高院的僵持助長了混亂局面
SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.

406
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,150
你看報嗎  肖恩
Do you read the paper, Sean?

407
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,430
比利三天前就署名發表了關于這個的報道
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.

408
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,370
宣戰怎么樣
Declaration of war?

409
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,720
安德伍德之前還決心滿滿
Underwood was so evangelical,

410
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,910
但他已經幾周沒提起這個了
but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.

411
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,010
行了  夠了  夠了
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

412
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,480
麗薩·威廉姆斯
Lisa Williams.

413
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,350
麗莎·威廉姆斯怎么了
What about Lisa Williams?

414
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,210
我看見你和她交談了
I saw you talking.

415
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,220
我認為她這條線可能值得追查
I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.

416
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,670
并不
She's not.

417
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,070
她只是在利用在報上看到的東西
She's using what she read in the paper

418
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,760
博取關注或是發點小財
to get attention or a little cash.

419
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,770
我調查了一下
I did some digging.

420
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,170
她和瑞秋·波斯納
She and Rachel Posner

421
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,720
都去過一個叫團契的教堂
both went to a church called the Fellowship.

422
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,400
-瑞秋失蹤了  -打住
- Rachel disappeared-- - Stop.

423
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,810
別再扯這些關于死去姑娘的陰謀論了
No more conspiracy theories about dead girls.

424
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,130
但人們喜歡看死去姑娘的故事
But people love stories about dead girls.

425
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,970
下一場眾議院投票就在后天了
The next House vote is the day after tomorrow.

426
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,200
國民坐立不安  義憤填膺
The natives are restless, outraged,

427
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,280
而且說實話  害怕了
just plain scared, actually.

428
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,440
他們希望美國不會一夜天翻地覆
They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.

429
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,240
卡拉比那條線再挖挖
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.

430
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,730
看看能不能和安德伍德聯系到一起去
See if you can connect Underwood to it.

431
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,570
這是詹姆斯·S·布雷迪媒體接待室
So, this is the James S. Brady press briefing room.

432
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,610
我們腳下其實是個游泳池
And under our feet is actually a swimming pool.

433
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,390
是由畸形兒基金會為
It was built by the March of Dimes

434
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,170
富蘭克林·羅斯福總統建造的  
for President Franklin Roosevelt,

435
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,110
他患了小兒麻痹癥
who had polio.

436
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,230
泳池是他唯一的健身場所
And this pool was really the only way for him to exercise.

437
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,810
羅斯福總統大部分時間
It was, an open secret

438
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,410
都是在輪椅上度過  這已是個公開的秘密了
that the president used a wheelchair most of the time.

439
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,460
因此白宮
Which is why the White House

440
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,020
是首批有殘疾人專用通道的政府建筑之一
was one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings.

441
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,410
-但大家都裝作他能走路嗎  -是的
- But everyone pretended he could walk? - Yes.

442
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,250
-這很有風度  -是的
- That's a bit of grace. - Yeah.

443
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,060
大家都心照不宣
A thing not spoken?

444
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,720
是的  這座大樓因為他的殘疾而進行了改建
Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.

445
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,940
但人們都很尊敬他
But people just respected him,

446
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,540
尊敬他的...
respected his, uh--

447
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,560
嗯
Right.

448
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,170
總統辦公室曾承載了很重的分量
That office used to carry so much weight,

449
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,100
和很多尊敬
so much, respect.

450
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,880
你覺得現在已經不是如此了嗎
You don't think it does anymore?

451
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,420
不不  我沒那個意思
No, oh, no, no! I'm not saying that.

452
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,780
我是在故意為難你  我明白你的意思
I was giving you a hard time. I know what you meant.

453
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,370
抱歉  我無意打擾你們參觀的
Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to hijack the tour.

454
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,540
繼續...
Moving on...

455
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,110
先生們  我們可以見你們了
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.

456
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,680
我今天可以在這兒
I could come here today

457
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,190
談論大麻和可卡因的
and talk about federal sentencing disparities

458
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,860
聯邦量刑差異
between crack and cocaine,

459
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,500
這其中顯然存在種族因素
which obviously are racially motivated.

460
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,890
打斷一下  你是斷定濫用大麻的問題
I'm sorry, but are you asserting that the crack epidemic

461
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,670
只在黑人群體中存在嗎
is exclusive to the black community?

462
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,210
不  完全不是
No, not at all.

463
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,740
但我覺得可以說  量刑差異
But I think it's fair to say that sentencing discrepancies

464
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,310
對少數群體的影響尤為嚴重
have disproportionately affected minority populations.

465
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,380
我們不只關注一個問題
We're not one-issue voters.

466
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,170
當然不是  這正是我的意思
Of course not. That's what I'm getting at.

467
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,670
今天會議的主旨就是擴展我們的綱領
The whole point of today's meeting is to broaden our platform.

468
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
共和黨總是拿犯罪說事  州長
Republicans are always dwelling on crime, Governor.

469
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,660
我就是來溝通的
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.

470
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,670
我們希望你能拿出一個方案來
We expected you to come in here with a plan.

471
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,650
我確實準備了一套方案
And I do have a plan.

472
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,900
專注于個別繁瑣的立法不叫方案
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.

473
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,490
讓我們把話說清楚...
Let's be clear...

474
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,880
這樣的說辭我們聽過
That kind of talk we've heard before.

475
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,000
-我是共和黨人  -又來了
- I'm a Republican. - Here we go.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,380
你們沒有好好聽我說
You're not listening.

477
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,610
我想幫助你們自力更生
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.

478
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,700
不可理喻
Unbelievable.

479
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,290
這就是我的綱領
That's my platform.

480
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,560
是嗎  我聽夠了
Well... I've heard enough.

481
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,270
還有誰有問題想問州長
So, does anyone else have any questions for the governor?

482
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,260
我倒是有個問題
Well, I have a question.

483
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,050
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德到底給了你們什么好處
What has Francis Underwood ever done for you?

484
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,570
今天早上的這出戲
This little charade this morning...

485
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,030
-演得好  真精彩  -威爾
- Well done. Quite an act. - Will.

486
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,630
-州長  -我說真的
- Governor. - No, but really.

487
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,250
你們也許和我有分歧
See, you may have differences with me...

488
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,910
你們也許真心不贊同我的觀點
You may have genuine differences with me.

489
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,290
但最關鍵的就是這一點  "真心"
But see, that's the operative word, "genuine."

490
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,900
能否麻煩你們哪位給我解釋一下
Can someone here please explain to me

491
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,160
你們為什么還對
why you all are still so loyal

492
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,290
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德和民主黨這么忠誠
to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?

493
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,780
總有一天
One of these days

494
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,170
在座的各位會意識到
the members of this room will realize

495
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,100
目前的現狀  你們要負多大的責任
how much you actually prop up the status quo.

496
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,310
你們撈著什么好處了嗎
And how's that working for ya?

497
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,240
威爾  我們先感謝各位先生女士見我們吧
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen and women for their time?

498
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,010
你們犯了個錯誤
You've made a mistake.

499
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:41,650
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}選舉人到華盛頓進行最后投票前6天

500
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,030
我們提議在兩個未能在安全港日之前
What we're proposing is a new election in the two states

501
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,290
選出有效選舉人的州
that weren't able to provide valid electors

502
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,650
重新舉行大選
by the safe harbor date.

503
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,210
還能這么做
Can we even do this?

504
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,650
安靜  大家安靜
Hold on. Hold on, everyone!

505
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,240
我想知道
I'd like to know,

506
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,620
司法部長是什么立場
where does the attorney general stand on this?

507
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,690
正在研究  不過也同意了
Looking into it, but on board.

508
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,930
鮑勃  這種事根本沒有先例
Bob, there's no precedent here.

509
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,630
沒有現成的規則
There's no playbook.

510
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,280
我們只能在憲法里尋找啟示
We can look to the Constitution for inspiration,

511
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
但它不是操作指南
but not for instruction.

512
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,800
周四的投票表明民主黨人漸漸想明白了
Thursday's vote showed Democrats are coming to their senses.

513
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
我們輸了一場投票  喬丹
We lost one vote, Jordan.

514
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,750
這事完全可能搞成拉鋸戰
We can go back and forth like this forever.

515
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,800
作為在場少數的幾個共和黨  我必須要說
As one of the few Republicans in the room, it needs to be said.

516
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,720
我們國家的穩定
The stability of our country

517
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,610
要比總統職位重要得多
is more important than the presidency.

518
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,950
除非民眾認為他們的總統
Not if people believe the president

519
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,910
是秘密會議指定的
is being chosen behind closed doors.

520
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,240
這是憲法里寫明的程序
A process that is laid out in the Constitution.

521
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,150
而這個程序完全可能讓我們
The same process that can keep us gridlocked

522
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,440
再僵持兩年
for the next two years.

523
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,160
決定權應該且必須歸于眾議院
The House should and will decide.

524
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,120
特拉華州只有一個眾議員
Delaware has one congressman.

525
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,130
如果兩年后你的對手告訴選民  是你
How will that play in Austin when your opponent in two years

526
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,650
讓特拉華這樣的小州和德州有相同的影響力
tells voters that you allowed a state like Delaware

527
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,930
你在奧斯丁還要怎么待
to have the same influence as Texas?

528
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,960
你們許多在任議員都將可能敗選
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.

529
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,080
就是這樣
And there it is.

530
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,520
看啊  看看他們
Look. Look at them.

531
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,700
這就是忌憚失敗的表情
That is the look of contemplating loss.

532
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,270
失敗
Loss...

533
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,120
是這里所有人唯一聽從的選民
the only constituent that anyone in this room really listens to.

534
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,550
我個人想聽一下
I, for one, would like to hear

535
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,490
總統對此的看法
how the president feels about all this.

536
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,740
-我已經...  -我想我們可以
- Well, I've made my... - I think we could...

537
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,250
我是問總統先生  您剛才一直沒說什么
No, Mr. President. You haven't spoken much here.

538
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,380
我們相信一人一票
We believe in one person, one vote.

539
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,490
如果不能做到這點  我們國家還算什么
If we take that away, then what is this country?

540
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,730
對不對  總統先生
Isn't that right, Mr. President?

541
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,780
完全正確  總統女士
Absolutely, Madam President.

542
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,030
等等  等下  我往下挪挪
Wait, hold it. Let me just move down a bit.

543
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,890
我老是要從講臺上滑下來
I keep slipping off the podium.

544
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,660
-你接著我  -好些了嗎
- You got me. - That better?

545
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,290
嗯  好爽
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

546
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,290
話說林肯室
So the Lincoln...

547
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,470
那真是他的辦公室嗎
That was actually his office?

548
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,940
能不說工作嗎
Can we... can we not?

549
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,320
-你能  把我往上托一托嗎  -好
- Can you... can you move me up a bit? - Yeah.

550
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,330
好了
Okay.

551
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,400
-還順利嗎  -再看吧
- How'd it go? - We'll see.

552
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,430
我需要你再過一遍南極洲事件的聲明稿
I need you to look over the Antarctica statement again.

553
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,980
都聽你的
Whatever you need.

554
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,190
陪我走走吧
Walk with me?

555
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,050
我有點擔心弗蘭西斯
I'm worried about Francis.

556
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,030
-為什么  -我可能需要你幫我一把
- Why? - I might need you to save me.

557
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,060
-這樣是不行的  -為什么
- This is not going to work. - Why?

558
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,230
如果他沒贏  那我還是輸
If he loses, I still lose.

559
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,740
他不能站在圈外看著我們忙活
He cannot be on the outside looking in.

560
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,380
他會贏的
He'll win.

561
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,070
你真的這么想
You actually believe that?

562
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,890
當然  為什么不呢
Sure... why not?

563
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,520
這本就是賭一把
It was a wager.

564
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,530
有潛在收益  所以有必要賭
The potential gains made it necessary.

565
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,290
完全是浪費我的時間
It was a complete waste of my time.

566
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,240
如果你還不開始扭轉局勢
If you don't start turning things around,

567
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,830
你他媽就得滾蛋  明白嗎
you're going to be out on your fucking ass. You understand?

568
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,430
明白
I do.

569
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,850
我該跟你說明白一件事  州長
I should explain something to you, Governor.

570
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,870
如果你再那樣跟我說話
If you ever talk to me like that again...

571
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,710
我會確保你這輩子再贏不了一場選舉
I'll make sure you never win another election in your life.

572
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,110
-你在威脅我嗎  -不  我只是把話說開
- Are you threatening me? - No, I'm enlightening you.

573
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,790
康威州長  你好  先生
Governor Conway. Hello, sir.

574
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,910
情況如何  我來看看
How you doin'? Take a peek,

575
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,860
-你不介意吧  機長  -州長
- if you don't mind, Captain? - Governor.

576
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,490
我過去也開過飛機
I used to fly, too, you know.

577
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,290
引擎的最大推力是多少
What kinda max thrust you get on these engines?

578
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,080
-約六千四百磅  -六千四百磅
- About 6,400 pounds. - 6,400 pounds.

579
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,750
我過去開的飛機更大  推力更強
I used to fly something a lot bigger, a lot more power,

580
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,800
但飛機上的武器很重
but it was so weighed down with all the weaponry,

581
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
像在駕駛坦克
it was like flying a tank.

582
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,710
不如你讓我開會兒
Why don't you let me in for a second,

583
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,530
讓我控制操縱桿
just flip me the controls?

584
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,780
抱歉  先生  不行
I'm sorry, sir. I can't.

585
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,580
別這樣  我...
Come on, I...

586
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,190
我只是想感受一下操縱桿的力道
I just want to feel the weight on the stick for a second.

587
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,640
我也想  但你不在飛行計劃中
I wish I could, but, uh, you're not on the flight plan.

588
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,650
你知道我經驗豐富吧
You know I've been in situations,

589
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,890
我遭遇過攻擊
where, like, I've been shot at.

590
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,210
你明白吧
You realize that, right?

591
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,080
你覺得我駕馭不了十千米高空中的雙引擎
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at 35,000 feet,

592
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,870
飛機還是平穩地飛越農田
straight and level over some farm country?

593
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,110
拜托  先生
I mean, come on, sir.

594
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,090
先生
Sir.

595
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,920
您還是回主艙吧
You should probably go back to the main cabin.

596
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,790
你知道我會成為總統吧
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?

597
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,710
-希望如此  先生  -你希望如此
- I hope so, sir. - You hope so?

598
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,170
我只是說我支持你  先生
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.

599
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,440
我一定會成為總統
I'm gonna be the president,

600
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,880
你也一定要把那該死的操縱桿給我
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.

601
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,170
威爾  過來
Will, come on.

602
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
-干嗎  你想怎樣  -我只是
- What? What do you want? - I just

603
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,040
得跟你談一會兒  行嗎
I need to talk to you for a minute, please.

604
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,570
我只是在跟飛行員聊天
I was just talking to the pilots.

605
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,470
行  你得冷靜下來  行嗎
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?

606
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,830
呼吸
Breathe.

607
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,410
威爾  不如你坐下
Will, why don't you sit down?

608
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,340
不如你他媽閉嘴
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

609
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,220
我要炒了你
I'll fire you.

610
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,570
把你留在跑道上
I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.

611
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,670
好吧
Okay.

612
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,590
你他媽想怎樣
What the fuck are you gonna do?

613
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,800
坐下來  別耍孩子氣
Sit down and try and act like an adult...

614
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,710
至少要有點下任美國總統的樣子
or at least like the next President of the United States.

615
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,220
坐下
Sit.

616
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,710
他們是誰
Who are they?

617
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,930
或許是印尼的秘密警察
Maybe Indonesian secret police?

618
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,330
不付錢會怎樣
What if we don't pay?

619
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,230
還有其他買家嗎
Are there other buyers?

620
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,940
不清楚
I don't know.

621
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,850
我會處理好的
I'll take care of it.

622
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,050
-怎么做  -別問我
- How? - Don't ask how.

623
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,670
我會找回麥卡倫
I'll get Macallan back.

624
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,790
顯然這事得保密
Obviously, this stays between us.

625
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,750
說"謝謝  道格"
Say, "Thank you, Doug."

626
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,340
謝謝  道格
Thank you, Doug.

627
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,530
我們在公交車上認識的
We met on a bus.

628
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,090
她當時在聽歌
She was listening to music.

629
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,420
我問她要不要去我以前常去的一間教堂
And I asked her to go to this church I used to go to.

630
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,310
-那是在哪  -馬里蘭
- Where was that? - Maryland.

631
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,610
冬離團契
The Winter's Run Fellowship.

632
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,590
巴爾的摩往北一小時路程
About an hour north of Baltimore.

633
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,260
然后呢
So, then what?

634
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,100
我們就是...
I don't know. We just...

635
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,680
成了朋友  然后就超越了朋友
became friends. And then it became more than that.

636
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,280
開始每晚在一起
Started spending every night together.

637
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,870
后來  她告訴我有個男人
At some point, she told me about this guy

638
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,750
常常過去查看她的情況
who used to come around to check on her.

639
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,900
-那男人長什么樣  -我沒見過他
- What'd he look like? - I never saw him.

640
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,200
只是有時  她說他要來
Just sometimes she said he was coming,

641
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,150
就沒法跟我在一起
so she couldn't hang out.

642
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,320
她并不怎么跟我講他的事
She wouldn't really tell me anything about him.

643
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,590
你沒事吧
Everything okay?

644
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,590
沒事  失陪一下
Yeah, do you mind?

645
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,510
我朋友在那邊  我得去見他
I just need to see my friend up there.

646
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,120
你好嗎
How are you doing?

647
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,270
謝謝
Thanks.

648
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,380
你認為那兒有石油
You think there's oil there.

649
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,200
你想爭取開采權
You're positioning to stake a claim.

650
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,120
南極洲并沒有俄國軍隊
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.

651
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,790
我們愿對《南極條約》締約國
We're willing to recommend changes

652
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,420
提出修改建議
to the Antarctic Treaty parties.

653
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,730
安德伍德夫婦被趕出白宮后  你會怎么樣
What happens to you when the Underwoods are ejected from office?

654
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,840
到大學去教國際關系
You teach international relations at a university?

655
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,170
還是加入智囊團
Or work for a think tank?

656
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,000
我還沒想那么遠
I haven't thought that far ahead.

657
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
你應該有吧
I think you have.

658
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,970
你不覺得全世界遲早會發現
How long do you expect the world to believe

659
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,860
那是你的軍隊嗎
those aren't your soldiers?

660
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,740
你喜歡替安德伍德夫婦工作嗎
Do you like working for the Underwoods?

661
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,480
你有多忠誠
How loyal are you?

662
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,460
關鍵時刻  你會支持他們
When the time comes, will you stand with them...

663
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,100
還是拋棄他們
or not?

664
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,300
我明天離開
I leave tomorrow.

665
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,750
關于制裁的新聞會在周一爆出
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.

666
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,620
你走之前我們見個面
Let's meet before you go.

667
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,370
你是外交專家  專業人士
You're a career diplomat, a professional.

668
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,430
或許因此我信任你
Maybe that's why I trust you.

669
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,790
你會照顧他們
Then you take care of them,

670
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,480
他們感覺好了  就會照顧你
so they feel good and they take care of you.

671
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,390
那你就會感覺好...
So you feel good because...

672
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,600
瑞秋美麗動人
I mean, Rachel was really beautiful.

673
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,940
你站在街對面就能看得出來
You could tell that from across the street.

674
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,640
但我從來沒有隔著街看過她
I never saw her from across the street, though.

675
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,600
仔細想想是不是很奇妙
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?

676
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,490
我覺得  有時候
A lot of people, I think,

677
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,930
很多人隔著街就能認出他們的心上人
they spot the one they love from across the street sometimes.

678
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,400
比如說他們出門辦事
It's like they're running an errand,

679
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,770
碰巧看見他們的心上人
and they happen to spot the one they love

680
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,140
在街對面  辦著別的事
across the street running a different errand.

681
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,480
心里一陣激動
There's this sudden thrill, like...

682
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,710
因為你的愛人
while the person you love

683
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,090
和你居住在同一個世界
is inhabiting the same world as you.

684
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,160
而他們只是很隨意地
And they're just walking around,

685
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,680
出門買個維生素水之類的
buying, I don't know... Vitaminwater,

686
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,740
或許他們這么做時  知道你愛著他們
and maybe they know that you love them while they're doing it,

687
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,370
或許他們因此會對店員友善
and maybe it means they're nice to a cashier.

688
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,940
但是我從來沒有隔著街看過她
I never got to see her from across the street, though.

689
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,650
從來沒有
It just never happened.

690
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
別燙傷自己了
I don't want you to burn yourself.

691
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,180
不會燙傷的
No burning, no.

692
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,940
瑞秋愛抽煙
Rachel liked to smoke.

693
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,220
她說打算戒掉
She said she was gonna stop,

694
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,110
但她定了個規則  只有我們一起聽
but she would have a rule that she'd only smoke

695
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,110
我們共同喜愛的樂隊時  她才能抽煙
when we listened to this one band we both loved.

696
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,360
因為那是儀式
Because of the ceremony.

697
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,600
"這該成為一個儀式"  她這么說的
"It should be a ceremony," it's what she said.

698
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,530
即使是口香糖
Well, even if it's gum,

699
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,760
我還是想到外面嚼
I still prefer to step outside to chew it.

700
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,070
像是在點燃一根美味的香煙
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.

701
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,690
我們所懷念的  那種儀式感
The things we miss, the rituals...

702
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,060
我先走了
Excuse me.

703
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,780
-她不喜歡我  -她以后會的
- She doesn't like me. - She will.

704
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,120
感謝你過來和他見面
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.

705
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,370
你知道法律上  你無法趕走克萊爾·安德伍德
You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood,

706
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,340
即便你在眾議院獲勝
even if you win in the House?

707
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,500
我正在想辦法
I'm working on that.

708
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,030
我沒興趣
I'm not interested.

709
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,580
他需要你  我需要你
He needs you. I need you.

710
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,000
國家也需要你
So does the country.

711
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,850
我不是政客
I'm not a politician.

712
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,330
我能下達命令  也能遵從命令
I can give orders, I can follow orders

713
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,070
我知道何時該閉嘴
and I know when the hell to shut up.

714
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,740
你是個穩重的人  國家需要這種人
And you're a steady hand, which, again, the country needs.

715
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,610
-我可不當康威的替死鬼  -你不會的
- I'm not gonna be Conway's patsy. - No, you're not.

716
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,370
他是個難相處的人
He's a difficult man to be around.

717
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,540
已經結束了
It's over. It's over.

718
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,430
憲法程序選擇了克萊爾·安德伍德
The process chose Claire Underwood.

719
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,420
我們會有辦法的
We'll get there.

720
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,110
你會被稱為副總統
You'll be called vice president,

721
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,700
但實際上  你將做到更多
but you will be, de facto, something more.

722
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,560
你去那兒做什么
What were you doing there?

723
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,370
我去問賽斯·格雷森關于麗薩·威廉姆斯的事
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.

724
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,790
你為什么會認為可以這么做
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?

725
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,320
我不是叫你別管這條線索了嗎
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?

726
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,140
這還算線索嗎  因為沒人在查
Is it still a lead? Because nobody's on it.

727
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,220
沒人在查是因為她是癮君子
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie,

728
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,480
而她告訴我的一切
and everything she said to me

729
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,840
盧卡斯·古德溫的宣言里都有
is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto,

730
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,960
而宣言的每一字每一句  都被網上各大論壇
which has been picked apart by every message board

731
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,100
和陰謀論者掰爛嚼碎了
and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.

732
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,240
一開始  格雷森說對她的名字沒印象
At first, Grayson said her name didn't ring a bell,

733
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,840
然后他突然聯系我
but then he called me out of the blue

734
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,300
問我是不是還在查這個事
and asked me if we were still looking into it.

735
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,530
所以我就查了
So I followed up.

736
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,870
你偷看了我的筆記
You looked through my notes.

737
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,690
滾
You're out.

738
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,780
-什么  -你被開除了  杰弗瑞斯
- What? - You're fired, Jeffries.

739
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,390
這是個故事  我在跟進這個故事
It's a story. I was following it.

740
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,680
我不希望你跟著我干了
I don't want you on my team.

741
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,340
滾出我的辦公室
Get out of my office.

742
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,950
我們知道我們能贏下這兩個州
We know we can win both states.

743
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,330
為什么不接受這個交易
Why would we not take this deal?

744
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,640
不  安德伍德夫婦想重新投票
No. The Underwoods want a revote

745
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,280
是因為他們知道拿不下眾議院  而我們能
because they know they can't win in the House. We can.

746
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,040
我們要做個交易  逼克萊爾·安德伍德辭職
We need to make a deal that forces Claire Underwood to resign.

747
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,240
-她有那么重要嗎  -我能說兩句嗎
- And why does that matter? - If I may?

748
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,680
-議長女士  -就國會而言
- Madam Speaker. - Speaking from the Hill,

749
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,990
作為副總統
as vice president,

750
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,520
她可以利用這個平臺公開抹黑你的所有動作
she'll have a public pulpit to discredit your every move.

751
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,660
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美國副總統官邸

752
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,660
我會把克萊爾·安德伍德流放到海軍天文臺I'm going to exile Claire Underwood to the Naval Observatory

753
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,920
讓她整天在東南亞出席國葬儀式
and stack her schedule with state funerals in Southeast Asia.

754
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,540
她別想參與白宮的決策
She'll never see the inside of the West Wing,

755
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,460
更別提干涉總統了
let alone the Oval.

756
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,600
你需要布洛哈特在你身邊支持你
You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.

757
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,050
我不想再聽布洛哈特的事了
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.

758
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,130
重要的是讓威爾當上總統
What matters is that Will becomes president.

759
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,370
安德伍德在你的政府里會造成巨大破壞的
Underwood in office can cause an enormous amount damage.

760
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,860
反過來如果他們輸了  他們就全完了
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.

761
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,570
我希望這場選舉是在我
I want this election to be between me

762
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,150
和弗蘭西斯·安德伍德之間
and Francis Underwood.

763
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,490
這你說了不算
Well, it isn't up to you.

764
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,450
麥卡錫議長不會讓這個議案進入投票的
Speaker McCarthy isn't letting this particular bill to the floor,

765
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,100
除非我們附加一項修正案
unless we have an amendment attached

766
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,650
將克萊爾·安德伍德趕走
that removes Claire Underwood.

767
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,890
威爾
Will...

768
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,950
如果你希望白宮里有位愿意合作的總統
Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House,

769
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,860
那你最好讓議案原樣進入表決
you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.

770
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,040
如果你坐進總統辦公室  威爾
If you get to the Oval, Will,

771
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,260
那時是你更需要議長  而不是反過來
you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.

772
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,120
我這就給她打回去
So, I'm gonna call her back,

773
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,200
然后你要道歉
and you are going to apologize.

774
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,560
威爾
Will.

775
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,570
威爾  回來
Will, get back here!

776
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,040
威爾
Will!

777
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,880
別逼他了
Enough.

778
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,600
關門
Shut the door.

779
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,610
你看著像死人
You look like death.

780
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,270
我聯系不上綁匪了
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.

781
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,310
快一天了  什么消息都沒有
It's been radio silence for almost 24 hours.

782
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,850
有傳言說他已經不在綁匪手上了
There's rumors they don't even have him anymore.

783
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,550
這事我不能再瞞著總統了
I can't keep this from the president any longer.

784
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,050
好吧
Okay.

785
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,850
那我會告訴他你幫了好大的忙
And then I'll tell him what a big help you've been.

786
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,250
再過幾小時制裁就要生效了
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.

787
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,240
你要么和杜蘭特國務卿談
Deal with Secretary Durant

788
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,030
要么對付幾個憤怒的億萬富翁去吧
or with some very unhappy billionaires.

789
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,250
你要讓我在南極洲任意開采石油
You will allow me to exploit whatever oil I find in Antarctica.

790
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,770
我告訴你為什么
And I'll tell you why.

791
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,850
我手上有料
I have something.

792
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,080
或者說有你們想要的人
Or rather, someone you need.

793
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,550
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

794
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,170
你們政府里有人
Someone in your administration

795
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,770
愿花大錢換他平安回國
was willing to pay a great deal of money for his safe return.

796
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,900
你的艾丹·麥卡倫
Your Aidan Macallan.

797
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,460
他在這里  就在克里姆林宮里
He's here. In the Kremlin.

798
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,750
不然你以為是誰泄的密
Who do you think orchestrated that leak?

799
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,690
看來他知道的不少啊
Seems to know quite a lot.

800
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,630
失陪一下  你們國務卿來了
Excuse me one moment. The Secretary of State is here.

801
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,480
-國務卿女士  -先生們
- Madam Secretary. - Gentlemen.

802
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,600
想必你認識艾丹吧
You must know Aidan?

803
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,290
我想我不認識他
I don't believe I do.

804
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,730
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you.

805
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,200
-你是美國人  -是
- You're American? - I am.

806
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,080
開始會談之前  我想讓你知道
Before we begin, I'd just like you to know that

807
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,930
你們的總統和前總統都在線上
the president and the former president are on the line.

808
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,810
凱茜
Cathy...

809
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,170
你愿意的話可以接聽
You can pick up the phone, if you like.

810
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,860
總統先生
Mr. President.

811
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,750
你最好先回華盛頓
It's best you come back to Washington.

812
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,930
有什么發現嗎
Find anything yet?

813
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,420
還沒
Not yet.

814
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,980
再次感謝  巴恩斯先生
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,

815
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,540
謝謝你讓我看
for letting me take a look.

816
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,300
我不會看太久
I won't be long.

817
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,660
這就是全部嗎
This is everything?

818
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,440
這是他們從佐伊的公寓寄來的一切
This is everything they sent from Zoe's apartment.

819
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,140
我就是
I just, you know...

820
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,080
我不忍扔掉任何東西
I just can't seem to throw anything out.

821
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,380
只是些文件  但是
I mean, it's just papers, but...

822
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,140
不管怎樣  你自便
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

823
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,330
-好  謝謝  -沒事
- Okay. Thank you. - Yeah.

824
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
好吧
Okay.

825
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,060
黑人黨團  不是吧
The Black Caucus? Really?

826
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,820
我喜歡馬克  因為我總是知道他的立場
I like Mark, because I always know where he stands.

827
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
通常是對人步步緊逼
It's usually on someone's neck.

828
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,080
你給自己爭取到了什么  一天時間嗎
What did you buy yourselves, another day?

829
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,110
足夠跟大衛·拉斯姆森談了
Enough time to talk to David Rasmussen,

830
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,950
顯然你早就跟他談過
who you clearly spoke to before.

831
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,410
然后又見了喬丹·薩多斯基
And to meet with Jordan Sadowsky

832
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,010
和剩下的共和黨領導人
and the rest of the Republican leadership.

833
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,310
那星期二呢  星期三呢
And what happens Tuesday? Or Wednesday?

834
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,320
我能讓大衛和眾議院
Look, I... I can have David and the House

835
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
每次會議都對此進行投票
vote on this every single session.

836
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,070
我們背景不同
Our backgrounds are different,

837
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,300
但內心里我們都是窮小子
but we're both hardscrabble boys at heart.

838
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,450
我們需要最后一個字  最后一擊
We need the last word, last blow,

839
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,650
最后一舉
last move.

840
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,260
我們能讓眾議院通過議案
We can push the bill through the House

841
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,000
在田納西州和俄亥俄州重新選舉總統
for a new election for president in Tennessee and Ohio.

842
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,920
麥卡錫議長不會允許那種事發生
Speaker McCarthy won't let that happen.

843
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,470
但我能說服她
But I could... convince her

844
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,890
如果你辭職
if you were to step down,

845
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,820
我們在田納西州和俄亥俄州
and our full tickets president and vice president

846
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,110
同時進行總統和副總統的選舉
run against each other in Tennessee and Ohio.

847
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,630
那可不行  那可不行
Well, to hell with that. Well, to hell with that.

848
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,270
我們接受交易  我想這是正確的做法
We'll make the deal. I think this is the right thing to do.

849
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,740
明天我會宣布
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention

850
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,120
在重新投票后我就辭職
to step down after the revote.

851
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,170
我會通知議長讓議案進入投票表決
I'll let the Speaker know to put the bill on the floor.

852
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,390
我們還有一件非常重要的事
We have one more outstanding piece of business,

853
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,850
最高法院提名人
the Supreme Court nominee.

854
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,120
我們需要任命個人來打破四四僵局
We'll need to appoint someone to break the four-four deadlock.

855
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,080
批準國會的新選舉日
Approve Congress' new election date.

856
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,240
我們有幾個人選
We, uh, have several people in mind.

857
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,110
我希望你們任命伊麗莎白·本森
I want you to appoint Elizabeth Benson.

858
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,870
她足夠開放  你可以接受
Well, she's liberal enough for you to swallow,

859
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,950
必要的時候又足夠保守
and conservative enough when it counts.

860
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,910
但我們沒時間開參議院聽證會
Yes, but we don't have time for Senate hearings.

861
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,440
我可以讓參議院休會
I can make a recess happen.

862
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,110
競選活動上見
I'll see you on the campaign trail.

863
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,100
那置我于何地  艾力克斯
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?

864
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,390
我冒了巨大風險
I went out on a limb here.

865
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,180
如果我們沒拿下眾議院  那怎么辦
If we don't have a vote in the House, then what?

866
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,280
馬克·厄舍是你的朋友  不是我的
Mark Usher is your friend, not mine.

867
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,010
馬克·厄舍不是任何人的朋友
Mark Usher's no one's friend.

868
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,280
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德什么也沒贏  好嗎
Francis Underwood hasn't won a thing, okay?

869
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,870
威爾·康威有可能  很大的可能
And there's a good... More than a good chance that Will Conway

870
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,450
會成為下一任美國總統
will be the next President of the United States.

871
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,700
能讓我單獨待會兒嗎  這幾天太艱難了
Could you give me a moment? It's been a difficult few days.

872
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,300
好點嗎
Better?

873
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,200
嗯
Yes.

874
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,540
我們不能按原計劃讓眾議院周一投票
We couldn't let the House vote proceed on Monday.

875
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,350
為什么
Why not?

876
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,340
因為你會輸的
Because you would've lost.

877
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,010
即使康威當了總統
Even if Conway took the presidency,

878
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,720
有你  我們還是會有立足之地
we would've had a foothold with you.

879
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,570
我們可以破壞他們  就像對沃克夫婦那樣
We could've sabotaged, just like we did with the Walkers.

880
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,590
康威夫婦不是沃克夫婦
The Conways are not the Walkers.

881
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,250
那不是你能決定的
It wasn't your decision to make.

882
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,670
你說什么
Excuse me?

883
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,530
你自己說的  你只是代總統
You said it yourself. You're only acting.

884
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,230
我贊同厄舍
I agreed with Usher

885
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,820
是因為他會不惜一切
because he will sacrifice everything

886
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,330
讓布洛哈特上位
to get Brockhart into office,

887
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,290
而這就讓康威變弱  容易失敗
which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.

888
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,320
我以為你和我看法相同
I thought you saw what I saw.

889
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,060
確實
I did. I do.

890
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,870
我們完全同步  克萊爾
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.

892
00:53:28,210 --> 00:54:28,210
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}最高法院基本任命流程是  當法院出現空缺  總統提名一個人選
然后參議院舉行公開聽證會  一般持續三到五天
然后參議院進行投票  如果被提名者獲得多數票  就可以宣誓就職  
歷史上也出現過休會任命大法官
但休會任命的局限是  在參議院復會后  還是要進行任命投票
在最高法院大法官的任命投票上  民主黨在控制參議院時
取消了原有的阻撓議事  允許51票簡單多數即可過關
這種規則的更改  卻讓共和黨占了便宜
在不久前特朗普提名大法官后  因為目前共和黨控制了參議院
雖然民主黨非常反對  但共和黨仍靠簡單多數投票讓大法官上任了

894
00:54:28,210 --> 00:55:28,210
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}在美國早期  現代政黨系統還沒有成型的時候
出現過正副總統分屬不同黨派的情況
亞當斯做總統時  副總統杰斐遜跟他不是一個黨派
創立了共和黨的林肯  出于選舉策略的考慮  選了民主黨杰克遜做副總統
根據法律  這種情況是可能出現的
因為一旦選舉結果有爭議  需要國會來投票選舉總統時
總統是由眾議院選舉產生  而副總統是由參議院選舉產生
這就可能出現正副總統不同黨  但歷史上沒有發生過
