早上好  准老公
Good morning, almost husband!

早上好  准...
Good morning, almost...

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,920
淡定一点啦
Oh, calm down.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,010
这肯定不是你们第一次
This can't be the first time

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,960
醒来发现有别的男人在卧室里
you woke up with another men in your bedroom.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,820
新婚快乐哦
Happy wedding day!

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,130
你们在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,370
你们订的是全方位服务婚礼
You pay for a full-service wedding,

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,510
自然会享受我们的全套"家伙儿"

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
接近了  亲爱的  很接近了
Oh, close, honey, so close.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,740
-我们要穿过来  -穿过来
- And we are crossing... - We're crossing

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,590
放下餐盘
and trays down.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,830
铺上餐巾
Napkin.

14
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,410
放轻松  好好享受
Relax. Enjoy.

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,060
4点车会来接你们
The car will pick you up at 4:00

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,330
把你们送到美丽的山顶婚礼会场
to whisk you away to your beautiful hilltop wedding.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,900
天气怎么样
How's the weather?

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,250
我梦到下了瓢泼大雨
I had a dream it rained on everyone.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,070
晴空万里
Dry as a bone.

20
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
今晚从天而降的只有汉子们
The only thing it will be raining tonight is men.

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,310
我们迫切需要呢
We really need it.

22
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,730
萨尔有消息了吗
Has anyone heard from Sal?

23
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,420
没有
No.

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,680
我真心不明白你们为什么
And I will never understand

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,060
要请那个成天醉醺醺的老巫婆
why you asked that boozy us-hag to

26
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,350
主持你们的婚礼
officiate your wedding.

27
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,620
我们并没有邀请萨尔
We didn't exactly ask Sal.

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,690
萨尔
Sal...

29
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,890
我们有件很重要的事要跟你谈谈
...we have something very important to talk to you about.

30
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,910
对  我们希望你能考虑一下...
Yeah, we hope that maybe you would be open to the idea --

31
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,490
好的  我非常愿意主持你们的婚礼
Yes! I will totally officiate your wedding!

32
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,510
我的酒啊
Oh, my drinks!

33
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,180
我们本来是要劝她戒酒的
It was supposed to be an intervention.

第五季 第二十三集

45
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,450
喂  伴郎
Hey, best man.

46
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,010
你好  娇羞新娘
Hello, blushing bride.

47
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,670
我不太喜欢这个称呼
I feel like I should hate that more.

48
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,730
对  我也觉得你应该叫我"伴人"
Yeah, I think I might go with "Best person."

49
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,480
不管怎样  我是想问问
Anyway, I'm just calling

50
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,420
你们准备得如何了
to see how you're doing.

51
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,340
我很好啊
I'm great.

52
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,380
真的吗
Really?

53
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,140
我  又是老妈的事吗
I-I-- is this about mom again?

54
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,920
我早就跟你说了  我没事
I told you -- I'm fine.

55
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,680
我母亲不能来参加婚礼
My mother can't come to the wedding.

56
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,170
她在一家瑜伽隐修所修炼
She was at a yoga retreat,

57
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,670
做一个战士瑜伽式的时候摔倒了
and she fell out of a warrior pose,

58
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,860
摔坏了屁股
and she broke her hip.

59
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,430
我们能不能考虑一下
Should we consider the possibility

60
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,370
可能是有人推倒了她呢
that someone pushed her?

61
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,710
小卡  拜托
Cam, please.

62
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,340
他们不过是一群爱好和平的嬉皮士
They were a bunch of peace-loving hippies

63
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,210
跟我母亲在雨林里共度了两个星期
who spent two weeks in the rainforest with my mother.

64
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,230
肯定是有人推她的
Of course someone pushed her.

65
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,010
她不来其实还让我松了一口气
I'm actually relieved she's not coming.

66
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,040
这样我的婚礼就不会出状况
She's given me the gift

67
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,320
算是她送的大礼
of a crazy-free wedding.

68
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
我知道  我只是有点同情你
I know. I was just a little sad for you.

69
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,220
老妈爽约了
Mom's a no-show,

70
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,100
你和老爸又几乎不说话
and you and dad are hardly even speaking.

71
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,370
别再说老爸的事了
Enough about Dad.

72
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,250
他不能理解同性恋婚礼
He doesn't get gay weddings,

73
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,360
我也不理解运动服竟然可以当便装穿
and I don't get track suits as casualwear.

74
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,570
我们能聊点开心的事吗
Can we please talk about something happy,

75
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,650
比如我即将去墨西哥度蜜月
like my honeymoon in Mexico?

76
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,280
对了  你最好看一下天气频道
Oh, yeah, you're gonna want to take a look at the weather channel.

77
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,200
你真幽默
Hilarious.

78
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,710
爱你
Love you.

79
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,700
我也爱你
Love you, too.

80
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,660
你今天会去拿礼物吧
You're gonna get the gift today, right?

81
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,850
我们不是有很多时间做这事吗
Don't we have a year to do that?

82
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,780
不  我有个老公要做这件事
No, I have a husband to do that.

83
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,440
他们看上了
They fell in love with

84
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,380
一个独特的绿松石色意式玻璃碗
this very specific turquoise Italian glass bowl.

85
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,070
我到处找  才终于找到一个
I looked everywhere, finally found one,

86
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,590
我们必须带着那个去参加婚礼 
and we're not going to that wedding without it.

87
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,390
等等  我以为你会带我去看眼科医生
Wait. I-I thought you were taking me to the eye doctor.

88
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,990
他们说我不可以自己开车回家
They said I'm not supposed to drive myself home.

89
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,970
不不不
No, no, no, no.

90
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,830
我要把卢克从荒野探险那里接回来
I'm picking up Luke from his wilderness trip.

91
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,020
艾丽克斯会载你去
Alex can take you.

92
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,860
真失望
That's a bummer.

93
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
老爸  我深受感动
Aww, dad, I'm touched.

94
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,340
不  不是说你  我只是宁愿去接卢克
No, not because of you. I'd just rather pick up Luke.

95
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,150
也不要去看眼科医生
Than go to the eye doctor.

96
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,130
我  我喜欢跟你在一起
I-I love spending time with you.

97
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,580
别担心  你很有趣
Don't worry -- you're fun.

98
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,440
我老爸从来不承认
My dad would never admit this,

99
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,230
但当他想找乐子的时候
but when he wants fun,

100
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,770
他就直接去找卢克
he goes straight to Luke.

101
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,090
他们之间有种奇怪的默契
They have a weird connection.

102
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,700
就像蝙蝠侠和罗宾
They're like Batman and Robin.

103
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,210
老爸和我则更像蝙蝠侠
Dad and I are more like

104
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,270
和鲁思・金斯伯格[美国大法官]
Batman and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

105
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,020
乖女儿  别那样
Honey, don't be like that.

106
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,450
你真的非常有趣
You're super fun!

107
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,550
你确定我不能去接卢克吗
You sure I can't get Luke?

108
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,290
我听到了
I heard that!

109
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,520
我们走吧
Let's do this!

110
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,040
你好
Hello.

111
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,280
老妈  歌洛莉亚想问你
Hey, mom. Gloria wants to know

112
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,670
她能不能在我和小卡的妈妈之后
if she can do your hair and makeup last

113
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,110
再帮你做头发和化妆
after me and Cam's mom.

114
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,510
她说没事
It's fine.

115
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,930
还有关于卢克的事情  我没兴趣听了
Something about Luke -- I've lost interest.

116
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,650
好的  爱你  再见
Okay, love you. Bye!

117
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,050
天啊  这是我喝过最棒的咖啡了
Damn, this is the best cup of coffee I ever had.

118
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,890
曼尼每周五晚都亲手烘培咖啡豆
Manny roasts his own beans every friday night.

119
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,370
那孩子会需要自撸"小豆豆"很多年的
That kid's gonna be roasting his own beans for a long time,

120
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,430
你懂我的意思吧
if you know what I mean.

121
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,440
我要再次感谢你们让我们住在这里
Can I just say thank you again for letting us stay here?

122
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,870
那一大袋鹿肉已经充分表达了你的谢意
You have thanked us enough with that big bag of deer meat.

123
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,780
妈
Hey, mom.

124
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
你能看到这个吗
Can you see this?

125
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,520
什么痘痘
What pimple?

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,330
我就知道
I knew it.

127
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,680
我不能这副模样去婚礼
I can't go looking like this.

128
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,290
婚礼上有很多姑娘的
Weddings are where you meet girls.

129
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,570
这场婚礼上没有
Not at this one.

130
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,460
-我们还是走吧  -没错
- Well, we better be going. - Yeah.

131
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,130
好好享受水疗
Have a great spa day.

132
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,570
男人才不做水疗
Men don't have spa days.

133
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,260
我们要去俱乐部里  蒸蒸桑拿
We're just going to the club, taking a steam,

134
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,830
按摩按摩
having a couple of rubdowns.

135
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,940
那地方提供黄瓜水吗
Do they serve cucumber water at that place?

136
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,380
他们有时候会做草莓罗勒汁
Sometimes they do a strawberry-basil mix.

137
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,320
-莫尔  -何事  女士
- Merle? - Yes, ma'am?

138
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,860
准时回来我给你系领带
Be back in time for me to do your tie.

139
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,950
好的  女士
Uh, yes, ma'am.

140
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,670
我很抱歉让你看到这个
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

141
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,470
看到什么
See what?

142
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,490
我们刚刚那样训斥了对方
The way we just snapped at each other.

143
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
你在开玩笑吗
Are you joking?

144
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,970
显然  莫尔和我正在闹矛盾
Obviously, Merle and I are going through a heck of a rough patch.

145
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,130
如果我那么友善地跟杰说话
If I talked to Jay that nice,

146
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,900
他会以为我对他不忠呢
he would think I'm cheating on him.

147
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,240
普太太
Mrs. P...

148
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
我预约的出租车没有来
...my darn taxi never came.

149
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,340
我要错过我的航班了
I'm gonna miss my flight.

150
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,160
不是吧
No.

151
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,770
我只是
I just --

152
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,050
现在碰到这状况真烦
I don't want to deal with this right now

153
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,020
我本来已经很害怕坐飞机了
'cause I'm already so scared of flying.

154
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,180
我讨厌关于坐飞机的一切
I just hate everything about it --

155
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,420
除了飞机上的食物
Except for the food.

156
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,330
不知道在那么小一间厨房里是怎么做出
I don't understand how they get such bold flavors

157
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,480
那么丰盛香浓的食物的
out of that tiny kitchen.

158
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,710
海莉  你能开车载安迪去机场吗
Haley, can you drive Andy to the airport, please?

159
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,920
她不想载我去啦
She doesn't want to do that.

160
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,540
你懂我
Aww, you get me.

161
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,390
海莉
Haley.

162
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,460
我没车  是别人载我过来的
I don't have a car. I got dropped off.

163
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,240
我想我们可以开我的车
I guess we can take my car.

164
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,370
就这么定了  去吧
That's settled. Go.

165
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,280
好吧
Fine.

166
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,340
好了
Okay.

167
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,340
我们真的得赶紧
We really need to hurry.

168
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,820
别紧张  我们会按时赶到的
Relax. We'll get there.

169
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,720
你只需担心
You just worry about

170
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,190
被困在离地三万英尺的
being strapped in a giant metal tube

171
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,670
巨大金属管子里
30,000 feet in the air.

172
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,550
没错  我听到了
That's right -- I heard.

173
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,330
-喂  -干什么
- Hey. - What?

174
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,450
我刚想到一件事
I just thought of something.

175
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,320
我的头发今天会怎么样
What's going on with my hair today?

176
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,780
爸爸会把你的头发盘起来插上花朵
Daddy's going to do it up really pretty with flowers.

177
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
不是你吧
Not you, right?

178
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,570
不  是另一个爸爸
No, other daddy.

179
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,690
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

180
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,410
米奇尔  这不是我的礼服
Mitchell, this is not my tuxedo!

181
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,680
他们给错了
They gave me the wrong order!

182
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,370
那紫红色的礼裙都没让你看出来吗
And the fuchsia gown didn't tip you off?

183
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,440
我有九件这种颜色的衬衫
I have like nine shirts this color.

184
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,470
我现在穿的衬衫就是这颜色的
I'm wearing a shirt this color.

185
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,870
好了  深呼吸  深呼吸
Okay, deep breaths. Deep breaths.

186
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,750
我们有足够时间去干洗店
We have plenty of time to go to the dry-cleaner.

187
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,360
我们知道今天会有磨难
We knew that there would be a bump today,

188
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,210
这就是  我们要早点办好
and here it is. We're getting it done early.

189
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,310
这是我们的磨难
This is our bump.

190
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,550
干洗店
每周七天开放

191
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,180
店主家里有事
暂停营业

192
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,240
好吧  这才是我们的磨难
Okay, okay, so this is our bump.

193
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,220
我应付不来了
I can't handle this.

194
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,980
我们五小时后就要结婚了
We're getting married in five hours,

195
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,790
而我没有精心裁剪的礼服
I don't have my perfectly tailored tux.

196
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,200
我不能去买一件现成的
I can't just go buy something off the rack.

197
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,780
我又不是超模辛迪・克劳馥
I'm not Cindy Crawford.

198
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,720
为什么把自己比作女人
Why a woman?

199
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,640
我只是好奇
I'm just wondering.

200
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,610
我们要怎么办
What are we gonna do?

201
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,670
我们可以吃东西啊
We could eat.

202
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,130
我们需要和店主取得联系
We just need to get in touch with the owner.

203
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,670
你知道他的名字  对吧
Y-you, uh, you know his name, right?

204
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,950
是阿齐兹什么的
It's...Aziz something? .

205
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,800
不  是阿米尔
Oh, oh it's -- it's -- uh, no, it's A-Amir.

206
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,330
不是阿米尔  不是
It's -- it's not amir, no.

207
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,800
是阿玛德
Oh, no, it's, uh, Ahmad.

208
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,480
是艾哈迈德
It's Achmed.

209
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,610
收据上有写
No. Oh, it's on the ticket.

210
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,870
我现在觉得自己种族歧视
Now I'm just feeling racist.

211
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,070
-是什么  -在这里
- What is it? - Here it is.

212
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,850
-是  -杰瑞
- It's... - Jerry.

213
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,720
-好吧  杰瑞  -阿马里
- J-- oh, Jerry. - Amari.

214
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,770
杰瑞・阿马里
Jerry Amari.

215
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,980
知道了
There you go.

216
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,550
在这里看得清楚些了吗
Can you see better in here?

217
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,070
好一点  但眼药水的效果还在
A little, but those drops are really hanging on.

218
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,730
我就像是从爆炸现场走出来的韩・索罗
I'm like Han Solo right when he came out of the carbonite.

219
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,240
真的吗  你没点反应
Really? Nothing?

220
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,410
我知道  是《星际迷航》
I get it. It's "Star Trek."

221
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,540
你简直伤透我的心了
You're breaking my heart.

222
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,950
在卢克面前说吧  他会很喜欢的
Save it for Luke. He'll love that.

223
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,140
我们能不能买完礼物就走啊
Can we just get the gift and get out of here?

224
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,340
好  但是先办重要的事
Right, but first things first.

225
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,400
我们来戴滑稽的帽子
Let's put on some funny hats,

226
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,340
然后装成没戴的样子
act like they're not there,

227
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,010
然后严肃地走来走去
and then walk around all serious.

228
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,270
这有什么意义
What's the point of this?

229
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,760
很好  你很严肃
That's good. You're nailing it.

230
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,120
喂  亲爱的
Hey, honey.

231
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,300
眼科检查怎么样
How was the eye exam?

232
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,880
超棒
Great.

233
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,590
我都看不清了
I can barely see.

234
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,790
我戴着一副超大的墨镜和很娘的帽子
I'm wearing giant sunglasses and a girly hat.

235
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,170
艾丽克斯和我玩得很开心
Alex and I are having a blast.

236
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,440
但你取到礼物了吧
But you got the gift, right?

237
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,440
[双关: gift还有"天赋"的意思]

238
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,740
人们都是那样夸我的
That's what people tell me.

239
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,010
亲爱的  我是说碗
Honey, the bowl.

240
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,060
我拿到碗了
I have the bowl.

241
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,050
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

242
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,380
我们回家见
I'll -- I'll see you at home.

243
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
我有个想法
Hey, here's a thought --

244
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,790
既然你告诉妈妈你拿到了碗
Now that you told mom you got the bowl,

245
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,070
不如我们真的去取吧
how about we actually go get it?

246
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,420
好  别再闹着玩了
Yes, no more fooling around.

247
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,510
我们去买碗
Let's go get the bowl.

248
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,460
先让我们搞清楚睡眠指数吧
Oh, right after we find out our sleep number.

249
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,060
我儿子来了
There's my guy.

250
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,760
我还以为是我爸爸来接我
I thought dad was picking me up.

251
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,310
我也好想你
Oh. I missed you, too.

252
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,180
来吧
Come here.

253
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,020
你玩得开心吗
So, did you have fun?

254
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,920
是的
Yeah.

255
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,110
你最喜欢哪部分
What was your favorite thing?

256
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,200
我不记得了
I don't remember.

257
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,150
就是昨天的事
It was yesterday.

258
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,650
热狗  现在能走了吗
Hot dogs. Can we go now?

259
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,310
亲爱的  你要提前离开我真心抱歉
Honey, I feel bad that you have to leave early.

260
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,550
你今天错过了什么
What are you missing today?

261
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,670
划船
Boating.

262
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,130
还有时间去玩一玩嘛
Well, I mean, we have a little time.

263
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,790
你不介意在车里等着吗
You don't mind waiting in the car?

264
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,670
小卡告诉我  你和米奇起了点争执
So, Cam tells me you and Mitch had a little dust-up.

265
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,530
是啊
Yeah.

266
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,250
几周前
A couple of weeks ago.

267
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,280
那孩子会记仇
That kid can hold a grudge.

268
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,330
你去参加婚礼有点不爽吧
A little uncomfortable about that wedding, are you?

269
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,050
你知道我的感受  对吧
Well, you know what I'm feeling, right?

270
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,540
我觉得我在这问题上更为开明
I'd like to think I've evolved on the subject.

271
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,120
我们池塘里有一对同性恋天鹅
We got a couple of lesbo swans in the pond.

272
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,700
它们好像很快乐
They seem pretty happy.

273
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,640
杰
Hey, Jay.

274
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
霍华德  拉里
Hey, Howard, Larry.

275
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,150
这是我的...
This is my, uh...

276
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,490
这是我朋友莫尔  他从密苏里州过来玩
This is my friend Merle, and he's visiting from Missouri.

277
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,710
是那个"眼见为信”的州啊[拿给我看]
Ooh, the "Show me" state.

278
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,710
[密苏里州有个别名叫"Show-me State"]

279
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,180
别在这里说啊
Don't say that in here!

280
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,290
你怎么到这里来了  莫尔
So, what brings you to town, Merle?

281
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,800
我的...  我们的...
Well, uh, my -- our --

282
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,680
杰和我的孩子今天要结婚了
Jay's and my...kids are getting married today.

283
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,400
恭喜
Congratulations.

284
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,540
真是太棒了
Isn't that nice?

285
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,450
新娘和新郎的父亲
Father of the bride, father of the groom

286
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,510
在结婚当天一起蒸桑拿
taking a steam together the day of the wedding.

287
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,790
是这样
Yeah, something like that.

288
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,510
我儿子结婚的那天  轻松愉快
The day my son got married -- piece of cake.

289
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,050
但当我送走我小女儿时
But the day I lost my little girl --

290
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,160
真是让我伤心死了
Ohh, that wrecked me.

291
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,620
今天你们谁要经历这种痛苦啊
So, which one of you has to suffer through that today?

292
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,330
知道吗  这里太热了
You know what? It's too hot in here.

293
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,240
-是啊  -我们走吧
- Yeah. - Let's go.

294
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,530
你真开明
Mm-hmm. Real evolved.

295
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,150
你的天鹅会为你感到羞耻的
Your swans would be ashamed.

296
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,360
帕梅隆搬走后  我才第一次发现
Well, I guess I first noticed it after Pameron moved out,

297
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,730
莫尔和我开始
and Merle and I just started

298
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,680
出口伤人
sniping at each other.

299
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,780
像今天早上那场唇枪舌剑一样吗
Yeah, like that bloodbath this morning?

300
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,350
我再次道歉
Ohh. Again, I am so sorry.

301
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,470
但你没法和莫尔心平气和谈事情
But Merle is not the type you can talk to about things.

302
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,740
我们结婚期间  他嘴里一直
I mean, the man's had a toothpick in his mouth

303
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,110
叼着一根牙签  我什么也不能说
our whole marriage, and I can't say a word.

304
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,930
你不能压抑感情
No, you can't sit on your feelings.

305
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,370
这样会爆发的
You will explode!

306
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,590
我每天都会小爆发十次
I have, like, 10 little explosions every day,

307
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,270
这样就不会大爆发
so I don't have the big one.

308
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,810
我家族里的女人
The women in my family --

309
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,760
有时候会对着丈夫开枪
sometimes, they shoot their husbands.

310
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,790
我们愉快地相处了48年
Well, we've had 48...good years.

311
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,120
我想我们没时间了
I...guess we're just gonna run out the clock.

312
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,030
不会
No!

313
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,890
你还是...
You're still...

314
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,510
你还有...
You have...

315
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,260
这态度不好
That is bad attitude!

316
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,230
你必须告诉莫尔你烦恼的事
You have to tell Merle what is bothering you.

317
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,190
他一点也不想听
Oh, he doesn't want to hear all that.

318
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,750
他完全听不进去意见
He gets all closed off and macho.

319
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,000
你在挠我的脚趾
You're ticklin' my piggies.

320
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,190
你会习惯的
You get used to that.

321
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,390
真遗憾米奇尔的母亲不能来参加婚礼
It's a shame Mitchell's mother couldn't make it to the wedding.

322
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,370
对谁来说遗憾
For who?

323
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,720
你们关系还那么紧张吗
Mm, things still rough between the two of you?

324
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,950
莫尔  我们关系一直不好
Merle, things have always been rough.

325
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,440
那女人永远都在抱怨
That woman never stopped complaining.

326
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,200
鼓足勇气离开迪迪是我做过的
Finding the strength to leave Dede is the hardest thing I ever did,

327
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,830
最艰难却也最正确的决定
but the best decision I ever made.

328
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,890
能娶到歌洛莉亚是你的福气
Well, you sure made a score with that Gloria.

329
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,330
绝对的
Big-time.

330
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,500
我打赌
I bet you landed her

331
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,530
你拿下她之前没给她看过你的臭脚丫
before she got a gander at those hooves of yours.

332
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,810
顺便说一句  不用谢
You're welcome, by the way.

333
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,190
你准备在犹他做点什么
So, what are you gonna do in Utah?

334
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,680
我和我女朋友
Well, me and my girlfriend

335
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,370
很长时间没见面了
haven't seen each other in a while,

336
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,830
所以我们会像两只兔宝宝一样
So we're gonna be like a couple of bunny rabbits...

337
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,790
到哪都粘在一起
just hopping all over town.

338
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
这是她吗
Is this her?

339
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,860
对  我的贝丝
Yep, that's my Beth.

340
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,770
她很漂亮
Huh. She's pretty.

341
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,330
没错 她是我的女神  内外兼修
Yeah. She's the most beautiful creature, inside and out.

342
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,000
爱上她是我的幸运
I'm just the luckiest guy ever to get to love her.

343
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,680
好吧  她也许是真实存在的
Okay, she may be real,

344
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,740
但你太假了
but no way you are.

345
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,750
谁会说那种话
Who talks like that?

346
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,560
我不喜欢你这样说话
You know, I hate when you say things like that

347
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,000
因为你风趣  又漂亮
because you are funny, and you are pretty,

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,860
你也很聪明  有你自己的方式
and you are smart and in an original way,

349
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,740
为什么不能有人觉得爱上你是一种幸运呢
so why shouldn't a guy feel lucky to love you?

350
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,730
闭嘴  别调戏姐
Shut up. Be normal.

351
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,690
-我手机振了  能帮我看看吗  -好
- Hey, my phone just buzzed. Can you read it? - Yeah.

352
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,410
我不想边开车边看手机
I don't want to put our lives at risk.

353
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,370
是航空公司发来的
It's, uh, it's from the airline.

354
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,280
你的航班延误三个小时
Your flight's delayed three hours.

355
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,830
-三个小时  -是啊
- Three hours?! - Yeah.

356
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,940
怎么会这样
Ohh! Jinkies!

357
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,470
要不你找个咖啡厅把我放下
I guess we can just drop me off at a coffee shop,

358
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,970
我到时自己打车过去
and I can take a cab from there.

359
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,850
好
Okay.

360
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,610
事实上  我有点困
Actually, I really need to wake up.

361
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,720
不介意的话  我们可以一起喝杯咖啡
Maybe I'll grab a coffee with you, if you don't mind.

362
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
当然
Please.

363
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,710
和别人聊聊天
The more I talk to people,

364
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,760
我才比较不容易想象自己的飞机
the less I imagine plummeting to my death

365
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,310
在尖叫和哭喊声中坠毁
in a fiery spiral of screaming and crying.

366
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,930
这不像刚用了卡通人物口头禅的人说的话
Pretty dark for someone who just said "Jinkies."

367
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,550
看起来我们
Well, I guess we have

368
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,790
对"紧急情况"的定义是不一样的
different definitions of "Emergency," then.

369
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,940
我必须要说
You know, I'm just gonna say it --

370
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,130
警察局接线员的态度不怎么好
911 dispatchers have a little bit of attitude.

371
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,940
因为你要求他们派特警过来
Well, you requested a S.W.A.T. Team.

372
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,310
还有谁肚子饿吗
Is anybody else hungry?

373
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,680
米奇尔  米奇尔
Mitchell! Mitchell!

374
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
加急包裹投放

375
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,890
看我找到什么了
Look at this.

376
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,900
你觉得你能钻进去吗
Do you think you could fit in there?

377
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,030
我不会那么做的
I'm not doing that.

378
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,650
那婚礼上我要穿什么 
Then what am I gonna wear to our wedding --

379
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,820
难道穿我的黑色葬礼服吗
My black funeral suit?

380
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,200
你想给婚礼定那种基调吗
Is that the tone you want to set?

381
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,530
你只穿去过一个葬礼
You wore it to one funeral.

382
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,060
而且你和毕・亚瑟[演员]又不认识
And you didn't even know Bea Arthur.

383
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,360
-我觉得我认识  -我知道
- I felt like I did. - I know.

384
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
是胡娇  他会知道该怎么做
It's Pepper. He'll know what to do.

385
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,930
喂  胡娇  出大事了
Yes. Pepper. Disaster.

386
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,270
不是什么大问题  只是山火罢了
It's not a disaster. It's just a wildfire.

387
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,890
而且我很确定不会烧到你们的婚礼
And it's most certainly not going to burn down your wedding.

388
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,980
-什么  -什么
- What?! - What?

389
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,660
会场旁边有山火
There's a wildfire near the venue.

390
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,610
不是吧
No!

391
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,770
是着火了  不过你放心
Yes, but it's fine.

392
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,320
罗纳多会群发短信通知宾客
Ronaldo is going to text-blast the guest list,

393
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,370
婚礼从5点提前到1点开始
tell them the wedding is being moved from 5:00 to 1:00.

394
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,520
上帝啊
Oh, my god!

395
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,830
别紧张
Don't panic.

396
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,140
有人能把那个该死的瀑布关上吗
Would somebody please turn off that wretched waterfall?!

397
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,200
立即关掉瀑布
Kill the waterfall immediately!

398
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,870
28%的山火已经被扑灭了
The fire is already 28% contained.

399
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,030
听起来不太多
That doesn't sound like a lot.

400
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,530
打扮好自己就行了
Just get dressed and look pretty.

401
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,050
我一个小时后派车去接你们
I'm going to send the car for you in one hour.

402
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,150
你疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?!

403
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,490
滚  你真让我恶心
Go! You disgust me!

404
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,350
滚
Go!

405
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,210
好了
Okay.

406
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,470
我们现在怎么办
Now what are we gonna do?

407
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,700
我猜也许
No, I guess maybe --

408
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,960
不  小卡  我不可能钻得进去
No, th-- Cam, there's no way I could fit through there.

409
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,060
我被你们两个烦死了
You two exhaust me.

410
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,080
什么
What?

411
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,930
我们一个小时后就得到
We have to be there in an hour!

412
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,820
我不能就这么去
I can't go like this!

413
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,930
瞧我什么样儿啊
Look at me!

414
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,640
我讨厌你
I hate you.

415
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,790
准备享用你人生中最美味的汉堡吧
Prepare yourself for the best burger of your life.

416
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,430
我们得走了
We got to go.

417
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,660
也许我们该再试几顶帽子
Maybe we should try on more hats.

418
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,820
你觉得我们还有时间吗
Do you think we have time?

419
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,170
坏了
It's not working!

420
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,910
没有桨吗
And there's no oar?

421
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,820
我们现在真的是进退两难了
We are literally up a creek without a paddle?

422
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,030
莉莉  莉莉
Okay, Lily, Lily!

423
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,480
你要按绿色的按钮让它启动
Okay, you're gonna press the green button to start it,

424
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,980
然后找到9-1-3号
and then you're gonna look for number 9-1-3.

425
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,970
然后当它经过你旁边时
And then, when you see it go by,

426
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,390
按红色的按钮让它停止  懂了吗
you press the red button to stop it, okay?

427
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,650
好了
Okay.

428
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,110
真高兴你在这
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

429
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,950
每次陷于这种境地我就急得发疯
I get us into these situations, and I freak,

430
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,520
然后你总能解决问题
and then you always fix the problem.

431
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,090
我们每个人都有自己的天赋
Well, now, we each have our own gifts.

432
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,980
只是我比较容易
It's just it's easier for me

433
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
在这种情况下保持冷静
to stay calm in the face of --

434
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,580
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, oh!

435
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,750
-莉莉  爸爸们来了  -天啊
- Lily, Daddies coming for you! - Oh, my god!

436
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,320
现在  莉莉  按红色按钮
Okay, now, Lily, press the red button!

437
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,780
我要打碎玻璃
I'm breaking the window!

438
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,800
放下它
Put that down!

439
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,060
谢天谢地你来了
Thank god you're here.

440
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,520
你们要闯进我的店吗
Are you breaking into my store?

441
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,070
不是
Uh, no.

442
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,420
你怎么会那么想
Why would you even say that?

443
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,090
我的警报响了
My alarm went off.

444
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,840
好吧  那是个巧合
Oh, well, okay, that is a coincidence

445
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
因为他的礼服在里面
Because his tuxedo is in there,

446
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,190
而且我们一个小时后就要举行婚礼
and we're getting married in an hour.

447
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,070
你简直是大救星
You are totally saving us.

448
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,660
我在这种情况下通常急得发疯
You know, I freak out at situations like this,

449
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,440
于是他不得不出来解决问题
which forces him to fix the problem,

450
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,150
-你懂吧  -我懂  我懂
- You know? - I do. I do.

451
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,410
我在这里急得发疯了
So, I'm over here, freaking out,

452
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,480
而他在别的地方解决问题
while he's somewhere else, fixing the problem.

453
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,900
天啊  我很抱歉
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

454
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,170
也许那是好事  你知道
Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know --

455
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,190
两个人要互补
the yin, the yang?

456
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,330
随便你怎么说吧  杰瑞
Yeah, whatever, Jerry.

457
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,010
她从哪来的
Where'd she come from?

458
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,770
就因为她长得不像我们吗
Oh, oh, because she doesn't look like us?

459
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,630
-你这样歧视很过分  -杰瑞
- That's offensive. - Oh, Jerry.

460
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,610
我们怎么办
What are we going to do?

461
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,910
我知道怎么排到前面去
I know how to get up there.

462
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,010
-我看不见  -跟着我走
- I'm blind. - Follow me.

463
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,540
-我才不干  -艾丽克斯
- Oh, I'm not doing that. - Alex!

464
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,680
不好意思  谁能告诉我在哪排队吗
Excuse me, could someone help me to find the back of the line?

465
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,060
不不  你到前面来吧
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

466
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
-就排这里吧  -真的可以吗
- Go right here.  - Are you sure?

467
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,540
有什么可以帮您
Can I help you?

468
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,720
我来取邓菲订的东西
Yes, picking up for Dunphy.

469
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,370
我叫人帮我留货了
It's on hold, I believe.

470
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,930
天气不错  我听说
Beautiful day, huh? I was told.

471
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,530
拿来了  信用卡支付吗
Here we go. Credit card?

472
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,660
我想确认一下  是绿松石色的吧
Uh, just to be sure -- that is turquoise, right?

473
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,950
因为我太太说这碗还有翠绿色的
Because my wife said it also comes in emerald.

474
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,370
没错  先生  您后面队很长
Yes. Sir, it's a very long line.

475
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,960
好吧  能给我摸一下吗
Okay. Um, can I have it for one second?

476
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,150
谢谢
Thank you.

477
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,880
但这感觉不像是绿松石色
Yep, that doesn't feel like turquoise.

478
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,540
你可以感觉出颜色吗  开什么玩笑
You can feel color? You got to be kidding me.

479
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,360
当你失去一种感官功能
When you lose one sense,

480
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,740
其他的感官功能就会变得异常敏锐
all your other senses become heightened.

481
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,650
所以我感觉你说话声很大  且充满鄙夷
That's why you sound so loud and judge-y to me.

482
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,830
我的错  先生
My mistake, sir.

483
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,730
-我马上就回  -好的
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

484
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,810
好了
Here it is.

485
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,610
嘿  他在耍盲人呢
Hey, he's messing with the blind guy.

486
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,120
谢谢你  不管你站在哪儿
Thank you -- wherever you are.

487
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,700
我觉得他并非真的瞎了
I don't think he's really blind.

488
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,590
打断一下
Excuse me.

489
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,790
我父亲去洪都拉斯执行人道主义任务时
My father suffered methanol poisoning

490
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,840
遭遇了甲醛中毒事故
on a humanitarian mission in Honduras

491
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,150
造成永久性的神经功能障碍
resulting in permanent neurological dysfunction

492
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,830
和无法治愈的失明
and irreversible blindness.

493
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,140
这对我们家人已经够难以承受的了
It's been hard enough on our family

494
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,040
但你这种人却使情况变得更糟
without people like you making it worse.

495
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,190
如果他感觉这不是我们要的碗
If he feels it's not the bowl,

496
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,980
那就不是
it's not the bowl.

497
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,400
对不起
I'm so sorry.

498
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,900
我去看看绿松石颜色的
I'll check on the turquoise.

499
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,630
好吧  竟然挺有趣的
Okay, that was kind of fun.

500
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,550
我现在就在对你眨眼呢
I'm winking at you right now.

501
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,430
这办法不管用
Ohh, this is not working.

502
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,340
我们永远不可能准时赶到那里的
We are never gonna get there on time,

503
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,320
我可是"伴人"
and I am the best person.

504
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,500
天啊
Oh, god!

505
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,980
我觉得我刚刚在乌龟背上刮断了指甲
I think I just broke a nail on a turtle.

506
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,060
是你非要来这里的
You're the one who wanted to come out here.

507
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,150
是的  没错
Yes, I did,

508
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,630
因为我想跟我儿子共度一些时光
because I wanted to spend some time with my son.

509
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,110
你现在...
You've --

510
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,750
你最近一直疏远我
You've been pushing me away so much lately,

511
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,530
我不希望你长大了变成那种
And I don't want you to grow up to be the kind of kid

512
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,760
不在乎妈妈来不来参加自己婚礼的孩子
who doesn't care if his mom shows up at his wedding.

513
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,070
你在胡说些什么呢
What are you talking about?

514
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,760
外婆今天不来  米奇尔觉得松了一口气
Nana isn't coming today, and Mitchell's relieved.

515
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,060
如果你错过了我的婚礼  我会很难过的
I'd be really sad if you missed my wedding.

516
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,330
真的吗  你保证
Really? You promise?

517
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,410
绝对的  凯特也是
Totally. And so would Kate.

518
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,140
凯特是谁
Who's Kate?

519
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,950
凯特・阿普顿  我妻子  你儿媳
Upton -- my wife, your daughter-in-law.

520
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,130
信息跟上一点啊
Get on board.

521
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,910
拜托
Come on.

522
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,430
你最近是什么情况啊
Then what has been going on with you recently?

523
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,940
总是闷闷不乐的
You've been so moody.

524
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,270
对不起  但我真的很讨厌每天去学校
I'm sorry, but I'm sick of going school

525
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,300
都听老师说
and hearing teachers say,

526
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,150
"你是艾丽克斯・邓菲的弟弟吗
"You're Alex Dunphy's brother?

527
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
真的假的"  就像我是个蠢货一样
Really?" Like I'm an idiot.

528
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
亲爱的  你才不是蠢货呢
Oh, honey, you're not an idiot.

529
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,490
我竟然忘了带桨
I forgot the paddle

530
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,230
何况我们昨天才学了划船必备物品清单
even though we just learned the boating checklist yesterday.

531
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,820
艾丽克斯肯定不会做出这种事的
Alex would never do that.

532
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,410
就算她做了  可能也会...
And if she did, she'd probably, like --

533
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,480
我也说不清
I don't know --

534
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,270
利用这个钓竿甩出去  把我们拉到岸上
use this fishing rod to cast out and hook us on the shore

535
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,150
因为"我好聪明"
because "I'm so smart."

536
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,800
然后她会把我们拉过去
And then she'd pull us in

537
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,310
因为她无论想出什么办法都能行得通
because everything she does always works.

538
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,180
天啊  真的行得通  很有效
Oh, my god. It's working. It's working!

539
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,570
我想也是  艾丽克斯
Figures. Alex.

540
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,690
别动
Don't move.

541
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,280
这会儿的光线真好
The lighting is really cool right now.

542
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,670
你在搞什么啊  别笑
Wh are you doing? Don't smile.

543
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,980
为什么  这是我的最爱
Why? It's my favorite thing.

544
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,930
不  说真的  严肃一点
No, really, be serious.

545
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,000
看向窗外
Look out the window.

546
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,260
看吧
Look.

547
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,440
这真的是别人为我拍过的最帅的照片
That is honestly the best photo anyone's ever taken of me.

548
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,250
谢谢
Thank you.

549
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,990
你介意我发一张给贝丝吗
You mind if I send a copy to Beth?

550
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,940
安迪  那个...
Andy, um...

551
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,130
我之前读航空公司那条短信时
When I read the text about your flight,

552
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,380
也看到贝丝的短信说让你不要去了
I saw the text from Beth telling you not to come.

553
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,560
她并非真的是那个意思
Yeah, she doesn't mean that.

554
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,350
她说  "我们完了"
She said, "It's over."

555
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,590
那可能有各种不同的意思
That can mean a lot of different things.

556
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,430
你的手机又响了
Your phone's buzzing again.

557
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,450
天啊  婚礼提前了
Oh, my god. The wedding got moved up.

558
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,490
我得走了
I have to go.

559
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
安迪  你确定要登机飞过去吗
Andy, are you sure about getting on that plane?

560
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,990
是啊  我没事
Yeah, yeah. I-I'm fine.

561
