1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,800
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,060
Next time you decide to release my friend's inner ice demon,

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,370
you do it sometime in July.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,800
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,690
When I became Killer Frost,

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,680
Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,940
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,560
and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,750
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,970
Just tell me how you did it.

11
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,420
- I had help. - Help from who?

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,850
A physicist. Her name's Tracy Brand.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,060
I know who you are.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,530
Cecile?

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,750
Most people quit...

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,480
their New Year's resolutions by now.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,030
Central City Marathon is in two months,

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,460
and I gotta shave--ooh!

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,080
I still got half a minute I gotta take off my time.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,950
- You? - A lot more than 30 seconds.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,100
Look, I am going to wait for you...

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,930
at the end of the marathon.

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,840
No, you're not pulling out of this thing.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
I am not as easy with running

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,070
as some other members of my family.

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm gonna let it slide. I'm gonna let it.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,090
- Yeah? - Yeah.

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,770
Are you getting mad?

32
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,520
I would never get mad.

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,630
I love you too much to be mad.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,230
That, I,

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,450
- I didn't really mean to-- - No, absolutely--

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,240
I was looking at you,

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,610
and then it just came out, and I didn't want you

38
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,480
- to feel uncomfortable or-- - I'm sorry. Hold on.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,510
- Sorry. I gotta take this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.

40
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,930
Yeah? Okay. I'm on my way.

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,540
Yeah.

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,480
All right, sorry.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,650
I gotta head out.

44
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,660
Her name is Tracy Brand.

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,010
She's one of the world's top theoretical physicists--

46
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,660
you know, or at least she will be.

47
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,420
No kidding. Girl Scout earns her merit badges.

48
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,180
2021 Nobel Prize, Copley Medal,

49
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,630
presidential commendation.

50
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,370
She's a genius, but what's that to us?

51
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,350
She's the key to stopping Savitar.

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,700
Future me said that four years from now,

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,640
Dr. Brand invents the technology

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,460
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,610
- Four years too late. - Yeah, but if she invents

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,070
the tech then, then maybe she's working on the prototype now.

57
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,910
That's exactly right, so we should find her.

58
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
Agreed.

59
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,870
Sorry.

60
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,110
Why are we not looking for Caitlin again?

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,540
Easy, Romeo and Juliet.

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,060
None of us have forgotten about Caitlin.

63
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,000
Right, but future Flash already confirmed

64
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,900
that she teams up with Savitar.

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,570
We should be doing everything in our power

66
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,710
- to stop that from happening. - We know.

67
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,720
Right, so what is Wally doing

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,550
swanning off to Earth-3 to be with his girlfriend?

69
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,390
He could be here right now looking for her.

70
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,130
It's like no one's doing a thing.

71
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,510
No one's doing a thing?

72
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,600
Barry and Wally searched the city half a dozen times.

73
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,710
No one's doing a thing?

74
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,660
Every chance I get, I try to vibe where she is.

75
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,710
We're using facial recognition technology.

76
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,500
We're using the meta-human app, the satellite.

77
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,660
We're doing everything we can.

78
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,880
I just want her back, okay?

79
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,580
Yeah, well, if you wanted her here so badly,

80
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,090
maybe you shouldn't have ripped off that necklace

81
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,970
- and turned her into a killer. - Okay, okay.

82
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,720
- All right. - Just saying.

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,890
We got a hit.

84
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,260
Tracy Brand,

85
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,560
currently enrolled in CCU's theoretical Physics program.

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,180
So our hopes of defeating an evil speed god hinge

87
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,970
- on a grad student? - Yup.

88
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,820
Could be worse. B.A., Cisco, let's do this.

89
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,360
Let's go.

90
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,330
Ahh, the soul-sucking fluorescence of academia.

91
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,440
Yeah, this is exciting, though.

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
It's like meeting Norbert before he was Einstein.

93
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,550
- Albert. - Norbert Albert?

94
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,950
Do you guys smell that?

95
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,280
Toast?

96
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,050
Holy--

97
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,050
What are you doing?

98
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,910
You mean save you from a painful, fiery death?

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,580
I had it under control.

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,670
- Come on! - Okay! You know what?

101
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,840
Let's put this down

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
while you still have your eyebrows.

103
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,460
Did you set the fire on purpose?

104
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,850
Yes, I'm burning everything.

105
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,190
- W-- ev... - What?

106
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,040
- Everything? What-- - My work.

107
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,550
Well, I don't know why they call it "Work,"

108
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,340
because none of it works.

109
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,810
This isn't exactly what I expected.

110
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,320
- Me neither. - Um, Dr. Brand?

111
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,380
Oh, no. Just Tracy.

112
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,150
I failed my dissertation.

113
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,820
Nothing like ten years down the drain

114
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,180
and a pile of debt as a legacy.

115
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,150
Tracy, uh, w-w-we were just hoping

116
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,720
that you'd have a moment to talk.

117
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
Oh, no. My bus leaves in five minutes.

118
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,090
Oh, please tell me I didn't burn my bus ticket.

119
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, that's hot.

120
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,520
Your bus? Where-- where are you going?

121
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,130
Big Belly Burger. I hear they're hiring.

122
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,890
What? You're seri--

123
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,920
Well, what about all your research?

124
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,490
You mean my "Unsubstantiated and transactional" inquiry

125
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,040
into the "Purely suppositional" nature

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,680
of extra-dimensional energy?

127
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,320
- Yes? - Yeah?

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,760
A waste of time, or, as Dr. Hersh puts it,

129
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,920
"A total misapplication of the university's resources."

130
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,570
I might as well start practicing,

131
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,710
"Do you want fries with that?"

132
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,930
- Yes. - No.

133
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,140
- B.A. - Stop.

134
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,950
Look, don't let the naysayers get you down.

135
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,340
Your doubts, they're traitors.

136
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,260
Don't believe them.

137
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,790
Your mind is too fine to waste turning tubers into finger chips.

138
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,680
Finger... chips?

139
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,310
Finger chips. There's, like, a--

140
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,710
- He's from out of town. - Stop.

141
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,630
Look, look, look. You can't give up.

142
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,680
Your work on relativistic quantum mechanics

143
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,560
and its application to interspatial theory

144
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,660
to manipulate matter on a subatomic level,

145
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,640
it's groundbreaking.

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,610
I haven't shared that hypothesis with anyone,

147
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,010
other than my therapist.

148
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,300
- Who are you? - We're therapists.

149
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,350
Yeah.

150
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,290
Admission here is so easy.

151
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,310
Get her out of here. Go.

152
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,890
So...

153
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,700
you've gone full-on Killer Frost, huh?

154
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,240
New threads and everything.

155
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,410
No more pencil skirts for me.

156
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,110
I don't want to hurt you.

157
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,460
You won't.

158
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,130
But I will hurt her.

159
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,640
Cisco! Hey!

160
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,110
- Hey, you good? - Yeah.

161
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,140
- That's gonna leave a mark. - Come on, come on.

162
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,660
- Caitlin's after Tracy. - Yeah.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,650
That means she's working with Savitar.

165
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,090
That's definitely her, Detective.

166
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,590
Icy eyes and all.

167
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,950
Yup, that's her.

168
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,430
So I'm gonna spread this around

169
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,070
so everyone knows to look for her.

170
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,900
Uh, can you give me one second?

171
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,810
Uh, so if Caitlin wants Tracy dead,

172
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,230
I guess what you saw in the future was true

173
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,640
and she's teamed up with Savitar.

174
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,220
I just didn't think it was gonna happen this soon.

175
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,490
It certainly makes things more complicated.

176
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,100
Makes what more complicated?

177
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,460
T-there was a meta attack at CCU,

178
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,390
and we just don't have much to go off of.

179
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,010
Really? It's a college campus.

180
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,900
- Isn't there video footage? - Uh, no.

181
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,830
It got...erased.

182
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,740
Uh, well, I'm sure you two will figure it out.

183
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,520
Joe, can I, um...

184
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,670
So I'm feeling weird about this morning.

185
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,460
Uh... Look, when I told you

186
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,120
that I loved you, I-I didn't mean to make you feel pressured.

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
No, no, no, no, I-I didn't feel pressured.

188
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,560
Okay. So...we're good?

189
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,960
- We're great. - Great. Okay.

190
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,300
Um, in that case, uh...

191
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,490
good luck with your meta.

192
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,030
Um, so I totally heard that.

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,010
- Do you want to talk? - No.

194
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,110
Hey, where are you going?

195
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,630
Oh, uh, nearest bus stop.

196
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,170
Uh, no, you should stay here,

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,530
um, with Detective West for a little bit.

198
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,200
Why? That sketch artist was like freaking Michelangelo.

199
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,630
- I mean, you've got your woman. - Not yet.

200
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,240
And until we do, you could be in a lot of danger.

202
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,360
You really think Jack Frost's sister wants to kill me?

203
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,180
- I'm no one. - In my experience,

204
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,580
if she's come after you once, she's likely to do it again.

205
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,890
Look, this whole witness overprotection thing

206
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,470
is totally unnecessary.

207
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,030
It was just a random attack.

208
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,940
The bus is coming.

209
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,990
I gotta go.

210
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,920
We need to keep an eye on her.

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,420
Yeah, we do.

212
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,400
She got away.

213
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,090
I told you exactly where she'd be.

214
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,890
Barry and Cisco were there when I arrived.

215
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,290
As I told you they would be.

216
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,870
Maybe there's more Caitlin Snow inside you

217
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,410
than you led me to believe.

218
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,550
Are you saying I let her go on purpose?

219
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,710
Did you?

220
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,560
You call yourself Killer Frost,

221
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,860
but you haven't actually killed anyone yet.

222
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,180
You and I can both be Gods,

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
free of the pain and suffering of man.

224
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,520
All you have to do...

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,490
is kill the girl.

226
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,130
Okay. Look, I might not have any cash.

227
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,530
But I have one of those, um, Jitters cards

228
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,360
that has ten stamps on it,

229
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,170
which means you owe me a free drink.

230
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,360
Okay?

231
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,330
Allow moi to help out a damsel in distress.

232
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,890
I will pay for myself and the lady.

233
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,140
I will have a triple-shot, no-whip mocha Flash,

234
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,510
and anything this young lady desires.

235
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,510
Yeah, I, um--I need to calm down, so a Zoom.

236
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,510
A Zoom?

237
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,300
Never heard of it.

238
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,970
- Oh, it's on the secret menu. - Secret menu?

239
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,150
Triple espresso with a shot of cayenne.

240
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,420
Marry me.

241
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,020
Hey, wait. You were at the college this morning.

242
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,860
No--oh, this morning? Oh, yeah.

243
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,050
No, I remember you now.

244
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,910
Yes, I was. H.R.

245
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,960
Wait, what is it with you people?

246
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,670
Did the CCPD send you to find me?

247
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,610
No, no, no, no. The reason I'm here is...

248
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,050
- my team and I are very interested in your research. - Really?

249
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,270
- Yes. - You're interested in my theories on quantum mechanics?

250
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,110
Your ideas of wave-particle duality,

251
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,800
your quantization of energy,

252
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,020
and your time-symmetric formulation

253
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,260
- of quantum theory and... - How the boundary conditions

254
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,310
lead to principle causality

255
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,100
and the psychological arrow of time.

256
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,270
And the psychological arrow of time.

257
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,820
You really know your stuff.

258
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,090
Well, je suis... smart.

259
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,290
Lay off the French, and lay off the improv too, please.

260
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,570
Just keep her talking.

261
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,800
Ah. Thank you, Mischa.

262
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,700
Please. The Zoom.

263
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,740
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

264
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,840
Let's zoom.

265
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,050
Mate, was it just me,

266
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,070
or did it sound like H.R. was trying to flirt?

267
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,210
Didn't notice.

268
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,090
Listen, the, uh, security footage today from CCU,

269
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,670
the stuff that we wiped to protect Caitlin's identity?

270
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,170
I-I saw it.

271
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,080
As in, I-I saw the two of you squaring off.

272
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,300
Okay.

273
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,900
Well, from the angle that I saw,

274
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,780
it looked like you had a pretty clear shot.

275
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,390
Okay.

276
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,380
You had a clear shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it.

277
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,010
- Why? - Julian, I'm trying to focus

278
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,560
on what we're here to focus on. I suggest you do the same.

279
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,680
Gents, how we doing?

280
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,300
Uh, all good.

281
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,890
I don't know about this one, Bar.

282
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,740
H.R. isn't exactly our best closer.

283
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,110
Ah, he'll be fine.

284
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,270
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

285
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,800
- Just... - Cecile?

286
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,440
She's just-- she caught me off guard.

287
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,030
Just didn't think we were there yet.

288
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,020
Well, obviously she is.

289
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,660
- Are you? - I-I care for her a lot.

290
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,550
It's just with everything going on with Iris and Savitar

291
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,510
and now Caitlin, I just feel like I...

292
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,710
lie to Cecile all the time.

293
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,460
Then maybe you should stop.

294
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,610
You're gonna have to tell her about Wally

295
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,690
and me and all this at some point, right?

296
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,080
So why not now?

297
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,380
Well, just so you know,

298
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,510
you don't have to keep her in the dark for us.

299
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,480
If you love her, you should be honest with her.

300
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,340
At least that's what you'd tell me to do.

301
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,540
Okay, so...

302
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,390
Here's the thing that I could never get them to understand

303
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,350
at the university. See...

304
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,800
I've been studying speedsters.

305
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,160
And so you know how, when they run,

306
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,710
they generate a trail of lightning behind them?

307
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,970
Light--lightning.

308
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,510
I don't think all of that is generated by them running.

309
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,050
- I think... - No?

310
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,090
Some of it comes from somewhere.

311
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,980
Like, it's some sort of a--

312
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,570
like a--hmm.

313
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,810
Speed Force?

314
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,870
Yeah. Wait.

315
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,620
- That is a great term for it. - Well...

316
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,860
- Speed Force. - Thanks.

317
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,080
Anyway, so I've been doing some calculations.

318
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,780
I think there might be a way to manipulate it.

319
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,030
Maybe even...control it.

320
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,090
Maybe even turn it into a prison.

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,690
Maybe. Um, yeah.

322
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,180
Yeah, yeah. I mean... Just a random thought.

323
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,880
How do you think one would accomplish that?

324
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,530
- See, I don't know... - Okay.

325
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,920
Because the university wouldn't fund my research.

326
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,110
Why are you so interested in this?

327
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,580
Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.

328
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,160
I certainly don't think you're a crackpot.

329
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,580
I--

330
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,240
What's wrong?

331
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,030
- We should go. - Wait. What?

332
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,620
I think we should go. Yup.

333
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,990
Guys, guys, we need a little help here!

334
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,760
We got a little trouble here!

335
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,400
Flash?

336
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,000
Where is she?

337
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,180
Right here!

338
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,820
- Her again? - Caitlin! Caitlin, stop!

339
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,140
- Get her out of here! - What? What?

340
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,630
What did I ever do to you?

341
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,500
So what? You're Savitar's lackey now?

342
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,530
More fun to reign in hell and all that.

343
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,050
All right, I'm gonna get her to head back this way.

344
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,900
When she does, you gotta knock her out, okay?

345
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,260
- Okay? - Yeah.

346
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,960
Now, Cisco!

347
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,620
Savitar says I'm not allowed to kill you,

348
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,610
but I can't have you following me around.

349
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,890
It was the left leg last time, right?

350
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,460
Right.

351
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,280
Scar tissue's a lot more sensitive than regular tissue.

352
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,460
This isn't you!

353
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,290
It is now.

354
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,810
Cait! Cait!

355
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,540
This is where the Flashy Flash goes down?

356
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,900
It's not exactly what I imagined, but it's cool.

357
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,470
So I always wondered how you kept the friction

358
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,370
from building up a lethal dose of static charge.

359
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,190
Yeah, that's vulcanized Teflon.

360
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,950
It neutralizes any electron imbalance.

361
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,470
Okay, and the-- the White Witch?

362
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,180
I'm guessing you know why she's after me.

363
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,090
Well, she's teamed up

364
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,620
with an evil speedster from the future,

365
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,340
and apparently you developed the technology to trap him

366
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,060
for an eternity, so...

367
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,400
You can't be serious.

368
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,080
Totally serious.

369
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,100
An evil speedster?

370
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,560
He calls himself Savitar.

371
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,150
Savitar? And he's from the future?

372
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,380
- Yup. - And I build a trap for him?

373
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,490
- Me? - You.

374
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,640
He wants to kill you before you build it.

375
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,740
That's why he's sending Killer Frost after you.

376
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,580
Killer Frost? Her name...is Killer Frost?

377
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,580
- Yeah. - We know it's a lot to take in.

378
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,030
Well, to be fair, you're basically telling me

379
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm Sarah Connor in "Terminator."

380
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,930
- Well... - Uh, more like...

381
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,690
- Miles Dyson. - Yeah,

382
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,480
- but good effort, though. - So wait.

383
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,530
You're telling me my ideas about the, um...

384
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,720
The Speed Force.

385
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,210
Speed Force, being able to control it, manipulate it, all of that...

386
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,930
I'm right?

387
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,010
It appears so.

388
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,380
That's me?

389
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,040
Nobel Prize?

390
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,710
All of that?

391
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,470
In the future, yeah.

392
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,020
Look, Tracy.

393
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,820
We need your help.

394
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,100
We need you to build this trap now.

395
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,510
What happens if I don't build the trap?

396
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,640
Someone very important to us is going to die.

397
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,960
Excuse me.

399
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,810
Uh, I know that, uh,

400
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,120
normally one of you fellas goes out for the chat, but, uh...

401
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,640
I got this one.

402
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,100
Tracy!

403
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,550
Oh, Tracy!

404
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm working.

405
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
I can see.

406
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,230
I thought you'd like to be informed

407
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,550
that H.R. Has managed to talk Tracy around.

408
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,580
Ah, perfect. That means we can get to work.

409
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,460
Yeah, there's one thing I need to know first.

410
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,390
Outside Jitters earlier,

411
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,360
you could've stopped Caitlin with a vibe.

412
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,310
But just like CCU, you didn't.

413
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,810
I'm not doing this again.

414
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,090
No, no, no, no, no.

415
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,200
You are.

416
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,420
I need to know, Cisco.

417
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,570
Tell me why you couldn't do it.

418
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,700
Get out of my way.

419
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,650
Caitlin could be home now.

420
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,650
Had you stopped her, she would be here.

421
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,710
But you didn't! You couldn't!

422
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,440
Tell me why!

423
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,860
Because I'm afraid!

424
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,440
- Afraid of what? - Afraid of killing her!

425
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm walking around with two loaded guns here,

426
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,170
ready to go off.

427
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,370
What if she's hurting Barry or Joe or you

428
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,300
and I have to save you and I can't control my powers

429
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,810
and I end up killing her?

430
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,400
She's my best friend.

431
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,060
And I'd rather it be me than her.

432
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,870
How's Tracy holding up?

433
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,180
Ah, we'll see.

434
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,950
Have you told Cecile about us yet?

435
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,300
Cecile is the only thing... normal I have in my life right now,

436
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,360
and I like having something normal.

437
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,720
If I tell her about all this...

438
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,270
that goes away.

439
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,970
But if you don't tell her...

440
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,990
There may not be an "us."

441
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,030
Joe, there's no such thing as normal.

442
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,630
Love is the only thing that makes the fight worth it,

443
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,170
and it's the only thing that's gonna get us through it.

444
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,280
Guys. Guys, there you are.

445
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,640
We got a big problem.

446
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,380
Tracy's gone.

447
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,120
I checked CCU, her apartment, and Jitter's.

448
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,120
Tracy's not in any of them.

449
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,550
I'll bet you Savitar and Killer Frost

450
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,970
are hunting her down as we speak.

451
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,400
H.R., you were with Tracy last.

452
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,630
- How did she seem? - Rattled, Miss West.

453
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,930
Rattled, but I gave her a rousing and reassuring pep talk,

454
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,110
- so I think she's okay. - Oh, that's why she left.

455
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,160
That's not why--  look, I will have you know

456
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,760
my book on motivational speeches,

457
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,500
"All's Wells that Ends Wells"--

458
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,910
- Tracy is in danger. - You're right.

459
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,480
- Iris! Focus! - What?

460
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,090
- We need to find her. Now. - Yeah, we gotta find her.

461
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,900
Where else could she be?

462
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,630
Why don't we start with her future hologram, right?

463
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,040
That's--  that would give us insight

464
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,980
- into her psyche, no? - Of course, yeah.

465
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,970
- That's pretty good. - Thank you.

466
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,900
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

467
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,780
- She's cute. - This is creepy, right?

468
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,980
Yeah. I find her charming.

469
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,240
Do you think you could screenshot a hologram?

470
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
Go back to that last one.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah, there's another one like it.

472
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,910
- Look at that. Zoom in. - Yeah.

473
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,320
Eppur si...

474
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,780
Eppur si muove.

475
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,590
Tracy, you blessed paramour of science.

476
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,360
Gang, I know exactly where she is.

477
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,910
Eppur si muove.

478
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,920
"And yet it moves."

479
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,540
Galileo's famous statement uttered moments

480
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,440
after being forced to recant his theory that the Earth

481
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,950
revolves around the sun.

482
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,570
"And yet it moves."

483
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,010
Mocha Flash for me.

484
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,280
A Zoom for milady.

485
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,820
Thank you.

486
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,520
You're very welcome.

487
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,450
How did you know I was here?

488
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,240
I might have done a bit of holographic stalktag.

489
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,930
I stalked you holographically.

490
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,320
You mean, in the future,

491
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,510
I'm still obsessed with a 500-year-old Italian polymath?

492
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,440
Yes, it would appear so.

493
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,750
- I'm sorry I ran off. I just... - No.

494
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,930
- Just needed to clear my head - Of course.

495
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,960
and think and... this is where I do it best.

496
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,680
Well, I can see that.

497
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,130
That statue is nothing if not inspiring.

498
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,820
Concrete beard, foreboding, smart.

499
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,940
- Totally inspiring. - Yup.

500
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,960
You know

501
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,300
Galileo's peers thought he was a crackpot too.

502
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,070
- Is that right? - Yeah.

503
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,020
And I used to find that comforting.

504
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,480
But then when your team

505
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,010
showed me the future

506
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,820
and showed me that my crazy ideas

507
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,840
aren't so crazy after all,

508
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,650
I just felt more intimidated than ever.

509
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,550
Well, I can see that.

510
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,990
It's like you're sitting in the shadow of greatness.

511
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,090
- Your own greatness, right? - Exactly!

512
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,810
It's like I've failed so many times.

513
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,510
That's all I know how to do.

514
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,220
I don't know how to be that...

515
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,310
brilliant woman in the hologram.

516
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,150
But you wouldn't understand.

517
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,850
You are a born genius.

518
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,350
Yeah, about that.

519
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,210
I'm not... technically a genius.

520
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,470
That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry I misled you

521
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,980
about me being a genius.

522
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,850
The point is, you...

523
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,310
are...a genius.

524
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,900
You are. I know it. I can--

525
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,260
I can feel it.

526
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,580
It's right there. It's right there,

527
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,980
just brimming just below the surface.

528
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,030
- It is? - Yes, absolutely!

529
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,410
Yes, it is, Tracy.

530
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,330
And you can defeat Savitar.

531
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,590
All you need is to just believe in yourself.

532
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,150
And for what it's worth...

533
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,410
I already do.

534
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,270
- I didn't know you were dropping by. - Yeah, well,

535
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,330
if you had read any of my texts, you'd know.

536
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,850
Yeah.

537
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,810
- I'm sorry. - I know.

538
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,810
It's why I'm here. Look, I--

539
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,760
You know, it doesn't take a detective to see

540
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,510
that something's not right.

541
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,310
Look, Cecile--

542
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,550
Is it because I said, "I love you", this morning?

543
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,610
Because, Joe, it's--it's okay

544
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,490
if you're not ready to say it back.

545
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,580
No, no. It's not about that.

546
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,490
No? Well, then what's going on?

547
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,350
'Cause you've been acting weird all day.

548
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,600
I mean, not just with us this morning

549
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
but at work with that meta case.

550
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,100
You gotta give me something, Joe.

551
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,360
All I can say is...

552
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,830
that part of my life is very complicated.

553
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,090
And if you were to become part of that,

554
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,080
your life would be very complicated,

555
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,350
and it would change us.

556
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,870
And I mean change us forever.

557
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,440
That's not a bad thing, you know.

558
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,630
It's called growth.

559
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,190
And then I was thinking about...

560
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,530
what you said

561
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,470
this morning, and

562
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,160
it told me where you were.

563
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,160
It also showed me where I was, and...

564
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,760
and you add those complications,and

565
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,550
I think we should stop seeing each other.

566
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,830
Really?

567
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,150
That's what you think we should do?

568
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,710
I-I-I think it's the best thing for both of us.

569
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,570
Here I was, thinking that being together

570
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,610
was the best thing for both of us.

571
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,870
I guess I'll...

572
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll see you around the station, Joe.

573
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,640
- Cecile! - Joe!

574
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,470
- No! Guarantee you I'm faster. - Joe!

575
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,280
Caitlin...

576
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,660
we can talk about this.

577
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,650
I'll talk. You listen.

578
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,680
In an hour, you're gonna get a message with an address.

579
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,440
Bring me Tracy Brand, or I will kill your little sweetheart.

580
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,410
Joe.

581
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,430
Wait!

582
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,270
So you're saying that if we don't turn Tracy over to Killer Frost...

583
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,160
She's gonna kill Cecile.

584
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,070
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Tracy is our key

585
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,740
to finding Savitar, right?

586
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,970
Yes, but what are we gonna do?

587
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,240
We gonna just let Killer Frost

588
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,670
live up to her name and kill somebody?

589
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,360
Not if I have anything to say about it.

590
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,690
All I'm saying is,

591
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,380
we need to do whatever it takes to save her.

592
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,950
No one's gonna die, all right?

593
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,020
We're gonna get her back. I promise.

594
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,850
That's them.

595
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,480
They're at the Old Dressler Factory.

596
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,890
Okay, we know where they are. That's something.

597
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,340
So what do we do?

598
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,610
I have a plan.

599
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,290
Cisco, can I have a quick word?

600
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,140
Not now, Julian.

601
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,070
Listen, please, mate.

602
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,520
Just--just hear me out.

603
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,370
I know you're terrified of losing her.

604
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,980
So am I.

605
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,350
I know you're--you're

606
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,160
worried about not being able to control your powers,

607
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,440
but I know you can.

608
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,700
I don't think your abilities have ever come from a place

609
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,360
of--of negativity or--or hate.

610
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,050
They come from somewhere good.

611
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,770
They come from love.

612
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,000
And if you can find it in you to stop her,then

613
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,920
I really think we can save her.

614
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,060
Cheers, mate.

615
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,140
Yeah, you know how I said, you know,

616
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,890
we were gonna keep you safe?

617
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,380
Yeah.

618
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,280
So, um, now I need to ask you to do something dangerous.

619
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,480
Cecile!

620
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,750
Are you all right?

621
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,150
Joe! I'm okay. She didn't hurt me.

622
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,010
That's because killing you... does nothing for me.

623
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,390
Killing you, Tracy? That's everything.

624
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,970
Hand her over.

625
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,260
You don't have to do this.

626
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,750
Yes, I do.

627
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,150
Why?

628
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,480
Because Savitar commands it?

629
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,180
He's not a god.

630
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,050
He's just a man that's using you.

631
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,670
- Come on, you're one of us. - One of us?

632
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,580
- We're family. - We're family?

633
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,330
We protect each other till the end.

634
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,160
How are you doing that?

635
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,660
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

636
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,550
You two are more alike than you realize.

637
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,490
You see, that's how Savitar knows every move

638
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,400
you're going to make.

639
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,510
He's always one step ahead of you,

640
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,250
because this is all history to him.

641
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,660
That's how I know Cisco's in the rafters right now.

642
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,450
Oh, no.

643
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,860
It's over, Caitlin.

644
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,190
Caitlin is dead.

645
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,910
Not to me.

646
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,540
Go. Go. Go. Go.

647
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,360
Caitlin.

648
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,080
You're alive.

649
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,860
I'm sorry.

650
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,020
I had to stop you to save you.

651
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,280
My ascension is nearly at hand, Flash.

652
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,410
As I rise, you will fall.

653
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
How do we keep surviving these things?

654
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,540
Because we're in control of our fates.

655
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,470
And how did she know I was up in the rafters?

656
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,450
Is she psychic now too?

657
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,480
And that thing where you guys were talking

658
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,400
at the same time? How do you think she was doing that?

659
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,430
I don't know. She said Savitar told her what was gonna happen.

660
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,040
No way, man. This wasn't just brushing up on days to come.

661
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,730
This was precise.

662
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,190
Scary precise.

663
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,190
Like Savitar was there.

664
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,290
What I don't understand is why Savitar

665
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,790
wouldn't kill Tracy when he showed up.

666
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,130
I mean, why would he choose to rescue Caitlin?

667
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,510
He needs her for something.

668
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,760
We gotta figure out what that is.

669
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,990
Agreed.

670
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,950
Thanks to Cisco, we now have a sample of her blood

671
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,760
when she was fully mutated as Killer Frost.

672
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,690
This? It could be the key

673
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,810
to reverse engineering a cure, so...

674
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,030
it's good work, mate.

675
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,230
You too.

676
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,680
Oh, there you are.

677
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,890
I brought us some coffee treats.

678
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,160
Unfortunately, we were all out of cayenne.

679
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,460
Careful, that's hot.

680
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,410
Yeah, hot, hot, sorry.

681
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,010
- How are you? Oh! Ha! Whoo! - Careful.

682
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,750
How are you holding up?

683
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,930
Whew, it's hot.

684
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,990
Well, I'm processing.

685
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,790
That was really-- I mean, the voice...

686
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,460
And the "Whoom!"

687
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,880
Killer Frost? Savitar?

688
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,480
You know some people with really scary names.

689
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,300
Eh, but is it too much?

690
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,950
All of us here would understand.

691
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,820
Personally, I just-- I just wanna make sure that,

692
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,510
you know, you don't get hurt.

693
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,520
As a matter of fact, I was thinking--

694
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,110
- I was thinking too. - Yeah?

695
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,520
About Savitar.

696
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,400
The way the light reflects off his suit,

697
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,740
it's unlike any other metallic compound I have ever seen.

698
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,720
Hmm, you and I were thinking about different things.

699
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,810
What do you think it is?

700
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,970
In Fermi liquid theory, any sort of non-Fermi liquid

701
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,070
is called "Strange metal."

702
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,580
It's a theoretical compound capable of dispersing heat

703
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,130
at high temperatures. I think Savitar travels so fast

704
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,660
that he needs that suit to neutralize the charge

705
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,260
he builds up around him.

706
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,020
Huh. Interesting. So without the suit,

707
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,820
he's just a dude with a bad case of static cling.

708
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,700
Yeah. So if we could build a device

709
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,850
capable of harnessing that power,

710
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,790
theoretically, we could use his own velocity against him.

711
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,100
And trap him in the Speed Force.

712
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,280
Tracy, you are indeed a genius.

713
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,720
- I'm getting there. - Well, yes, you are.

714
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,050
That means you're gonna stay and help us.

715
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,340
Is that what that means?

716
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,910
If I do, does that mean the future's changing?

717
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,700
I think it means mine certainly has.

718
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,260
Thanks for seeing me. Come on in.

719
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,560
So how are you doing?

720
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,670
Joe, I'm fine. I just--

721
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,650
you know, I wish that you would've told me

722
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,660
what was going on with you.

723
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,380
Although I...obviously have some idea now.

724
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,980
It was my fault that you got caught up in all this.

725
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,280
I'm so sorry, Cecile.

726
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,320
Joe, me too. Look, I--

727
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,430
When you told me that you loved me this morning...

728
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,940
- I froze. - Yeah.

729
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,300
I knew that it meant that we moved up a level

730
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,730
in our relationship.

731
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,380
And...for me,

732
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,850
that level comes with a lot of baggage.

733
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,310
Like Killer Frost and The Flash?

734
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,470
Yeah.

735
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,260
So you thought that pushing me away was the thing to do?

736
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,480
I thought that I was protecting you.

737
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,310
Clearly I was wrong,

738
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,530
because not only did I lie to you.

739
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,640
I lied to myself.

740
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,210
And you know what?

741
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,560
I'm done with that.

742
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,960
And I'm done with this.

743
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,940
Thank you for not making a big deal about me wearing this.

744
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,310
Cecile Horton...

745
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,070
I love you.

746
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,160
I love you with all my heart.

747
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,200
And I'm sorry that I was dishonest with you.

748
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,300
And from now on,

749
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,420
there will be no secrets between us.

750
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,880
Okay.

751
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,510
I should have told you a long time ago.

752
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,610
But it's not bad.

753
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,270
- Wally! - Hey, Dad.

754
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,030
How was it?

755
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,250
It was--yeah, it was great. Jesse says hi.

756
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,640
- So you talked to Cecile? - I did.

757
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,370
Told her everything.

758
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,780
Told her I love her.

759
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,930
I told her that you were The Flash

760
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,520
and that Wally was Kid Flash.

761
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,350
Don't worry. She promised me...

762
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,540
that she wouldn't tell Joanie.

763
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,620
What changed your mind?

764
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,640
You. All of you.

765
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.

766
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,960
Without it, nothing really matters.

767
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,250
And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?

768
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,700
- How was Earth-3? - Yeah, um,

769
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,610
hanging out with Jesse was awesome.

770
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,350
I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.

771
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,080
Without it, nothing really matters.

772
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,060
And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?

773
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,990
You did this to me, Barry.

774
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,240
- I created you? - I created myself.

775
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,030
You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself,

776
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,460
but he's gonna kill them all.

777
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,940
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

778
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,280
You two are more alike than you realize.

779
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,600
Savitar knows every move you're going to make.

780
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,660
He's always one step ahead of you.

781
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,530
This is all history.

782
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,470
This wasn't just brushing up on days to come.

783
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,820
This was precise.

784
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,030
Like Savitar was there.

785
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,010
Who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?

786
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,170
One step ahead of you.

787
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,930
All history.

788
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,640
I am the future Flash.

789
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,040
One step ahead of you.

790
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,040
Barry!

791
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,170
Are you okay?

792
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,970
Yeah.

793
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,270
Uh, I'm sorry.

794
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,940
I'll be--I'll be right back, all right?

795
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,050
I'm here!

796
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,850
I'm here!

797
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,240
I know who you are.

798
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,960
It's about time.

799
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,710
Yes, it is.

800
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,530
Everything with you is about time, isn't it?

801
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,870
The past, the present, the future--

802
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,290
you know all of it, right?

803
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,480
And you know everything about me!

804
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,420
About Joe!

805
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,570
About Wally.

806
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,710
And Iris!

807
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,370
You know our strengths. You know our fears.

808
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,110
You how much we love each other.

809
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,870
And you know how to use that love against us.

810
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,380
All this time, we thought that we couldn't stop you,

811
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,210
because you're one step ahead, but that's not it.

812
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,790
You don't just know what's gonna happen to us.

813
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,870
You were there. You've lived it.

814
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,340
You remembered, when you were me.

815
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,720
Like I told you from the beginning,

816
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,510
I am the future Flash.
