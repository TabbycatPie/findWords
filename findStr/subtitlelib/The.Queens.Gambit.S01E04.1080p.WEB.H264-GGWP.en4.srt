A few days ago.

181
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,833
-I thought you were done with tournaments.
-I am. Mike's a glutton for punishment.

182
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,666
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Your mom has a new friend.

183
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,166
She came in at three o'clock this morning,
2:30 the day before.

184
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,416
He's got a green Dodge
that always seems to be at her disposal.

185
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,458
And they've had lunch and dinner
every day this week.

186
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
I'm pretty sure they're fucking.

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,333
I thought, at first, it was the altitude.

188
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,083
7,350 feet.

189
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,458
Good lord, it's enough
to make a person positively giddy.

190
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,000
Now, I think it's the culture.

191
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,750
There's no hint
of a Protestant ethic in Mexico.

192
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,041
They're all Latin Catholics,

193
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,083
and they all live in the here and now.

194
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,791
[Beth] You really need
to stop reading Alan Watts.

195
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,750
It's annoying.

196
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,625
I think I'll have just one margarita
before I go out.

197
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,000
Will you call for one, honey?

198
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,916
-[woman] Recepción.
-Yes, could we get a margarita and a Coke?

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
-[in English] Room number?
-713.

200
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,750
-Coming soon.
-Yes, thank you.

201
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,875
You know you could come along
to the folklórico.

202
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,750
I understand the costumes alone
are worth the price of admission.

203
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,125
-It's such a beautiful day.
-It's been raining the last two days.

204
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,208
Has it?

205
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,708
I hadn't noticed.

206
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,458
The tournament starts tomorrow.
I need to work on these endgames.

207
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,333
You know, perhaps, Beth,
you have to work on yourself.

208
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,083
Chess is not all there is.

209
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,875
It's what I know.

210
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,041
My experience has taught me what
you know isn't always what's important.

211
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,750
And what's important?

212
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,333
Living and growing.

213
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,208
[chuckles] Living your life.

214
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,625
-With a sleazy Mexican salesman.
-Treating yourself. Adventure.

215
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,041
You haven’t visited Bellas Artes,
or even been to Chapultepec Park.

216
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,750
The zoo there is delightful.

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,041
You’ve taken
all of your meals in this room,

218
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,666
you've had your nose
buried in a chess book.

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,458
Shouldn't you just relax
the day before the tournament?

220
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,500
Think about something other than chess?

221
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,416
Mother.

222
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,375
Tomorrow, at ten o'clock,
I play black against Octavio Marenco.

223
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,208
That means he gets to move first.

224
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,708
Yes. I know what playing black means.

225
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,666
He's 34 and an International Grandmaster.

226
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,041
If I lose, we'll be paying for this trip…

227
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,166
this adventure…

228
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,000
out of capital.

229
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,125
If I win, I'll be playing someone even
better than Marenco in the afternoon.

230
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,625
I need to study my endgame.

231
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,291
You're what they call
an intuitive player, are you not?

232
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,208
Yes, I have been called that before.

233
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,416
Sometimes, the moves come to me.

234
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,083
I've noticed the moves
they applaud the loudest

235
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,041
are the ones you make rather quickly.

236
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,083
And there's a certain look on your face.

237
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,375
Intuition can't be found in books.

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,791
I think you just don't like Manuel.

239
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
Manuel is all right.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,458
But he doesn't come by to see me.

241
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,041
That's irrelevant. [chuckles softly]

242
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,250
You need to relax.

243
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,208
There's no player in the world
as gifted as you are.

244
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,666
I haven't the remotest idea
what faculties a person needs

245
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,250
in order to play chess well,

246
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,416
but I am convinced
that relaxation can only improve them.

247
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,708
[sighs]

248
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,375
-[thunder rumbling]
-[birds chirping, geese honking]

249
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,291
[sighs]

250
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,833
-[Beth] Una cerveza Corona, por favor.
-Sí.

251
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,708
[Mr. Shaibel]
People like you have a hard time.

252
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,041
[pensive music playing]

253
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,291
Two sides of the same coin.

254
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,916
You've got your gift…

255
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,041
[coin clatters softly]

256
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
…and you've got what it costs.

257
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,166
Hard to say for you what that will be.

258
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,000
[Beth sighs]

259
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,791
You'll have your
time in the sun, but for how long?

260
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,666
You've got so much anger in you.

261
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,833
You'll have to be careful.

262
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,208
Cerveza?

263
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,250
Let's play.

264
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,583
[indistinct chatter]

265
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,958
[sighs]

266
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,916
[speaking Russian indistinctly]

267
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,750
-[door opens]
-[Mrs. Wheatley giggles, coughs]

268
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,458
[door closes]

269
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,166
-[clatter]
-[Mrs. Wheatley] Shit.

270
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,500
[Beth]
You can turn on the light. I'm now awake.

271
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,291
-[Beth exhales drowsily]
-[Mrs. Wheatley sniffles]

272
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,458
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,833
[coughs]

274
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
I seem to have caught a virus.

275
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,958
I don't know if I'll be able
to watch your match in the morning.

276
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,791
-It's all right.
-[sighs heavily]

277
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,208
You'll tell me all about it?

278
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,291
[moans softly] Sure.

279
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,125
-Every move?
-[chuckles]

280
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,250
Of course.

281
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,083
-[rain pouring]
-Hi, boys.

282
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,000
-Hey.
-Hey.

283
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
Lovely night for a swim.

284
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,791
[boys chuckling]

285
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,500
[in Spanish] This is Juan Alberto Diaz

286
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,250
coming to you live from the Mexico City
Invitational Chess Tournament

287
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,666
at the Palacio Azteca where

288
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,708
the big story
has been the seventeen-year-old

289
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,375
from Lexington, Kentucky,
Elizabeth Harmon.

290
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,708
[Beth, in English]
Neither of us spoke the other's language.

291
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,250
[man whispering indistinctly]

292
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,666
He opened with a pawn to king four.

293
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,208
I played pawn to queen's bishop four.

294
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,333
In 31 moves,
I had his king in a mating net.

295
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,541
You're a wonder.

296
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,250
[pensive music playing]

297
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
[thunder rumbling]

298
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
[water splashes]

299
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,666
[Diaz, in Spanish]
Undefeated, this morning she played

300
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,416
the Queen's Gambit Declined

301
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,958
against the Austrian, Diedrich.

302
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,125
Facing relentless pressure
in the middle of the board,

303
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,416
Harmon had him
on his heels from the start.

304
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,916
She did it mostly with pawns,

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,916
and crushed his position
as one might crush an egg.

306
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
Diedrich played well,

307
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,166
made no blunders or anything
that could properly be called a mistake,

308
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,916
but Harmon moved with such deadly accuracy,
such measured control,

309
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,666
that his position was hopeless

310
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,000
by the 23rd move.

311
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,333
Impressive play by this young woman.

312
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,625
[all laughing]

313
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,333
Borgov retreats his knight,

314
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,375
but he's really attacking
the black knight.

315
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,958
This is a very interesting position.

316
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,291
It is dangerous for both sides.

317
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,750
How is Black going to answer the threat?

318
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,750
[chess clock ticking]

319
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,125
Will he defend himself or counter attack?

320
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,625
It could go either way.

321
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,458
-[door opens]
-Mother?

322
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,541
[Mrs. Wheatley] Out here.

323
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,750
[distant traffic sounds]

324
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,750
[Mrs. Wheatley]
Fresh air feels nice, doesn't it?

325
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,375
Aren't you going out?

326
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,708
No, Manuel's not coming tonight.

327
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,958
He had business in Oaxaca.

328
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,708
Oh.

329
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,291
How long will he be gone?

330
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,458
At least until we leave.

331
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,875
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,250
I've never been to Oaxaca, but…

333
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,708
I imagine it resembles Denver.

334
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,375
We can have dinner together.

335
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,375
You can take me
to one of the places you know.

336
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Of course. [chuckles ruefully]

337
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,583
It was fun while it lasted.

338
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,541
[anticipatory music playing]

339
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,791
[with Russian accent] Good afternoon.

340
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,916
-[camera shutter clicks]
-I am Georgi Girev.

341
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,333
Beth Harmon.

342
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,500
[Georgi] I'm honored.

343
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,375
-[button clicks]
-[suspenseful music playing]

344
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,500
[Georgi sighs]

345
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,291
It's been five hours.

346
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,750
Perhaps we should adjourn now.

347
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,208
You must seal your move.

348
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,666
Miss Harmon must seal her move now.

349
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,833
Play will resume tomorrow at ten,
before your regular matches.

350
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,500
Miss Harmon.

351
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,666
Yes?

352
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,625
May I ask you something?

353
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:16,833
In America, I'm told
that one sees films inside the car.

354
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,708
Is this true?

355
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,250
Drive-ins.

356
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,208
You mean drive-in movies?

357
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,541
Yes, Elvis Presley movies.

358
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,083
Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor…

359
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,583
That happens?

360
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,833
It does.

361
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,166

I should not have let you do that.

386
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,083
With the rook.

387
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:03,500
No.

388
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,791
But you won't let
the next one that tries it.

389
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,625
How old were you
when you started playing?

390
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,041
Four.

391
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,375
I was district champion at seven.

392
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,625
I will be world champion one day.

393
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,541
When?

394
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,708
In three years.

395
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,875
You'll be 16 in three years.

00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,833

If you're world champion at 16…

what will you do
with the rest of your life?

401
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,041
I don't understand.

402
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,208
You're the best I've ever played.

403
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,333

Co-Champion.

412
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,208
I'm sorry I missed your match,

413
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,250
but the bath was so lovely.

414
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,291
I soaked the entire afternoon.

415
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,125
[Beth] I'm glad.

00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,875
-You look better.
-I feel better.

417
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,166
-Are you hungry?
-Starving.

You play beautiful, señora.

Thank you.

So much for your stage fright.

421
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,250
I play fine as long as it's for fun.

422
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,041
Where shall we go?

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,625

you've been to?

424
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:07,541
Mm-hm.

[man 2, in Russian] In Moscow, she'll be
jet-lagged. We can destroy her then.

431
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,125
[in Russian] She's getting better.

432
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,083
Have to deal with her here or in Paris

433
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,125
before she gets too strong.

434
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,041
There's talk she's a drunk.

435
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,416
Her game is almost all attack.

436
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,000
So she doesn't always watch her back.

437
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,458
When she blunders, she gets angry,

438
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,458
and can be dangerous.

439
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,875
-[man 3, in Russian] Like all women.
-She's an orphan. A survivor.

losing is not an option for her.

441

[Diaz, in Spanish] Pawn to king four.

453
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,625
She always plays
the Sicilian to that opening.

454
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,500
It's the most common opening
for White in the game of chess,

455
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:09,916
and Borgov has been called
the "Master of the Sicilian."

456
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,166
Harmon moves pawn to queen bishop four,

457
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,458
hoping to play him on ground
that's fresh for both of them,

458
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,916
that won't give him
the advantage of his superior knowledge.

459
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:29,541
And now Borgov has brought out
his king's knight to bishop three,

460
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,458
…and Harmon,

461
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,916
of course,
brings hers to queen bishop three,

462
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,708
attacking the center.

463
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:44,208
But Borgov moves his bishop
to knight five,

464
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,208
signaling he's going to play
the Closed Sicilian,

465
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,583
not the Open.

466
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,166

The Rossolimo. A rare opening…

469
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,500
Harmon pushes her pawn

470
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,625
to rook three,
attacking Borgov's bishop.

471

-[pieces clatter]
-[chess clock button clicks]

472
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,125
[Diaz] Borgov castles.

473
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,083
Harmon must now decide

474
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,583
to open the game or keep it closed.

475
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,625
[Mike] White has the advantage.

476
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,666
Since it always has the first move,
it always has the advantage.

477
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,125
I read that when computers
learn to play chess,

478
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,958
and play against other computers,

479
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,750
White will always win
because of the first move.

480
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,166
Like tic-tac-toe.

481
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,625
Borgov's not a machine.

482
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,750
[Matt chuckles] That you know of.

[piece clatters loudly]

487
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,291
[Beth] I didn't expect it.

488
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,708
No one really plays it.

489
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:51,708
It threw me off.

490
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,541
Just like he knew it would.

491
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,208
From that point on, the whole game
was like a foregone conclusion. I…

492
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,416
I couldn't fight this feeling
that I'd already lost.

493
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,833
Like in the books,

494
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,000
where you know the outcome,
but you play it out

495
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,083
just to see how it would happen, and…

496
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:16,000
I mean, every move he made was so…

497
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,000
obvious, so…

498
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,291
unimaginative, so bureaucratic.

499
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,541
And the whole time, I'd look at his face,

500
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,875
and there was no doubt.

501
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,250
No weakness.

502
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,083
I'm so glad you didn't see it.

503
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:44,791
Mother?

[exhales shakily]

506
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,625
I'm sorry.

507
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:29,916
What was it?

508
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,125
Hepatitis, possibly.

509
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,791
We will know tomorrow.

510
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,375
Could you give me a tranquilizer?

511
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,541
-Yes. I have a sedative.
-I don't want a sedative.

512
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,208
Could I have a prescription for Librium?

513
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,541
You don't need a prescription
to buy Librium in Mexico.

514
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,958
I suggest meprobamate.

515
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,750
There's a farmacia here in the hotel.

516
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,416
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.

517
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,666
Allow us to help you
with any arrangements.

518
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,041
Signing papers, dealing with authorities.

519
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,750
And, of course,
the bill will be taken care of.

520
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,333
-Thank you.
-Including the liquor bill,

521
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,166
which was significant.

522
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,750
Though, I'm sure none
of the many margaritas she consumed

523
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,291
was the culprit
in your mother's untimely passing.

524
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,791
She did mention something
about the quality of the tequila.

525
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,500
Again…

526
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,666
whatever we can do to help.

527
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:47,875
I need to find him.

Hello?

From Denver.

534

Thank you.

535
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,083
This is Allston Wheatley.

536
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,000
It's Beth, Mr. Wheatley.

537
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,708
Beth?

538
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,250
Your daughter.

539
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,791
-Elizabeth Harmon.
-And you're in Mexico?

540
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,333
It's about Mrs. Wheatley.

541
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,958
How is Alma? Is she there with you?

542
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,250
She's dead.

543
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,125
She died this morning.

544
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,541
-Mr. Wheatley--
-Can't you handle this?

545
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,416
I-I can't be going off to Mexico.

546
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:43,416
There's an autopsy in the morning,
and I have to buy new plane tickets…

547
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,375
I mean, I have to get
a new ticket for myself.

548
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:55,958
-I don't know where to bury her.
-Call Durgin Brothers in Lexington.

549
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,708
There's a family plot
in her maiden name, Benson.

550
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,041
What about the house?

551
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,375
[sighs]
Look, I don't want any part of this.

552
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,791
I got problems enough in Denver.

553
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,375
Get her up to Kentucky and bury her,
and the house is yours. Just…

554
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,458
make the mortgage payments.

555
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,208
You need money?

556
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,583
I don't know.
I don't know how much it'll cost.

557
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,708
I heard you're doing all right.
The child-prodigy thing.

558
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,166
Can't you charge it or something?

559
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,708
I'll ask the hotel.

560
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,250
Good, you do that.
I'm strapped for cash right now,

561
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,708
but call Second National Bank
and ask for Mr. Erlich.

562
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,083
That's E-R-L-I-C-H.

563
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,041
Say you can have the house.
He knows how to reach me.

564
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,916
Don't you want to know how she died?

565
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,833
What was it?

566
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,083
Hepatitis.

567
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,250
I think. We'll know tomorrow.

568
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,125
Yeah.

569
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,875
She was sick a lot.
