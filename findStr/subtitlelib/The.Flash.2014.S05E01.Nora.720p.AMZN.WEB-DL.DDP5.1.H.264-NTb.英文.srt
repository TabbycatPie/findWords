19
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,930
Last season, on "The Flash."

20
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,020
Melt.

21
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,580
- Killer Frost... - Is gone.

22
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,040
It says there's still another cryogenic anomaly

23
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,840
in my DNA.

24
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,160
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

25
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,230
Hang on.

26
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,860
See, right there.

27
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,950
Killer Frost, she was part of you.

28
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,000
Even then.

29
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,500
How is that possible?

30
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,180
To the newest member of Team Flash.

31
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,080
We need to talk.

32
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,460
- Who are you? - I'm your daughter, Nora.

33
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,440
Sally's in a decaying orbit.

34
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,370
Okay, how do we stop something

36
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,200
that's going to send us back into the Stone Age?

37
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,500
Barry, you've got to destroy that satellite.

38
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,960
That satellite

39
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,640
it wasn't just me who took it down.

40
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,230
There was another speedster.

41
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,860
Okay, let's back up.

42
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,330
My name is Nora West-Allen,

43
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,150
the fastest woman alive.

44
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,270
When I'm from, 30 years from now,

45
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,330
I'm the guardian of Central City.

46
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,210
I'm a speedster, just like my dad.

47
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,790
People call me XS.

48
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,290
Every day, I hope to live up to the legacy of The Flash...

49
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,370
But I've still got a long way to go.

50
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,750
You're saying you're our daughter?

51
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,330
From the future?

52
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,830
Named Nora?

53
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,050
After your mother.

54
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,180
Anybody need a refill?

55
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,990
No? Just me?

56
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,230
Cisco Ramon,

57
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,940
always cutting the tension with a joke.

58
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,980
You know our names?

59
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,620
Of course. I know all of you.

60
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,290
You're Caitlin Snow, Ralph Dibny,

61
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,450
Papa Joe, Mama Cecile.

62
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,750
Little Auntie Jenna.

63
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,160
She's so cute.

64
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,360
And Uncle Wally.

65
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,340
Uh, and your nickname is XS?

66
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,570
Clearly not my doing.

67
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,960
No, uh, it's a nickname

68
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,770
that you gave me when I was a kid, Mom.

69
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,910
"Mom"?

70
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,160
You said I did everything in excess.

71
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,340
Guess I've always been like that.

72
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,320
Overdoing things, getting in way over my head.

73
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,220
Like, uh, recently.

74
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,970
This mistake that you made?

75
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,390
Big mistake.

76
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,610
Which was...

77
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,070
Helping you save the city

78
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,810
by destroying the STAR Labs satellite last night.

79
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,090
You were the other speedster?

80
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,160
I just couldn't stop myself

81
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,650
from getting involved.

82
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,210
But something happened when I did, because now,

83
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,190
I can't seem to go fast enough to open up the Speed Force.

84
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,680
Par--pardon me.

85
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,560
Are we talking about actual time travel here?

86
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,780
Do you just like, not pay any attention

87
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,370
when we have our briefings?

88
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,200
Y'all didn't teach him about the Legends?

89
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Look, nobody said bubkes about time travel.

90
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Come on, Ralph. You're scaring the baby.

91
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,050
Yeah, you're scaring the baby.

92
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,820
No, no, she's not scared.

93
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,320
She just said she's hungry.

94
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,250
She said that she's-- Joe!

95
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,320
I heard her!

96
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,500
I read her mind!

97
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,910
I might not be losing my powers!

98
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,640
I might not be losing my powers!

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,650
Awesome.

100
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,990
I'm sorry.

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,410
I know how bizarre this must seem,

102
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,380
meeting your daughter from the future as an adult.

103
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,110
But really, this wasn't my plan at all,

104
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,880
but I'm kind of stuck here now,

105
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,160
and you're the only people who can help me.

106
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,610
So...anybody know what to do?

109
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,560
This is so, so weird.

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,930
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe that's our daughter up there.

111
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,360
- We have been lied to before. - Barry.

112
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,770
Yellow lightning like yours, purple lightning like mine?

113
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,150
I mean, it's-- it's got to be her.

114
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,700
We're meeting our daughter for the first time, Barry.

115
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah, well, look. If it is true,

116
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,150
Nora could say the wrong thing or step on the wrong butterfly

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,240
and screw up the whole timeline.

118
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,450
I mean, she could Marty McFly herself out of existence.

119
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,020
Mm, "Terminator 2," Yeah.

120
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,210
No, that's "Back to the"-- It doesn't matter.

121
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,250
Look, we just need to be responsible, all right?

122
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,670
I mean, I think we need to find a way to send her home, fast.

123
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,020
Barry, don't you think future us taught our daughter

124
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,750
how not to screw with the timeline?

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,990
Wow, this Speed Lab sure is archaic, huh?

126
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,250
La-la-la-la-la, you don't know--

127
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,640
you know what, um...

128
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,250
Sorry, just--no future talk, all right, please?

129
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,370
Right, I don't want to wreck the timeline.

130
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,590
All right, Nora.

131
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,290
This is gonna link us up with your biometrics.

132
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,380
And this little scrunchy doohicky

133
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,720
is gonna analyze your connection to the, um, uh--

134
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,580
The Speed Force.

135
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,070
The Speed Force. Thank you.

136
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,820
Great.

137
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,350
I'll be back in a...flash.

138
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,860
And what does it say?

139
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,140
A quick analysis of her DNA shows patterns

140
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,660
that are similar to both of yours.

141
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,740
I knew it. She's our daughter.

142
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,350
What about her being stuck here?

143
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,480
Everything's normal.

144
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,780
She definitely has Speed Force in her system.

145
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,290
She's just not going... fast enough

146
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,980
to, uh, open up a time portal, so.

147
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,250
How much champagne did you have at Joe and Cecile's?

148
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,720
This is the first opportunity I have

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,730
to process my breakup with Gypsy, okay?

150
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,610
How was I supposed to know

151
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,340
that your future daughter was gonna come show up

152
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,860
and crash my pity party?

153
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,570
How was I supposed to "Ancipitate" that?

154
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,380
Crap, I was supposed to meet Singh at CCPD an hour ago.

155
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,840
- Okay. - Hey, Wally, can you do me a favor?

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,310
Can you take the sample to the Legends

157
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,580
to see if they have any insight?

158
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,640
And maybe, worst comes to worst,

159
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,030
we can take her home on the Waverider?

160
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,590
- Yeah, I got it. - All right.

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Okay, just-- I'll hurry back.

162
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
Keep an eye on her.

163
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,030
New ID, keys to the lab.

164
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,020
You are officially reinstated as our CSI tech, Allen.

165
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,230
Thanks, Captain.

166
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,180
Oh, one more thing.

167
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,130
We didn't fill your position while you were away,

168
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,730
so there are a few cases waiting for you in your lab.

169
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,180
Get to them fast as you can.

170
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,090
Welcome back, Allen.

171
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
"A few"?

172
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,960
What you working on?

173
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,250
- I don't-- - You are crazy behind.

174
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,210
Hey, so I thought you were gonna stay at STAR Labs,

175
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,800
with, um...with your...

176
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,680
Iris-- mom.

177
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
Your mom.

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,390
You know I'm a forensic scientist too?

179
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,320
CCU grad, just like you. 5.6 GPA.

180
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,630
I could help you get through this.

181
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,800
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's--

182
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,660
So the fire marshal at this site says

183
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,710
crazing in the melted glass suggests a liquid accelerant.

184
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,280
Mm, any petroleum-based household product

185
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,790
could cause crazing.

186
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,060
Well, like floor wax, or shag rugs, even balloons.

187
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,110
Yeah, the glass melts under the surface,

188
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,800
like ice cream in the cracks of a waffle cone.

189
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,210
Oh, like when you get two scoops

190
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,860
of cookie dough ice cream with extra sprinkles

191
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,010
at the Mason Family Ice Cream Shop in...

192
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,250
Happy Harbor, Rhode Island.

193
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,320
My parents used to take me there when I was a kid.

194
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,140
It's my favorite dessert.

195
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,730
Mine too.

196
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,950
Hey, look, I'm sorry, um, you're obviously

197
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,350
good at forensics, but you shouldn't interfere.

198
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,430
I mean, people like us, we need to be responsible.

199
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,850
Right! Uh, timeline.

200
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,070
The timeline, yeah.

201
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,340
All available units,

202
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,540
M-0-3 in progress, 10th and Neely.

203
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,300
M-0-3, that's a meta attack.

204
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,610
Yeah, my suit's all torn up.

205
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,990
I don't have anything to--

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,450
Direct from Cisco's back closet.

207
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,600
One first-edition red emblem OG super suit.

208
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,210
Total fan favorite.

209
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,280
Thank you.

210
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,300
Uh, I'm-- I'm gonna handle this.

211
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,060
You just-- no, no, no.

212
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,820
Uh, you... stay.

213
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
- Okay? - Okay.

214
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Seriously, please.

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,670
Now I'm gonna...

216
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,400
Going old-school today, Flash?

217
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,060
Yeah, it's a little tighter than I remember, though.

218
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,900
Hey, uh, you might want to do something.

219
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,160
Now it's my turn, Flash.

220
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,190
Gridlock? Schway!

221
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,140
- What are you doing? - No, no.

222
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,490
I just-- I just wanted--

223
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,410
Nice.

224
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,950
Oh, grife. You're mad at me.

225
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,770
No, Nora, we're not. We're just--

226
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,270
Please don't say "Disappointed."

227
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,760
That's so much worse.

228
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,390
I mean, I just didn't think it was a big deal.

229
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,020
It was only Gridlock.

230
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,690
Oh, Gridlock, huh?

231
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,130
Boy, the future's got some great names.

232
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,960
This lighting!

233
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,650
How did you know who he is?

234
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,930
Flash Museum.

235
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,120
Did you say...

236
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,110
- "Flash Museum"? - Yeah.

237
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,110
It has all the villains and battles in chronological order.

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,140
I've studied everything.

239
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,270
So you know this guy's real name?

240
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,950
Mr. Myles, the curator,

241
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,410
he scrubbed all the names for legal reasons.

242
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,880
But it really shouldn't matter.

243
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,230
I mean, Gridlock was a one-and-done.

244
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,100
You guys beat him in one try,

245
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,940
or at least... you were supposed to.

246
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,260
Ugh, now, because of me, he's on the run,

247
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,040
and the timeline's all messed up again, and I--

248
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,580
Nora, hey, look, look.

249
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,670
I've made way bigger mistakes than this time traveling.

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,320
We'll get this guy-- you don't need to worry about that--

251
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,570
but the longer you stay here, the more things might change.

252
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,810
We need to get you home.

253
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,470
But I can't go fast enough to get home.

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,330
What about the tachyon absorption enhancer?

255
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,030
The one that Thawne used to increase his speed?

256
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,840
Ooh, and if we charge it up,

257
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,030
we could uh, boost the Speed Force in her cells,

258
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,550
like some kind of, um...

259
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,930
thing that boosts Speed Force in cells.

260
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea.

261
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,620
Let's--okay, finding Gridlock

262
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,990
and getting Nora home need to be our priorities.

263
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,610
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

264
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,960
- Wait. - Loud!

265
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,330
Okay, so--but this needs to be our priority.

266
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,820
Now, I realize that you're all way ahead of me

267
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,550
in this time-travel business, but guys,

268
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,140
I think I just discovered something.

269
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,360
So if--if Nora can time travel,

270
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,390
that means she can create new timelines, right?

271
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,450
New timelines means that parallel timelines can exist.

272
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,410
So, guys,

273
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,130
I think that a whole other universe could exist.

274
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,970
I know, I know, I know.

275
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,330
It sounds crazy, but think about it.

276
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,280
There could be an Earth where we're all bad guys,

277
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,980
or another Earth where there's no world hunger,

278
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,600
or--or another Earth where--

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,920
where they never made that last "Indiana Jones" Movie.

280
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,340
Think of the possibilities.

281
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,990
It's like some kind of a manyverse.

282
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,860
And everybody knows about the manyverse.

283
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,000
Multiverse, and so do you, Ralph.

284
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,430
Breacher? Gypsy? Harry?

285
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,660
What did you think we meant when we said

286
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,280
Harry was from Earth-2?

287
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,440
That he is from Earth "Also."

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,780
Oh, my God.

289
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,440
You guys really need to make, like, a welcome pamphlet,

290
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,640
or at least a Powerpoint or something.

291
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,180
Hey, Ralph, buddy?

292
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,510
Can we get off time travel, maybe, please?

293
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,610
Let's focus on finding Gridlock, all right?

294
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,750
Thank you.

295
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,820
I'm gonna go to CCPD,

296
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,690
see what I can dig up.

297
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,170
Okay, I'll stay with Nora.

298
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,080
- Let's just make sure- - I know.

299
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,450
Protect the timeline.

300
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,610
You thirsty?

301
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay, latte for me, and a decaf Flash for you.

302
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,260
Dad's lightning bolt is way cooler than Lightning Lad's.

303
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,630
And do you think he's gonna be back soon?

304
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,510
Well, you know your dad.

305
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,340
Whenever there's a problem, he's gotta run off and fix it.

306
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,670
But, you know,

307
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,660
this gives us a chance to connect.

308
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,460
You're not worried about messing things up, like he is?

309
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,940
I--well, I just, I...

310
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,700
want to get to know you a little.

311
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,580
How about this?

312
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,630
I will ask you questions

313
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,280
about your life, and if I'm right,

314
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,010
you just blink twice.

315
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,730
I mean, blinking never broke the timeline, right?

316
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,040
Okay, yeah, I mean, if you really want to.

317
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,780
Yeah, I think it'll be really fun.

318
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,860
Okay, um, so let's see.

319
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,670
You are a reporter for a newspaper

320
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,430
that you can only read on Instagram.

321
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,820
Um, okay, you--you are a cop.

322
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,690
You're a--a CSI?

323
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,320
You're a CSI.

324
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,560
Just like your dad.

325
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,300
Okay, well, what about you and I?

326
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,340
Do we--do we, like, have dinner every Sunday?

327
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,260
Do we talk on the phone?

328
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,360
Do we still get coffee at Jitters?

329
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,920
Uh... Was that a blink?

330
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,590
Uh, no, I just-I have something in my eye.

331
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,500
You know, a coffee in my time at Jitters is $43 a cup.

332
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,350
That's one thing I really like about now.

333
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,540
2018 is way schway.

334
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,450
"Schway"? Oh.

335
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,150
Yeah, I guess it's a future thing.

336
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,420
Oh--oh, no. Oh, "Schway."

337
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,680
No, I know, I'm hip. I know what schway means.

338
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,930
Like, I'm schway, you're schway.

339
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,690
We're--we're schway, baby.

340
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,560
Stupid.

341
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,280
Do you think maybe Caitlin and Cisco need any help?

342
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,810
I can't believe I'm wearing the same tachyon enhancer

343
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,510
my dad used to meet Supergirl for the first time.

344
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,620
All set.

345
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Wait, what happened to the second version?

346
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,850
The smaller one that was inside the emblem

347
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,640
of my dad's second suit?

348
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,960
Um, if he wore that one, he could harness tachyons

349
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,190
and share them with me.

350
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,400
Hey, fangirl, relax.

351
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,380
We know.

352
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,480
Did all these suits shrink?

353
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,390
And why does it smell so bad?

354
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,320
Because it's the one you used

355
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,380
when you swam against King Shark.

356
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

357
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,750
Flash!

358
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,550
Zoom wants you dead!

359
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,660
I know King Shark is technically a bad guy,

360
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,890
but you should see-just wait.

361
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,760
When he fights Grodd, it's-Um!

362
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,430
Spoiler alert.

363
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,840
We should get going, actually, let's--

364
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Right.

365
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,560
Then this is goodbye.

366
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,470
From your guys' perspectives, at least.

367
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,750
I'll see you again in a minute and 27 seconds,

368
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,460
but when you see me again, I'll be a baby.

369
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,440
Get home safe, Nora.

370
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,370
I'm sorry

371
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,310
we didn't get to spend more time together.

372
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,120
Oh, it's fine, Mom.

373
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,950
We spend our whole lives together.

374
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,370
All right.

375
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,710
Did they already leave?

376
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,190
Yeah, why? What's up?

377
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,560
We have to stop them.

378
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,590
I'm sorry I was too late.

379
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,470
It took me a while to find where the Legends were.

380
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,750
Well, when they were.

381
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,050
But we got their Gideon

382
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,830
to scan Nora's blood sample.

383
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,260
- What'd she find? - Negative tachyons.

384
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,800
Negative tachyons?

385
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,690
So, what, instead of speeding you up, they slow you down?

386
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,510
Yeah.

387
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,030
Oh, damn, I was just joking.

388
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,270
That's a real thing?

389
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,970
Yeah, Ava and her team at the Time Bureau

390
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,390
have encountered them before, but no one knows

391
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,460
where they come from or how they're generated.

392
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,250
Like dark matter for the space time continuum.

393
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,830
Exactly, and they're saturating Nora's body

394
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,700
and keeping her from entering the Speed Force.

395
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,270
What about the Waverider? Can the Legends take her back?

396
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,000
If negative tachyons come anywhere near

397
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,300
the Rider's time drives,

398
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,540
uh, the reaction will vaporize the ship.

399
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,470
Well, there's got to be a way to get rid of them, right?

400
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,700
I mean, I don't know about getting rid of them,

401
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,790
but maybe we can offset

402
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,530
the tachyon absorption enhancer

403
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,590
to negate the reaction somehow.

404
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,430
- A new meta was last seen... - Hey, guys.

405
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,000
Jumping off a building in order to

406
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,210
evade capture after stealing jewels...

407
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,530
How did we miss this?

408
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,440
I guess this is a parting gift from DeVoe.

409
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,470
Without our STAR Labs satellite,

410
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,560
we've lost our eyes, our ears, our dark matter scanner,

411
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,440
our facial recognition-- I mean, we're always

412
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,610
gonna be one step behind these metas now.

413
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,530
I'll work on this.

414
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,850
Why don't you guys go help Ralph

415
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,180
with the Gridlock crime scene, okay?

416
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,080
I can come help.

417
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,090
Please, no, just--we just

418
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,050
can't let this get any worse, all right?

419
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,500
Just relax, okay?

420
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,920
How's your investigation going?

421
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,430
Uh, it just doesn't really add up.

422
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,600
I mean, if Eddie wanted to erase Thawne from existence,

423
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,480
why didn't he just have a vasectomy?

424
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,590
Right, uh, nobody's talking.

425
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,760
Probably because they're afraid

426
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,330
Gridlock will attack them.

427
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,710
Right, but maybe if I had Killer Frost at my side,

428
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,800
people would be a little more willing

429
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,660
to tell us what they know.

430
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,130
Ralph, Killer Frost has been gone

431
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,230
since the night that DeVoe took over your body.

432
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,470
Jeez Louise, no one tells me anything.

433
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,230
- Is she gone for good? - I hope not.

434
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,760
But I've tried everything I can think of

435
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
to get her to reappear.

436
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,790
You don't have any other leads?

437
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,190
Cisco vibed me back to when

438
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,150
Killer Frost and I were younger.

439
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,690
You've been a meta since you were a kid?

440
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,110
- I guess so. - How?

441
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,850
- I have no idea. - Did you see anything else?

442
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,690
- Just that my dad was there. - Well, that's something.

443
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,810
Except my dad's been dead for years.

444
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,150
But none of this matters right now.

445
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,410
We have much more pressing things to deal with.

446
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,210
Hey, come look at this.

447
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,480
I present Gridlock.

448
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,260
A mystery in three acts.

449
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,520
Please note the dark matter levels.

450
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,200
Act One, Gridlock attacks the cops before Barry shows up.

451
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,280
Okay, but these dark matter levels

452
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,000
are perfectly normal for a man of his size.

453
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,040
Until Act Two.

454
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,510
He gets lightning punched by Barry.

455
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,360
His dark matter levels increased.

456
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,130
Which brings us to our third and final act...

457
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,970
Gridlock hits back.

458
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,880
Even higher.

459
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,600
How--how is that possible?

460
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,160
It isn't, unless every time Gridlock got hit,

461
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,090
his cells absorbed the kinetic energy.

462
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,890
That would increase his dark matter quotient,

463
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,960
thereby increasing his powers.

464
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,410
If this is true, then whatever movement he's exposed to--

465
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,770
The stronger he's gonna get.

466
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,880
So, if Gridlock keeps moving, he becomes unstoppable.

467
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,830
So, figure it out yet?

468
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,380
Whatever these negative tachyons are,

469
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,930
it feels a lot more like science fiction

470
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,410
than actual science.

471
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,350
I wasn't asking about the science.

472
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,800
I was asking about the scientist.

473
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,490
You and Nora, you guys have such a strong connection.

474
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,150
I mean, it's... it's effortless.

475
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,670
So why are you so intent on sending her back?

476
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,930
I mean, what do you mean?

477
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,150
First of all, she can't stop talking about the future.

478
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,260
But--I mean, you know the danger that her being here

479
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,900
poses to the timeline.

480
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,740
Yeah, I do, but I also know you, Barry.

481
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,210
Look.

482
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
You're the guy that went back in time

483
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,410
- to borrow Snart before he died. - I know.

484
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,140
You're also the same guy that travelled to 2020

485
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,500
to figure out who Savitar was,

486
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,100
and 2015 to train with Wells.

487
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,760
You changed fate to save my life.

488
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,560
So, now that our daughter is here in front of us,

489
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,400
asking for our help, you expect me to believe

490
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,490
that you're worried about the timeline?

491
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,030
Nora shouldn't be here.

492
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,990
Look, I'm--

493
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,210
- I've always wanted a family. - I know.

494
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,140
You know, and when we got married,

495
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,890
I knew that one day, we'd decide to have a baby.

496
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,710
We would try, and you'd get pregnant.

497
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,630
I'd be there for the sonogram, I'd hear her first heartbeat,

498
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,680
and then she'd come.

499
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,780
And we'd take her home, see her first smile,

500
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,800
her first tooth, the first time I read to her.

501
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,990
Her first steps. The first time she ran.

502
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,050
But her being here now, don't you feel like

503
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,290
we missed all those firsts?

504
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,890
That we skipped all the good stuff?

505
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,220
Baby, we will still have all of those firsts.

506
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,520
Just not in that order.

507
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,570
But my whole life's been out of order.

508
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,800
These powers, time travel--

509
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,270
that's the reason my mom was killed,

510
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,980
why I grew up with my dad in prison.

511
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,140
They missed so many firsts. They missed our wedding.

512
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,070
I know.

513
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,960
I don't know, I just thought that when it was our turn to have a kid,

514
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,000
that life would let us have this one little thing

515
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,400
the normal way.

516
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,340
Just once.

517
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,730
But we lost that chance.

518
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,440
No, we're not losing anything by having her here now.

519
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,960
We're only gaining something extra, Barry.

520
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,920
And look, if we figure this out,

521
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,740
I mean, by the time we do have a baby,

522
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,690
we are gonna be the best parents ever.

523
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,560
- Maybe you're right. - I know I'm right.

524
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,770
You're gonna be there to put that quarter under her pillow,

525
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,390
and you're gonna be there

526
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,530
to drive her to her first day of school,

527
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,040
and you're gonna be there to cheer on her first run.

528
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,320
And we are gonna have all of those firsts.

529
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,130
I promise.

530
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,620
And think about it.

531
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,350
We have a kid who defied the laws of physics

532
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,600
to hang out with her parents.

533
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,730
I mean, that's pretty-- that's pretty schway.

534
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,570
Yeah, as eager as she is, you'd think that she's the one

535
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,340
that grew up with a parent in...

536
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,210
What's wrong?

537
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,300
Nothing. Um, nothing.

538
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm--I'm gonna be right back.

539
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,160
Nora.

540
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,740
What happens to me in the future?

541
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,690
You said that you spend your whole life with your mom,

542
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,410
but you didn't say the same for me.

543
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,580
My poker face is that bad, huh?

544
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,460
I need to know.

546
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,150
How long?

548
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,740
You never come back.

549
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,420
How old were you when it happened?

550
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,390
I was born, um, a few years before you vanished,

551
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,510
but I don't have any memories of you.

552
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,540
So the wedding was...

553
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,260
Was pretty much the first time I met you.

554
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,320
I'd imagined so many different things to say to you.

555
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,340
Still can't believe I went with "Remember to say 'I do.'"

556
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,360
I guess things don't always go the way you plan them.

557
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,050
You're not stuck here, are you?

558
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,810
I found it in the museum archive.

559
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,310
Negative tachyons, harnessed on demand.

560
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,540
Really should work on that poker face, I guess.

561
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,870
This didn't have to be a secret.

562
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,600
Why did you keep this from us?

563
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,000
Because if you knew I could have gone home,

564
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,100
you would have sent me back

565
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,520
the second I walked into Grandpa's house.

566
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,810
I mean, it's like you said, Dad.

567
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,020
Speedsters have to be responsible.

568
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,010
But--but I'm not responsible, am I?

569
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
I'm...just selfish

570
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,450
and really, really bad at being a speedster.

571
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,360
Nora, you're not bad.

572
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,260
I mean, I can do some cool things, you know?

573
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,100
Sometimes, I run so fast, I reverse time a bit,

574
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,050
but I can't do the things you can.

575
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,110
I don't even know how to phase yet.

576
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,300
Guess there's only so much you can learn from a museum.

577
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,320
What about your mom?

578
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,850
Yeah, I--she's around, you know?

579
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,640
It's just, uh-- just me and her.

580
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm sorry.

581
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,590
Yeah, I know.

582
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,100
I shouldn't have lied.

583
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,560
I just wanted to see you so badly

584
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,690
and spend a day with you.

585
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,400
Go for a run for the first time together.

586
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,100
I missed all your firsts.

587
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,110
I was so worried about screwing up your childhood

588
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,330
and screwing up our family, but...

589
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,550
I'm not even there.

590
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,740
Barry, we need you in the Cortex.

591
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,150
It's about Gridlock.

592
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,200
I-- - I'm fine.

593
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,410
you need to go fix my mess, and then I can go home.

594
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,150
I scanned the crime scene photos and got a match.

595
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,140
This is not Lang's first rodeo.

597
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,890
CCPD put out a warrant for him for carjacking.

598
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,330
He killed the whole crew inside.

599
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,090
And now he absorbs kinetic energy?

600
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,840
He only gets stronger if you punch him,

601
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,480
you shoot him, you throw him into traffic.

602
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,040
Which could only make the traffic worse.

603
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,010
God, I'd hate to be stuck in that gridlock.

604
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,490
Gridlock... Gridlock...

605
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,540
I came up with the name.

606
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,400
I am fortune's fool.

607
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,250
So how do we find this guy without Sally the satellite?

608
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,690
We don't need a satellite to hack a cell phone.

609
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,130
And if we want to find his cell phone, we'll find it...

610
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,230
By the airport?

611
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,110
Got it, 'cause he's on a plane that just took off.

612
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,980
Central City Air, flight number 5201.

613
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,540
Why would he get on a plane?

614
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,170
Because he's gonna crash it.

615
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,650
We are currently cruising at 34,000 feet.

616
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,310
We anticipate a smooth landing,

617
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,480
so sit back and enjoy...

618
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,620
Excuse me, sir.

619
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,440
If you could please fasten your seatbelt

620
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,050
until we reach cruising altitude

621
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,330
and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign.

622
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,890
Are you gonna buckle that thing in too?

623
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,380
Well, it must be something priceless to get its own seat.

624
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,270
Jewels, maybe.

625
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,980
The plane just lost an engine.

626
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,370
It's headed for downtown.

628
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,840
If Gridlock takes out the other engine,

629
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,950
the pilot won't be able to avoid the buildings.

630
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,370
Thousands of people will die.

631
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,170
Not if you phase the plane through the buildings.

632
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,650
I read about you doing the same thing

633
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,300
to a plane in the future when you were fighting Mob Rule.

634
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,590
Can you two do that?

635
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,270
A plane?

636
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,530
No-- I mean, no, I don't think so.

637
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,970
I mean, I think it's too big.

638
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,990
The three of us.

639
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,660
I mean, the three of us might be able to do it.

640
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,470
Well, I can't phase anything.

641
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,920
I can't even phase myself, let alone at G-Force.

642
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,820
Wait, G-For-- G-Force, that's it.

643
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,770
The plane is still ascending.

644
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,050
Once he blows up the other engine,

645
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,140
it's gonna slow down and point downwards

646
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,370
before it starts its descent.

647
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,230
That'll give us about ten seconds of zero Gs on the plane.

648
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,860
- Yeah. - And zero Gs means no kinetic energy,

649
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,520
means Gridlock has no powers.

650
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,980
Can you breach them onto the plane?

651
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,580
A plane goes way too fast.

652
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,930
I'd need to see it in person.

653
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,280
- Then go. - But I don't have a suit.

654
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,220
I actually have a backup.

655
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,810
I got more than just a list of metas from that museum.

656
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,750
Damn, Gina. I made that?

657
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,000
Uh, Ryan Choi, actually.

658
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,660
Oh, this is a supersuit.

659
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,560
- No offense. - None taken.

662
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,480
Guys, he just took out the other engine.

663
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,430
You can do this.

664
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,460
Don't drink and vibe. I feel like I'm gonna hurl.

665
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,330
It's slowing.

666
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,260
Guys, you've got ten seconds.

667
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,410
Ten.

668
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,310
Nine.

669
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,110
Eight.

670
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,900
Seven.

671
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,570
Six.

672
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,160
Five.

673
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,770
Four.

674
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,850
Three.

675
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,840
Two.

676
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,540
One.

677
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,360
Okay, everybody stay calm, all right?

678
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,680
Just stay calm.

679
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,480
All right, come on.

680
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,510
Hey, take a wall, all right?

681
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,270
We got this.

682
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,270
Barry, hurry.

683
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,510
- It's not working. - What?

684
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,890
I can't do this.

685
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,790
All right, yes-- listen to me, just breathe.

686
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,100
Feel the floor beneath your feet.

687
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,580
Feel the rumble of the plane.

688
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,090
Feel the air.

689
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,630
Feel that wind on your face,

690
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,260
- and the lightning. - And the lightning.

691
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,230
Feel its electricity pumping through your veins,

692
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,740
traveling to every nerve in your body

693
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,730
like a shock you never want to end.

694
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,360
- You are no longer you now. - You're no longer you.

695
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,610
You're part of something greater.

696
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,830
You're part of something greater.

697
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,510
Part of the Speed Force.

698
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,730
That's right.

699
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,170
All right, it's ours.

700
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,990
Now, let's do it.

701
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,530
Everybody hold on!

702
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,500
Hold on!

703
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,790
Are you okay?

704
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,870
Nice.

705
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,650
You phased.

706
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,180
For the first time!

707
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,800
Well, Gridlock's off to Iron Heights' meta wing.

709
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,330
Where he won't be moving from for a very long time.

710
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,850
Thanks to your help.

711
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,020
I'm glad we got to team up.

712
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,050
Me too.

713
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,010
Ladies and gentleman,

714
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,880
say hello to the tachyon absorption enhancer 2.5,

715
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,190
now complete with completely recalibrated

716
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,600
Time Bureau technology.

717
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,030
We haven't tested it yet, but it should counterbalance

718
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,270
the negative tachyons in Nora's cells.

719
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,850
Here you go, Billy Pilgrim.

720
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,470
Consider yourself unstuck in time.

721
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,050
So I can run home now?

722
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,110
Or...

723
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,380
maybe we hit pause on this thing.

724
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,860
You want Nora to stay?

725
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,440
Um, yeah, I thought getting her home was our priority.

726
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,860
No, it is, I just--

727
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,410
now, I'm thinking that maybe we should make sure

728
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,480
her powers are working correctly

729
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,990
before we send her home.

730
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,410
And what about the timeline?

731
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,700
It's risky, but I don't know.

732
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,090
I mean, Wally and I were talking about it.

733
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,630
Yeah, the Legends have a theory.

734
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,420
Uh, there are some historical events that are soft.

735
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,790
Basically, you change those,

736
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,330
it's not going to affect much else,

737
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,100
like catching Gridlock late.

738
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,110
And then, there are those that are fixed.

739
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,360
You mess with them, and all sorts of craziness starts to happen.

740
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,830
Like the night my mom died.

741
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,870
Changing that created Flashpoint.

742
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,540
It looks like Nora is gonna need a place to stay.

743
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,320
Uh, yes, and I'll stay in the lounge.

744
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,220
What lounge?

745
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,120
This lounge.

746
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,560
- Damn. - Dad.

747
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,030
- You found my spot. - You knew about this?

748
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,700
I've been napping in here since day one.

749
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,920
Uh, well, Nora was gonna stay here,

750
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,470
if that's all right with you.

751
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,890
Okay, well,

752
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,930
now I can get to know my granddaughter.

753
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm sorry, you met Elvis?

754
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,750
Met him?

755
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,510
Uncle Wally fought the ghost of his twin brother.

756
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,090
I, uh--I went to a monastery,

757
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,070
and I was trying to find myself,

758
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,530
but I was really close.

759
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,400
Then, the Legends came, they swooped me up,

760
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,950
and life got even more crazy.

761
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,680
You want to go back, don't you?

762
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,470
I can't. I mean, I just got here.

763
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,990
I don't want to leave the team. I don't want to leave you.

764
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,890
Wally, everybody in this room loves you, especially me.

765
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,420
But you didn't finish what you set out to do,

766
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,600
and nobody's gonna get in your way.

767
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,740
So promise me, when you find what you're looking for,

768
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,610
come back, or you're gonna have

769
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,670
a very angry-looking dad in your zen garden.

770
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,760
Will you take care of him, XS?

771
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,390
You got it, Kid Flash.

772
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,280
You okay?

773
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,820
Yeah.

774
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,810
I thought I missed out on my chance to connect with Nora,

775
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,230
but now that she's staying, I get another shot.

776
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,940
If you could have seen her on that plane,

777
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,180
you'd know that you guys are already connected.

778
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,340
Really?

779
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,040
She was fearless, just like you.

780
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,690
- We have a daughter together. - Yeah.

781
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,960
We make a person.

782
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,900
In the end, everything works out.

783
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,950
We get our happy ending.

784
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,500
If Barry can go back in time,

785
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,270
why didn't he stop the Thinker from killing me?

786
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,220
Kidding, I'm kidding.

787
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,500
Guys, I'm kidding.

788
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,340
I realize that could have upset

789
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,550
the delicate balance of the universe.

790
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,880
Besides, if he did that, who knows?

791
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,490
He might have created a timeline where

792
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,480
I died in that particle accelerator explosion.

793
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,780
Wishful thinking.

794
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,220
Kidding. I'm glad you're here,

795
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,590
and I'm glad that we don't have to hold your hand

796
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,690
through the time travel thing; you're figuring it out.

797
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,870
Yeah, well, time travel's not the only mystery I solved.

798
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,120
While you guys were fighting Gridlock,

799
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,300
I was, uh, running this down.

800
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,200
- What's this? - An answer.

801
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,290
And a lot more questions.

802
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,060
It's my father's death certificate.

803
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,100
A friend at county helped me out with that.

804
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,580
The ME who signed off on it, Cameron Mahkent?

805
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,620
He doesn't exist.

806
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,450
So then, this death certificate...

807
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,660
Is a fake.

808
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,690
You should get some rest. You've had a long day.

809
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,880
Ooh, I'll try.

810
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,990
I'm just so excited. Like, literally.

811
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,600
Phasing excited all of the electron clouds in my body.

812
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,150
Well, if you're not tired,

813
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,290
two scoops of cookie dough ice cream sound good right now.

814
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,680
From Happy Harbor?

815
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,230
If that's okay with you.

816
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,770
It is, yeah.

817
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,070
Just, uh, bring me back some mint chip.

818
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,240
My name is Nora West Allen,

819
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,300
and I'm the fastest woman alive.

820
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,370
When I was a child, my father disappeared

821
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,350
in something impossible.

822
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,770
Then I grew up and became the impossible.

823
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,460
Now I'm trying to live up to the legacy he created

824
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,880
so that one day, I'll stop him from ever disappearing.

825
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,330
I'm XS.

826
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,320
How schway is that?

827
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,030
CCPD! Stay where you are.

828
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,680
Freeze, don't move.

829
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,990
Who the hell are you?

830
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,370
Wh--what do you want?

831
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,640
For all of you to die.
