34
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,640
You're here early. Trouble sleeping?

35
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,420
No. Just wanted to get out of my apartment and to work.

36
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,050
We work you plenty hard enough. Go home.

37
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,600
Making sure you're rested is also part of the job.

38
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,880
I understand.

39
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,830
What should I tell a patient

40
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,200
if they don't think they're sick

41
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,340
but I think they have pancreatic cancer?

42
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,670
You think one of our patients has pancreatic cancer?

43
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,240
Seventeen.

44
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,740
He's burped 17 times in 10 minutes.

45
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,590
It's a frequent symptom of pancreatic cancer.

46
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,990
Shaun, it's acid reflux.

47
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,740
He's also jaundiced.

48
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,750
No, he isn't.

49
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,180
Paul's skin is definitely not the same color it was six months ago.

50
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,320
- Paul? - I looked at his mouth

51
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,210
when he was telling me about his daughter.

52
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,450
- She just... - Walk with me.

53
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,060
Say nothing.

54
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,340
Hey, Shaun.

55
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,660
Do a CVC, CMP,

56
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,090
amylase, lipase, CA-19 levels,

57
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,460
and CT abdomen, pelvis pancreatic protocol,

58
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,280
and do not tell him why.

59
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,930
You want me to lie?

60
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't want you to tell the truth.

61
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,050
The discoloration, if there is any, is very minor.

62
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,860
I don't want you scaring the crap out of the man over nothing.

63
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,530
Excellent. I've been practicing lying.

64
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,560
I lied to you before

65
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,830
when I said I just wanted to get out of my apartment and to work.

66
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,150
Take Claire.

67
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,940
Hello. I'm Dr. Lim.

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,370
How can I help you today...

69
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,300
Asha?

70
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,320
I want plastic surgery.

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,240
Sweetheart, this is the Emergency Room.

72
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,650
If you want, I can make an appointment for you...

73
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,020
Well, you do vaginal rejuvenation, right?

74
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,960
Yes...

75
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,090
On much older, much vainer women,

76
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,060
generally after having many children.

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
I don't know what the boys have told you...

78
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,360
Examine me.

79
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,790
Please.

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Please take off your underwear.

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,040
Were you in an accident?

82
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,040
No.

83
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,660
Can you help me?

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,550
- Did your father do this to you? - No.

85
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,010
- Please just... - Did your mother...

86
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,250
I need to know who did this to you.

87
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,300
No, you don't! It doesn't matter who...

88
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,990
When I was 2 years old...

89
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,570
I was... tied down, and I was circumcised.

90
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,270
Please.

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,070
I'm hideous.

92
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,980
Will you help me?

93
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,850
Yes.

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,720
Why do you need to confirm a diagnosis of acid reflux?

95
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,850
Because we're doctors. It's what we do.

96
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,590
We just like to be sure of everything.

97
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,320
There are a few remote possibilities...

98
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,670
I've got this!

99
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,720
Are you familiar with the hospital employee manual

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,310
section 17, subsection C, triple I?

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,560
- No. - Good.

102
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,980
- Good? - Yes.

103
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,540
It requires that

104
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,570
all employees shall be subject to,

105
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,750
and I quote,

106
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,500
"Any and all possible necessary tests 

107
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,300
to confirm any and all diagnoses,

108
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,220
no matter how mundane, the cost of which tests

109
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,080
shall be borne by the hospital," end quote.

110
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,220
The Board wants to make sure

111
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,030
that no one is exposed to patients

112
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,750
if there is any chance that they have

113
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,900
any communicable condition.

114
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,480
I had the flu last week.

115
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,650
Why didn't anybody do anything for me then?

116
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,070
- It's a new policy. - You might have pancreatic cancer.

117
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,150
What?

118
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,950
What'd he say?

119
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,250
Female genital mutilation

120
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,020
is the ritual cutting or removal of some, or all,

121
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,160
of the external female genitalia.

122
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,830
Over 200 million victims worldwide.

123
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,590
It is almost universally practiced

124
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,440
in a number of African and Asian countries.

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Where was she born?

126
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,250
Wisconsin.

127
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,470
Yeah, it's way more common here than you think.

128
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,290
- What religion is she? - I didn't ask.

129
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,460
This isn't about religion.

130
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,090
No legit religious organization endorses this stuff.

131
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,650
We're gonna do the labiaplasty first thing in the morning.

132
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,230
The damage done to her nerves is not going to get undone,

133
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,810
nor is the psych damage,

134
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,350
but at least she'll look like other girls.

135
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,050
We should be able to have her out of here by 6:00 in the evening.

136
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,060
Outpatient? Why the hurry?

137
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,710
So her mother will simply think she's in school,

138
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,310
then out studying with her friends.

139
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,810
She loves her parents and doesn't want to tell them

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,420
that she's rejecting one of their cultural traditions.

141
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,690
They won't stay in the dark for long,

142
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,020
since we're legally obligated to report them.

143
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,120
That "Cultural tradition" also fits the definition of abuse.

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
And they'll also find out when we ask

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
for their permission to do this surgery.

146
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,810
She's a minor.

147
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,270
Her ID says she's 18.

148
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes, her fake ID says she's 18.

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,760
Her number starts with an "H,"

150
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,950
Which means she was born in the '50s.

151
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,850
Also, the photo background is green instead of blue.

152
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,600
Also six other things.

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,140
Maybe we can get Legal to get a court order...

154
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,200
If I believe that ID is real,

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,530
then I am entitled to perform this surgery

156
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,500
without seeking consent of anyone other than the patient.

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,570
And, as legally required within 36 hours,

158
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,310
I will report the evidence of abuse

159
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,190
under the name and address listed on that ID.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,810
If the investigation of that report

161
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,420
doesn't begin until the girl is long gone

162
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,580
and happens to lead nowhere because the name wasn't real,

163
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,990
that's no fault of mine.

164
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,150
Are you sure you want to risk your medical license

165
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,490
to protect an abusive mother?

166
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,920
If we do this by the book,

167
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,070
we never see that girl again and no one gets help.

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,170
If we do this by the book, maybe the cops lock the parents up.

169
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,590
We shine a light on this thing, her community gets scared,

170
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,620
and maybe the next girl doesn't need our help.

171
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,540
Or maybe the testimony of the girl

172
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,290
about what happened to her when she was 2

173
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,910
doesn't help the cops at all.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,060
Maybe the parents just take their daughter home,

175
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,710
and maybe we scare the next girl

176
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,910
into not even asking for help.

177
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,130
I'm doing the surgery to this girl

178
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,610
under this name tomorrow morning at 7:00 A.M.

179
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,160
I can't believe people ever lie.

180
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,310
There are so many questions people might ask you,

181
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,160
but if you tell the truth,

182
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,310
you already know the answers.

183
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,640
And, also, it's wrong.

184
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,760
But sometimes,

185
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,380
you shouldn't tell the whole truth?

186
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,170
No. Of course not.

187
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,510
Because that lets you be honorable

188
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,370
and tell the truth and be a good person,

189
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,260
but at the same time,

190
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,820
you get to completely deceive the person.

191
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,770
- No, I don't think that... - Lea came back.

192
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,150
Shaun, that's great.

193
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,760
She's staying with me until she finds her own place.

194
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,950
You must be so excited.

195
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,330
Yes.

196
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,810
You're not excited?

197
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,310
I said, "Yes."

198
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,410
Paul has one year to live.

199
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,950
He has pancreatic cancer.

200
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,990
Stage III.

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,630
There are no metastatic lesions, but there are local nodes involved.

202
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,180
And there's partial encasement of the superior mesenteric artery.

203
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,820
That puts it past the point where we can cure with local resection.

204
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,910
We could do Whipple surgery.

205
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,100
That's not advised for stage III pancreatic cancer.

206
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,750
Not quite. It's not advised for stage IV.

207
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,040
For stage III, it's discretionary.

208
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,780
In my discretion,

209
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,680
he's better off with 12 semi-comfortable months,

210
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
rather than running the risk of dying on the table tomorrow.

211
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,740
If he doesn't die on the table, he could have many years.

212
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,710
It isn't our call to make.

213
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,810
I'll talk to Paul, advise him of the parameters,

214
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,350
let him make his own decision.

215
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,760
No.

216
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,200
Shaun should do it.

217
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,890
Claire can do it.

218
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,450
Yes, she can, which is why you should do it.

219
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,200
This is a teaching hospital.

220
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,630
Andrews is right...

221
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,670
Being a surgeon isn't just about cutting.

222
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Would it be okay if we spoke someplace more quiet?

223
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,570
You need someplace quiet to tell me I have acid reflux?

224
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,020
I think we should be someplace quiet

225
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,210
because people sometimes get very upset

226
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,360
when they find out they probably only have less than a year to live.

227
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,690
Okay, uh...

228
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,320
Can I call my family?

229
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,290
They should probably hear what you have to say, too.

230
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,700
I'd rather just talk to...

231
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,020
Of course you can.

232
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,690
I'll elevate it with a 6-inch Ambler tissue hook.

233
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,050
You separate the underlying tissue with iris forceps.

234
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,810
I got it. Tenotomy scissors.

235
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,330
I think we're actually a little ahead of schedule.

236
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,360
Might be able to get her home in time to do her homework.

237
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,740
Back to the bosom of her loving family.

238
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,660
We'd remove as much of the cancer as possible

239
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,620
by removing the head of the pancreas

240
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,930
and other attached organs,

241
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,610
but then, we'd have to reconstruct the anatomy.

242
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,920
The easiest way to do that

243
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,890
is to bring up a loop of jejunum...

244
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,560
Shaun.

245
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,720
Sorry.

246
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,450
The jejunum is part of the small intestine

247
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,870
between the duodenum and ileum.

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,030
It's complicated, very dangerous surgery.

249
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,490
And even if it's successful,

250
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,700
post-operative complications are frequent and serious.

251
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,270
And recovery can be very painful.

252
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,090
But if it works, he's better? He'll be healthy?

253
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,220
He would still need chemotherapy

254
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,050
and a lifetime of monitoring.

255
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,830
But hopefully, a long lifetime.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
Let's do it, Dad.

257
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,420
What do you say?

258
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,640
What should I do?

259
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,720
It's your decision.

260
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,220
All we can do is present you with the facts.

261
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah, here are the facts, Dad...

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,900
The surgery may kill you.

263
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,630
Not doing the surgery will kill you.

264
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,950
Can you give us a few minutes?

265
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,800
Of course.

266
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,430
It was very nice of Dr. Andrews to give you an office,

267
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,190
even though, you're on medical leave.

268
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,600
Yeah, he is a prince.

269
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,390
Who's your surgeon going to be?

270
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,550
I haven't d...

271
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,580
I haven't decided yet.

272
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
You should definitely go with

273
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,020
Dr. Joshua Atkinson at Stanford Medical Center.

274
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,430
His mortality index is .3.

275
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,580
It's too low.

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,170
Not enough of his patients are dying?

277
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,400
No, Shaun, sometimes patients die.

278
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Doesn't matter how good the doctor is.

279
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,780
But when your mortality rate is as low as Atkinson's,

280
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,770
it means you're turning away patients.

281
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,770
You turn away patients, it means you lack confidence.

282
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,750
You lack confidence, I don't want you inside my head.

283
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,630
And I'd like to be able to dress myself

284
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
when I'm all done.

285
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,650
Shaun, what are you doing here?

286
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,790
You showed up at work early this morning.

287
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,550
Go home. Get some rest.

288
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,470
I won't rest if I go home.

289
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,590
The surgery went great.

290
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,570
Once everything's healed,

291
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,120
I think you'll be very happy with the results.

292
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,570
What time is it?

293
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,210
Not quite 5:45.

294
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,000
We just need you to pee, and...

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,020
I need to go home.

296
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,390
And you will... very soon.

297
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,360
It hurts.

298
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,620
I told you it would.

299
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,560
We did a lot of cutting and scraping.

300
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,420
You had a lot of scar tissue.

301
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,380
It hurts a lot.

302
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,950
We'll give you some Tylenol,

303
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,040
and you can tell your mother you're cramping.

304
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,610
Hang ketamine... 130 micrograms per kilogram per hour.

305
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,780
Why does it hurt this much?

306
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
I don't know.

307
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,670
But you're not going home.

308
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,650
She's heavily sedated.

309
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,220
What did we do to her?

310
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,150
What if this is good news?

311
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,340
I know you haven't been a doctor all that long,

312
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,430
but pain is rarely a sign of good news.

313
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,410
It is if you're talking about a part of the body

314
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,580
you thought was dead.

315
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,760
What if this means there's still viable nerve endings in there?

316
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,960
What if this means we can actually reconstruct her clitoris

317
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,770
and that it's capable of sensation?

318
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,900
Maybe. All we know for sure

319
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,780
is she's not gonna be home anywhere near 6:00,

320
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,640
which means we're about to have a missing child on our hands.

321
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,210
We have to bring Andrews up to speed.

322
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,140
I did a bad job of telling you that you're dying.

323
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,090
Is there a good way?

324
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,940
I can't figure out when I'm supposed to lie,

325
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,230
when I'm supposed to tell part of the truth.

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,820
And it doesn't really matter,

327
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,660
because I can't figure out how to do it anyway.

328
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,370
You did fine with me.

329
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,660
You never need to lie.

330
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,580
Lies don't protect you from the truth.

331
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,030
I don't like your haircut.

332
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,350
Okay.

333
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Maybe sometimes, when the truth can't help someone...

334
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,220
you should definitely just lie.

335
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,710
Do you think praying will help you reach a decision?

336
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,010
I've already reached a decision.

337
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm praying to help me find comfort with that decision.

338
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,550
My family wants the surgery.

339
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,980
And what do you want?

340
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,280
I want what my family wants.

341
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,800
I love them.

342
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
But they love you, too, right?

343
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,670
Don't they want what you want?

344
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,040
Long ago, I made a decision

345
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,560
to be there for them

346
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,460
no matter what.

347
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,960
And if the last choice I make in my life

348
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,070
is consistent with that,

349
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,180
I'm comfortable with that.

350
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,290
I'm surprised by you.

351
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,640
I, arguably, made errors in judgment,

352
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,790
but it was all in an effort to help a patient.

353
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,310
Yes, and that would make sense if you thought

354
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,230
you'd never have another patient ever again.

355
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,250
And if there wasn't currently an opening for Chief of Surgery.

356
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,720
I didn't know that was on the table.

357
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,150
See, that's the difference between you and Melendez.

358
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,750
I have no doubt that as soon as I got this promotion,

359
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,830
Melendez had done the math and reacted accordingly.

360
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,420
But I suspect that even if you had done the math,

361
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,400
it wouldn't have changed how you handled this patient.

362
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,310
I don't view that as a weakness.

363
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,320
I'll handle the administrative fallout.

364
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,130
You...

365
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,950
notify the parents immediately.

366
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,200
I can't.

367
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,660
We don't know the girl's real name,

368
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,850
and we have to keep her sedated,

369
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,820
so there's no way we can track...

370
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,890
She's a teenager. She's got a phone.

371
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,440
Next time it rings, answer it.

372
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,170
- You feel the mesenteric artery pulsing? - Yes.

373
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,010
You shouldn't. You're too close to the vein.

374
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,120
Great. Dr. Browne, pass a penrose drain through.

375
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,520
Bovie.

376
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,110
Suction.

377
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,730
Got it all.

378
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,540
I see leaking pancreatic fluid.

379
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,290
That'll eat holes in everything it touches.

380
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,160
Our duct tie didn't hold.

381
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,750
Suction. Needle driver.

382
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,510
Excellent.

383
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,350
You have approved a scrub nurse

384
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,270
and a circulating nurse and seven other personnel.

385
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,350
Everyone and everything is covered,

386
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,910
except for an actual surgeon.

387
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,890
Yeah. I think we may have to postpone.

388
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,210
Have you notified your tumor to stop growing in the interim?

389
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,620
I think any possible damage from a delay

390
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,280
may be more than offset by having somebody competent

391
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,660
digging around in my brain.

392
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,710
"Competent"?

393
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,790
- What's wrong with Sanders? - 6% mortality rate.

394
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,610
- Taylor? - I don't like the way he's planning on

395
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,880
dealing with a carotid tear.

396
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,070
- That's nowhere near your tumor. - It's the principle.

397
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,410
- Unger? - He doesn't like me.

398
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,540
- No one likes you. - No! You don't like me.

399
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,220
He doesn't like me. That's two.

400
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,610
Just pick a name. I don't care who.

401
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,070
I don't care if they're a doctor.

402
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,510
Just pick a name.

403
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,630
Because in 48 hours, you're either getting your surgery

404
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,410
or you're getting a new oncologist.

405
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,560
She's in pain.

406
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,530
That's why she's asleep right now,

407
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,470
because of what you did to her?

408
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,120
What I did to her

409
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,460
I believe revealed that what you did to her

410
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,010
didn't do as much damage as we initially feared.

411
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,350
We want to do a second surgery...

412
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,970
How can you stop her pain?

413
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,790
It's called clitoral reconstruction.

414
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,910
The nerves of her clitoris are exposed.

415
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,120
We can sheath them using...

416
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,780
Our daughter wants this?

417
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,650
Asha wants to be like other girls.

418
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,080
She wants to be able to...

419
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,390
Mara told you that?

420
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,630
That's our daughter's name.

421
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,460
Not Asha.

422
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,800
You don't know her at all.

423
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,710
We need to do this surgery to relieve her pain.

424
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,940
No. There must be another way.

425
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,520
We want a second opinion.

426
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,020
Not at this hospital.

427
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,270
How soon can our daughter be moved?

428
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,690
Excuse me, Dr. Lim.

429
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,770
I am Ellen Vahtra from Child Protective Services.

430
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,130
Until I complete my review,

431
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,850
I'm afraid you're not going to be moving your daughter anywhere.

432
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,090
How did it go? Is Dad okay?

433
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,330
There were complications,

434
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,570
but we found solutions.

435
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,780
It went very well. We got it all.

436
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,170
Oh, my...

437
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,530
There's still...

438
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
I don't think I did that well.

439
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,000
They're too happy.

440
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Post-surgical complications are still a major concern that they...

441
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,190
Let them enjoy the good news.

442
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,970
Is deceiving someone in a way that makes them happy

443
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,940
better than deceiving someone in a way that makes them sad?

444
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,140
Shaun. I think there's someone here to see you.

445
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,780
I had some time,

446
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,190
so I thought you might want to have some lunch with me?

447
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,110
I do not have time.

448
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,040
What's wrong?

449
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,620
What did she do?

450
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,500
Shaun. Sha...

451
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,180
You don't want to talk to Lea. I don't understand.

452
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,850
I don't understand!

453
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,990
I don't understand!

454
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,450
You're not being fair to her or yourself.

455
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,940
- She's always been nice to you. - No, she hasn't.

456
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,230
She's your friend.

457
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,620
Whatever's happened, you have to talk to her about it.

458
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,540
Be honest about what you're feeling...

459
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,110
I can't be.

460
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,210
Of course you can.

461
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,650
I don't know...

462
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,740
I don't know how I feel!

463
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,080
I can't be honest if I don't know how I feel!

464
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,270
Our 16-year-old daughter

465
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,440
is lying in a hospital bed unconscious

466
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,650
to protect her from overwhelming pain

467
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,760
because of what this place

468
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,470
did to her without our permission.

469
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,530
And you are investigating us?

470
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,670
Your daughter is suffering

471
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,830
because you butchered her when she was 2 years old.

472
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,750
Dr. Lim, please refrain from unsubstantiated allegations.

473
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,270
Either they're the butchers or they're protecting the butchers.

474
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,780
If you didn't do it, tell us who did.

475
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,620
It was an aunt and a grandmother from Kenya.

476
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,750
They were watching Mara while we were on vacation.

477
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,620
Well, you must've been horrified.

478
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,620
Did you take her to a doctor?

479
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,190
That girl's sex organs were covered with scar tissue.

480
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,850
She had no medical attention to treat any of her wounds.

481
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,880
She was fine.

482
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,880
She was happy, laughing.

483
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,510
It's not that big a deal.

484
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,390
I was cut.

485
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,950
My mother was cut. Her mother was cut.

486
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,870
It is a rite of passage connecting our women to their ancestors.

487
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,790
She will not find a husband in our culture if she's...

488
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,070
So she'll find someone else.

489
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,610
It's not that big a deal.

490
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
These parents forfeited the right to make any calls

491
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,510
about their daughter a long time ago.

492
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,720
Our daughter is an honor student,

493
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,750
taking three AP classes in her junior year,

494
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,810
went on a mission to Haiti to build a school.

495
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,590
We have raised her well.

496
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,260
She is a good person.

497
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,920
We're proud of her.

498
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,680
I'm sure she is a good person.

499
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,570
But you are not gonna convince me

500
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,570
that what happened to Mara when she was 2 years old

501
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,770
is anything short of an abomination.

502
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,690
But that's not the issue today.

503
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,150
The issue is, how do we best help this girl now?

504
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,670
The clitoral reconstruction should protect the exposed nerve.

505
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,400
"Should"?

506
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,340
That is the surgery that, in my medical opinion,

507
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,210
is called for.

508
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,870
But it's not the only option?

509
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,640
We could oblate the peripheral nerves

510
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,810
and remove the remaining clitoral tissue.

511
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,350
And is that surgery safer or more dangerous?

512
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,640
It's simpler, but that's not the only factor here.

513
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,750
It's the only factor to us.

514
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,900
We want to know that our daughter

515
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,180
won't spend the rest of her life in pain.

516
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,640
Please.

517
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,240
For a moment,

518
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,390
can we think about something other than Mara's pain?

519
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,020
Can we think about her pleasure?

520
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,620
We have a chance to give her

521
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,370
a healthy, meaningful sex life.

522
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,610
That is what she came here looking for.

523
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,410
Wake her up.

524
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,550
She's in pain, and she's already told me what she wanted.

525
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,160
Yesterday, she was requesting cosmetic surgery.

526
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,390
Today, you're asking her to risk a lifetime of pain

527
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,930
for a chance at pleasure.

528
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,310
From everything I've heard,

529
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,300
she's mature enough to make the call herself,

530
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,220
even if it means suffering for a few minutes to do so.

531
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,490
Dr. Unger has a mortality index

532
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,910
that is not too high and not too low.

533
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,120
It's not gonna be Unger.

534
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,950
You have not eliminated Dr. Ko.

535
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,770
Not yet.

536
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,650
I may have to go out of state to find a neurosurgeon.

537
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,630
Plus, I may have to find myself a new oncologist.

538
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,450
You've used Dr. Ko many times.

539
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,010
Did you think she might kill your patients?

540
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,700
No.

541
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,180
Do you think you're better than them?

542
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes, a little.

543
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,250
That was a joke.

544
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,480
You don't want to talk about this.

545
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
No, I don't want to talk about this, Shaun.

546
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,140
That, in fact, is the point of the alcohol.

547
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,510
Okay, I understand.

548
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,600
Good.

549
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,900
Why can't we talk about it?

550
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,830
Because it's upsetting.

551
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,630
Is that why you're stalling?

552
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,740
Because you're afraid of dying?

553
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm not afraid of dying.

554
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,780
Really?

555
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,140
Why not?

556
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,140
You should be. Dying is terrible.

557
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,040
Yes, dying is terrible.

558
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,290
But there are worse things.

559
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,250
What's worse than dying?

560
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,470
Not dying.

561
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,490
That doesn't make sense.

562
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,850
Makes sense to me.

563
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,870
That doesn't make sense.

564
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,850
That's the middle ground, Shaun.

565
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,160
Brain surgeries have a tendency

566
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,820
to end in the middle ground.

567
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,460
Brain surgeries can be considered a success

568
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,500
even when the patient ends up compromised.

569
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,010
He can't walk. He can't talk.

570
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,530
His hand can't stop shaking.

571
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,960
I've been terrible at a lot of things in my life,

572
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,380
but I am damn smart.

573
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,090
And I am a damn good surgeon.

574
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,190
And if I can't be those things,

575
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,760
then I don't know who I'd be.

576
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
You'd be my friend.

577
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,900
Well, thank you, Shaun.

578
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,040
I have to go. My patient just crashed.

579
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,970
It's not enough. Is it?

580
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,550
No.

581
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,680
I'm sorry it isn't.

582
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,740
Mom. Dad.

583
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,490
We're here.

584
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,410
We love you.

585
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,580
We just don't understand why you would turn your back.

586
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,890
Hello, Mara.

587
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,120
I'm Ellen Vahtra. I'm a social worker.

588
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,720
Your parents know what happened,

589
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,750
and Dr. Lim gave you a nerve block.

590
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,270
It hurts. It still hurts.

591
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,980
I understand that, and we are going to try to get you

592
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,800
back to sleep as quickly as possible.

593
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,900
But something happened during your surgery,

594
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,720
and we need you to make a decision about what is done next.

595
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,410
We believe that, despite what was done to you as a child,

596
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,750
the reason you're in so much pain because you still have

597
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,650
functioning nerves in your clitoris,

598
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,330
nerves that had been covered with scar tissue.

599
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,070
I'd like to repair that.

600
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,170
We can make you physiologically complete.

601
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,450
But there's no guarantee that it would work.

602
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,790
I'm confident.

603
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,830
There is a safer choice.

604
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,500
We could...remove your entire clitoris.

605
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,800
This is your choice.

606
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,260
You will be protected no matter what.

607
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,570
Take it out.

608
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,240
Mara, we can make you whole...

609
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,600
I made a mistake. Take it out.

610
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,240
She's on medication. She's in pain...

611
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,440
Dr. Lim, please let her go back to sleep.

612
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,570
And prepare to operate to remove the damaged tissue.

613
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,740
Hang fresh, frozen plasma, too.

614
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,970
Looks like he's going into DIC.

615
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,100
Give me another hemostat. BP's 71 over 53.

616
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,690
We should have warned the family.

617
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,900
Can't see anything in here. There's too much blood.

618
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,940
- More suction. - I think you got the hepatic artery.

619
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,110
The warning wouldn't have made any difference.

620
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,730
The bleeding is not slowing down.

621
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,900
We need to send the aorta to the celiac.

622
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,860
I need to see it to clamp it.

623
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,320
They would have been prepared.

624
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
A-line systolic's 54. He's bottoming out.

625
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,910
No, they wouldn't.

626
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,910
You two, shut up and pack his abdomen with laps

627
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,350
while I sort through this mess.

628
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,400
I won't do it.

629
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,250
Can we appeal this? Do you know?

630
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,960
I've spoken with our legal department.

631
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,710
Unless we can prove the social worker was biased,

632
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,040
we are stuck with this ruling.

633
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,200
Well, then you're also stuck with "I won't do it."

634
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,490
You're a good doctor. This hospital will miss you.

635
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,470
You're gonna fire me because I won't butcher a teenage girl?

636
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,540
Of course I am.

637
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,470
This hospital will face lawsuits, suspensions,

638
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,020
perhaps criminal charges,

639
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,040
and this little girl will still get the surgery you hate.

640
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,260
Could Dr. Lim at least talk to Mara again?

641
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,300
You want to wake her up again in pain?

642
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,570
Every woman deserves the right

643
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,030
to make decisions about her sexuality

644
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,810
without her parents hanging over her.

645
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,570
Okay.

646
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,460
When I was 15 years old,

647
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,090
my father caught me with a boy.

648
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,030
I mean, we weren't doing it,

649
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,350
but my top was off and

650
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,850
well, it doesn't matter.

651
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,470
My father hit me.

652
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,230
I still have a small scar.

653
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,310
Our relationship was never the same.

654
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,570
But that's what growing up is.

655
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,900
Not everyone gets called a slut.

656
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,820
gets butchered.

657
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,550
But everyone becomes a man or a woman

658
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,200
and stops being a child.

659
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,010
I want to take a piece of tissue from inside your cheek

660
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,540
and I want to graft it to your clitoris.

661
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,010
We can make you feel...love.

662
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,100
I can't turn my back on my family, on my traditions.

663
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,980
Traditions

664
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,230
connect us to the past.

665
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,740
What about the future?

666
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,700
Please.

667
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,120
No. I'm in pain.

668
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,320
Cross-clamping his aorta.

669
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,560
He's in ventricular fibrillation.

670
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,100
Starting chest compressions.

671
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,820
- Okay. - Everybody clear.

672
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,380
Prep the cheek, as well.

673
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,610
She's taking the graft? The paperwork doesn't say...

674
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,970
She consented verbally.

675
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,490
We didn't want to keep her awake any longer

676
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,970
than absolutely necessary.

677
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,730
I wanted to help her as much as you...

678
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,150
when she wanted help.

679
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,570
- But if she doesn't want this... - She wants this.

680
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,650
Dr. Lim just told us.

681
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,610
Prep the cheek.

682
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,380
I'll tell the family.

683
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,840
No.

684
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,970
Claire, you do it.

685
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,300
This isn't the time for learning.

686
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,620
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,370
Paul died during surgery.

688
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,560
He had a gastroduodenal artery rupture.

689
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,400
It's a common complication of a Whipple surgery,

690
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,930
especially when someone's cancer was...

691
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,220
as advanced as his was.

692
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,470
We...did everything we could for as long as we could.

693
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,430
He didn't suffer.

694
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,400
You did this to him.

695
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,280
Dad didn't want this.

696
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,950
You saw that look on his face. He was scared.

697
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,180
In my experience, it does no good to dwell...

698
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,750
Of course he was scared.

699
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,840
That doesn't mean...

700
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,220
He just wanted to live his last few months.

701
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,330
Stop it.

702
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,730
Nobody made your father do anything.

703
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,500
He knew the risks.

704
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,380
It's your fault, too, Mom.

705
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,140
All of us.

706
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,890
He would do anything for us.

707
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,890
We killed our father.

708
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,820
It's not true.

709
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,950
Paul wanted this surgery.

710
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,540
He told me he wanted this surgery.

711
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,820
Was that true?

712
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,080
Paul told me...

713
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,910
when the truth can't help someone,

714
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,620
we should lie.

715
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,970
Mom?

716
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,060
How are you? Does anything hurt?

717
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,810
Not much. I'm better.

718
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,520
Looks like she's doing well.

719
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,780
Thank you, Doctor.

720
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,860
There should still be some discomfort at the surgical site.

721
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,990
A nurse will bring you some...

722
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,250
Sorry.

723
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,600
A nurse will bring you some Tylenol,

724
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,750
which should really be all you need.

725
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,420
Thank you.

726
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,050
You're gonna be great.

727
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,330
You're here.

728
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,680
Yes. I live here.

729
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,970
You know that.

730
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,810
Well, I was starting to doubt it the last couple of days.

731
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,000
You come home after I'm asleep.

732
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,380
You leave before I can even get up.

733
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,840
Thank you.

734
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,020
Please take this.

735
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,160
No, this is yours, Shaun.

736
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,830
I gave it to you to remember me by.

737
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,150
It hurt.

738
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,010
I didn't want to tell you the truth

739
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,800
because I didn't know it,

740
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,790
but I have to tell you the truth because it will help.

741
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,210
Every night, I would come home,

742
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,720
and I would look at that baseball,

743
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,590
and I would think of you.

744
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,740
The baseball was here,

745
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,770
but you weren't.

746
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,160
That's sweet.

747
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,950
No, it isn't.

748
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,480
It hurt.

749
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,940
You hurt me.

750
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,960
Okay, Shaun, you know...

751
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,000
You went away, and it hurt,

752
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,780
and it kept hurting, and now you're back.

753
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,390
If you stay, you will go away again,

754
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,290
and it will hurt again.

755
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,420
So I want you to go back to Hershey.

756
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,520
I know you don't mean that, and I know...

757
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,020
Please go back to Hershey

758
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,220
or anywhere other than here!

759
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,500
Feeling okay?

760
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,710
Yeah, sure, superduper.

761
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,670
I want to thank you for your trust.

762
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,840
I'll do my best to deserve it.

763
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,590
Well, that's all I can ask.

764
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,390
You know the drill.

765
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,560
10...

766
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,730
9...

767
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,530
8...

768
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,450
7...
