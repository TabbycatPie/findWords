{\an7}{\pos(10,10)}BGM: If Ever There's A Reason by Derby

23

{\an9}♪ If ever there's a reason to be swept up in the season ♪

24
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,340

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,870
You won't believe the crap Armen pulled last night.

41
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,970
He cut the power to my apartment!

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,840
That's right!

43
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,670
No lights, no Wi-Fi, nothing.

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,280
For 15 minutes!

45
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,990
And if I had been on a ventilator,

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,570
I could've suffocated in that time, right?

47
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,630
You're a doctor.

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,100
You're not on a ventilator.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,660
Thank God for that. But I could be.

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,010
I mean, it was dark. I could've tripped.

51
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,300
I should sue him.

52
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,900
Sorry. Were you gonna eat this?

53
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,010
I stress eat.

54
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,330
Okay, listen.

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,200
I go to talk to him,

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,280
and he claims I was playing my music too loud again.

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,690
I wear earplugs when your music irritates me.

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,480
I miss the dripping.

59
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,280
You're missing the point here, Shaun, okay?

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
You knock. You ask.

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,370
You don't cut someone's power.

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,730
You knock, right?

63
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,490
Of course, you would knock. Any normal person would.

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,180
I mean, am I crazy or is he a total sociopath?

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,780
You should get headphones.

66
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,610
Headphones?

67
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,520
They would eliminate the sound.

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,350
Yeah. I got it.

69
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,040
Thank you.

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,480
Thank you for being so objective about this.

71
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,340
In fact, why don't you go help Armen

72
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,930
write my eviction notice!

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,460
Yeah, and I'll never drive down that street again.

74
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,030
It's a pretty bad memory.

75
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,620
Yeah, that sounds pretty...

76
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,560
Wait, it's kind of hot for a hike, isn't it?

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,410
We're hiking. We're gonna sweat. It happens.

78
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,560
All right, don't do nothing stupid!

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,950
Open the register and put everything in the bag!

80
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,810
Come on! Right now! 

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,010
Don't move. Give me your wallets, phones, everything.

82
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,390
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

83
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,560
I said get out your wallet!

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,770
Do it now!

85
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,070
Wallet, now!

86
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,280
Is he okay? 

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,190
We don't know. This is routed through Basecamp.

88
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,180
It says Shaun was there,

89
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,270
but it didn't say if he was hurt or not.

90
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,140
Well, EMS has two critical inbounding.

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,040
Their hands are a little full to chat right now.

92
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
20-year-old female.

93
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,320
Single gunshot wound to the abdomen.

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,780
Hypotensive and tachy.

95
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,210
Two liters of saline en route.

96
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,300
Her name's Avery.

97
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
We'll take good care of her.

98
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
Jared, you're with me.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,660
Blunt-force neck injury.

100
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,480
Oxygen sats just dropped below 80.

101
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,580
Trachea's crushed.

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,010
I inserted a laryngeal mask,

103
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,340
but the airway is not secured.

104
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,810
Are you okay? You weren't hurt?

105
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,510
His oropharyngeal anatomy is distorted from the confusion.

106
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,310
Subcutaneous emphysema. He's barely moving air.

107
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,550
Let's take him to a bay, and get me an O.R. now.

108
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,540
I need four units O-Negative type and cross her.

109
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,480
She has decreased breath sounds on her left.

110
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,400
Let's get a chest X-ray on her.

111
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,490
What the hell is he doing here?

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,070
It's his fault.

113
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,770
This is all his fault!

114
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,510
Yeah, clerk says the guy entered,

115
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,580
shouted orders,

116
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,440
and apparently, your doctor didn't comply.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,540
Girl gets shot,

118
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,160
and the store clerk clocks the gunman with a bat.

119
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,700
- That's all we know. - All right, what do you need?

120
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,510
I need forensics on the gunman and the girl.

121
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,130
All right, we'll let you know what we find out.

122
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,190
Police are gonna want to talk to you.

123
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,510
After that, you can go home.

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,760
I should be helping. My shift is just starting. 

125
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,560
You were at the shooting. I don't have time to hold your hand.

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,330
I don't like my hand being held.

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,440
Small-caliber bullets.

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,530
They ricochet inside.

129
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,510
They can cause multiple and unpredictable injuries.

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,050
And what do we need to do about it?

131
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,850
Chest and abdominal X-rays

132
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,590
and a Focused Assessment Sonogram.

133
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,370
Three units of O-neg and...

134
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,400
We could use your help over here, Dr. Melendez!

135
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you okay?

136
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,720
Yes, I'm fine.

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,970
You're with me.

138
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,450
- Get a gown on him. - Okay.

139
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,640
Entrance wound is down here.

140
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,070
The bullet fractured the pelvis on the way in.

141
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,350
All right, let's look for an exit wound.

142
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,090
We're gonna roll her on three. One, two, three.

143
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,290
All right, got it.

144
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,450
Between the second and third rib.

145
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,730
She's hemorrhaging here, too.

146
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,810
Hey, Murphy, get us the ultrasound 

147
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,440
so we can find out what's inside.

148
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,780
Focused Assessment with Sonography and Trauma.

149
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,600
No chest contusions or secondary injuries evident.

150
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,740
Oxygen sat's 70.

151
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,470
I can't squeeze a camera past this collapse.

152
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,360
O.R. 3 is prepped and ready, but that's it.

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,210
We got a full house right now up in surgery.

154
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,600
- Next show time is 15 minutes out. - I could use it.

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,930
I gotta get this bleeding under control.

156
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,360
What's the status on your guy?

157
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,150
Take her up. Take the gunshot.

158
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,840
Hold on.

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,370
His airway's so damaged, I can't even do a tracheotomy.

160
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,110
He's got five minutes until anoxic brain dead.

161
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,070
Mine's got pressure. I'll see what I can do here.

162
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,370
You're scrubbing in with me.

163
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,920
Go ahead and feed the tube under the collapsed trachea.

164
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,130
Starting high flow O2.

165
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,960
And we're good.

166
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,400
Now that our patient is actually breathing,

167
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,940
we can realign and repair.

168
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,160
Four-O on a driver.

169
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,010
Scissors. Sponge stick.

170
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,040
It's a slippery thing letting your feelings about a patient

171
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,790
influence your medical judgment.

172
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,440
I didn't.

173
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,590
I get the instinct -- She's a victim.

174
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,830
He's a shooter, a racist.

175
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,390
Often we don't even know we're doing it.

176
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,350
I would never let my personal feelings impact a patient's care.

177
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,430
She was bleeding out.

178
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,870
And this guy just drew his first good breath 30 seconds ago.

179
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,840
They were both critical!

180
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,250
He was dying. You were wrong. Own it.

181
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,330
You know as well as I do that that was not an easy call to make.

182
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,630
- Do I? - Yes!

183
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,870
Clear the field, Dr. Browne.

184
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,510
Not my operative field.

185
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,370
The surgical field. Scrub out.

186
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,590
Excuse me?

187
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,540
You're done.

188
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,910
Step out of my O.R.

189
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,720
Gail, can you please relieve Dr. Browne of her instruments

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,710
and page Dr. Cleland to assist me?

191
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,680
Now, isn't this more pleasant?

192
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,880
Aside from the spleen, what else are we dealing with?

193
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,180
The bullet ruptured her transverse colon

194
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,400
at the splenic flexure.

195
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,990
Put it on our to-do list.

196
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,330
Why does her boyfriend think it's your fault?

197
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,730
It punctured her diaphragm here

198
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,840
and entered the posterior chest.

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,940
She's bleeding again. Clamp the hilum.

200
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,760
I already did. It's too damaged to hold.

201
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,640
Gauze!

202
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,750
Hold this right there. Don't let go.

203
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,480
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

204
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,550
It's gonna be like sewing ground beef back into a steak.

205
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,240
All right, new plan -- she's gonna have to live without her spleen.

206
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,340
Nurse to pick up.

207
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,530
Need a ligating suture on the splenic artery

208
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,670
while I make the cut.

209
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,530
Can you do that for me before this young lady bleeds out on us,

210
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,460
Murphy?

211
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,930
Yes.

212
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,310
Okay, let's move on to the bowel perf.

213
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,120
Shaun.

214
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,420
Ah, thank God you're all right.

215
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,340
I just heard what happened.

216
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,390
Shaun. Are you all right?

217
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes. I wasn't injured.

218
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,090
What happened this morning?

219
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,160
Lea ate my apple.

220
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,090
No, Shaun, at the store this morning.

221
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,210
What happened at the store?

222
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,150
Wallet now!

223
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,150
I can't.

224
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,240
Why the hell not?!

225
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,100
You said keep my hands where you could see them.

226
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,440
My wallet is in my pocket.

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,210
You can't see my hands if

228
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,550
-- Are you trying to be a hero?!

229
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,690
I'm a surgical resident --

230
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,980
Shut the hell up!

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,140
This isn't a game, man. I'm serious. Okay.

232
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,310
Put your damn phone and wallet on the ground right now.

233
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,350
Hey, do you see this, man? I am not playing around!

234
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,600
Just put your phone and wallet on the damn ground!

235
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,680
Come on, man, just -- just do what he says!

236
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,020
Please listen to him.

237
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,960
Shut up! Just shut up and get on your knees!

238
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,390
Put your hands and knees on the ground.

239
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,990
Get your wallet out right now.

240
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,440
I will shoot your crazy ass, I swear to God. Okay.

241
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,590
Are you listening to me?! I'll do it! Yes.

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,530
You hear me?

243
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,910
Oh, my God!

244
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,280
Okay.

245
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,050
You need to take the rest of the day off.

246
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,950
Dr. Melendez said that, too.

247
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,640
Why?

248
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,490
"Why?" Because you just experienced a traumatic event.

249
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,750
- It's not my fault. - I-I know that.

250
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,590
Avery has multiple injuries.

251
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,580
Dr. Melendez wants me to monitor her.

252
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,560
Dr. Lim.

253
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,370
I was out of line.

254
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,130
I shouldn't have argued with you.

255
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,580
Primary enclosure went well.

256
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,070
We'll extubate him in a few hours

257
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,560
to prevent any further internal damage.

258
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,550
Well, that's good.

259
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,870
It is, and you're gonna make sure he stays that way.

260
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,130
You'll be babysitting tonight in the ICU.

261
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm -- I'm not on call.

262
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,970
Great, then you're available.

263
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,200
Should be a quiet night.

264
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,920
Just want to keep an eye on those vitals.

265
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,910
You never know with tracheal tears.

266
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,300
Can't one of the ICU nurses do that?

267
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Yep.

268
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,370
But they didn't lip off in my operating room.

269
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,130
And he'd better be breathing in the morning.

270
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,850
Excuse me, but why is Shaun on the victim's case?

271
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,220
I assessed him, and he seemed perfectly capable.

272
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,140
You assessed him?

273
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,410
What does that mean? You asked him how he was feeling?

274
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,800
You psychic?

275
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,130
D-Do you have an advanced degree in psychology?

276
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,240
You don't know what's going on in his head.

277
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,020
When I'm in surgery,

278
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,160
my focus is on the person whose guts are open in front of me

279
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,770
rather than the soul of the person standing across from me.

280
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,610
No.

281
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,140
And it seems that Shaun doesn't let anything impact his work.

282
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,750
So, along with his photographic memory,

283
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,910
I'm putting cold-hearted in the plus column.

284
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,980
Dr. Murphy, do you understand why you're here?

285
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,870
Yes.

286
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,400
Dr. Glassman said I had to talk to you.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,370
After any doctor goes through a potentially traumatic --

288
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,610
You have to determine

289
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,110
if I'm a medicolegal liability to the hospital.

290
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,880
Yes. And, more importantly,

291
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,920
it's an opportunity to provide you with emotional support.

292
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,410
How are you feeling?

293
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,970
You don't have apples.

294
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,580
I'll try to have some fruit next time we meet.

295
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,910
Good.

296
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,030
Do you regret anything about this morning?

297
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,110
Why?

298
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,080
After bad things happen,

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,050
it's perfectly normal to replay the events,

300
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,320
wishing you had done things differently.

301
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,930
It already happened.

302
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,960
I can't do things differently.

303
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,690
Is talking about this upsetting you?

304
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,390
What are you thinking about right now?

305
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,180
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

306
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,000
The surgery went well.

307
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,200
After a serious trauma like this,

308
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,460
the body can develop a self-destructive inflammatory reaction.

309
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,330
Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart --

310
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,660
any or all of them can start to shut down.

311
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,400
We'll be giving her anti-inflammatories

312
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,140
and monitoring her closely,

313
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,730
but the next 24 hours are critical.

314
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,070
Okay. Thanks.

315
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,340
Just get her through this. Whatever you got to do.

316
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,190
Yeah, well, I need consent forms

317
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,760
from your girlfriend's next of kin.

318
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,710
If you could please get her family in here

319
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,000
as quickly as possible.

320
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,130
I can't. I...

321
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,370
I don't even know her last name.

322
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,150
It was our first date.

323
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,490
W-We met on a dating app.

324
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,420
We were going hiking,

325
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,040
so she wasn't carrying a purse or ID.

326
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,130
Well, then, you really don't need to be here.

327
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,110
Someone out there cares about her.

328
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,030
If she dies,

329
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,950
I want them to know someone was with her.

330
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,060
I'll have social work try to locate her family.

331
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,190
Stay as long as you want.

332
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,440
It looks clean, dry, and healthy.

333
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,010
My neck is killing me.

334
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,070
How long have you been using?

335
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
What's that got to do with anything?

336
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,910
Well, you likely built up a tolerance to pain meds.

337
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,130
Now that you really need them,

338
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:09,820
they aren't there for you.

339
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,470
That's why I need fentanyl.

340
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,380
100 micrograms. Are you gonna help me or not?

341
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,650
That wouldn't be helping.

342
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,100
The worst thing I can do for you is feed your habit.

343
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,790
What?

344
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,690
You saw my tattoo.

345
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,660
Yeah.

346
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,360
And now you're punishing me.

347
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,430
You want this to hurt.

348
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm treating you professionally.

349
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,560
If you were treating me professionally,

350
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,070
I wouldn't be in so much pain. I'm sorry, but I --

351
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,680
Just give me the damn drugs!

352
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,060
Come on!

353
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,160
Melendez thinks that he's okay being on Avery's case.

354
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,200
I don't.

355
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,410
Dr. Melendez may be right.

356
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,910
That case seems to be Shaun's primary focus right now.

357
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,580
Maybe his condition is a blessing in this situation.

358
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,130
Maybe?

359
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,060
Or obsessing over Avery's health

360
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,280
could be his only outlet for a guilty conscience.

361
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,860
Watching her suffer could just be worsening those feelings.

362
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,010
So, either it's a huge problem

363
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,310
or it's not a problem at all.

364
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,050
This is your professional opinion?

365
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,780
Shaun has a very unique mind

366
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
and an incredibly introverted nature.

367
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,460
Well, thank you for that.

368
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm sorry, but without a lot more time with him,

369
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,950
that's the best I can offer.

370
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,090
What did Lim expect me to do --

371
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,040
stand there and smile

372
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,260
while she called my medical judgment into question?

373
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,040
Your patient nearly died waiting on that O.R., right?

374
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,460
It was bad. What do you want me to do?

375
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,860
Tell her to back off!

376
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,450
- No. - He's a complete and utter --

377
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,960
Not one of those nice racists, huh?

378
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,680
- I shouldn't have to be -- Claire!

379
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,600
Here's what you have to do --

380
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,710
shut up and do exactly what Dr. Lim tells you to do.

381
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,440
But --

382
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,740
Yes, sir.

383
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
Maybe we could take turns.

384
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,720
You can keep an eye on my patient,

385
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,890
I keep an eye on yours.

386
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,650
No.

387
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,910
Her creatinine is 1.6.

388
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,620
Mild bump in renal numbers

389
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,830
isn't surprising after all her trauma.

390
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,730
This morning must've been crazy.

391
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,830
Are you okay?

392
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,510
This morning, my neighbor Lea came over and ate my apple.

393
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,940
That's too bad.

394
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, it was my last one.

395
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,770
She was upset with Armen, our landlord.

396
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,010
She plays her music very loud.

397
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,450
I gave her some advice. It seemed to anger her

398
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,570
because she left without saying goodbye.

399
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,810
And you think you did something wrong.

400
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,880
No, it was good advice.

401
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,970
Shaun, sometimes a woman wants advice,

402
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,070
and sometimes she just wants support.

403
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,490
How can I tell which one Lea wants?

404
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,920
Err on the side of support.

405
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,720
- That's not helpful. - Yes, it is.

406
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,890
Dr. Browne. You're being summoned.

407
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,570
All right.

408
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,470
About time.

409
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,080
All your struggling, you've pulled out your IV.

410
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,570
Aren't nurses usually supposed to do this kind of crap?

411
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,990
They let you go to med school,

412
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,310
but they don't trust you with any real responsibility.

413
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,790
There must be a competent doctor tucked around here somewhere

414
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,290
who tell someone I need more than aspirin.

415
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,220
- "Competent"? - Yeah.

416
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,430
You know what I mean.

418
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,710
Imhotep was the father of modern medicine.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,330
- An Egyptian. - Yeah.

420
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,800
Good for your people.

421
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,240
I'm willing to bet there's even been a couple others

422
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,540
over the last 3,000 years, but guess what?

423
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,790
On average,

424
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,980
you look at most great technological advancements,

425
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,220
you'll find a proud Northern European holding the patent.

426
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,630
That's what you were trying to do this morning?

427
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
Get the patent on stealing 30 bucks

428
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
from the corner store for a drug fix?

429
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,010
You don't like drug addicts, do you?

430
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,760
A lot of people I don't like.

431
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,050
Thieves, racists, 

432
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,930
violent punks,

433
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,050
but I'll treat 'em.

434
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,310
Was your mama a drug addict?

435
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,060
That's the beauty of cliches,

436
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,880
is they're true so often, huh?

437
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,410
You don't know anything about me.

438
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,820
I didn't go to college.

439
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,700
I didn't have no affirmative action to get me in,

440
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,790
but you did.

441
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,820
All because some bleeding-heart liberal in the Dean's office

442
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,650
teared up reading your essay about your crack-whore mama.

443
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
What the hell?

444
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,150
I guess we're all violent punks.

445
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,040
All you had to do was give him your wallet.

446
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,170
Her urine output is low.

447
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,630
What are you doing?!

448
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,740
Get away from her!

449
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,590
You can't be in here shoving my doctors around.

450
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,330
Me? He -- He's the --

451
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,880
- Oh, my God. - She needs dialysis.

452
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,110
Her kidneys are failing fast.

453
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,650
This is the first stage of total organ failure.

454
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,970
We removed two liters of excess fluid with dialysis,

455
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,460
but she's getting worse.

456
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,460
Fluid's building up in her chest.

457
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,960
She's in pulmonary failure, too.

458
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,590
Draining the fluid in her pleural space

459
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,370
would reduce airway resistance.

460
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,370
Yeah, let's prep her for a thoracentesis.

461
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,650
We're gonna have to work fast.

462
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,510
I'll prep the evac drain.

463
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm gonna need you to put that needle right between --

464
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,920
6th and 7th rib.

465
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,460
Wait, you're gonna let him do --

466
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,090
Shut up. All right, careful.

467
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,430
Don't put the needle in too deep.

468
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,700
- We don't want to give her -- - Pneumothorax.

469
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,350
All right, you're in.

470
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,250
Now, let me see what I can pull out.

471
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,050
Hopefully she settles down.

472
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,490
CO2's down, and O2's climbing.

473
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,300
We can manage her kidneys and her lungs,

474
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,130
but the last stop in multiple organ failure would be her heart.

475
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,390
Watch her ventilation pressures like a hawk,

476
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,810
push cardioprotective meds, 

477
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,230
and page me if anything changes.

478
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,940
Think you're being her hero?

479
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,470
The fact is you hardly know her.

480
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,080
And you don't know him at all.

481
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,230
Go home.

482
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,160
Okay, I am done.

483
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,830
He's a foul-mouthed, spiteful bully.

484
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,430
No problem. I'll have the concierge

485
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,790
find a patient more suited to your liking.

486
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,480
He doesn't need a doctor doting over him.

487
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,180
He doesn't want me.

488
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,540
I don't care.

489
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,130
I'm sorry I disagreed with you, okay?

490
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,740
But I don't deserve to be scolded like a school girl

491
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,880
because your ego can't handle being challenged a little.

492
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,410
That is some apology.

493
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,570
Look, I had a legitimate --

494
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,110
You really don't see the problem here?

495
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,230
What? With challenging you?

496
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,140
Right now, you are confronting me in front of two nurses.

497
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,100
Would you do that to Melendez?

498
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,040
Or would you wait five minutes?

499
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,290
I have dealt with men undermining my authority my entire career.

500
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,620
We shouldn't do it to one another, too.

501
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,670
Now go take care of him like you would any other patient.

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,130
Food services -- they double-check every order.

503
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,130
What are you looking for?

504
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,590
- An apple. - An apple?

505
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,860
- Who's getting an apple? - I am!

506
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,160
- No. - Shaun.

507
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,580
Forget the apple, please.

508
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,270
I'm sorry. Can I have a minute?

509
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,220
Shaun?

510
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,620
Okay.

511
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,090
Shaun, there's no need to get defensive, okay?

512
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,870
Do you want to sit down?

513
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,980
No, thank you.

514
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,600
I want you to tell me again

515
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,570
exactly what happened this morning.

516
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,640
I told you exactly what happened this morning.

517
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,880
Yes, but people have told you that it's your fault.

518
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,510
Haven't they?

519
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,220
My actions and the shooting were associative incidents.

520
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,040
It is not a causal relationship.

521
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,530
I paced, and she got shot,

522
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,790
but pacing doesn't cause shootings,

523
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,130
otherwise every time someone paced,

524
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,030
a shooting would soon follow.

525
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,150
Okay, that's a very good point.

526
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,910
When someone has a gun

527
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,380
and it's a dangerous situation, right?

528
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,780
You don't want to upset the situation.

529
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,600
You don't want to make it worse.

530
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,540
You think this is my fault, too.

531
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,290
No, no, it was the shoot--

532
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,510
It was the shooter's fault,

533
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,150
but your actions may have contributed to it.

534
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,310
Okay, Shaun, wait a second. Wait a second.

535
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,840
I know your behavior is not completely in your control,

536
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
but I also know it's not completely out of your control.

537
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,860
Is it?

538
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,290
So, yes, maybe it is a little bit your fault.

539
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,000
And definitely mine.

540
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,170
You weren't even there.

541
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,080
That's right.

542
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,700
I wasn't there.

543
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,310
Can we sit down, please, just for a second?

544
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,550
Shaun...

545
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,200
I convinced myself that everything was fine

546
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,540
because in here, it is.

547
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,660
It's great.

548
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,010
But you need help.

549
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,140
Shaun...

550
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,890
you need guidance --

551
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,410
much more than I can give you.

552
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,390
I'm supposed to be with my patient.

553
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,790
I'm supposed to be watching her like a hawk.

554
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,170
It's my fault.

555
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,170
I didn't like her.

556
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,660
When I first saw her this morning, she just...

557
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,210
didn't look...

558
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,550
I don't know.

559
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,080
I mean, I wanted to blow her off,

560
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,500
so, uh... I said I forgot water.

561
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,430
I mean, I figured we'd go to the store

562
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,290
and -- and I'd pretend that I forgot my wallet.

563
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,490
I knew she didn't have her purse, so...

564
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,620
We can't go hiking without water, right?

565
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,950
I mean, no harm, no foul?

566
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,130
She was there because of me.

567
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,420
She's here...

568
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,840
because of me.

569
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,400
It's not a causal relationship.

570
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,770
Wait, excuse me?

571
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,030
It's not a causal relationship --

572
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,180
lying and shootings.

573
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,360
Lying doesn't cause shootings,

574
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,400
otherwise, every time someone lied --

575
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,120
Her pulse pressure is narrow.

576
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,620
Wait, what does that mean?

577
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,280
She's dying.

578
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,360
Page Melendez. Stat!

579
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,510
Your respiratory rate is up.

580
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,910
Are you having trouble breathing?

581
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,730
Yeah. It's tight.

582
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,860
Find Dr. Lim.

583
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,850
Narrow pulse pressure indicates a reduced cardiac output.

584
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,760
The inflammation is affecting her heart.

585
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,180
She's in end-stage organ failure.

586
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,150
Yes, we can insert an intra-aortic balloon pump.

587
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,660
It may reduce some of the workload on her heart,

588
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,310
but it's failing fast -- really fast.

589
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,750
It only needs to work overnight.

590
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,630
The inflammatory reaction will improve after that.

591
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,380
What if it's failing so fast because it's not her heart?

592
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,180
Her hemoglobin's dropped from 14 to 12

593
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,350
between her last two draws.

594
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,170
What if the real problem is she's bleeding somewhere?

595
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,110
Given what she's been through,

596
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,420
a two-point drop could mean nothing.

597
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,930
Or it could mean a bleed,

598
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,740
which would account for the narrow pulse pressure.

599
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,010
Her heart could be fine.

600
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,500
If you're right, that means we'd have to open her back up.

601
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,450
I don't know if her body can handle another operation.

602
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,590
No, it can't.

603
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,490
Treating heart failure with an aortic pump

604
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,550
is also a simple procedure.

605
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,680
So we're going to diagnose based on which procedure is simpler?

606
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,900
If I'm right, there could be no more blood to pump.

607
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,050
She'll be dead.

608
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,470
She's crashing!

609
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,310
We should prepare the cath lab for a pump.

610
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,840
We should prepare the O.R.

611
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,940
Let's get her into an O.R. Now.

612
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,370
Hemoglobin's dropped to 8.

613
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,850
She is bleeding out.

614
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,270
Yes, she is, but where?

615
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,700
Got to find where the bleeder's coming from

616
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
and clip it before she dies.

617
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,500
I got nothing.

618
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,210
Must be hidden under the retroperitoneum or mediastinum.

619
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,200
That's a whole lot of real estate

620
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,870
to cut open and just go blindly looking.

621
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,960
We should start at the abdomen. She was shot there.

622
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,520
The bullet passed through the posterior thorax.

623
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,740
BP's 40 over palp. She's dying, Neil.

624
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,570
Whatever you're gonna do, you need to do it now.

625
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,520
We need to look everywhere. 

626
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,620
Give me a knife and sternal saw.

627
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,660
I'm gonna open her up from chest to pelvis.

628
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,890
Prep the sternum and abdomen with Betadine.

629
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,000
Gonna need a sponge stick

630
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,860
to control the bleeding when we find it.

631
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,850
Stop!

632
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,390
Open her between the second and third rib on the left side.

633
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,160
The bullet nicked the left supreme intercostal artery.

634
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,360
The wall has blown.

635
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,370
How do you know?

636
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,600
I followed the injuries --

637
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,680
pelvis to bowel to spleen to diaphragm.

638
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,510
Next target has to be left supreme intercostal artery.

639
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,180
All right, prep left intercostal space.

640
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,830
I can't breathe.

641
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,420
Why aren't you helping me?

642
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,890
Dr. Lim will be along in just two minutes.

643
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,170
You're the damn doctor. Do your job.

644
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,610
I need to open up the left neck compartment

645
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,050
to relieve the pressure.

646
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,190
Procedure tray?

647
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,560
You done this before?

648
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,770
Nope.

649
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,030
Scalpel.

650
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,450
It's too swollen.

651
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,330
I can't see the Adam's apple.

652
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,620
Okay.

653
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,290
Cut along the soft divot between the carotid sheath and the trachea.

654
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,540
Soft divot.

655
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,590
Got it.

656
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,480
Update me.

657
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,510
What did you do?

658
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,960
He had a cervical hematoma. 

659
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,760
I had to relieve the pressure.

660
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,710
Here?

661
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,680
Oxygen sats are going up.

662
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,030
It's rare, but post-op swelling can happen with tracheal tears.

663
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,960
That's why we watch them so closely the first 24 hours.

664
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,370
You mind if we finish this off in the operating room?

665
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,150
I don't see anything, Shaun --

666
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,850
no blood and no arterial tear.

667
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,880
You're too high.

668
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,780
It's near the bifurcation.

669
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,860
Get some light in.

670
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,970
I got something. 

671
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,530
Blood's pooling right under the bifurcation.

672
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,600
Clamp now.

673
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,170
She wasn't in heart failure.

674
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,370
That means her heart is still strong enough

675
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,690
to get her through the night.

676
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,000
I was wrong.

677
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,240
Yeah.

678
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,750
And you just made up for it.

679
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,280
You were right, Jared.

680
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,780
Good work.

681
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,360
You know what?

682
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,700
You were right.

683
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,860
My mother had problems.

684
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,830
So I couldn't afford to just around

685
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,740
expecting everything to be handed to me

686
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,220
or whatever else it is that's holding you back.

687
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,000
And yeah, I got some breaks,

688
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,490
but I worked my ass off.

689
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,210
Two jobs, two roommates every step of the way.

690
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,650
And that is what got me to the place where I could save your life.

691
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,300
Your daughter's not out of the woods yet,

692
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,430
but I do expect her condition to improve day by day.

693
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,470
Thank you, Doctor.

694
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,740
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

695
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Baby.

696
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,220
Sorry we weren't here for you.

697
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,400
How are you feeling?

698
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,630
Probably won't be hiking anytime soon.

699
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,940
You sneaking out before I can thank you?

700
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,470
Please, you don't need to thank me.

701
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,360
Yeah, I do.

702
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,040
And apologize.

703
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,260
I was wrong about you.

704
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,070
I thought you were trying to ditch me.

705
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,560
I was...

706
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,010
hoping you were trying to ditch me.

707
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,530
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,900
When you're feeling better,

709
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,450
I'd like a second chance at a first date.

710
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,590
I'm sorry.

711
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,660
You were right.

712
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,220
I publicly disrespected you,

713
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,800
and so I thought it only right to publicly respect you.

714
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,050
I am grateful for the chance to learn from you.

715
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,680
I know you needed this victory.

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,770
Glad you saved a life today.

717
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,730
Just wish it wasn't a Nazi.

718
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,850
Lane number two.

719
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,390
Maddie always took that lane.

720
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,940
She would tuck in behind me

721
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,690
and draft until the last 200 meters.

722
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,100
It was a dirty little trick.

723
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,660
- It worked. - Every time.

724
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,680
13 years ago today.

725
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,110
Yeah.

726
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,300
I miss her, too.

727
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,330
Give her space, right?

728
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,620
Give her space.

729
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,050
She just drifted farther and farther away.

730
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,560
Everything I did...

731
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,740
I did wrong.

732
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,130
You did your best.

733
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,460
I was...

734
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,840
practically living at your house back then, and --

735
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,050
If I hadn't...

736
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,490
You were both teenagers.

737
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,010
You were idiots.

738
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,880
You got lucky, she didn't.

739
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,760
If I...

740
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,500
was there more...

741
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,920
if I...

742
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,270
stayed on her...

743
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,940
You're there for him.

744
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,810
Here's your extended forecast for the week.

745
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,500
Starting off with a little bit of cloud cover in San Francisco, 

746
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,050
temperatures in the low 70s...

747
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,680
...just a few degrees as we get closer to the weekend.

748
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,470
Expect dry conditions for the next seven days here --

749
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,300
I, uh, saw your light.

750
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,970
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,920
Claire told me to apologize

752
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,030
because you didn't want me to tell the truth.

753
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,410
You only wanted me to support your position,

754
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,850
even though it's wrong.

755
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,940
Well, I don't accept.

756
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,130
I may have overreacted this morning a little.

757
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,790
And you were honest -- brutally honest --

758
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,430
but you shouldn't have to wear ear plugs in your own home.

759
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,110
And don't start lying to me to make me feel good.

760
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,390
You're the only honest guy I know.

761
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,440
So...

762
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,970
...have a good night, Shaun Murphy.

763
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,840
And I will try not to keep you up.

764
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:57,600
