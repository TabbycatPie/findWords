1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,400
Singing next door.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,360
Who is that?

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Lewis. Sometimes, he sings.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,520
I think he's a better driver than singer.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,480
You worried about having Netflix
back in the garage?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,880
No. I think people say that,
when Netflix is around, things go bad,

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,440
but, you know, it's just...

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,600
Um, how do you say?
It's just a bad coincidence.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,240
<i>Hamilton beats Bottas!</i>

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>It's a Mercedes one-two again.</i>

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,200
Having Lewis as my teammate,
he's a multiple world champion,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,480
one of the best ever.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,840
It's pretty tough.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
<i>Mercedes, making it clear</i>

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
<i>they expect
Valtteri to move out of Lewis's way.</i>

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,760
<i>It's a Mercedes one-two again.
Bottas finishes second.</i>

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,720
<i>And the winner, Lewis Hamilton!</i>

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
I should be always happy
to be on the podium,

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
but if your teammate wins
and you are second,

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,680
you feel like you lose.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,160
I never in a million years thought
I'd have as many titles as I have.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,120
It's a hard thing to kind of grasp.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,640
what you've, you know, what I've done,
but it's, for sure, hard for Valtteri.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
He wants to be world champion.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,480
I know
I've been second in the past,

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,440
but I want to prove
that I'm not just a number two.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,880
- Valtteri was such a sensational wingman.
- Well, first of all, "wingman" hurts.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,520
People say
Valtteri is your number two driver.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,120
- Would you say that?
- Fuck you.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,960
- Is that fair?
- Fuck you.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,600
They can't hear your question, right?

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,160
They might.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,840
In Finland, it's a different
mindset to many other countries.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Most of us,
we're kind of bit of lone wolves.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Even though it's a team sport,
you have a massive team behind,

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
in the car, you are there alone.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,280
Finland is a pretty good contrast
to the Formula 1 world.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
There's no pressure.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
The sauna is warm.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Oh yeah.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Balls out.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Aye, aye, aye.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,040
This is peaceful.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,600
Throwing water on the rocks,
you relax straightaway.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
Yeah.

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,600
How are you feeling about it?

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,160
Of course,
performance is a big thing, but...

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,920
it's not only how good you are at driving.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,120
But what can you do?

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,320
- That's just how it is.
- That's just how it is.

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,200
I believe, my gut feeling is
that things will end up going well.

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Yeah.

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,800
Now I just need to step
on the accelerator bloody well.

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
I hate to be second.

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
There's many couch commentators
in the sport,

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,800
but I don't let it get to me.

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,440
I know what I'm still aiming for
and what I'm capable of.

58
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,560
And Lewis knows how hungry I am
for the wins and for my first title.

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,320
- We shall find out.
- We shall find out.

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,720
- Enough Formula 1 stuff.
- Yeah, definitely.

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Let's just look at the swans.

62
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>It's the Russian Grand Prix,</i>

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>and Sochi is Russia's most popular resort.</i>

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
<i>It's the country's unofficial
summer capital.</i>

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,520
<i>It's glorious.</i>

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
<i>There's beaches, there's theme parks,
roller coasters, all sorts.</i>

67
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,480
Hello.

68
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,720
Thank you.

69
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,920
It's the only word I know.

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,840
<i>It's gonna be
a fascinating Russian Grand Prix.</i>

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,680
<i>Lewis Hamilton
seeks to join Michael Schumacher</i>

72
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
<i>as a 91-times Grand Prix victor.</i>

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,640
<i>The all-time record is up for grabs
in Sochi.</i>

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Valtteri, do you wanna do it,
the four of us?

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,680
- No, be separate.
- You want to be separate?

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't want
any disease from you.

77
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,160
I haven't got any diseases...
that you can catch airborne.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,200
- Are we doing it in here?
- Lewis said let's do it in here.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Why is he not in here?

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,440
He wants to sit in his room
and do it through there.

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,760
<i>Can you see everything?</i>

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
Nope. Just black.

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,040
- Now it's okay.
<i>- Yeah, let's get started.</i>

84
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,600
Um, as you can tell,
we have Netflix with us this weekend.

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,800
Uh, we'll try
and offer pretty broad access.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,720
We can talk about certain things,

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,600
but, obviously, the special systems
we're gonna keep hidden away from them.

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
- Okay.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

89
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Lewis,
yesterday it was announced

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,240
that you made the list of the 100
most influential people in <i>Time </i>magazine.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Cheers, man.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Lewis is a big,
worldwide star compared to me.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,600
Everyone knows the name Lewis Hamilton.
Not as many people know Valtteri Bottas.

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,800
But I feel my strength against him
is that I want the title more than him.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
<i>Call ended.</i>

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
- Thank you, Valtteri.
- Easy.

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,680
Not so exciting to follow. Yeah?

98
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,840
The two drivers
actually are just so different.

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,280
It's not about schmoozing with each other.
It's about having respect for each other.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,840
- Your feet must be on fire.
- They are pretty hot.

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,760
- Yeah.
- I'm regretting the decision.

102
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,440
- But I am committed to the cause.
- Of course.

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,560
Lewis is much more extroverted.

104
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,080
Are you comfortable?

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,880
Ish. Yeah.

106
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,536
It's okay. Cool.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
And Valtteri is more to himself.

108
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
More like the typical Finnish character.

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,400
It's always been quite a strong track
for me, so we definitely expect to win.

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,200
And having these diverse characters
is a strength of the team,

111
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,680
as long as our objectives are the same.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Looking ahead to this weekend,

113
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,200
how excited are you about potentially
equaling Michael Schumacher's record?

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,520
It's very, very surreal to think
that I'm that close to Michael.

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,680
But it's not one of my favorite tracks,
so it'll be a real challenge.

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,200
I don't know where we're gonna stand,

117
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,200
but we've got to work very hard
to keep this guy behind.

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,240
We're doing a piece
on your teammate.

119
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,120
He's about to break a big record
in the Formula 1 world.

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,560
As a teammate, what is it
that makes him so hard to race against?

121
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,080
First of all, for sure, I try to avoid him
breaking that record yet.

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah. I just wanna beat him.

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Thank you.

124
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,200
<i>2.9.</i>

125
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,880
There's a noticeable delay
with the wheel going on.

126
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,080
What you wanna do is back it off a bit.

127
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,160
In the team, many people,
even though they wouldn't admit it,

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,160
maybe unconsciously, they have number one
and number two driver.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,640
- That's fine.
- Is it okay?

130
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,880
Sometimes, the team members,
they had to question themselves,

131
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,040
"Are we giving equal treatment
to Lewis and Valtteri?"

132
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,320
<i>Bottas leads.
Hamilton and Vettel, it's wheel to wheel!</i>

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,040
At Sochi 2018,
that was a pretty tough race.

134
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,800
Valtteri was in
an impossible situation

135
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
where we had to make decisions
that are uncomfortable.

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,760
<i>Valtteri Bottas
has just let Lewis Hamilton pass.</i>

137
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,600
<i>There's Toto Wolff pressing the button.
Clearly his call.</i>

138
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,080
<i>They needed to put one car,
in terms of the championship,</i>

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>between Hamilton and Vettel,</i>

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
<i>and Bottas had to be the man.</i>

141
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I was gonna go faster next lap.

142
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>Let's discuss it afterwards.
We'll explain.</i>

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,680
<i>Lewis Hamilton
wins the Russian Grand Prix!</i>

144
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Yeah, that was tough. Tough to accept.

145
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,720
I understand
how difficult it was for Valtteri.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,280
He did a fantastic job today
and deserved to win.

147
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,280
I was pretty angry.

148
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,680
Honestly, I was thinking,
"Why do I do this?"

149
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,280
I was even thinking of quitting,
of giving up.

150
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Straight after the race,
I said I would not do it again.

151
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,920
One more.

152
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Do you think
Valtteri can still be world champion?

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,920
I think Valtteri,

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
in his mind,

155
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,720
has no doubt that he can be.

156
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
But having Lewis as your teammate

157
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,440
is probably the hardest thing
that you can have.

158
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,440
He could beat Michael Schumacher's
90-race win record.

159
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,640
Doesn't get any worse, I guess.

160
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,720
Do you get nervous
on qualifying day?

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
No.

162
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,240
- I can't recommend the cycling here.
- No?

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
- Did you go to the mountains?
- Yeah, then I got arrested.

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,640
- Arrested?
- Yes.

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,880
Apparently I entered a military area.
So they stopped me, they kept my passport.

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,000
I got chased by a stray dog at one point.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
Welcome to Russia.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,520
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

169
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,480
<i>We're here at the Olympic Park,
host of the 2014 Winter Olympics.</i>

170
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,960
<i>And, for the first time this season,
the fans are back!</i>

171
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
<i>There are 30,000 here today,</i>

172
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,440
<i>ready for some fast action
on a 3.6 mile circuit.</i>

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,720
We'll find out
if it's gonna be a good weekend.

174
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,200
A critical part of every qualifying
session is a front-row lockout.

175
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Being able to start first and second
on the grid protects the driver on pole.

176
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,600
At every other track
on the calendar,

177
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,400
the best position to start
is either first or second.

178
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
But I think actually, on this track,

179
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,520
to win the race,
you want to start either first or third.

180
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
It's nearly one kilometer
into the first corner.

181
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,120
If you are following a car,
it's less air to push away,

182
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
so you go faster on the straight.

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,640
That's a huge advantage.

184
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Qualifying is all about starting
as high up the grid as you can.

185
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,760
Decided by those finite margins

186
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,320
of a hundredth, a tenth of a second.

187
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,160
<i>Mercedes, now looking for
an eighth consecutive front-row lockout.</i>

188
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
We've got Valtteri behind four seconds.

189
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,800
<i>The circuit's all clear ahead.</i>

190
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
<i>Let's go.</i>

191
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,800
<i>Lewis Hamilton starts
his flying lap.</i>

192
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,920
- Strat two.
- Copy.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,200
<i>Valtteri Bottas, just about to start his.</i>

194
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
Tactics, we're gonna push.

195
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,040
The rear end feels good.

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,240
<i>Valtteri Bottas,
giving it absolutely everything.</i>

197
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
<i>We're in a good position.</i>

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,480
I went too deep.
Had a bit of a lockup.

199
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,440
<i>- You're slower than Lewis.
- </i>Copy.

200
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,880
<i>- Push all the way to Turn 16.</i>
- Yep.

201
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
<i>Just keep the pace up.</i>

202
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
<i>Push hard now.</i>

203
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
<i>Final corner.</i>

204
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,680
<i>Hamilton whips up
a massive lap and goes P1.</i>

205
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,440
<i>Nice work.
That's provisional pole.</i>

206
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
<i>This will be your last push.</i>

207
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,800
<i>Bottas across the line.
Half a second away from Lewis Hamilton.</i>

208
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,680
That's currently P2.

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,440
<i>It's looking like
a Mercedes one-two tomorrow.</i>

210
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,560
<i>It's not done yet though.
Max Verstappen has to do his lap.</i>

211
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,120
<i>What's this?
Bottas is giving Verstappen a massive tow.</i>

212
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,120
This is going to give the Red Bull
a huge advantage.

213
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Let Verstappen go.
Don't give him a tow.

214
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh God!

215
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,080
Getting a tow essentially means
that a car in front of you

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,600
is punching a hole in the air.

217
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,080
There's less wind resistance,
which means that you can drive faster.

218
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,440
Verstappen behind. Don't give him a tow.

219
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,880
Giving a rival a tow is like
giving them an extra 20 horsepower.

220
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,520
On this track, I know,

221
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,920
if you don't make pole,
you need to start third.

222
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,480
To beat Lewis, I always race hard, fair,

223
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,480
but, sometimes, it's like, "Fuck it."

224
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,720
<i>Verstappen has just flown past Bottas.</i>

225
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
<i>Verstappen's on the front row!</i>

226
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Yes!

227
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,080
That was a good lap.

228
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,360
<i>Great job, Max. Good
of Valtteri to give you a tow as well.</i>

229
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,480
After Sochi 2018, I realized
you have to take all your opportunities.

230
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
Look how he towed him.

231
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,760
We need to be more responsive next time.
That's just something we need to work on.

233
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,720
<i>Is that Valtteri Bottas thinking,</i>

234
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,840
<i>"Today's the day
I'm gonna stop being a team member here,</i>

235
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,200
<i>and I'm gonna start putting myself first
a little more often"?</i>

236
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,720
<i>That's Lewis, P1,
Verstappen, yourself,</i>

237
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,200
<i>and Verstappen can thank you for the tow</i>.

238
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
<i>Lewis Hamilton on pole</i>

239
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,320
<i>on the weekend that he's aiming
to equal Michael Schumacher's record.</i>

240
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,120
<i>But it isn't a Mercedes lockout
on the front row.</i>

241
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,800
<i>Verstappen starts second.
Valtteri Bottas starts third.</i>

242
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,360
Mercedes have qualified
so well this year.

243
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
And, all of a sudden,
Max Verstappen is splitting the Mercedes

244
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,200
and starting on the front row.

245
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,640
It raised a lot of eyebrows
up and down the paddock.

246
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,000
Did you see Verstappen,
how he towed him?

247
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,280
That's not the reason he's in front of us.

248
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
The reason he's in front of us
is we did a bad lap.

249
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,920
No, it's one of the reasons.
We did a bad lap and we towed him.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,720
Both things contributed to not being P2.

251
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,320
We are just trying
to come as close to perfection as we can.

252
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,440
But sometimes the drivers' objectives are
different to the objectives of the team.

253
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
I didn't quite understand

254
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,920
why the team
would have been disappointed I was third.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,960
Everyone knew third is better than second.

256
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
If I did it on purpose,

257
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,240
only I know.

258
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,000
But I would have not made it into
this sport if I wasn't selfish at times.

259
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,800
- What happened?
- I wish I knew.

260
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
I just didn't go quicker,

261
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,840
so maybe I was just playing games,
wanting to start third.

262
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,880
It's a good place to start.

263
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,080
It will give me
an advantage against Lewis.

264
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,040
I don't know why Valtteri
didn't get great laps this afternoon.

265
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
Maybe it's tactical.

266
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,480
Don't know how
or why he would do that, so, um, yeah.

267
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,480
It's so important
to have the support of your teammate.

268
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,840
There was a period of time

269
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,880
the guy that has been my teammate
has been my best friend.

270
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,920
But when you work your life to win
and only one of you can win,

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,640
it brings a lot of friction.

272
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
♪ <i>Champione, champione ♪</i>

273
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,040
<i>♪ Ole, ole, ole ♪</i>

274
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,200
To win a world championship,
I dedicated my whole life to it.

275
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,320
For me, it makes it all the more sweeter
that Lewis was the guy I managed to beat.

276
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
I've known Lewis since I'm 13 years old.

277
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,680
We were teammates in go-karting
and best friends at the time.

278
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm just gonna drive my hardest.

279
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,840
- Drive smooth and calm and collective.
- I need to finish at the front.

280
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,720
Just be careful, then finally
just give it everything. Full speed.

281
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,840
We were dreaming,

282
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,840
"Imagine if, one day, we can be
in the leading Formula 1 team,

283
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
fighting for world championships."

284
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,320
Totally unrealistic.

285
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,680
Then, all of a sudden, it happened.

286
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,600
<i>OK, Lewis,
if you let Nico pass this lap.</i>

287
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,240
- I'm not slowing down for Nico.
- Why is he not letting me through?

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>He's had the message, Nico.</i>

289
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,680
It's unique in sport that
your teammate is your biggest opponent.

290
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,680
With Lewis, it just went too far.

291
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
Nico hit me.

292
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Nico's hit me.

293
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,920
This is an absolutely unacceptable race
for us.

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,040
I agree. That is unacceptable.

295
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
It's probably best I go now.

296
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,600
As team principal,
it was almost impossible

297
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,200
to manage the animosity.

298
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
We, as a team, cannot let it happen again.

299
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,880
Psychology plays a big, big role
in sports. It's huge.

300
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Everybody has self-doubt.
Lewis has self-doubt as well.

301
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,200
You need to amplify that.
You can force him into mistakes.

302
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
He's already left?

303
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,136
- We do the longest days.
- We do the longest days!

304
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,960
- We're always last to leave.
- That's why we're number one.

305
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,920
Tomorrow's gonna be hard.

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,040
Mm-hmm.

307
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,120
It's been a real challenge
to raise my level each year

308
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,920
and deliver without making mistakes.

309
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,800
In that battle you have with your mind,
you've got to stay calm, stay in the zone.

310
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,200
- Shoot, man, we haven't skydived for ages.
- Oh God, we have to do it.

311
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,840
- I'd like to do bobsleigh.
- Bobsleigh's hardcore.

312
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,360
- You should do skeleton.
- Hell no!

313
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
- Where you lay on the thing and go down?
- Head first.

314
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,920
No fucking way.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,120
You're nuts.

316
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,280
- It looks like so much fun.
- It does not look fun at all.

317
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,080
- The Mercedes team is hardworking.
- Pushing.

318
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
Yeah, pushing.

319
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,040
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow. Bye. One of ours.

320
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,760
Lewis equaling Michael's record
with 91 wins

321
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,920
is the main focus that we have now.

322
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,960
It's not great pictures.

323
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,800
Undermines my authority.

324
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,480
But this weekend, it's also important
for Valtteri to make up some points

325
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,880
for his chance to win the championship.

326
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,320
So you never know what to expect.

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,960
That's the race director, by the way.

328
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,800
He's the one everybody complains to.

329
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,200
Exactly. Including you.

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,480
Wait tomorrow.

331
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,040
I'll be on the intercom with you.

332
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
- Is Sochi for your liking?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
Good vodka.

334
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Russian karaoke.

335
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,840
We did it once.

336
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,960
- Nearly missed the flight the next day.
- Yeah. It was 2015.

337
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,080
Good old days.

338
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,960
Anything that I can get for you?

339
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
- No, thanks.
- Perfect.

340
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,136
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Thank you.

341
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Did you get a bit happy last night
on social?

342
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Yeah, so I saw this comment...

343
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,960
What did he comment?

344
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,960
He was basically saying
something negative.

345
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,480
"Lewis will still beat you,"
"You're still shit," basically that.

346
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,280
Yeah. Then I just said,
"If I had your mentality,

347
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,440
I would have given up many times."

348
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,360
The evening before the race, a comment
on social media went under my skin.

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,960
People forget that people have feelings
and are real people.

350
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Yes.

351
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,920
But turning anger into motivation
and will to win,

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
that's very healthy,
if you can control that.

353
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,320
If I listened too much to criticism,
that would be a killer.

354
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,120
There's a Finnish saying.

355
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
The translation is...

356
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,280
"Dogs are barking,
but the train keeps going."

357
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>It is the seventh Russian Grand Prix.</i>

358
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
<i>It is absolutely roasting here.</i>

359
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,960
<i>Track temperature's gonna be
over 40 degrees.</i>

360
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,920
<i>Today, Lewis Hamilton
is chasing win number 91.</i>

361
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,560
<i>To equal Michael Schumacher's record.</i>

362
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
I hope we can prevent him
from matching the record

363
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,000
until at least the next race.

364
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>Radio check, Max.</i>

365
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,800
- Yeah. Radio check.
<i>- Straight through the pit lane.</i>

366
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
Are you good at wheel guns?

367
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,360
I should have a go.
I can't be worse than a team principal.

368
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,160
- Radio check.
- Radio's loud and clear.

369
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,720
Okay, Lewis. It'll be a practice start
from the pit lane.

370
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,560
There is a designated area
to do a practice start

371
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,720
at the end of the pit lane.

372
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Everybody that goes onto the grid
can do a practice start,

373
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,200
but it has to be in that block.

374
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,920
There's all rubber here.
Can I go further out?

375
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
<i>Um...</i>

376
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
<i>Leave enough room for cars to pass.</i>

377
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,560
What is this?

378
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,120
<i>To the end of the pit wall?</i>

379
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
<i>Yeah, copy.</i>

380
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Seems an odd thing to do
on the pit wall, no?

381
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
I understand the rules.

382
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
And I'm always looking
to maximize every opportunity,

383
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,280
plain and simple.

384
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,400
<i>He's gone a long way out.
That's too far out of the pit lane.</i>

385
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
<i>I'm not entirely sure why</i>

386
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
<i>the team okayed
for Lewis to go down there and do it.</i>

387
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,480
<i>The stewards will not be happy with that.</i>

388
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,680
What Lewis Hamilton did
put others at risk.

389
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,240
If he'd launched himself out when people
were already coming out of the pit lane,

390
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,080
there could've been a massive crash.

391
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,480
Okay<i>. We can go to the grid now.</i>

392
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Lewis wanted to maximize
the practice start before the race,

393
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,440
so he could nail it
on the race start itself.

394
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,440
<i>So cool the car.</i>

395
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,640
He knows that sometimes the pole
can be less of an advantage.

396
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,680
And maybe

397
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
it played games in Lewis's head.

398
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,480
<i>All okay with the engine.</i>

399
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,680
Everyone makes mistakes in this sport.
Even the best.

400
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Even Lewis.

401
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,560
<i>We're just hearing
that Lewis is under investigation</i>

402
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,120
<i>for doing a practice start
outside of the designated area.</i>

403
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
<i>He's being investigated.</i>

404
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>This could have big implications</i>

405
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
<i>for his race this afternoon.</i>

406
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,400
Hamilton stopped on the track.

407
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,040
- Did he?
- Yeah.

408
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,160
I think he stopped on the track
and made a practice start.

409
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,760
Surely they can't penalize you in a race
for something that happened earlier?

410
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,680
- That's got to just be a fine.
- Yeah.

411
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,360
I like this national anthem.
It reminds me of Rocky against Ivan Drago.

412
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,000
<i>Valtteri needs
a great start from P3 if he wants to win.</i>

413
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,320
<i>He needs to be ahead of Hamilton
going into Turn 2.</i>

414
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,760
Everyone's expecting Lewis to win,
but everyone cracks. Also, Lewis.

415
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,040
I need to keep putting the pressure
on him. I need to keep him on his toes.

416
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,560
Now I'm getting close
to Michael Schumacher.

417
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,280
It's very, very surreal.

418
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,240
<i>Could it be the day</i>

419
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,160
<i>Lewis Hamilton
equals Michael Schumacher's record?</i>

420
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,280
You've got to be able to block it all out
and focus on the one goal.

421
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,520
To win the race. It's intense.

422
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,440
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

423
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,200
<i>And it's Hamilton in the lead!</i>

424
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,320
<i>Bottas is going
round the outside of Hamilton!</i>

425
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
<i>Oh, but he's run wide!</i>

426
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,520
<i>Hamilton gets back in front.
Bottas in second.</i>

427
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,080
<i>Carlos Sainz is in the wall.
That's a big crash.</i>

428
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,520
<i>Lance Stroll is out
of the race and into the barriers,</i>

429
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,080
<i>They'll need a safety car
on the opening lap of the Grand Prix.</i>

430
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Are you okay?

431
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,080
- Is everyone okay?
<i>- All okay. Just a lot of debris.</i>

432
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,320
<i>Bottas went with huge aggression</i>

433
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,640
<i>into the first corner,
taking it to Hamilton,</i>

434
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,880
<i>making him feel uncomfortable,
like Rosberg did in 2016.</i>

435
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,080
<i>But Lewis still managed
to hold it beautifully.</i>

436
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,760
<i>So lights are out.
You control the pace.</i>

437
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,520
Very poor grip there.

438
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,680
<i>A lot can happen with Hamilton.</i>

439
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,560
<i>He's still under investigation
for that practice start.</i>

440
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,960
- What is it?
- Look.

441
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,040
Oh God.

442
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,920
<i>There is a ten-second time penalty</i>

443
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,400
<i>for the race leader, Lewis Hamilton,
for practice start violations.</i>

444
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,360
Fuck! Is Lewis aware?

445
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,720
Tell him. Tell him.

446
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,360
<i>Lewis,
we have a ten-second time penalty</i>

447
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,320
<i>for the practice start infringements.</i>

448
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,440
What happened?

449
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
Sorry, the practice start,

450
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,120
going to the grid,
got a ten-second penalty.

451
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
- Where's that in the rule book?
- Copy, Lewis.

452
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeah, that's bullshit.

453
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,680
Yeah, it's... It's shit.

454
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,920
<i>So Lewis ahead
has a ten-second penalty</i>

455
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,120
- Start closing up the gap to Lewis.
- Copy.

456
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,440
<i>Bottas has got
a second chance to win the Grand Prix.</i>

457
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,080
Simon, talk to me about vibration.

458
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,640
- It's still growing steadily lap on lap.
- I'm gonna call Lewis.

459
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,960
We need to get him in
as soon as we can.

460
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,400
<i>Stand by, red. Tires off.</i>

461
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,960
Box, box. Box, box.

462
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,720
<i>The Mercedes garage
are getting ready for Hamilton's pit stop.</i>

463
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,200
Tires are still okay.

464
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Do not stop me early. Do not.

465
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,120
- OK, copy, Lewis.
- Stand down, gents. Stand down.

466
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,280
<i>Hamilton doesn't want to come in.</i>

467
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,120
Tell him, "Attack all you can."

468
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,720
<i>Lewis, let's give it everything.</i>

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,320
<i>Hamilton does not pit
and he's still got great pace.</i>

470
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,600
<i>A full second quicker than his last
flying lap. He's on the march.</i>

471
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,760
<i>Six tenths quicker than Bottas.
Over a second quicker than Verstappen.</i>

472
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,840
<i>Lewis, that's the fastest lap.
You need to maintain this pace.</i>

473
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,280
- Safety critical vibrations.
- We have to stop Lewis this lap.

474
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,920
<i>Blankets off in the pit lane now.</i>

475
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
<i>Sorry, Lewis,
you need to box. Box, box.</i>

476
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>Into the pits comes Lewis Hamilton.</i>

477
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,720
<i>This will be a ten-second wait,</i>

478
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,360
<i>which will feel like it's forever for him.</i>

479
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,040
Why did we have to serve it?
Why isn't it added at the end of the race?

480
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,680
Yeah, Lewis, we have to serve it.
Just focus.

481
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,920
Lewis is serving his ten-second penalty.
Now show us your pace.

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Copy.

483
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,200
<i>Hamilton is gonna come out
of the pits in the middle of the pack.</i>

484
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
This is just ridiculous.

485
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,560
How far have I dropped back?

486
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,960
Currently down to P11.

487
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,240
<i>That record-equaling 91st win</i>

488
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,600
<i>will take a lot of effort from Hamilton
if he's gonna achieve it.</i>

489
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,760
<i>He's coming out behind Sebastian Vettel.</i>

490
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,440
<i>- Where's Lewis?
- </i>Lewis, currently P11.

491
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,480
<i>This is now critical for the race.</i>

492
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,320
<i>What can Valtteri Bottas do now that
he's got a clear track in front of him?</i>

493
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,520
Good job. This pace is very good.

494
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,600
The penalty for Lewis, it's welcome.

495
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
It only helps me.

496
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,640
And I decided that there's no way
I'm gonna give up this win.

497
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,600
<i>If Valtteri doesn't
win now... This is on a plate for Bottas.</i>

498
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,040
- Why did you stop me so early?
<i>- We'll have that chat later.</i>

499
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,240
<i>We have Vettel ahead.
Let's get on with it.</i>

500
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,520
<i>Hamilton, 0.4 behind.</i>

501
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,640
An overtake is available.

502
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,840
<i>Hamilton taking
the position from Vettel.</i>

503
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,040
<i>All cars ahead are yet to stop,
so you are P3 on the road virtually.</i>

504
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,880
<i>Kvyat coming into the pit.</i>

505
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,920
<i>Okay, Lewis, so now P3.</i>

506
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,720
<i>Verstappen, eight seconds ahead.</i>

507
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,480
<i>The man on a mission
is Lewis Hamilton.</i>

508
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,360
<i>It's all about hunting down Verstappen.</i>

509
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,200
<i>How's the drivability, Max?</i>

510
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,920
<i>I'm trying, but it's not very easy
to drive at the moment.</i>

511
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,840
I've started to feel the left a little bit
as well now.

512
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,080
<i>Verstappen, pace dropping.</i>

513
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,080
<i>He's complaining about tires on radio.</i>

514
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
Tell him, "You can do this."
Just this one sentence.

515
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,720
<i>Hamilton gaining on Max Verstappen.</i>

516
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,880
How far is he behind?

517
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
<i>Gap to Hamilton, six seconds.</i>

518
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,680
<i>Bottas is cruising.
Miles quicker than anyone else.</i>

519
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,000
- <i>That's the fastest lap.</i>
- Yeah.

520
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,120
Valtteri now has fastest lap.

521
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't want to hear from you now, Bono.
It doesn't make any difference.

522
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,400
<i>There will be
another podium for Lewis Hamilton,</i>

523
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,360
<i>but it will not be that 91st win.</i>

524
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,160
<i>Valtteri Bottas
through the final couple of corners.</i>

525
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
Valtteri is two corners away.

526
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,800
Let's show our appreciation
to a fantastic drive from him.

527
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,560
<i>Bottas takes victory,
winning the Russian Grand Prix.</i>

528
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,120
Yes!

529
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,000
<i>Fuck yeah!</i>

530
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,280
Yes, mate! Get in there!

531
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,560
<i>Win number nine
in Formula 1 for Valtteri Bottas,</i>

532
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,160
<i>who hits back
in the drivers' championship.</i>

533
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,880
I think, again,
it's a nice moment to thank my critics.

534
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,360
To whom it may concern, fuck you.

535
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,960
<i>Max Verstappen
finishes second for Red Bull,</i>

536
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,160
<i>and another super drive from him.</i>

537
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,080
Cracking job, Max.

538
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,760
We split the two cars again.

539
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,120
Well done, Max.
That was a great job.

540
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,880
<i>Lewis Hamilton comes home
on a day he will not choose to remember.</i>

541
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,440
<i>His chances to match Schumacher's record</i>

542
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,200
<i>undone before the five red lights
even went out.</i>

543
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,040
- Lewis is not happy, is he?
- No.

544
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,440
- Good decision.
- The right decision, 100%.

545
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,280
For sure, he will do something again.
He believes he can do whatever he wants.

546
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,360
Were you not aware
of that regulation?

547
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,040
I've done it at a million tracks,
never been questioned on it.

548
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,080
They're trying to stop me, aren't they?
So it is what it is.

549
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,560
I mean, that penalty was very drastic,
very radical,

550
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,400
very over-the-top.

551
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
This is ridiculous.

552
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,960
Ron and I are going to the stewards.
Just to make a point. We owe it to Lewis.

553
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,440
I don't want to just accept this.

554
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,880
I've had a target on my back,
since I started racing.

555
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,680
You know, I was that kid
that everyone wanted to beat.

556
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,880
And they couldn't beat me,
so they would find other ways to beat me.

557
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
It was extremely dangerous to do that.

558
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,480
It's not the first time
somebody did a race start

559
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
from a place
that was different to the other ones.

560
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,000
It was not an easy decision, honestly.

561
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,760
Toto, we do not look at who he is.

562
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,240
We look at the regulations and we apply...

563
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,360
OK, gentlemen.

564
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
Stubborn.
It is just talking against a wall.

565
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,480
<i>Now, please welcome
the third-placed driver today,</i>

566
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
<i>Lewis Hamilton!</i>

567
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,880
Most important is that
we defend Lewis. That's why, in that case,

568
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,200
podium is less important
than seeing the stewards immediately

569
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,680
and making our argument.

570
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,920
And I think Valtteri himself doesn't care
whether he's being given credit or not.

571
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,200
<i>Valtteri Bottas of Finland!</i>

572
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,440
Beating Lewis,
you know, it is so satisfying.

573
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,200
Everyone was expecting Lewis
to match Michael in the race wins,

574
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,600
but I want to delay that process
as far as possible.

575
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,080
- See you, Toto.
- See ya.

576
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,880
- Happy?
- Yeah, happy.

577
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,160
We need to be happy for a one and three.
It's not a compete misery.

578
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,040
See ya.

579
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,640
We'll do the team victory
in ten minutes, okay?

580
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,640
Feels good.

581
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,280
- Yeah.
- It feels good.

582
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,360
Look at this. The engineers are gone, so...

583
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,760
Every single driver
would do anything to get into my seat.

584
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,960
But it's not easy sometimes,
or most of the time,

585
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,640
when you are against Lewis.

586
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
It takes a lot of energy.

587
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Traditions.

588
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,640
There's a reason
why Lewis is in this team, but,

589
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,240
you know, there must be also a reason
why I am in this team.

590
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,040
I hate to be second.

591
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm not just the number two.

592
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,560
The car is so hard to drive.

593
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,120
<i>Oh, big one!</i>

594
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,280
They had an unfair advantage
that the FIA took away.

595
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,600
We are in this position
because we deserve to be.

596
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
I guess he was pissed off.

597
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,960
<i>That Racing Point,
an awful lot of pace.</i>

598
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,720
Racing Point, I don't understand.

599
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,120
Our competitors
simply didn't do a good enough job.

600
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,160
You always think about your future.
I want to do the maximum.

601
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,120
I don't want to have any regret.

602
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,200
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Is he okay?
