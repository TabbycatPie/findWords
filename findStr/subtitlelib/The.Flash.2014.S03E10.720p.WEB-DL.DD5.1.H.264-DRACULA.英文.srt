19
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,330
My name is Barry Allen,

20
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,460
and I am the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,260
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

22
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,810
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

23
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,560
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

24
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,880
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

25
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,280
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

26
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,590
and I saw him murder the woman I love.

27
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,290
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm going to do everything in my power

29
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,290
to change the future,

30
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,940
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

31
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,210
I am The Flash.

32
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,210
{\an7}Previously on "The Flash"...

34
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,610
{\an7}You wanna open S.T.A.R. Labs to the public?

35
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,200
- In two weeks? - Soft open.

36
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm Alchemy.

37
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,070
Turning innocent people

38
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,520
into meta-humans worshipping the Savitar?

40
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,960
An article used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

42
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,460
Something's changed with our future.

43
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,000
- Barry. - No!

44
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,520
What you saw was one possibility of the future.

45
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920
Then I can stop this from happening.

46
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,150
I--I don't understand. Where are we?

47
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,140
Home. I don't know...

48
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,130
what's gonna happen in the future.

49
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,590
All I know is right here, right now,

50
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,850
I wanna spend every moment I can with you.

51
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,700
Don't!

52
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,610
- Don't do this! - Barry--

53
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,070
You lose, Barry.

54
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,070
No!

55
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,310
Babe, are you okay?

56
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,380
- Yeah... - Yeah.

57
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,530
Just a bad dream.

58
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,070
Go back to sleep.

59
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,090
Yeah, sure. I'm not completely wide awake

60
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,050
after hearing you scream in your sleep.

61
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,380
You wanna talk about it?

62
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,510
No, you know what I wanna do?

63
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm gonna unpack.

64
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,410
It's been a month.

65
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,950
Do not change the subject, Bartholomew.

66
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,320
Bartholomew?

67
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
Am I in trouble?

68
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,590
Well, this is the third night in a row.

69
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,560
I know something else that's happened three nights in a row.

70
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,290
It's a fire.

71
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,530
Richmond Heights.

72
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,280
Go, Wally's gonna beat you there.

73
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,900
- What? - I just...

74
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,760
I just really love you.

75
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,040
Detective Patterson just ran inside.

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,820
He hasn't come out yet.

77
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,980
The fire department will not make it here on time.

78
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,890
Help!

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,860
I'm trapped in here!

80
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,640
We gotta get him out of here.

81
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,320
This place is up in flames any second.

82
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,840
- You see the soot around this door? - Yeah.

83
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,370
'Cause the fire has no ventilation,

84
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,440
so if we open the door now,

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,720
the sudden inrush of oxygen will cause an explosion.

86
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,890
Help!

87
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,070
Okay, so what do we do?

88
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,690
Create an exit point for the heat and smoke,

89
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,560
and remove all the oxygen at the same time.

90
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,870
- Which will put out the fire. - Help me!

91
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,820
When I say so, open the door, all right?

92
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,300
Now.

93
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,200
Flash, thanks.

94
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,300
Two of 'em.

95
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,540
Oh, man, that was so dope. How do you stay so calm?

96
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,770
You're like scary calm in the middle of a fight.

97
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,110
It's just experience, Wally.

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
That's why it's important for you to shadow me for a while,

99
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,460
and try to learn everything I know.

100
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,000
And then I get to kick some ass.

101
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,600
Let me give you some advice, Wally.

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,290
Being a superhero's not about kicking ass.

103
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,470
Well... nope, actually that's a straight-up lie.

104
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,330
There's a lot of ass-kicking involved.

105
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,250
Just keep doing what you're doing--

106
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,810
Watching me. You're doing great.

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,450
I gotta go to breakfast with Dad,

108
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,980
but I'll catch up with you guys later.

109
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,070
Yo, that's where--  mm-- Nope.

110
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,340
- You okay? - My suit goes there.

111
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,300
Ah, two suits, one mannequin.

112
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,370
That is what we call a conundrum.

113
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,610
No, I--

114
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,010
Hey, are you okay?

115
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,650
Yeah, these things have just been on the fritz lately.

116
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,180
It makes me feel like a criminal.

117
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,510
Hasn't been on the fritz, okay?

118
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,910
Uh, maybe if you charge the battery, like I told you to.

119
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,780
Oh, I'm just supposed to hook myself up to an outlet,

120
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,340
like I'm some sort of human tablet?

121
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,310
Either you charge the cuffs,

122
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,450
or you go all Frozone on us again.

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,510
Or... you could fix them for me?

124
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,350
Or I could fix 'em.

125
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,180
- Sumptuous day, brethren. - Oh, boy.

126
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,660
- Good morning, H.R. - Oh, not just good.

127
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,060
It's g-r-r-eat, and why is that?

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,340
Because I'm finally ready to announce

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,990
that the new S.T.A.R. Labs museum is ready for its opening--

130
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,570
soft opening-- so come.

131
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,290
Let's take the tour.

132
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,510
This could've been avoided. You know that, right?

134
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,950
I just don't see why you're defending the yellow guy.

135
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes, he goes everywhere The Flash goes,

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,230
but this morning, for example, he's just standing back,

137
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,960
waiting for the warehouse to burn down.

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,430
Well, maybe he's training with The Flash.

139
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,410
- You know, learning the ropes? - Okay, well, we send

140
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,040
rookie cops out on patrol, expect them to perform.

141
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,530
Look, I think the yellow guy's gonna surprise you.

142
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,430
Once he gains a little bit of experience,

143
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,940
he's gonna give The Flash a run for his money.

144
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,670
You know what I think? I think maybe he's just not that fast.

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,380
- Or maybe he's just a coward. - You don't get paid to think.

146
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,700
- And Kid Flash ain't no coward. - Kid Flash? Okay.

147
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,710
There it is. The name says it all.

148
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,900
Hey, I say we just send him to Keystone.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
We already have a Flash.

150
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,410
Wally.

151
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,550
- Did you hear any of that? - Any of what?

152
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,040
Nothing, it was just a cop being stupid.

153
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,830
- Take you to breakfast? - Please.

154
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,820
Behold.

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
- You did all this? - Yeah.

156
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,450
Well, I don't wanna take all the credit.

157
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,230
I'm too modest to do that, but yeah.

158
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,290
Uh, who exactly is paying for all this?

159
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,130
That's a great question.

160
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,150
Olga!

161
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,290
Allow me to introduce you to your new coworkers.

162
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,750
Everybody, this is Olga.

163
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,500
- Da. - Hi.

164
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,210
Oh, and she doesn't really speak English so much,

165
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,640
but she's great. So right over here,

166
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,690
we have the ticketing and the admissions.

167
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,700
Over there, our specialty coffees--

168
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,360
Oh, uh, that reminds me. Caitlin...

169
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,600
Initially, I had you targeted for ticketing,

170
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,510
but it occurs to me, with a few lessons in foam art,

171
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,080
you could very well man up-- excuse me-- woman up

172
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,960
our cappuccino stand. What do you think?

173
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,110
H.R., I think Caitlin's gonna have plenty to do as it is.

174
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
Can I ask you a question?

175
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,880
Do you want to eat pizza pockets for every meal

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,320
for the rest of your life? You don't; nobody wants that.

177
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,820
What you want is an income,

178
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,080
and we collectively need a cover for S.T.A.R. Labs

179
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,940
for our continued operation.

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,290
He makes some good points.

181
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,400
Now for the pi¨¨ce de r¨¦sistance...

182
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,350
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.

183
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,970
I'm sorry, did you make a hologram of me?

184
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,930
Oh, Francisco, you made it perfectly clear

185
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,560
you didn't want to be a tour guide.

186
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,620
You're not. You're a virtual tour guide.

187
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,200
Guess what. That falls under the umbrella

188
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,350
of not wanting to be a tour guide.

189
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,810
- On we go. - My name is Francisco Ramon.

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,270
I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.

191
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,170
It was my love of science

192
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,690
that allowed me to overcome my tough upbringing

193
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,160
and join S.T.A.R. Labs, before our beautiful

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
and handsome founder, Harrison Wells, stepped down.

195
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,450
I hope my love of science will inspire some among you

196
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,860
to join the scientific community.

197
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,990
Thanks.

198
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,960
Here's the thing.

199
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,020
I don't sound anything like that.

200
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,980
My love of science-- my love of science...

201
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,700
My...love...of...science.

202
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to take a look at that.

203
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,220
I can't do it...

204
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,910
'Cause I have important things to do, so--

205
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,350
- Oh, wha--oh, hey! Ugh! - Right now, so...

206
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,670
Guys, I gotta run an errand. See ya later.

207
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
Where you going?

208
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,270
- Ah, hello you. - Hey.

209
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,510
Am I in for another kidnapping?

210
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,340
Okay, I deserve that.

211
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,930
No, um, I just came to check on you.

212
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,720
We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.

213
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,610
That's very sweet of you. I'm doing well, thank you.

214
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,850
You know, what Savitar did-- forcing you to hurt people--

215
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,520
Savitar was controlling me, okay?

216
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,700
As far as I'm concerned, my conscience is clear.

217
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,630
Really?

218
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,840
Then why the Zolpidem? Are you having trouble sleeping?

219
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,290
Why don't we stop playing games, Dr. Snow,

220
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,860
and you tell me what you actually came for

221
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,960
rather than accusing me of having insomnia?

222
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,630
I actually need your help.

223
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,980
How can I help you?

224
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,360
Well, you're the world's foremost specialist on meta-humans...

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,690
Yes, this much is true.

226
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,340
And I need you to help me get rid of my powers.

227
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,980
I've tried everything.

228
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,380
I've run every test-- blood, DNA--

229
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,110
and I can't reverse this.

230
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,420
I need to get rid of my powers before...

231
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,520
Before what?

232
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,800
Before I hurt someone else... the way I hurt you.

233
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,730
I don't cure meta-humans.

234
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,620
I put them in prison.

235
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,910
You're on your own, I'm afraid.

236
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,030
No, no, no, no.

237
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,450
Please.

238
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,690
Okay.

239
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,810
Can I open my eyes yet please?

240
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,870
Um, yeah, but just one second.

241
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,100
- Okay. - Just, um...

242
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,640
yeah--okay, open 'em.

243
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,650
I know you wanted to unpack slowly,

244
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,440
like a normal couple, but I don't know--

245
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,350
between our jobs and the S.T.A.R. Labs museum and--

246
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,710
do you hate it?

247
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,340
Uh, n-no, no, I don't hate it.

248
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,330
You do. I just--I don't--

249
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,310
I just wanna give you the home that you deserve.

250
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,440
- I... - Barry, you have.

251
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,480
I love our loft.

252
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,930
Look... what I don't love

253
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,360
is you not talking to me about these nightmares.

254
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,980
I don't know. I mean, I've seen

255
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,470
a lot of terrible things in my life.

256
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,420
The nightmares, they're just a part of me.

257
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,170
Yeah, but, Barry, I have been with you

258
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,220
through all those terrible things.

259
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,610
This is different.

260
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,470
It feels different.

261
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,570
What are you not telling me?

262
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,880
Oh, that's a robbery in progress.

264
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,710
That is a robbery in progress.

265
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,390
Go.

267
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,360
See, I'm living with someone now,

268
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,330
so I can't have criminals constantly interrupting

269
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,550
our alone time.

270
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,570
Flash.

271
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,520
Morillo was found guilty

273
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,010
of grand theft and aggravated assault

275
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,300
after he was caught by The Flash.

276
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,730
That gun.

277
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,770
I've never seen anything like that in my life.

278
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,080
- I want a gun like that. - What happened out there?

279
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,160
Your telemetry readings dropped precipitously.

280
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,570
I don't know, but...

281
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,150
It caught me off-guard.

282
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,290
I've gotta run an errand. I'll be right back.

283
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,630
Okay, so we're up against a guy with a futuristic rifle

284
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,450
that steals jewelry and looks like a pirate.

285
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,790
A pirate. Right, then...

286
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,910
we shall call this scurvy lad boy

287
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,890
the name of Plunder. Plunder, agreed?

288
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,390
Jared Morillo, aka Plunder...

290
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,240
Okay, aren't you supposed to be working on, like,

291
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,590
- your museum, or something? - Aren't you supposed to be

292
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,720
helping me, Francisco, with me hologram?

293
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,730
Um, that's not my problem.

294
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah, I just wanna show you something.

295
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,320
Why do I feel like I'm walking into a trap?

296
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,910
Anyway, I'm gonna get CCPD to monitor

297
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,930
all the jewelry stores in the city.

298
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,820
This guys must be pretty full of himself,

299
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,830
knowing he escaped The Flash, so ten to one, he'll be back.

300
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,060
- All right. - When he is,

301
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,640
we'll be ready for him, though, right, Barry?

302
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,700
No, not we, Wally.

303
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,500
This--you're still training.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,860
Have you seen my times in the Speed Lab lately?

305
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,200
- I¡¯m almost as fast as you. - Okay, this isn't about speed.

306
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,530
This is about gaining knowledge and experience,

307
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,500
so please just trust me, all right?

308
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,510
Look, I am as overprotective a father as you can get,

309
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,850
but I gotta be honest, Barry,

310
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm--I agree with Wally.

311
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,170
I don't know, Joe. Let's just see what else

312
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,010
we can find on this guy before we let Wally loose.

313
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,620
Okay, well, remember, the best way

314
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,720
to teach somebody something is to throw them in the deep end.

315
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,130
That's how I taught you how to swim.

316
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,030
That was-- I'm still mad about that.

317
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,400
You can swim now, can't you?

318
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,130
Yeah.

320
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,870
Got your text.

321
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,230
Hi. Come and take a seat.

322
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,410
Look, I--I know I was... rude yesterday.

323
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,670
Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.

324
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,750
Yeah, there is a reason.

325
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,990
Because you are a world-class jerk?

326
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,930
Fair enough.

327
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,170
Listen, I've been trying really hard not to think

328
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,620
about my alter ego, about what he did,

329
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,260
and seeing you, it just...

330
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,460
it brought it all back.

331
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,450
Look,

332
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,450
what Alchemy did was not your fault.

333
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,270
Tell that to Dave Frieman, Ben Edwards, Jorge Gonzales.

334
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,030
These men were part of the CCPD task force

335
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,620
that Savitar murdered.

336
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,280
I should've died, not them.

337
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,150
Julian, what you're feeling, it's completely normal.

338
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,840
It's called survivor's guilt.

339
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,910
But it wasn't your fault, okay?

340
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,350
You're a victim too.

341
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,860
I--I tortured people

342
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,150
and nearly killed my best friends.

343
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,390
I didn't ask for these powers,

344
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,630
just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

345
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,920
Yeah.

346
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,980
I just don't know how to move forward.

347
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,740
Why don't you come join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?

348
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,570
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

349
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,970
- You're being serious? - Yeah.

350
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,290
Barry and the team, they'd be thrilled to have you.

351
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,140
I would be thrilled to have you.

352
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,550
I'll give it some thought.

353
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,200
Thanks for coming.

354
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,570
Tell me why I'm in here fixing your hologram.

355
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,380
Well, I'm just so persuasive. As a matter of fact,

356
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,510
my partner on my Earth, Randolf, used to say,

357
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,540
"Why, H.R., you could convince a cowboy

358
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,730
to buy dirt in a sandstorm." Cappuccino?

359
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,850
Didn't you just have one of those?

360
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,750
Oh, yeah.

361
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,640
Look, I gotta order more parts for this thing.

362
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,890
Yeah, no, go ahead. Price is no object.

363
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,130
How's it going?

364
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,130
You know, S.T.A.R. Labs museum,

365
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,970
gift that keeps on giving, so...

366
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,280
- Okay. - Barry, cappuccino.

367
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,770
- Hi, uh, no--uh, good. - Okay--all right.

368
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,680
- Sorry. - You know I'll double down.

369
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,910
- Yeah, no-- - Sure.

370
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,480
Um, I just actually wanted to ask you something...

371
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,540
about your scientific, uh,

372
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,950
- romance novels? - Oh, my novels, yeah, sure.

373
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,370
- Please, ha--have a seat, yeah. - Okay.

374
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,260
Ask any--anything you want. Any questions.

375
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,810
- Yep--all right, cool. - Yeah.

376
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,880
I was just wondering  if you've ever written about time travel.

377
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,350
But more specifically traveling to the future.

378
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,670
Oh, no, my best seller-- oh, hey,

379
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,130
"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be"--

380
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,110
that was--

381
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,700
it was all about-- it was all about this guy

382
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,860
who's actively trying to prevent his own murder.

383
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,400
Won the Nebula Award. It's well-received.

384
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,340
Yeah.

385
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,250
Um, so this character-- your character--

386
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,100
uh, was he able to change his future?

387
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,230
More specifically, if he allowed certain events to occur naturally,

388
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,150
was he only cementing the very timeline

389
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,280
that resulted in a horrible event later?

390
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,230
There were two schools of thought.

391
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,520
One faction--one group of fans--they believed,

392
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,760
you know, the future's ever-changing.

393
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,570
You know, it's not fixed, and so

394
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,990
you could make of the future anything you wish.

395
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,430
- Right. - Another group of fans

396
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,920
vehemently disagreed with it. They said, "No, no, no.

397
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,350
The future is fixed, and you can't change it

398
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,760
no matter how hard you try."

399
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,630
Where do you come down?

400
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,820
On a fixed or ever-changing future?

401
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,930
Well, I think that a man often meets his destiny

402
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,870
on the very road he takes to avoid it.

403
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,270
- Meaning? - Meaning...

404
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,790
- the future is fixed. - Yeah.

405
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,150
Yo, there's a robbery at the Payson Hotel.

406
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,400
- Go. - Yeah.

407
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,900
Bring that chopper back.

408
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,500
You just couldn't resist another heist, huh?

409
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,830
Oh, what's the fun in one and done?

410
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,010
Avoiding a 15-year jail sentence

411
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,510
in Iron Heights would've been nice,

412
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,980
but you're forcing my hand.

413
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,380
I guess it's a little late for that now.

414
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,300
Eh, guess again.

415
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Barry, behind you!

416
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,410
I can't shake these things, Cisco.

417
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,990
- Shake faster. - Huh?

418
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,360
He means phase.

419
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,800
Barry, what are you waiting for?

420
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,660
After he was caught by The Flash...

422
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,530
Watch out!

423
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,880
No, Wally.

424
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,260
I caught that whole thing, man.

425
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,150
Anything you wanna say to camera?

426
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,350
Oh, for real?

427
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,110
Uh, what up, Central City? The name's Kid Flash.

428
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,290
Wally, congratulations. That was amazing.

429
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,240
Great job, Wally.

430
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,510
Kid Flash! Let 'em know.

431
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,250
That's how it's done.

432
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,200
We just deposited Plunder in Iron Heights.

433
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,970
- Yes, you did. - His real name is Jared Morillo.

434
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,930
Turns out he's wanted

435
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,340
for a string of robberies from here to Star City.

436
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,540
Wally, what was that?

437
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,180
I mean, you're supposed to be shadowing me.

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,530
Wait, you're mad at me? I thought--

439
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,420
Observe and learn. That's it.

440
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,720
That's it!

441
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,320
Barry, ease up. Wally just saved your life.

442
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,470
I'm sorry, Wally, but if you can't learn to follow orders,

443
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,210
this deal between us, it's over.

444
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,350
Okay. Who's ready for--

445
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,460
oh, man. Wallace, B.A.,

446
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,820
you're supposed to be dressed for the museum opening.

447
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,630
H.R., we're speedsters. We have time.

448
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,520
- Nobody likes a braggart. - Yeah, but we were actually

449
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,180
talking about something important before you showed up,

450
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,430
- so... - You--

451
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,740
- Okay, you clean up well... - Thank you.

452
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,570
I like the way you dress.

453
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,570
Guys, this is a very, very big deal for all of us.

454
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,950
Come on! Don't be late to the part-ay!

455
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,240
Wally.

456
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,210
Look, I'm gonna go over to CCPD

457
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,210
and fill out this Morillo paperwork.

458
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,030
Whatever the reasoning you have, for ragging on Wally,

459
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,710
- please get over it. - Mm.

460
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,870
Caitlin

461
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,710
where is everybody? Nobody's here.

462
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,220
No one showed up.

463
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,960
A custom--our first customers!

464
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,310
Welcome. Welcome to the grand

465
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
S.T.A.R. Labs museum opening,

466
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,370
and today, for your ticket price of admission--

467
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,580
today only--you also get a free steaming cup of joe.

468
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,350
- Ticket price? - Yep.

469
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,920
I thought this museum was free.

470
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,060
did you find us through social media? 'Cause--

471
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,940
Welcome--welcome...

472
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,350
- Olga! - Da.

473
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,900
- The thing-- it's doing the thing.

474
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,380
Folks, no--wait, do--oh!

475
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,410
Wait--no, wait, half-price! Half! Quarter--

476
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,740
I'll make a new pot of coffee.

477
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,480
- Don't bother. - No one's coming.

478
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,610
This isn't working. I don't know why.

479
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,940
You see this?

480
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,870
Do you see what you've done, H.R.?

481
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,770
You have distracted us for months, so what?

482
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,490
So that you could feel useful? You're not useful.

483
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,180
This museum isn't useful.

484
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,440
You know what?

485
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,490
- That's mean. - Yeah, well, I guess

486
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,750
I learned that from your doppelganger,

487
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,890
and at least he contributed something.

488
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,000
guys, there's another customer.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,020
Hey, welcome to S-- ah, it's Julius, you guys.

490
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,410
What are you doing here?

491
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,850
Well, uh, I've given it some thought,

492
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,290
and I'd like to accept your invitation.

493
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,750
Invitation for what?

494
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,140
Did you ask Julian to join

495
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,400
Team S.T.A.R. Labs?

496
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,430
I know, he's an acquired taste, but--

497
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,980
Yeah, well, he is Dr. Alchemy,

498
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,210
the big bad's little bad, so...

499
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,480
Yeah, he--he gave Wally his powers.

500
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,980
- That, I don't mind. - Guys, I need his help.

501
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,870
I'm sorry, Cisco, but these cuffs, they aren't cutting it.

502
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,840
Every night, when I go to bed,

503
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,900
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up...

504
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,020
be her.

505
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,710
Maybe Julian can think of something that we haven't.

506
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,720
Barry...

507
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,570
when your mom was murdered,

508
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,800
Joe and Iris, they took you in.

509
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,600
Cisco, when Dante died,

510
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,560
I slept on your couch to keep you company.

511
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,290
The things we see, the things that we face...

512
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,420
no one can do this alone.

513
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,830
Trying is the biggest mistake that you can make.

514
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,320
He hasn't told anyone that Barry's The Flash.

515
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,580
I think we can give him a chance.

516
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,480
Tell Julian we'll think about it, all right?

517
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,820
Iris...

518
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,700
I need to show you something.

519
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,930
- I forgot this place existed. - Yeah.

520
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,880
The original Wells used to call it his time vault.

521
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,180
I've been coming down here a lot lately.

522
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,590
I guess I've

523
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,200
become as obsessed with the future as he once was.

525
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,510
After Flashpoint happened, this article reappeared.

526
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,740
"Flash Missing...

527
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,630
Vanishes In Crisis." Julie Greer,

528
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,600
April 25, 2024.

529
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,380
The byline used to read "Iris West-Allen.

530
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,470
The future's changed.

531
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,690
So maybe I quit my job.

532
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,570
Yeah, that's what I'd hoped at first too,

533
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,750
or something,

534
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,570
but I...

535
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,430
Look, Iris, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this sooner.

536
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,280
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force,

537
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,150
I accidentally ran to the future.

538
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,480
I saw Savitar murder you.

539
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
And I saw myself, and I--

540
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,640
I wasn't fast enough to save you.

541
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,120
Barry, no--I mean, we--

542
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,150
We destroyed the Stone. Savitar's gone, so...

543
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,870
Maybe not. I--

544
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,970
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe not.

545
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,780
Is that why you keep having nightmares?

546
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,230
You keep seeing me?

547
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,950
So what does this have to do with Plunder?

548
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,140
He was already in jail in the future,

549
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,300
so I don't know. I thought if I didn't catch him,

550
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,340
that I could stop the timeline from cementing.

551
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,250
I could prevent your death. I don't know.

552
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,520
Barry, you cannot stop protecting the city to save me.

553
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,530
Why? Um, why not?

554
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,220
I'm sorry. Uh, one robber goes free.

555
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,510
It's that versus your life.

556
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,860
Joe would want me to make the exact same choice, Iris.

557
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,900
He--

558
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,350
Iris.

559
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,110
- How long? - How long what?

560
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,550
How long until it happens?

561
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,370
This is not gonna happen.

562
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,250
Hey, look at me. This is not gonna happen.

563
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,700
Jay said that your death is just one possible future, okay?

564
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,290
So that gives us four months to figure out

565
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,740
how to stop Savitar.

566
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,940
I swear, on both my parents' lives,

567
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,530
I will protect you.

568
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,220
We can't do this alone, Barry.

569
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,530
Hey, guys, um...

570
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,540
Iris and I, um...

571
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,300
we have something we need to tell you.

572
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,400
So you're saying that four months from now,

573
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,320
- Savitar will... - Kill me.

574
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,430
Possi--possibly.

575
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,050
It's okay. Guys, I am okay. Really.

576
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,880
- How are you gonna tell Dad? - I'm not.

577
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,240
Iris, he needs to know.

578
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,600
I agree with Wallace. Joe needs to know.

579
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,880
No, guys, this news would blind him, okay?

580
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,380
We all saw how crazy he went when Wally was in danger.

581
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,680
Imagine if he knew that Savitar was trying to kill me.

582
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,930
He would go after Savitar himself.

583
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,230
Wally...

584
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,970
The future isn't set. There's still hope.

585
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,760
But, Barry, the future,

586
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,940
it's harder to change than you can imagine.

587
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,390
The future wants to happen. The way it was explained to me

588
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,160
was, imagine if you had a row of dominos, okay?

589
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,750
Now, those dominos are all set up, and it--it's--

590
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,860
Here.

591
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,530
So convenient--yeah-- uh, Barry, if you wou--

592
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,790
So imagine, okay,

593
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,690
domino--each domino is a moment in time.

594
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,030
One moment in time leads to the next,

595
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,750
so as one domino falls, it hits the next,

596
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,890
it hits the next, and the next, and the next, and so on,

597
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,080
leading to the inevitable conclusion, and that is...

598
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,750
The future.

599
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,200
And what happens if we alter certain events?

600
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,950
Well, you-- you could conceivably

601
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,350
change where you end up, but--

602
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,300
but, Barry, if you would--

603
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,460
So you could change the future,

604
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,260
but you'd have to be very careful

605
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,110
about which events...

606
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,400
you alter.

607
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,690
We need to figure out everything that happens

608
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,540
leading up to Iris's death.

609
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,460
Wait, when I saw the future, there was a news scroll on TV.

610
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,590
I mean, that could offer us some clues.

611
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,440
Absolutely. I think I can help with that.

612
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,630
Hang on, McFly.

613
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,690
About to vibe you back to the future.

614
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,040
- Can you pass me the multi-meter please? - Yeah.

615
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,130
- The multi-meter. - Yep.

616
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,790
- The multi-meter? - Yeah.

617
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,950
I'm better with the tools of the scribe.

618
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,450
There it is.

619
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,140
You sure your buddy Randolf back home didn't just

620
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,030
solve that cryptogram to get rid of you?

621
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,150
perhaps he did.

622
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,510
Look, I came to this Earth seeking redemption,but

623
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,960
I realize now, you're right.

624
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,560
Greatness isn't in the cards for me.

625
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
Okay.

626
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,850
So you failed. So nobody came to your opening.

627
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,220
Don't end it like this.

628
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,150
Greatness takes time...

629
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,750
and you know this.

630
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,780
If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.

631
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,830
Patience can do lots of things.

632
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,930
Have you ever tried it?

633
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,220
All right.

634
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,640
All right, guys. You ready?

635
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
- Yeah. - Yeah, we're ready.

636
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,400
The machine's souped up and ready to go.

637
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,790
It's gonna be a hell of a vibe.

638
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,240
All you have to do is just sit back, relax--

639
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,610
or, well, try to relax--

640
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,820
and concentrate, really focus

641
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,560
on the exact date in the future that you traveled to.

642
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,180
Yep.

643
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,600
May 23, 2017.

644
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,350
Barry, whatever happens,

645
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,310
I am right here waiting for you, okay?

646
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,930
I know.

647
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,500
- Crank it. - Three, two, one.

648
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,660
What do you see?

649
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,050
An empty street.

650
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,910
A bus stop.

651
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,700
The me from Christmas just came out of the Speed Force.

652
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,020
In other legal news, the highly publicized trial...

653
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,120
He's watching the news report.

654
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,480
AKA Plunder, comes to a close.

655
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,010
Morillo was found guilty

656
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,480
of grand theft and aggravated assault...

657
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,870
These are the headlines, right?

658
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,850
Headlines. Yeah--you know what?

659
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,740
Call--call 'em out. I'll write 'em down.

660
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,640
"Music Meister gets six-figure book deal."

661
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,110
"Luigi's opens after murder."

662
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,590
"Joe West honored at City Hall."

663
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,770
Good for you, Joe.

664
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,930
"Killer"...

665
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,510
What does it say?

666
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,480
"Killer Frost still at large."

667
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,520
"S.T.A.R. Labs museum closes."

668
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,950
"City still recovering following gorilla attack."

669
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Don't!

670
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,250
Savitar has Iris.

671
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,020
Don't do this.

672
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,720
Now finally, I am free of you.

673
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,300
Look, up on the roof.

674
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,180
Barry... I love you.

675
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,450
Hey, no, don't say that, all right?

676
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,530
- H.R. is here. - Me? Are you sure?

677
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,990
- Yeah, you weren't here before. - Future's changed since then.

678
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,800
You lose, Barry.

679
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,130
No!

680
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,180
Just get us out of here.

681
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,820
You had a rifle pointed at Savitar.

682
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,580
Somehow telling you about Iris's death,

683
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,020
it changed the future.

684
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,760
I was wrong, you were right. Your theory is correct then.

685
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,820
Guys, my future isn't the only one that we need to change.

686
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,690
No, the--these headlines, though,

687
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,450
they--they tell us what happens in the future--

688
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,610
where Caitlin becomes Killer Frost and Iris dies.

689
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,900
If we can change the headlines,

690
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,790
that means we can change the future.

691
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,970
That's right. Challenge accepted.

692
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,480
Dad's upstairs. We've been looking for you.

693
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
What happened?

694
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,740
Plunder escaped.

695
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,810
Morillo assaulted two guards on his way out of Iron Heights.

696
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,770
Any idea where he might strike next?

697
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,190
Well, we've got it narrowed down to 35 jewelry stores

698
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,230
and 48 hotels in Central City, so...

699
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,390
What about banks? Auction houses?

700
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,050
He was caught by The Flash,

702
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,340
robbing the Central City Museum earlier this year.

703
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,250
Central City Museum.

704
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,460
- That's where he is. - Where'd you get that?

705
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
- Isn't there a jewelry exhibit there right now? - Yeah.

706
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,130
Uh-huh, with diamonds-- big ones, so it makes sense.

707
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,880
Let's suit up.

708
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,530
I don't understand.

709
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,720
Come here.

710
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,280
I was a dick yesterday, Wally. It wasn't about you.

711
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,900
I was scared when you caught Plunder.

712
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,410
I didn't know what it meant for Iris's future.

713
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,620
You're ready,

714
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,030
far more ready than I was when I started.

715
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,060
What do you say?

716
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,970
- I'm in. - All right.

717
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,670
Plunder, my man. Where do you think you're going?

718
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,490
Right through you.

719
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,300
- You all right? - I'm good, dude.

720
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,340
You can have this one.

721
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,220
No, Wally. This one has to be you.

722
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,070
Why?

723
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,590
Because if you take down Plunder,

724
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,110
the news report that says that I captured him

725
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,500
in the future, it's wrong.

726
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,340
We can prove that we can alter the future

727
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,390
here and now.

728
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,540
So that's why you sent me out here.

729
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,640
Hey, I sent you out here because you're a hero.

730
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,790
Iris needs a hero right now, Wally.

731
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,940
They are running.

732
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,370
Wally, take your next left. The streets meet up

733
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,360
in about two miles. If you time it just right,

734
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,530
- you'll be able to blindside him. - Got it.

735
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,240
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

736
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,800
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

737
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,450
Do you hear that? They're saying your name.

738
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:02,460
{\an7}Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

740
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,040
{\an7}Today's top story,

741
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,170
{\an7}Jared Morillo, aka Plunder, is back in police custody

742
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,200
after attempting to rob the Central City Museum.

743
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,940
Morillo was apprehended by a new speedster,

744
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,310
who goes by the name Kid Flash.

745
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,840
Well, that settles it.

746
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,220
I think you're officially Kid Flash now.

747
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,270
Yeah, it's growing on me.

748
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,310
And this rifle is growing on me.

749
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,780
Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning

750
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,550
of what this bad boy can do.

751
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,420
How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?

752
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,560
Barry stole it for me. Right, Barr?

753
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,530
Oh, so you plundered Plunder?

754
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,790
I had to do something while Wally was cuffing him.

755
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,870
Thanks to you, we changed the future.

756
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,280
If we can change one of these events,

757
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
we can change 'em all.

758
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,990
Nothing is set in stone.

759
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,320
We'll see you guys tonight.

760
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,870
- Can't wait. - Yeah.

761
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,960
I called the local elementary school,

762
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,490
and gave the principal discounted tickets.

763
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,360
I figured, hey, you know, if the kids love it,

764
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,500
they'll tell their parents, and, well,

765
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,010
the rest writes itself.

766
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,100
You, Francisco... are brilliant.

767
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,400
Of course, science

768
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,830
is what will inspire these children--

769
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,370
not just The Flash.

770
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,320
Check it out.

771
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,410
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.

772
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,450
My name is Francisco Ramon.

773
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,430
I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you,

774
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,090
but after years of hard work and studying,

775
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,690
I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.

776
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,100
- I hope my love of science... - Should we go talk to him?

777
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,640
Will inspire some among you

778
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,010
to join the scientific community

779
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,930
as we strive to reach a new age for humanity.

780
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,930
Thank you.

781
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,320
You're very welcome.

782
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,890
Okay, the quiche is in the oven;

783
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,200
the beer and wine are in the fridge;

784
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,150
and the candles are on the table.

785
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,640
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - What?

786
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,890
I forgot the ice.

787
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,990
Instant party save.

788
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,670
Baby, you've never been sexier.

789
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,870
I know.

790
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,610
Hey, Iris.

791
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,770
How are you doing? For real, are you okay?

792
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,820
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Because if you're not fine,

793
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,880
you can talk to me. You know that, right?

794
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,620
I know.

795
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,030
All right.

796
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,490
- You ready? - Yeah. - All right.

797
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,960
I got you guys a plant.

798
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,240
That's like a standard housewarming gift, right?

799
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,340
- Yes, perfect. - Not on my Earth.

800
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,860
On my Earth, we get reptiles.

801
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,310
I present to you McSnurtle...

802
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,180
the turtle. Careful, she bites.

803
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,280
- I--this is for me? - It's for the housewarming.

804
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,700
You two did really well. This place is "Noice."

805
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,150
Thank you. Mm, hi, Daddy.

806
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,590
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

807
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,140
Yeah, right?

808
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,930
What are we gonna call you?

809
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,760
Look, I--I got a pet. Who are you trying--

810
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,250
- Hello, hello. - Oh, hey.

811
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Hi. I hope I'm not too late.

812
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,130
Right on time.

813
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,430
Good, good. This is a--it's for you.

814
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,140
Thank you.

815
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,210
So we all talked it over, and

816
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,710
welcome to the team.

817
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,080
You being serious?

818
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,590
- Yeah. - Thank you.

819
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,440
Yeah, it's so exciting. I mean, my last team,

820
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,750
they were all murdered by Savitar, so...

821
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,150
We need to work on your small talk skills.

822
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,290
Yeah, sure. Just wanted to be upfront.

823
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,910
- Come on in. - That's nice of you.

824
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,880
- You want a drink? - Uh, yeah, I'd love one.

825
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,170
Is this for me?

826
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,770
- Oh, yeah. - All right.

827
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,070
This place is incredible, Barr.

828
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,220
Thank you.

829
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,780
I have to admit, I miss you around the house.

830
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,200
- Yeah? - But Wally over there

831
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,830
keeps me plenty occupied.

832
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah, um, I already talked to Wally,

833
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,000
but I'm sorry about yesterday. You were right.

834
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,220
He's really important to this team.

835
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,280
He's a real hero, Joe.

836
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,900
Both of my sons are heroes.

837
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,100
Julian and I were talking about your battery problem

838
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,430
with your cuffs.

839
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,280
we decided we'd invest in an alternate accessory.

840
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,530
Voil¨¤.

841
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,760
Every time you go outside, solar energy will recharge it.

842
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,840
Guys,

843
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,200
this means so much to me. Thank you.

844
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,740
Of course.

845
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,980
Thank you.

846
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,210
Hey, guys.

847
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,070
I asked myself to say a few words, um, on this occasion.

848
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,140
A home, you know, it's more than bricks and mortar

849
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,690
and a turtle. It's a--it's a feeling.

850
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,930
It's a feeling of belonging, isn't it?

851
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,000
Of--of love, of course--

852
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,330
hope for the future.

853
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,090
I don't know

854
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,620
if I have ever met two people

855
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,710
who are more suited to one another than you two.

856
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,840
- To Barry and Iris. - Barry and Iris.

857
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,640
To Barry and Iris.

858
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,990
- To us. - To us.
