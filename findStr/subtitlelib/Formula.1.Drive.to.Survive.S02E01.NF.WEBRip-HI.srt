00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
[interviewer] Welcome.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,740
- Good.
- [interviewer] Yeah.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,500
[interviewer] <i>Can you introduce yourself,
tell me what you do?</i>

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,540
[Binotto] <i>Okay.</i>

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,700
I'm Mattia Binotto.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm working at Scuderia Ferrari,
team principal, managing director.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,500
[interviewer] So, have you got Netflix?

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,460
No.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,760
- [interviewer] No?
- No.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,120
- So, you haven't seen Season 1?
- No.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,460
[commentator] <i>And there's a problem.</i>

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,700
<i>Massive accident!</i>

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>Wow!</i>

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,620
[audience gasps]

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,760
[Steiner]<i> Last season...</i>

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,920
[commentator]
<i>What a performance from Haas.</i>

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
[Steiner] <i>...it was up and down.</i>

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,120
[commentator] <i>It's Grosjean!</i>

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,540
[all] Oh!

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,700
Fuck. We fucking look like
a bunch of wankers.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,700
<i>But we made a big step up.</i>

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,380
[commentator] <i>Haas get their best-ever
finish in Formula 1.</i>

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
Woah!

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
[Brown] <i>At McLaren, I don't think
we designed a very good race car.</i>

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,120
[commentator] <i>Another problem for McLaren.</i>

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,920
<i>And Zak Brown, not happy.</i>

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,560
[Williams]<i> 2018 was a pretty horrific year
for Williams.</i>

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,200
[man] <i>What's the point in even racing now?</i>

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,280
[man] <i>Very successful drivers
started with Sauber.</i>

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,280
[commentator]
<i>Leclerc is driving a brilliant race.</i>

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
[Leclerc] <i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,520
[commentator] <i>Charles Leclerc
will be joining Ferrari next season.</i>

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,536
[commentator] <i>The Red Bulls
are really going for it here.</i>

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,540
[Horner] <i>This is the best driver pairing
that we've had in our history.</i>

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,740
[commentator] <i>They have crashed!</i>

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,300
[Ricciardo]
<i>I was kinda made to feel guilty.</i>

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,260
[commentator]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo leaving Red Bull.</i>

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>He's going to Renault.</i>

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,020
[Abiteboul] You need a driver
and an engine.

40
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,460
[Abiteboul laughs]

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,340
[Horner]<i> Yeah.</i>

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,240
[Abiteboul] <i>With Daniel,
we have a strategy and a plan.</i>

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,700
[Ricciardo] <i>I just needed to get out.</i>

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,100
[commentator] <i>And the knock-on effects
mean that Carlos Sainz will lose his seat.</i>

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,660
[Sainz Jr.] See ya.

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,940
[commentator] <i>It has been
a brilliant year.</i>

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,616
[Horner]<i> Mercedes is very much
the benchmark.</i>

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,700
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton,
a five-time champion of the world.</i>

49
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,720
[Horner] <i>One chapter closes...</i>

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,660
[Hamilton] <i>We have to focus
on what is ahead.</i>

51
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,420
[Magnussen]
<i>We just gotta try and do better.</i>

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,380
I feel like I've been here before.

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
[dramatic music playing]

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,720
[upbeat music playing]

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
[man] Yeah.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,056
- [Williams] Hello. Are you all right?
- [Abiteboul] <i>Bonjour.</i>

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,440
- [Abiteboul] Netflix.
- [Horner] Yes, of course.

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,916
[Horner] Are you guys back
for a second series?

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,340
- [woman] Yep.
- [Horner] Holy fuck.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,896
[Norris] There's only one answer.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,940
[Verstappen] I was sweating.
I was like, "No way. No way."

62
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,100
Down here, where you
and the drivers will be on the boat.

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,080
- [Williams] Yeah.
- [woman] Think they're gonna

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
go up the river a little bit and then...

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Wave like the Queen?

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,080
[chuckles] Wave to the crowds.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,320
[Williams] Hello. Hi.

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,600
[man] Whoo! Hello!

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,400
[woman] Hello, Melbourne.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,780
Welcome to the very first
Formula 1 season launch.

71
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,440
Who wants to see their favorite
Formula 1 drivers here tonight?

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,940
[man] The drivers of 2019
Formula 1 World Championship field

73
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,540
- are about to arrive on the boat.
- [all cheering]

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
[woman] Drivers have arrived.

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,360
And I can spy Sebastian Vettel.

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,600
I can see Daniel Ricciardo as well.

77
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
[man] Daniel!

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>I'm Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I am driving with the Renault F1 team.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm from Australia and I'm good looking.

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,140
[woman] Look, here they come.

82
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,680
George Russell. Lewis Hamilton.

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,120
[fan] Lewis, you legend!

84
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm Lewis Hamilton
and I race for Mercedes-Benz.

85
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,976
- Shit, is that what it is?
- [man] Yeah.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
- [man] Just say Mercedes-AMG.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,380
[man 1] Hey, the Hulk is here.

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,540
[man 2] Verstappen! Max! Max!

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,720
[Horner]<i> Well, we're all here because
we love racing, we love competing.</i>

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,540
<i>In many respects, it's my life.</i>

91
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,780
Outside of my family, it's the most
important thing in the world to me.

92
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,056
[woman] Hello, darling,
I have a present for you.

93
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,860
[Horner]<i> This is my 15th season
leading this team</i>

94
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,800
and I'm as excited going into this year
as I've been about any other years.

95
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,340
[crowd cheering]

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
[woman] If you want to,
otherwise I'll do it.

97
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,220
How is life?

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,320
Good, beginning of the season
so your dreams are still alive.

99
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,380
So far so good.

100
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,596
[Magnussen]
<i>The first race in Australia is awesome.</i>

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,740
<i>You know, you're excited to get back.</i>

102
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,800
I guess it's like, in spring,

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,200
when they let the cows out
of the houses and they go crazy.

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,640
[crowd cheering]

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,900
<i>My name's Toto Wolff.</i>

106
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm the team principal of the Mercedes...

107
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,920
[in German] How do I say it?

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,200
Um...

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,960
[man] Valtteri!

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
So, my name's Valtteri Bottas.

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,200
I drive for the Mercedes-AMG
Petronas Motorsport.

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,916
[Wolff]<i> Like with everything in life,</i>

113
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,920
<i>you have to be passionate
about what you do.</i>

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,320
<i>For me, personally,</i>

115
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,700
it is about being able to add
a sixth consecutive championship.

116
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,640
That hasn't been done before.

117
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,500
[crowd cheering]

118
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,720
Where is he?

119
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,660
[crew] I'll send Sebastian
when he gets here.

120
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,040
Here he is. No, he's here.

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,940
<i>I'm Sebastian Vettel.</i>

122
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm driving for Scuderia Ferrari.

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,240
<i>Well, obviously, I'm here
because I love racing, love my job,</i>

124
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,120
the goal and ambition
is to be successful with Ferrari,

125
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,040
and whilst doing so,
we enjoy and have a lot of fun.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,936
[woman] Right.
Let's go down to the audience.

127
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,460
Who's got a question down there?
Put your hand up.

128
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,340
Here we go.

129
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,160
[man] My question's for Guenther.

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,960
After the race this year, do you aim
to look like wankers or rock stars?

131
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,100
Hopefully, rock stars.

132
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,176
- That was a good question.
- Good question.

133
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
[Steiner] Thank you for the question, sir.

134
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,936
<i>A lot of people know what
happened to us last year in Australia.</i>

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,840
[commentator] <i>Kevin Magnussen has pitted.</i>

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,080
We had two failures on the pit stops
and we retired both cars.

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,200
[commentator] <i>And who's that going slowly?
It's Kevin Magnussen.</i>

138
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,416
[commentator] <i>And by the looks of things,</i>

139
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,040
<i>one of those wheels
isn't attached properly.</i>

140
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,760
[Steiner] <i>Stop the car, stop the car.</i>

141
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,360
[commentator] <i>Romain Grosjean pulling over
in the other Haas!</i>

142
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,460
[Steiner] We fucking look
like rock stars, huh?

143
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,140
Now, we are a fucking bunch of wankers.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,500
<i>Hopefully, we can make up for it
and that would be a good revenge.</i>

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,140
[Hamilton] <i>Each season is a journey.</i>

146
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,220
<i>It's 21 races, 21 countries.</i>

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,120
<i>On the road with us at Mercedes,</i>

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,500
there's nearly 100 people
that are moving from city to city.

149
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>It's quite an incredible journey
in trying to win a world championship.</i>

150
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
And one I'm looking forward to.

151
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,240
We are doing pretty well.

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,600
We are in front of Alfa,
in front of one Ferrari.

153
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,760
Going to Melbourne, it's too early to say
who is good, who is not good.

154
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,900
<i>I'm not counting out anybody,
I mean, we are all in for it.</i>

155
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,700
Comparing with other cars,
it's always difficult the first days.

156
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,220
<i>Only the racetrack will tell.</i>

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,196
[Horner] <i>It's not really
till you get to Melbourne</i>

158
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,200
<i>that you absolutely know
where your starting point is.</i>

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
<i>It's the first time
everybody pulls down their pants.</i>

160
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,600
And you see what you've got.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,640
[woman] We'll all do it together,
please, thank you.

162
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,980
[reporter] First, how does it feel
to be here with a different team?

163
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,000
[Ricciardo] Yeah, new team,
fresh start, fresh season,

164
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
but I still have
the same expectations for myself,

165
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,940
and to deliver, and to be the best I can
with the car I've got,

166
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,820
but also, I feel a real responsibility to
try and push this car further up the grid

167
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
during my time here.

168
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,060
When I signed with Renault, a lot
of people probably didn't understand it.

169
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,900
<i>And maybe some still don't.</i>

170
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
No worries.

171
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,236
[Buxton] <i>No one saw it coming.</i>

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,496
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

173
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,500
Good luck for tomorrow.

174
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,600
[Buxton] <i>It was a massive, massive shock.</i>

175
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
- Any chance?
- Sure.

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,960
Right up until about a week
before it was announced...

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,580
Christian Horner was absolutely,
100% sure Daniel wasn't gonna go anywhere.

178
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,860
[Horner] <i>When he rang to say,
"I'm leaving to go to Renault,"</i>

179
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,680
first of all, I thought it was a wind up.

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
<i>He couldn't really give me any reason.</i>

181
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,120
<i>But with Max Verstappen as his teammate,</i>

182
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,000
<i>my assumption was that
he was running a little bit from a fight.</i>

183
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,260
[Ricciardo] <i>I, personally,
wasn't running from anything.</i>

184
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,760
<i>I still want to achieve the world title.</i>

185
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,860
<i>And to do that,
I just felt like I needed a change.</i>

186
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,796
[Driver] See you later. Take care.
[Ricciardo] Bye.

187
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,320
[Ricciardo] <i>Once I signed on
the dotted line last year,</i>

188
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>moving to Renault,
working with new people...</i>

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,180
- Daniel.
- A pleasure.

190
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,940
[Ricciardo] <i>...it just increased every bit
of motivation and passion I had.</i>

191
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,680
I'll just wave to everyone.

192
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,060
Good morning!

193
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,456
- [man 1] Good morning!
- [man 2] Morning.

194
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,720
- [man 3] Welcome.
- Thanks.

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,580
[Ricciardo] <i>For sure, there,
I felt a bit of love.</i>

196
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,480
- Sup fellas?
- [man] Hey.

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,880
<i>That was the coolest thing.</i>

198
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,200
I noticed that straightaway,
everyone's just like...

199
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
Welcome.

200
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,216
[Ricciardo] <i>I wanna do great things here,</i>

201
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,500
and I wanna feel like this is a place
where I can, A, obviously be happy...

202
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,380
- Welcome home. You okay?
- Yeah.

203
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,360
[Ricciardo] <i>...but, B,
become a world champion.</i>

204
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,280
All right, this is it.

205
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,120
It's happening.

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,620
So, that's really all I'm here for.

207
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,520
[Ricciardo] What's going on?

208
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,460
Hiya.

209
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,680
[Abiteboul] So, welcome.

210
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,580
It's your office?

211
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,960
Yeah, it is, yeah, yeah. So, I think...

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,660
We believed in him, um,
but also, he believed in us.

213
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,420
Um, it was a special moment.

214
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,040
So, this is...

216
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,000
- Race base, right?
- This is race base, yes.

217
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,840
- This is all the machining area.
- Okay.

218
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,516
So, I'll be working here?
This is this my desk?

219
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,480
- Yeah. This is where you'll sit. Yeah?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,056
And you can watch
the gearbox through the glass.

221
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Cool.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
[Abiteboul] <i>For Daniel to join us,</i>

223
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,080
<i>he was confirming our project was an
exciting project for him to be a part of.</i>

224
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,540
You know, I saw the momentum
they've had since 2016,

225
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,380
<i>and I think there was just pressure
to continue that for '19.</i>

226
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,900
It sounds busy,
so I like the sound of that.

227
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,900
[laughs]

228
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,720
Oh, I gotcha.

229
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,560
What we've done so far
is P9, P6, P4 into the championship

230
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,740
<i>over the last three years.</i>

231
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,320
So, I guess natural expectation
that the next step is P3.

232
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,460
Sorry, dude. Dude!

233
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,560
Excuse me.

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,160
[laughing]

235
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Let's hug it out.

236
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,016
That's like the greatest,
greatest band ever.

237
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
Definitely.

238
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
Respect.

239
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,220
[laughs]

240
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,336
[Ricciardo] <i>If we, at Renault,
produce an amazing car</i>

241
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,040
<i>and really get ourselves clear
of that midfield,</i>

242
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,480
<i>and get in the fight
with those top three teams.</i>

243
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,580
<i>Ultimately, we want to latch onto
Ferraris, Mercedes and Red Bulls.</i>

244
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,580
Okay, so, let's give a big round
of applause to Daniel.

245
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,760
Please, thank you!

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,040
[all cheering]

247
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,000
[Ricciardo] <i>A first podium
with Renault, would...</i>

248
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
Well, I've thought about it.
I've certainly thought about it, but...

249
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,920
[crowd cheering]

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,000
[Abiteboul] <i>Welcome, Daniel.</i>

251
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,976
[commentator] <i>It's been a long wait,
but we're back everybody.</i>

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,540
<i>Welcome along to the first day
of the Formula 1 season.</i>

253
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,140
<i>We're here in Melbourne,
it's practice one.</i>

254
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,720
[engine accelerating]

255
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
[mechanic] Hello, how are you,
how have you been?

256
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,400
- When did you get here?
- Monday afternoon.

257
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,660
[Hamilton] <i>The ultimate goal is to win,
but we have to optimize this car.</i>

258
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,920
<i>We have to get this machine to perform.</i>

259
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,680
<i>It doesn't just perform on its own.</i>

260
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,780
<i>And the championship, it could be closer,</i>

261
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,280
I really won't know until we get
to that first race, to be honest.

262
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,600
- How are you?
- I'm good. All good?

263
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,840
[Horner] <i>Mercedes are a very
well-oiled machine.</i>

264
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,740
[Wolff] Hey, ladies.

265
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,580
You okay? You good?

266
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,560
They are, without a shadow of a doubt,
the favorites going into this year.

267
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,640
<i>And they will be
an incredibly hard nut to crack.</i>

268
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,440
[mechanic] So, the brakes, we need to go
and check that with George.

269
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,100
Sounds good.

270
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,960
[Wolff] Has everything with the setup
been okay with you?

271
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,896
Yeah, yeah, everything's been good.
Fire-up's gone all right. So far, so good.

272
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,316
- [Wolff] No dramas?
- [mechanic] Nope.

273
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,700
Engine running good, running well.

274
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,720
[Wolff] <i>We have brought ourselves</i>

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,060
<i>in a position that we
are the ones to beat.</i>

276
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,080
[Hamilton] <i>Radio check.</i>

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,456
[crew] Your radio's loud and clear, Lewis.

278
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
[Wolff] <i>A critical part is to manage
your own expectations.</i>

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,720
Not feel a sense of entitlement to win,
but stay modest,

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,380
<i>not looking back because at the start
of the season, all points go to zero.</i>

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,260
[crew] And Lewis, one minute.

282
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,160
[Binotto] <i>Last year,
we were a disappointed second.</i>

283
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,840
[both speaking in Italian]

284
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,000
[Binotto] <i>We are all very convinced
on what we wanna achieve.</i>

285
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,580
But again, it will take time.

286
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,300
The competitors are very strong.

287
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,160
[technician] Before turn nine,
upshift early

288
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
closer to when you go full throttle.

289
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,280
[Horner] <i>Well, Ferrari have dominated
pre-season testing.</i>

290
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
They will be blisteringly quick.

291
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
[crew] Radio check.

292
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
[driver] Copy.

293
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,576
[Binotto] <i>All the emotions are growing</i>

294
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,480
<i>because the car has to be
reliable to finish first,</i>

295
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,060
but we are working on that.

296
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
[indistinct chatter]

297
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,716
- You all right?
- [Verstappen] Yeah, good.

298
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,836
Please, can it look like that
at the end of the session?

299
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,540
- Good.
- That would be nice.

300
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,740
Keep Olly, he's losing
a bit of hair these days.

301
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,760
He doesn't...
He doesn't need it accelerating.

302
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,280
[man] It's all ready,
whatever happens, we're ready.

303
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,200
[Horner] <i>Max very much moves into
the driver to lead the team.</i>

304
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,660
<i>He started to select
another gear last year.</i>

305
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,380
<i>And he has this growing following,
this growing intensity around him.</i>

306
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,340
[Buxton] Ever since
he signed for Red Bull,

307
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,440
Max has been the team's shining star.

308
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,516
Team management has said
that they want to turn him into

309
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,360
the youngest world champion
in this sport's history.

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,920
So, competing with that, for Daniel,
was always going to be tough.

311
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,220
[interviewer] Will you miss Daniel,
racing him?

312
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,640
Daniel's in the paddock
and he's still racing Formula 1.

313
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,640
So, I won't necessarily miss him,

314
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>but I'm just looking ahead
to the ones we have to beat</i>

315
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,300
<i>and those are Ferrari and Mercedes,
not Renault.</i>

316
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
That's the target.

317
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,700
You know, if you see
that helmet in your mirror,

318
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,180
he's not gonna be there for long
and he's definitely gonna have a go,

319
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,160
<i>and it's reminiscent of
the greats in the past.</i>

320
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,600
<i>He will not give up
and will give it absolutely everything.</i>

321
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,316
[Verstappen] <i>Well, for me the aim
is to become a world champion</i>

322
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,800
<i>and, of course,
it's always better sooner than later.</i>

323
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
<i>In 10, 15, 20 years' time,</i>

324
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,760
if I would look back and I see third,
I'm not really interested.

325
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,540
But, personally, I'm only there to win.

326
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,740
[Horner] <i>We gotta deliver to retain him.</i>

327
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,176
<i>He's got an agreement with the team</i>

328
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,560
<i>that if we don't fit the criteria

331
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,140
<i>And there's a lot of teams in the paddock

332

[Horner] <i>Coming into 2019,</i>

340
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,300
<i>the biggest strategic decision
that we've had to make</i>

341
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,880
was walking away from Renault and taking
on a largely unproven engine in Honda.

342
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Well, the missing link for us
the last five years

343
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,300
has really been the power unit.

344
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,160
Um, you know, we went from winning
four double world championships.

345
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,820
The last five years
have been difficult for us.

346
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,580
[Horner] <i>We're totally taking
a risk on Honda, you know.</i>

347
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,940
You know, we've gone to the casino.
We've put all our money on one number.

349
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,016
[Verstappen] <i>It's not like some
other sports where it's just yourself,</i>

350
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,740
which can make the difference.

351
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,620
<i>If you don't really have
a car where you can fight with,</i>

352
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,380
then you can't really show
how good you are.

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,720
<i>At the moment for me,
it's very difficult to say what we can do,</i>

354
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,180
<i>because you don't know.</i>

355
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Nobody knows.

356
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,000
[Horner] <i>The reality is Red Bull

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,940

360
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,880
[Horner] If this new relationship
with Honda doesn't work,

361
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,580
<i>if we lose Max Verstappen,</i>

362
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,400
then you'd have to question Red Bull's

[Buxton] <i>Formula 1 hands out points

<i>Then it rapidly tails off.</i>

you're not really scoring the points</i>

<i>that a top team needs
to fight for the championship.</i>

372
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,600
All you can do is get into the midfield.

[Grosjean] <i>To be fair,
everyone in the midfield</i>

374

- [engineer] Radio check, Romain.
- [Grosjean] It's good, brother.

379
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,420
I insulted. No, I don't insult you.
I insult him.

[Steiner] <i>A small team.</i>

381

<i>I compete with big manufacturers.</i>

382
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,180
We know that our opposition,
they have got bigger budgets.

383
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,640
<i>They've got more resources,
but it's not all about that.</i>

384
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,860
<i>We stand up to them

385
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,880
because we're actually
not afraid of anybody.

386
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,896
[Steiner] You know we are going
into our fourth season.

387
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,980
I think we will have a good year again.

388
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,320
It's a joy to work with you.

389
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,756
With some of you. Not with everybody.

390
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,700
Where's Romain?

391
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,080
Nothing to say. Good.

392
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,580
Yeah, I need somebody to pick on.
It's normally him. He's used to it.

Good, little bit different, huh?

400
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,960
Hopefully, it's fast.

401
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,020
<i>I don't really care about what they say.</i>

402
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,580
You have to cut out
the BS from these people

403
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,060
because they've all got an opinion,
but they don't do the job.

404
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,560
Romain, the last time a black and gold car
was on the grid,

405
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,180
it finished on the podium with you, yeah.
So can you repeat this, yeah?

406
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,016
- [Grosjean] No pressure. No pressure.
- [Steiner] Yeah, no pressure...

407
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,780
Well, we went bankrupt as well.

408
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,060
We are not bankrupt. We are not bankrupt.

409
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,560
You know, we're not bankrupt.
Anyway, not yet.

410
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Depends how many cars
you destroy this year but, so...

411
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,280
That was going to come.

412
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,940
[Steiner] It's time now
to get on the podium, huh?

413
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,500
[Grosjean] I see.

414
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,856
[Steiner] Are you upset now with me?

415
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880

493
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,880
[commentator] <i>And there's Kevin Magnussen.</i>

494
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,920
<i>With Grosjean out of it, all hopes at Haas
fall on teammate Magnussen.</i>

495
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,440
[Magnussen] <i>Whatever position
I'm fighting for,</i>

496
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,720
I only have one setting
and that's maximum.

497
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,300
[commentator] <i>Whether Kevin Magnussen
can hold off the Renault behind.</i>

498
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,900
<i>Magnussen defends his place.</i>

499
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,140
[crowd cheering]

500
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,580
[commentator] <i>You know what I've really
missed in the winter?</i>

501
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,280
<i>Max Verstappen going for some overtakes.</i>

502
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,400
<i>We start the final lap of this race.</i>

503
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,140
The whole car was coming alive.

504
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,260
<i>We seemed to have really good power
compared to the others,</i>

505
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,400
so I could basically just push flat out.

506
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,880
[commentator] <i>Max Verstappen
is going for it here.</i>

507
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>Max Verstappen moves up into third place.</i>

508
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,320
[crew] Yes, mate!

509
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,080
[commentator] <i>A brilliant
Australian Grand Prix!</i>

510
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,480
[commentator] <i>It's Valtteri Bottas who
wins the Australian Grand Prix.</i>

511
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,760
[commentator] <i>Hamilton across
the line in second.</i>

512
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,300
<i>Max Verstappen, for the first time ever,
will stand on the podium at Albert Park.</i>

513
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,220
[crowd cheering]

514
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,260
[commentator] <i>Ferrari finish fourth
and fifth, chased by Kevin Magnussen,</i>

515
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,440
<i>best of the rest, in sixth place,
putting Haas top of the midfield.</i>

516
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,236
[crew] Chequered flag, Kevin,
chequered flag.

517
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,000
P6. Perfect race, man.
Perfect start to the season.

518
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,360
[Magnussen] <i>Whoo-hoo! Ah!</i>

519
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,320
Great job, boys. Great job, man.

520
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,680
[all applauding]

521
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,580
[crowd cheering]

522
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,420
And they're finished!

523
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,940
Well done!

524
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,920
- Very happy, happy.
- First podium!

525
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,920
Thank you very much, thank you.

526
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,340
[crowd cheering]

527
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,880
[Verstappen] <i>I'm not a dreamer.
I want to achieve.</i>

528
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,120
I think everybody had
a lot of question marks

529
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,580
about the partnership
we were starting with Honda,

530
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,300
<i>but I believe that in the future,</i>

531
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,020
<i>we can win world championships again
like the past.</i>

532
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,000
[crowd cheering]

533
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,540
- Good one.
- Good job. At least one.

534
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,500
- 50% better than last year.
- Yeah.

535
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,120
[chuckles] Getting there.
One more year and we're there again.

536
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,280
[Steiner] <i>It's such a mix of feelings,
but in the end you go away,</i>

537
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,340
<i>you make sure everyone is motivated
for the next race and you keep on going.</i>

538
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,080
[Grosjean] <i>It's one of 21,
and they're all part of one championship.</i>

539
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,240
The car is performing well. I feel good.
So, I'm ready to tackle the 20 others.

540
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,240
They actually showed your start.

541
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,540
They showed your start on the screen.
It's frustrating.

542
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
Your launch was awesome.

543
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,856
[Ricciardo] <i>It's a bit
of a kick in the guts</i>

544
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,500
<i>because it's just not
the way I wanted to start.</i>

545
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,400
<i>It does get you down.</i>

546
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,520
But the positive and the flip side is that
there's still so many races left,

547
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,980
so it's not like it's the last race
of the season

548
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,680
and you've got no more chance
at retaliation.

549
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,556
[Steiner] We are not going
to vote on this.

550
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,240
If somebody opposes to that, I sack them.

551
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,300
I wasn't even watching anymore.
I couldn't give a fuck.

552
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,776
[man]<i> It's gonna be a gearbox change.</i>

553
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,936
<i>Do you think we can do it or not?</i>

554
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,040
[crew 1]<i> Two minutes to go.</i>

555
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,700
[crew 2] <i>What happened?</i>

556
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,780
They hit each other.

557
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,260
[crew 2] Fuckin' idiots!

558
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,760
[Steiner] <i>I've had enough of both of you.
You let the fucking team down.</i>

559
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,700
<i>I don't need you here.</i>

560
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,560
- [man] Hello?
- Who the fuck are you?

561
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,180
You should have thrown
some banana peels at my rivals.

562
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,340
- Can you win this weekend?
- Yeah!

563
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,580
[Horner] <i>If they're good enough,</i>

564
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,360
<i>they swim. They survive.</i>

565
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,560
<i>If they're not good enough...</i>

566
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,020
[commentator]
<i>Verstappen goes off the track!</i>

567
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,520
[Sainz Jr.] <i>I'm working more
than anyone else in Formula 1.</i>

568
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,480
[man] We're gonna remove
that subject and put you in place.

569
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,500
[Wolff] Let's crush them.

570
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,720
May the best man win.

571
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
