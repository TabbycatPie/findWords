再也别回哥谭了

科波特死前  我和他谈过

哥谭金融界事件的最新消息

34
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,040
我正站在罗纳德・丹泽尔家门前
I'm standing before the home of Ronald Danzer,

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,380
所有人  法官  陪审团  地检官
All of them-- the judge, the jury, the D.A.--

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,210
他们要什么就给什么
pay them whatever it takes.

40
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,310
我才不要为了几个
I am not going to prison just because

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,370
丢了养老金的蠢巴士司机和傻老太太进监狱呢
a few dumb bus drivers and stupid old ladies lost their damn pensions.

42
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,340
我得偷偷溜出去
I got to sneak out.

43
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,300
村民拿着草耙堵在这儿呢

事情出现了诡异的转折
In a bizarre turn of events,

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,210
一个貌似是罗纳德・丹泽尔的人

60
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,810
正缓缓升上哥谭的天空

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,230
他被绑在了...
attached to...

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,820
一个气象气球上
a weather balloon.

63
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,900
哥谭
第一季第三集

64
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,020
推车里面装满了增重用的砖头
Cart was loaded with bricks for ballast.

65
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,760
罗纳德・丹泽尔
So, Ronald Danzer

66
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,540
把半数哥谭市民的存款骗了个精光
cheats half of Gotham out of their savings,

67
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,710
但他还没接受审判
but before he can stand trial,

68
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,820
就被不明嫌犯拴在气球上飞走了
an unknown man clips him to a balloon?

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,320
都没有尸体
No body?

70
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,250
我们要认定为凶杀吗
We calling this a murder?

71
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,840
这叫为民除害
Call it a public service.

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,970
丹泽尔是个人渣  他罪有应得
Danzer was a bum. He got what he deserved.

73
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,920
我要去吃个丹麦酥
I'm gonna go get a Danish.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,330
这是我应得的
It's what I deserve.

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,540
该死
Damn it!

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,450
给我把奥布莱恩找来
Somebody find me O'Brian!

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,090
再拿点冰块来
And get me some ice!

78
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,280
是  警督
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

79
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,070
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

80
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,620
吉姆・戈登
Jim Gordon.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,880
吉姆・戈登  你是布洛克的新搭档  是吧
Jim Gordon. You're Bullock's new partner, hey?

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,480
就是你  我是比尔・克兰斯顿警督
Yeah. Lieutenant Bill Cranston.

83
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,140
布洛克告诉我你特别正直
Yeah, Bullock tells me you're a real Boy Scout.

84
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,220
觉得我们不该采取这种手段吗
Don't think we should be roughing up the skels?

85
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,800
他们的确有人权啊
Well, they do have their rights.

86
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,380
我得记住这一点
I'm gonna have to remember that.

87
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,480
或许回头把这话纹在屁股上
Maybe I'll get that tattooed on my ass.

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,100
我给你看样东西  戈登
Let me show you something, Gordon.

89
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,370
这是哥谭商会给我们的礼物
This was a gift from the Gotham Chamber of Commerce

90
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,790
感谢我们多年来尽忠职守
for years of service.

91
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,850
我管他叫奥布莱恩
I call him O'Brian.

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,410
他恰好是警局最好的审讯官
He also just happens to be the best interrogator on the force.

93
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,040
很高兴认识你  戈登
Nice meeting you, Gordon.

94
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,170
卢克  跟奥布莱恩警长问好

95
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,770
{\an8}禁止入内

96
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,740
不  不要
No! No!

97
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,110
我刚刚见过了克兰斯顿警督
I just met Lieutenant Cranston.

98
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,620
伟人  神话  传说
The man, the myth, the legend.

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,630
他就是个恶棍
He's a thug.

100
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,950
没有指纹
So, no fingerprints,

101
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,160
小推车又太容易买到或盗取  无迹可寻
and those carts are too easy to buy or steal to trace.

102
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
死亡威胁查的怎么样了
How you coming on those death threats?

103
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,610
我们不是都说明白了吗
I thought we talked about this.

104
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,840
罗纳德・丹泽尔被杀了
Ronald Danzer was murdered.

105
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,370
抓住凶手是我们的职责
It's our job to catch murderers.

106
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,320
那人是个骗子
The guy was a crook.

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,110
但他还没被定罪
Who had not been convicted of any crime.

108
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,300
去跟那两个被他骗走一辈子积蓄
Tell that to the two guys who killed themselves

109
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,560
而自杀的人说去
because he lost their life savings.

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,740
这人30年来一直养尊处优
This guy was living high for 30 years

111
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,920
市里不单对他溜须拍马
while the city kissed his ass

112
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,180
还表彰他的慈善事业
and gave him awards for being such a philanthropist.

113
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,690
那我们就让凶手逃之夭夭吗
So we just let his killer go free.

114
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,910
凶手要是走进来束手就擒  我就逮捕他
Guy walks in here, holds out his hands, I'll arrest him.

115
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,130
否则  我就当正义已经得到伸张了
Otherwise, I'm content justice was served.

116
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,840
就像韦恩夫妇那样吗
Like with the Waynes? Is that what you mean?

117
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,830
是马里奥・佩珀杀了韦恩夫妇
Mario Pepper killed the Waynes.

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,110
我们也把佩珀正法了
We killed Pepper.

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,700
案子结了
That case is closed.

120
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,120
戈登警探
Detective Gordon?

121
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,140
我是青少年保护机构的戴维斯・拉蒙德
Davis Lamond from Juvenile Services?

122
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,620
你要求见塞琳娜・凯尔
You asked to see Selina Kyle.

123
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,240
能签下监管文件吗
Could you sign for custody?

124
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:13,920
等你完事了
And when you finish,

125
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,180
麻烦把她送去我们沃特街的新楼
you can bring her to our new facility on Water Street.

126
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,640
她明天要转移去州北
She's scheduled to be transferred upstate tomorrow.

127
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,150
那估计得推迟了
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.

128
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,020
她有一起案件的线索
She has information about an investigation.

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,780
你能往后站一点吗
Would you mind... stepping... back... A bit, please?

130
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,530
等等
Wait a minute.

131
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,490
她是被绑架的小孩之一吗
Is that one of the kids that was snatched?

132
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,470
又是一个结了的案子
Another closed case.

133
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,130
你是不懂什么叫结案了吗
What is it about the word "closed" you don't understand?

134
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,260
是别的事
This is something else.

135
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,890
你继续读威胁信  找气球
Just read the letters, track the balloons.

136
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,990
我一个小时内回来
I'll be back in an hour.

137
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,460
好的  老大  马上去办
Yeah, boss. Get right on it.

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
我笔哪去了
Where's my pen?

139
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
你为什么在乎杀死韦恩夫妇的真凶是谁
So why do you care who really killed the Waynes?

140
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,520
因为我想见到真凶绳之以法
Because I want the person responsible brought to justice.

141
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,030
这句话是从书里看到的吗
Did you read that in a book or something?

142
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,550
还有
And...

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,280
我对那个男孩发了誓
I made a promise to the boy.

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,940
说啊
So?

145
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,440
凶手是从那边过来的
The killer came from there.

146
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,520
抢了男人的钱包  和女人的项链
Took the man's wallet and the woman's necklace.

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
然后开枪杀了他们俩
Then shot them both.

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,390
留了男孩一命
He left the boy alive.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,050
我在那上面
I was up there.

150
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,240
所有人都知道这些
Everybody knows that much.

151
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,910
而且凶手蒙面了
Plus, the killer's face was covered.

152
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,950
一开始不是
Not at first.

153
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,570
他走向他们的时候才戴上面罩
He pulled up his scarf when he walked toward them.

154
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,480
我瞥见了
I saw him for a second.

155
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,560
你在黑暗之中看到他了
You saw him... here... in the dark?

156
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,120
我在黑暗之中也看得见
I can see in the dark.

157
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,560
你不信我
You don't believe me.

158
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,760
别说你是不是对你所看到的撒了谎
There's a question of whether you're lying about what you saw,

159
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,110
你当时到底在不在这儿都是个问题
and then there's the question of whether you were even here.

160
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,850
-你没给我证据  -我刚告诉你了
- You're not giving me proof. - I just told you,

161
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,250
在那之前我刚偷了一个白痴的钱包
I stole some chump's wallet just before it happened.

162
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,650
就离这儿两个街区
That was, like, two blocks from here.

163
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,870
他没报警吗
Didn't he report it?

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,510
是有个人报警说他的钱包被偷了
Yes, a man did report his wallet stolen

165
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,680
贼的长相跟你相符  而且没错
by a thief that matches your description, and, yes,

166
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,400
刚好是在韦恩夫妇被杀之前
the timing does work out to just before the Waynes were murdered.

167
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,990
但也不能证明你当时在这儿
But that does not place you here.

168
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,660
我把钱包扔了
I dumped the wallet.

169
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,680
在那儿
There.

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
下水道  好极了
The sewer. Great.

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,390
倒不是我信不过你  担心你会逃跑
It's not that I don't trust you not to run away.

172
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,620
但是  我确实信不过
But, well... I don't.

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,450
你找到钱包就会放我走  对吧
You find the wallet, you'll let me go, right?

174
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
-就这么定了  -不
- That's the deal. - No.

175
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,050
找到钱包  说明你来过
Find the wallet, that places you here.

176
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,440
还得去找那个人
We still have to find the guy.

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
太扯了
That's bull!

178
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,540
就这么说定了
That's the deal.

179
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,840
真好
Oh, great.

180
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,810
该死  她说的是实话
Son of a bitch. She was telling the truth.

181
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,190
警探先生
Oh, Detective?

182
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,140
你会需要这个的
You're gonna need these.

183
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,100
等等
Hey, wait a minute!

184
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,190
拉兹罗  宝贝
Lazlo, honey,

185
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,600
去休息吧
take a rest.

186
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,850
可怜的孩子
Poor thing.

187
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,290
哎呦
Well, well, well.

188
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,760
蒙托亚和艾伦警探
Detectives Montoya and Allen.

189
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,820
什么风把二位吹来了
To what do I owe this honor?

190
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,730
来看望你一下
Thought we'd pay our respects.

191
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,850
顺便问问你有没有看见科波特
Maybe ask if you'd seen your friend Cobblepot around.

192
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,290
奥斯瓦尔德
Oswald.

193
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,640
你这么一提  我才发觉很久没见他了
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him.

194
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,660
很有意思吧
Isn't that funny?

195
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,590
几乎和两个重案组警探来找奥斯瓦尔德
Almost as funny as two detectives from Major Crimes

196
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,170
这样的小人物一样有意思
looking for a nobody like Oswald.

197
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,590
咱们就别绕弯子了
Can we stop the dance?

198
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,030
他死了  对吗
He's dead, isn't he?

199
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
因为他告诉我们
He was killed 'cause he told us

200
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,970
佩珀是被栽赃成了杀韦恩夫妇的凶手
about Pepper being framed for the Wayne murders.

201
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,110
他死了
He's dead.

202
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,460
但那个告密小人不是我杀的
But I didn't kill the little snitch.

203
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,770
听说  动手的是吉姆・戈登
Word is, Jim Gordon pulled the trigger.

204
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,940
你有证据吗
You have proof?

205
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,690
我看起来像警察吗
What do I look like, a cop?

206
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,230
我只是听说
I only heard

207
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,610
詹姆斯・戈登让可怜的奥斯瓦尔德
that James Gordon splattered poor Oswald's brains

208
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,870
血染哥谭河了
all over Gotham River.

209
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,360
戈登有什么理由杀科波特
Why would Gordon want to murder Cobblepot? Huh?

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,910
就为了不让他说出栽赃内幕吗
Just to keep him quiet about the frame?

211
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,190
这个问题问的不好  帅哥
Wrong question, gorgeous.

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,140
动手的是吉姆・戈登  命令是谁下的呢
Jim Gordon pulled the trigger, but who gave the order?

213
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,170
谁能让警察犯下冷血凶杀呢
Who could make a cop commit cold-blooded murder?

214
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,210
法尔科内
Falcone.

215
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,840
你的推理能力让我震惊
Your deductive powers astonish me.

216
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,550
说实话  我都有点怕了呢
Honestly, I just got a chill.

217
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,970
最近有流言说
You know, there's a rumor going around that

218
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,060
法尔科内揍了你的新男宠
Falcone gave your latest boy-toy a nasty beating.

219
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,660
你这样说不会是为了报复他吧
You wouldn't be looking for a little revenge, now, would you?

220
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,790
我只想为可怜的奥斯瓦尔德讨回公道
I just want justice for little Oswald.

221
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,070
科波特
Hey, Cobblepot.

222
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
你不是死了吗
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

223
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,020
我想你是认错人了
I'm afraid you have me confused.

224
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,980
我名叫迪米特里  敖德萨来的
My name is Dimitri from Odessa.

225
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,380
我听说你因为告密被杀了
I-I heard you got whacked for ratting.

226
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,720
我把你交给菲什  她肯定会好好打赏我
Yeah, Fish is gonna pay some serious cash for your skinny ass.

227
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,080
不不  求你  不要
No, no, no, no! No, please!

228
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,110
求你  她会杀了我的
Please, please, she'll kill me!

229
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,690
你干吗还要回来呢
Why'd you even come back, huh? Huh?

230
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,490
我不能不回来  哥谭是我的家啊
I-I could not stay away. Gotham is my home!

231
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,460
这是我的宿命
It's my destiny!

232
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,470
你不知道这里将要发生什么  我知道
You don't see what's coming! I do!

233
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,520
哥谭需要我  我是哥谭的未来
Gotham needs me! I am its future!

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,060
如果真是这样  那哥谭可是前途堪忧了
If you're its future, then Gotham is in big trouble.

235
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,470
是  是啊
Yes. Yes, it is.

236
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,270
我要一个金枪鱼三明治  谢谢
Can I have a tuna sandwich, please?

237
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,280
-阿尔弗雷德  我不想玩  -怎么了
- Alfred, I don't want to do this. - What?

238
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,850
-住手  我不想玩  住手  -来啊  出手
- Stop. I don't want to do this. Stop. - Come on. Swat.

239
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,520
预备
En garde.

240
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,740
这就对了  怎么  怎么了
There you go, son. What? What?

241
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,090
-就这点本事吗  -我不要...玩这个
- Is that all you got? - I'm not... doing this.

242
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,400
怎么了
Uh... what?

243
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,880
她终于爆发了
There she blows,

244
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
眉宇间有虎的凌厉
the eye of the tiger

245
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,980
呼吸间都是虎的威风  布鲁斯少爷
through the wind in your nostrils, Sir Bruce,

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,430
血管里血液翻涌
the blood in his veins.

247
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,320
这就对了  小心头
That's it. Mind your head!

248
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,150
请您原谅  先生  我差点...
I do beg your pardon, sir. I'm most...

249
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,340
看我一击
Might be the bat.

250
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,000
热血沸腾了
Blood's up.

251
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,800
那下疼了吧  也不是
That's got to hurt. No, not really.

252
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,180
我让你住手
I said stop!

253
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,530
停  放剑
Stop. Down swords.

254
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,530
我投降
I surrender.

255
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,010
瞧
See?

256
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,870
一场漂亮的
A nice...

257
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,800
剑战能让你热血沸腾  不是吗
sword fight gets your blood up, doesn't it?

258
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,090
好过翻阅这些灰扑扑的旧文件
Better than reading these dusty old files.

259
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,060
这是什么啊
What is this, anyway?

260
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,530
警方的案卷
Police file.

261
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,500
关于你爸妈的案子  你怎么拿到的
About your mom and dad. How'd you get these?

262
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,390
不是太难
Wasn't-wasn't hard.

263
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,950
你为什么要看这些文件  这多可怕
Why would you want to look at these? They're horrible.

264
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,290
会让你做噩梦的
They're gonna give you nightmares.

265
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,820
反正我拿到了
I-I have those, anyway, and...

266
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,770
我在查找线索
I'm looking for clues.

267
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,240
你还变成侦探了
What, so you're a detective now, are you?

268
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,470
如果我能找到线索的话
If I find a clue I am.

269
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,700
那你找到线索了吗
Have you found a clue?

270
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,230
还没
Not yet.

271
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,140
还没
Not yet?

272
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,020
戈登警探已经答应你
Now, Detective Gordon has promised you

273
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,040
他会找出杀害你父母的凶手
that he will find the person that killed your parents.

274
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,360
你真的相信他会吗
Do you really believe he will?

275
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,500
他会尽全力
He will try.

276
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,030
这点我可以肯定
Of that I am certain.

277
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,240
是的  詹姆斯・戈登警探
Yeah. Detective James Gordon.

278
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,010
今早你们一个顾问带了个女孩来见我
One of your counselors brought me a girl this morning,

279
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,380
我签了监管
and I signed for custody.

280
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,690
这是我正要说的
That's what I'm saying.

281
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,520
我不能带她回去  她逃走了
I can't bring her back. She got away.

282
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,810
是吗  我对此也不高兴呢
Yeah? Well, I'm not happy about it either.

283
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,840
烦躁不安吗  戈登
On edge, Gordon?

284
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,100
我很好
I'm fine.

285
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,660
有什么能帮你的吗
How can I help you?

286
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,850
我们只是想知道
We were just, uh, wondering

287
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,970
你开枪打爆科波特的脑袋
when you shot Cobblepot in the head

288
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,020
然后把他的尸体丢进河里
and dumped his body in the river,

289
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,920
法尔科内给你钱了吗
did Falcone pay you?

290
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,410
还是只算是帮阁下大人个忙呢
Or was that more of a "Favor to the Don" type thing?

291
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,220
不管你听到了什么  都不是真的
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

292
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,540
那你的意思是你没杀科波特
Oh, so you mean you didn't kill Cobblepot?

293
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,290
还是你不是为了法尔科内
Or you didn't do it for Falcone?

294
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,710
我们想给你个对我们坦白的机会
We thought we'd give you a chance to tell us the truth.

295
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,680
警察之间说句实话
Cop to cop.

296
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,090
你们没听懂我的话  我没杀他
You're not listening. I didn't kill him.

297
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,510
那9月17号那晚你在哪
Okay, so where were you on the night of September the 17th?

298
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,530
你真的要问我这个问题吗
Are you really asking me this?

299
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,900
重案组什么时候变成内务处了
Since when did Major Crimes become I.A.?

300
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,950
就在警察开始替黑帮杀人的时候
When cops started doing hits for the Mob.

301
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,030
是吗  那等你有真凭实据再来找我
Yeah? Well, come back to me when you have actual proof.

302
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,170
在此之前  别浪费我的时间
Until then, don't waste my time.

303
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,990
戈登  给你个建议
Hey, Gordon, piece of advice:

304
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,270
洗个澡
Take a shower.

305
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,430
你像下水道一样臭
'Cause you stink like a sewer.

306
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,080
任何工作都行  哪怕是洗碗工
Any job at all. Even dishwasher.

307
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,450
我们满员了
We're staffed up.

308
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,890
我只求一个证明自己的机会
I only ask a chance to prove myself.

309
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,390
你在餐厅里工作过吗
You ever work in a restaurant?

310
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,710
不算是
Not exactly...

311
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,800
在餐厅里要站一整天
Here, you're on your feet all day.

312
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,050
你穿的鞋子都不对
You don't even have the right shoes.

313
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,590
你在这儿啊
There you are.

314
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,730
气象气球工厂的老板在楼下
I got the owner of a weather balloon factory downstairs,

315
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,480
他说要给我们提供线索
says he's got something for us.

316
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,230
蒙托亚和艾伦来过
Montoya and Allen came by.

317
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,780
-指控我杀了科波特  -见鬼的
- Accused me of killing Cobblepot. - Damn.

318
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,670
-肯定是有人泄密了  -无所谓
- Somebody must've talked. - Doesn't matter.

319
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,900
他们来找你  就说明他们没有证据
The fact they're here means they got nothing,

320
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,600
他们也查不到什么
and they're gonna get nothing.

321
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,670
说到底  没人在乎科波特
End of the day, no one cares about Cobblepot.

322
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,680
因为他活该  就像罗纳德・丹泽尔
Because he deserved it. Like Ronald Danzer.

323
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
不要小题大做
Don't make this into something bigger.

324
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,840
你也是迫不得已
You did what you had to do.

325
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280
是  他也许真就活该
And, yes, he probably did deserve it.

326
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
他是菲什的手下
He worked for Fish.

327
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,910
她不会雇什么好种
She doesn't employ altar boys.

328
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,090
那马里奥・佩珀呢  他也该死吗
What about Mario Pepper? He deserve what he got?

329
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,250
当然了
Hell, yes.

330
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,440
他就是个垃圾
He was a dirtbag.

331
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,700
他想开枪杀你  记得吗
He tried to shoot you, remember?

332
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,190
这事我们不是都说过了吗
And I thought we were done talking about this.

333
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,490
等杀害托马斯和玛莎・韦恩的真凶
We're done talking about this

334
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,980
而不是我们杀的替死鬼
when the person who actually murdered

335
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,350
被关进监狱
Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail,

336
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,570
这事才算过去
not the person we killed for it.

337
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,840
我再跟你说一遍  戈登  放弃吧
For the last time, Gordon, let it go.

338
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,860
不然呢
Or what?

339
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,260
下一个被拉去码头枪决的人
Am I gonna be the next person taken out to the pier

340
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,780
是不是就轮到我了
to get a bullet in the head?

341
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,640
证人等着我们呢
The interview's waiting.

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,990
打扰一下
Pardon me.

343
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,320
你在街对面那家意大利餐厅工作
You work at that Italian restaurant across the way,

344
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,020
-是吗  -是的
- don't you? - Yeah.

345
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,920
你穿几码鞋
And what size are your shoes?

346
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,490
42码
Uh, nines.

347
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,170
真巧啊
What a coincidence!

348
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,200
我看到电视上那个气球
When I saw that balloon go up on TV,

349
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,330
立刻就知道那是我的
I knew it was one of mine,

350
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,830
我跟自己说"吉米
and I said to myself, "Jimmy boy,

351
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
你最好马上报警
you better call the cops right away,

352
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,350
不然他们会把责任推到你头上来"
or they'll try and pin this on you."

353
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,260
是你来找我们的啊
So it was you who called us.

354
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,450
我还以为是我搭档
And here I thought my partner had gone

355
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,240
想方设法找到了你
to the trouble of tracking you down.

356
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,250
你的气球怎么会被用来杀罗纳德・丹泽尔
How exactly was one of your balloons used to kill Ronald Danzer?

357
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,630
一个月前气球被我一个雇员偷走了
It was stole by my bum of an ex-employee a month ago.

358
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,120
他叫卡尔・斯麦克斯
Carl Smikers.

359
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,910
这就是招年轻人做事的后果
That's what I get for hiring a kid.

360
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,360
他有提过丹泽尔吗
Did he ever mention Danzer?

361
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,640
当然没有
Hell, no.

362
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,310
没想到他竟然知道丹泽尔是谁
I'm surprised he even knew who Danzer was.

363
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,590
他可不是什么
We ain't talking about

364
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,940
聪明过人的人物
one of those intellectually superior types here.

365
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,290
你有他地址吗
You got an address?

366
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,490
有  你们要是找到他
Yeah, but you find him,

367
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,050
看能不能把其它的给我要回来
see you can get back the others.

368
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,870
其它什么
The other what?

369
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,370
其它气球
The other balloons.

370
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,830
那东西一个一千呢
A grand a pop those things are.

371
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,400
他偷走四个
He stole four.

372
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,750
47块  弗兰基  我下周再来
$47? Frankie, I'm coming back next week.

373
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,430
给我积极点  知道不
Try to show some initiative, all right?

374
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,010
知道了  比尔
Okay. Bill.

375
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,450
你真是毒贩子的耻辱
You're a disgrace to drug dealers.

376
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,790
热狗
Hot dog?

377
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,840
滚开
Get lost.

378
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,620
热狗
Hot dog?

379
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,520
我叫你滚开
I said get lost!

380
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,930
克兰斯顿警督
Lieutenant Cranston?

381
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,400
行了
All right.

382
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,910
看看...
Let's see...

383
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,860
看你有什么
Let's see what we got here.

384
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,730
怎么回事
What the hell?

385
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,850
你是谁
Who are you?

386
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,590
不要啊
Oh, no.

387
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
好吧
Right.

388
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,810
早餐也不吃
So no breakfast then?

389
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,890
昨晚晚餐也没吃
And no dinner last night?

390
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,140
有什么打算
What's the new program?

391
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,190
想看看不吃东西能撑多久吗
Trying to see how long we can go without eating anything?

392
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,410
如果这样  我也不必
Right. If that's the case, I should save myself the trouble

393
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,490
费神做了
of making it.

394
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,820
你看这个了吗
Have you seen this?

395
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,270
{\an8}气球人杀死腐败警察

396
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,790
看了  那疯子四处
Oh, yeah, yeah. That nuts going around

397
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,860
用气球杀人
offing people with balloons.

398
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,730
我有更简单的方法
I can think of easier ways to kill someone.

399
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,200
布鲁斯少爷  恕我
Master Bruce, forgive me for...

400
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,050
老生常谈  说什么"这种时候"
uttering the tired old words "in times like these,"

401
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,890
但在这种时候
but in times like these,

402
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,280
你更应该保持体力
you really need to keep your strength up.

403
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,690
我就是不饿
I'm just not hungry.

404
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,620
早上好
Morning.

405
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,360
谢谢
Thank you.

406
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,250
我本不想吵醒你
I tried not to wake you.

407
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,820
没事  我正好要开会
It's fine. I have a meeting.

408
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,420
你还好吧
You okay?

409
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,930
昨晚都没怎么睡觉
You hardly slept last night.

410
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,840
工作的事
Just work.

411
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,320
气球人吗
This Balloonman thing?

412
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,380
报纸上都这么说
That's what the paper's calling him.

413
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,170
还说他杀了个警察
And it says he killed a cop.

414
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,560
你不会有事吧
You're not in danger, are you?

415
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,370
不用担心我
You don't have to worry about me.

416
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,220
那是怎么回事
Well, what is it then?

417
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,560
我能看出来你有心事
I can see something's bothering you.

418
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,320
昨天
Yesterday,

419
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,820
第一个被害人  罗纳德・丹泽尔
the first victim, Ronald Danzer,

420
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,930
是个骗子
was a con man.

421
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,070
没人在意
Nobody cared.

422
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,010
而如今警察遇害
Now that a cop's been targeted,

423
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,590
调查就得到了全方位的支持
the investigation will get all the support it needs.

424
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,830
这不对
It's not right.

425
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,490
每个人都很重要  不该有分别
Everyone has to matter or nobody matters.

426
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,590
不然人民会失去信心
Otherwise people lose faith.

427
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,930
这才会出现义警
That's when you get vigilantes.

428
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,070
但那不是你的错
But that isn't your fault.

429
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,230
正相反  你给了人们信心
I mean, if anything, you're giving people faith.

430
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,650
是吗
Am I?

431
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,140
怎么说
How?

432
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,130
你的第一宗案子  就抓住了韦恩案凶手
Your first case, you caught the Wayne killer.

433
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,240
你知道那对这座城市意味着什么吗
Do you have any idea what that meant for the city?

434
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,650
你是个英雄
You're a hero.

435
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,800
我得走了
I gotta go.

436
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,820
你是警察又如何
Don't matter if you a cop.

437
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,110
你不干净  气球人就会找上你
You dirty, the Balloonman gonna get you.

438
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:05,280
{\an8}哥谭为气球人疯狂

439
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,180
哥谭市民也该意识到
It's time the people of Gotham realize

440
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,360
他们要维护自己的权益
that they have to stand up for themselves.

441
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,470
气球人下一个该抓我的房东
Hey, Balloonman ought to get to my landlord next.

442
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,740
他是个无赖  他叫哈罗德・布莱...
He's a crook. And his name is Harold Bl...

443
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,960
棒极了  这正是
This is wonderful. This is like...

444
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,810
我希望今天出现的情形
my dream of how today was gonna go.

445
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,400
除了让警局丢脸
Besides the black eye to the department,

446
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,100
现在还出了个杀腐败警察的义警
now we have a vigilante who kills bad cops.

447
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,690
克兰斯顿没那么坏
Cranston wasn't that bad.

448
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,910
管他干过什么事
But whatever he was or wasn't guilty of,

449
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,340
克兰斯顿可是哥谭市警局的警督
Cranston was a lieutenant in the GCPD.

450
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,700
没人可以随便杀警察
You don't get to go around killing cops.

451
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,890
这两起案子调查的怎么样了
So where are you on this and the Danzer murder?

452
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,800
我们在找一个名叫卡尔・斯麦克斯的人
We're looking for a man named Carl Smikers.

453
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,920
他原本是失窃气球工厂的工人
He was an employee at the factory where the balloons were stolen.

454
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,770
我们派人在他的公寓外监视
We have uniforms staking out his apartment,

455
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,540
但他自昨晚就没回去过
but he hasn't been back there since last night.

456
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,460
是他干的吗
And you like him for this?

457
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,600
他有罪
Oh, he's guilty.

458
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
把我和他关一起  他会有罪的
Leave me in a room with him, he'll be guilty.

459
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,590
他肯定有联系  但我不确定他就是凶手
He's definitely connected, but I'm not sure he's the one.

460
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,630
他拿了气象气球
He had weather balloons!

461
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,790
克兰斯顿和丹泽尔都是被气象气球杀死的
Cranston and Danzer were killed with weather balloons!

462
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,020
他就是凶手
He's the guy!

463
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
斯麦克斯高中都没毕业
Smikers never graduated high school.

464
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,690
他没有一份工作超过一年
He's never held a job for more than a year,

465
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,310
他曾因招妓和藏毒被捕
he's got busts for soliciting, possession.

466
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,970
告诉她还有其它气球
Tell her about the other balloons.

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,510
什么其它气球
What other balloons?

468
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,650
斯麦克斯的老板说丢了四个气球
Smikers' boss mentioned that four balloons are missing.

469
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,850
还有两个流失在外
There are two of them still out there.

470
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,780
那么说还有两个目标
So two more targets?

471
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,950
知道可能是谁吗
We have any sense who they might be?

472
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,320
丹泽尔和克兰斯顿都是名人
Danzer and Cranston were both known figures,

473
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,780
也都出了名的腐败
and known to be dirty.

474
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,560
凶手不需要专业知识也能锁定他们
Killer didn't need any special knowledge to target them,

475
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,360
所以接下来的目标应该是
so, it's likely the next target is

476
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,000
腐败的公众人物
public and known to be corrupt.

477
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,630
总之  哥谭的所有当选官员都该待在家里
Basically, every elected official in Gotham should stay indoors.

478
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,460
找到他  马上
Find him. Now.

479
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,690
我们会的
We will.

480
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,150
我们会的
We will?

481
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,610
不是说凶手是在替民除害吗
What happened to the killer doing the city a favor?

482
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,620
别让我觉得你真的在意
You're gonna make me think you actually care.

483
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,860
听着  机灵鬼  你想杀骗子金融家
Listen, smartass, you want to kill a corrupt financier,

484
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,460
随你
be my guest.

485
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,870
杀警察就是工作安全问题了
You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.

486
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,000
我们需要个计划
We need a plan.

487
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,870
放轻松  找人我可是略知一二
Relax. One thing I do know is how to find someone.

488
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,970
今天晚些时候吧
Maybe later tonight.

489
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,390
-给你  -太好了  多谢
- Here you go. - Beautiful, baby.

490
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,300
拿去吧
There you go.

491
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,700
他告诉你什么了
What did he tell you?

492
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,460
没什么  我饿了而已
Nothing. I was just hungry.

493
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,600
听好了  你洗盘子
Here's the deal: You wash dishes,

494
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,140
擦地  倒垃圾
mop the floor, take out the trash.

495
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,230
其他时候  你就是聋子傻子瞎子
Otherwise, you're deaf, dumb and blind.

496
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,240
-我懂  -你不懂  但你会明白的
- I understand. - No, you don't, but you will.

497
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,440
这里可不像其他餐馆  你要么明白
This ain't like other places, and you'll either get it...

498
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,140
要么被开掉
Or I'll be fired?

499
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,070
可以这么说
You could say that.

500
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,810
你完全不需要担心
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

501
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,630
我知道这是个好机会
I know that this is a great opportunity.

502
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,040
马罗尼阁下
Don Maroni!

503
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,430
见到您真高兴
Good to see you.

504
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,410
-最近怎样  -欢迎欢迎
- Doing good? - Welcome. Welcome.

505
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,840
好的
All right.

506
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,020
确实是个大好的机会
A great opportunity, indeed.

507
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,000
嫌疑犯两年前有过招妓前科
So, our suspect had a prior for soliciting two years ago, right?

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
我一个姑娘觉得他很面熟
So, one of my girls thought he looked familiar,

509
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,920
记起他喜欢膀大腰圆的类型
remembered he liked big, brawny types.

510
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,690
所以她给我介绍了
So, she pointed me to that pimp,

511
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,000
专门负责那个类型的皮条客
that guy who specialized in that.

512
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,510
-他记起来...  -在你修理他之后
- He remembered... - After you roughed him up a little.

513
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,270
他以前经常给干洗工张先生  送货上门
...that he used to do deliveries for this, uh, dry cleaner, Mr. Chang.

514
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,490
而且他印象最深的是
And he remembered, on top of everything else,

515
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,770
这家伙爱打麻将
the guy was a mahjong guy.

516
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,340
他曾欠华人赌博经纪人五千美元
He was into these Chinese bookies for, like, five grand.

517
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,280
他们让你来这儿
And they sent you here.

518
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,620
一个自行车信使透露
By way of some bike messengers,

519
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,360
这人负责南区的扒手
the guy that runs pickpockets on the south side,

520
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,930
还特喜欢一家锅贴店
and a pot sticker joint the guy apparently loved.

521
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,530
龙煲店外卖
Dragon Palace.

522
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,700
我们没定...
We didn't order any...

523
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,970
卡尔・斯麦克斯
Carl Smikers?

524
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,600
快跑
Run!

525
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,140
哥谭市警局  你被捕了
GCPD! You're under arrest!

526
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,890
住手  不然我就...
Stop, or I'll...

527
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,290
不许动
Don't move.

528
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,280
吉姆  能帮个忙吗
Jim, a little help!

529
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,620
放下
Put it down!

530
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,480
马上放下
Put it down now!

531
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,180
你把杀了奥斯瓦尔德的警察透露给重案组
You put the MCU onto that cop killing Oswald.

532
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,560
法尔科内如果发现是你漏的消息
Falcone finds out it came from you... I mean,

533
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,920
我不介意他对我做的事  只是...
I don't mind what he did to me, it's, uh...

534
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,590
拉兹罗  亲爱的
Lazlo, honey,

535
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,860
你在担心我  是吗
you're worried about me, aren't you?

536
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,110
但是你要记住
But you must remember,

537
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,800
法尔科内想伤害的不是你
it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt.

538
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,260
而是我
It was me.

539
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,450
明白了吗
Understand?

540
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,750
那孩子软了腰杆
The boy's lost his spine.

541
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,750
不是所有人都能经受住那种毒打
Not everyone's built for a beating like that.

542
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,160
罗马人近来的那个新宠
What's that new piece that the Roman's been seeing--

543
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,530
叫什么来着  娜塔莉亚  娜迪亚
what's her name-- Natalia? Nadia?

544
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,540
告诉布奇她会出意外
Tell Butch she's going to have an accident.

545
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,480
真是可惜
Such a shame.

546
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,410
她还挺漂亮的
She was a pretty girl.

547
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,000
顺便解决掉拉兹罗
And get rid of Lazlo while you're at it.

548
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,770
他太破坏气氛了
He's bringing down the mood.

549
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,070
我很荣幸
With pleasure.

550
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,460
我的天
My God!

551
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,700
抱歉  我敲门了  但我听到里边有人
Sorry. I knocked, but I could hear someone in here, and...

552
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,880
你怎么进来的
How did you get in?

553
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,390
我还有钥匙  记得吗
I still have a key, remember?

554
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,190
那你就擅自进来了
And you just let yourself in?

555
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,340
还给我
Give it to me.

556
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,850
我可以叫人逮捕你
I could have you arrested.

557
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,760
我也可以逮捕你
Or I could arrest you.

558
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,360
现在就嗑药是不是早了点
It's kind of early to get high, isn't it?

559
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,930
今天压力有点大
It's been a stressful day.

560
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,140
你就只嗑药了吗
And is that all you're doing?

561
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,230
是的  失望吗
Afraid so. Disappointed?

562
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,190
别耍我  芭芭拉
Don't play with me, Barbara.

563
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,520
我那时也在  记得吗
I was there, remember?

564
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,400
经历了全部
Through all of it.

565
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,910
你是说你参与其中了吧
Don't you mean you were a part of it?

566
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,180
好吧
Fine.

567
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,160
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

568
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,770
是的  只有这个
Yes. This is it.

569
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,820
你已经闯入我家
And now that you've broken into my home

570
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,630
指责我吸毒
and accused me of being a drug addict,

571
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,250
你可以走了
you can leave.

572
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,020
谈完戈登的事我再走
Not until we talk about Gordon.

573
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,190
他杀了人
He's killed a man.

574
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,830
你说过了  但那不是真的
You told me. It's not true.

575
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,860
不是马里奥・佩珀  是另一个人
Not Mario Pepper, another man.

576
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,220
是哥谭第一黑帮老大卡麦・法尔科内
And he killed him on the orders of Carmine Falcone,

577
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,310
下令让他杀的
biggest crime boss in Gotham.

578
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,840
你说谎
You're lying.

579
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,460
但是  我该习惯了
But, you know, I guess I should be used to that.

580
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,460
没错
True.

581
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,320
我们在一起时  我的确对你说过谎
When we were together, I did lie to you.

582
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,630
说过很多谎
A lot.

583
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,330
但你总是知道的
But you always knew.

584
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,150
你只要直视我的眼睛
You looked in my eyes,

585
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,200
就会知道我是否对你说谎
and you knew when I was lying to you.

586
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,000
我现在在说谎吗
Am I lying now?

587
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,480
是因为我爱他吗
Is it just because I love him?

588
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,000
所以你这么铁了心要毁了他
Is that why you are so determined to destroy him?

589
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,520
我已经戒酒一年了
I've been sober for a year.

590
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,740
我知道这无法抹去我的过错
Look, and I know that doesn't erase the things that I did.

591
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,240
但我还是在乎你的
But I still care about you.

592
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,070
我无法忍受你跟他在一起
I can't stand you being with this man.

593
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,470
你值得拥有更好的
You deserve better.

594
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,880
走
Leave.

595
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,160
马上
Now.

596
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,510
问他奥斯瓦尔德・科波特失踪的那晚他在哪
Ask him where he was the night that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

597
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,570
那是他杀害的人的名字
That's the name of the man he killed.

598
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,670
我说的是实话  我没杀那些人
I-I'm telling the truth, I didn't kill those guys.

599
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,110
杀警察  为什么我要杀警察
I mean, a cop?! Why would I kill a cop?!

600
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,330
也许因为你就是个偷东西  杀警察的垃圾
Maybe because you're a thieving, cop-murdering pile of crap.

601
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,250
但这还只是个理论
But, mind you, that's just a theory.

602
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,510
你承认你偷气球
You admit stealing the balloons.

603
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,520
对  那是因为我欠高利贷的钱
Yeah. Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks,

604
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,610
如果我不还钱  他们会切下我的...东西
and-and if I didn't pay 'em, they were gonna cut off stuff.

605
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,100
那么丹泽尔和克兰斯顿到底是谁杀的
So if you didn't kill Danzer and Cranston, who did?

606
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,560
你把气球卖给谁了
Who'd you sell the balloons to?

607
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,600
我没见着他的脸
I never saw his face.

608
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,620
我们有个交易地点  交换气球和钱
We had a drop-off point to exchange the balloons and money.

609
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,970
知道这什么情况吗  吉姆
You know what we got here, Jim?

610
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,620
这是个犯罪大师啊
We got us a criminal mastermind, hmm?

611
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,810
不仅凶器消失在同温层里
Not only is the murder weapon in the stratosphere,

612
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,490
尸体也是  简直是完美的犯罪
but so are the bodies. It's the perfect crime!

613
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,910
尸体会回来的
The bodies will come back.

614
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,000
你说什么
What are you talking about?

615
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,420
你们不知道气象气球的原理吗
Do you guys not know how weather balloons work?

616
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,330
告诉我们  天才  不然我打死你
Tell us, genius, or I'll beat it out of you.

617
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,130
等下  好吧
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

618
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,410
气球上升  升得越高  就越冷
They-they rise up, and-and it gets colder and colder,

619
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,730
气球就会变脆
and the balloon gets brittle,

620
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,400
氦气开始膨胀
and the helium expands.

621
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
然后呢
Then what?

622
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,230
然后就爆了
It pops.

623
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,330
我真的开始讨厌这宗案子了
I'm really starting to dislike this case.

624
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,950
他们在哪找到的那么大的铲子
Where do you think they find shovels that big, huh?

625
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,150
现在我们只需要担心最后一个气球了
We only have to worry about one more balloon.

626
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,430
-谁  -奎恩主教
- Who? - Cardinal Quinn.

627
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,980
他当时在园子里沉思
He was meditating in his garden.

628
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,640
阿尔瓦雷斯正在赶往凶案现场
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

629
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,180
这下教会也要向我们施压了  真好
Now we're gonna have the church on our back. Great.

630
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,490
虽然奎恩是出了名的闲混神父
Forget the fact that Quinn was known as the diddling priest.

631
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,370
这是我们在克兰斯顿的口袋里找到的
Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.

632
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,020
没摔碎的东西
What wasn't smashed to bits.

633
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,000
为什么上面有你的名字  吉姆
Why's your name on this, Jim?

634
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,030
我知道气球人是谁了
I know who the Balloonman is.

635
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,030
{\an8}巴蒙特餐馆

636
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,840
法尔科内是哥谭的老大
You see, Falcone is only the boss of Gotham

637
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,200
只因为人们认定他是老大
because people believe he's the boss.

638
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,850
所以阿卡姆会改变现状
That's what this Arkham thing is gonna change.

639
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,710
人们会看清皇帝新衣的真相
People are gonna see that the emperor's got no clothes.

640
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,420
我在白费唇舌  你个白痴
I'm wasting my breath. You're an idiot.

641
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,380
滚出去吧
Get out of here.

642
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,000
你是什么人
Who the hell are you?

643
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,820
我...很抱歉  先生
Uh, I-I'm sorry, sir.

644
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,010
-我是...  -等一下
- I'm... - Hold on.

645
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,280
放下
Put that down.

646
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,180
你刚刚在听我说话  你是新来的
You were listening, huh? You're new.

647
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,020
-叫什么  -帕罗  先生
- What's your name? - Paolo, sir.

648
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,560
意大利人吗  看着不像啊
Italian. You don't look Italian.

649
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,450
我母亲有意大利血统
Well, on my mother's side.

650
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,270
我只承认我母亲这边的亲戚
It's the side that I claim.

651
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,770
爱妈妈的好孩子
A boy who loves his mother.

652
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,210
给你  拿着吧
Here you go. Take it.

653
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
我以前也像你一样
I was a lot like you.

654
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,950
白手起家
Started from nothing.

655
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,190
但我低调做人  努力做事  看看我如今的成就
But I kept my head down, I worked hard, now look at me.

656
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,620
哥谭是机遇之城
Gotham is the city of opportunity.

657
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,890
是啊  先生  我也这样认为
Yes, sir. I believe that, too.

658
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,370
你刚刚听到我说的话了吗
You hear what I was saying back there?

659
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,890
那些名字  法尔科内  阿卡姆
Those names: Falcone, Arkham--

660
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
你知道什么意思吗
they mean anything to you?

661
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,220
老实说  先生  我什么都没听到
Honestly, sir... I didn't hear anything at all.

662
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,160
好孩子
Attaboy.

663
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,640
气球人再度出击
The Balloonman has struck once again.

664
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:01,230
{\an8}气球人杀死神父

665
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,780
曾被指控犯有多起性骚扰的奎恩主教
Cardinal Quinn, accused of multiple counts of sexual abuse,

666
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,360
成了这位义警的新目标
is the latest victim of the vigilante.

667
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,290
你看  这可不好
See this... this is not good.

668
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,330
哪能随随便便就杀神父
You can't go around killing priests.

669
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,220
至少不能当众杀
At least not in public.

670
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,600
去照顾妈妈吧  帕罗
Got take care of your mother, Paolo.

671
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,060
他叫戴维斯・拉蒙德  48岁
His name is Davis Lamond; 48.

672
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,540
他在青少年保护机构已经干了15年了
He's worked at Juvenile Services for 15 years.

673
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,570
没有前科
No priors.

674
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,220
今天没去上班
He didn't show up for work today,

675
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,050
一直没回公寓
and hasn't been back to his apartment.

676
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,280
我们在两边都安排了警员
We have uniforms at both.

677
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,740
你确定就是他
And you're positive he's the killer?

678
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,620
我们在克兰斯顿尸体上找到一张表格
We found a form on Cranston's body

679
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,500
那是我昨天早上给拉蒙德的
that I'd given Lamond yesterday morning.

680
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,940
还有能打开拉蒙德公寓的钥匙
Also keys that opened Lamond's apartment.

681
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,680
我猜他们当时打了起来
I'm guessing they had a scuffle,

682
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,610
克兰斯顿翻了他的兜
Cranston went through his pockets,

683
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,520
但拉蒙德还是把他吊到气球上了
but Lamond managed to attach him to the balloon.

684
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,880
那拉蒙德为什么突然爆发了
So what caused Lamond to snap?

685
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,050
不知道
Not sure.

686
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,170
拉蒙德的同事都说他周到  尽心
Lamond's coworkers describe him as thoughtful, dedicated,

687
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,790
还有几个人说人很好
sweet-- a few said that.

688
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,090
好啊  是那种人很好的杀警义警呢
Oh, great, one of those sweet cop-killing vigilantes.

689
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,550
他最后一个目标呢
And what about his last target?

690
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,470
跟其他的一个规律
Same profile as all the rest.

691
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,130
知名
Well known.

692
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,860
看似受人尊敬
Seemingly respectable.

693
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,100
实则腐败
Actually corrupt.

694
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,180
这可是哥谭
This is Gotham.

695
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,610
这并没有缩小范围
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

696
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,030
而与此同时  市长  市议会
Meanwhile, I have the mayor, city council,

697
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,740
半数的法官和神职人员都躲在家里
half the city's judges and clergy hiding indoors

698
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,900
叫嚷着让总警监找到凶徒
screaming at the commissioner to find the guy.

699
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,470
你猜猜总警监会冲谁嚷嚷
And guess who he screams at?

700
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,890
我们已经发布了他的照片
We've got his photo out there.

701
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,190
迟早能找到他的
It's just a matter of time.

702
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,230
没消息
Nothing.

703
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,170
是嘛
Really?

704
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,870
你的华人高利贷和妓女关系网毫无收获吗
Your network of Chinese loan sharks and hookers came up empty?

705
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,740
回头再得意吧  我们想想
Gloat later. Let's think about it.

706
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,930
他得存储气球
He had to store the balloons,

707
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,560
氦气罐  他用的推车
the helium canisters, the carts he was using...

708
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,600
或许他会藏在储藏设施  仓库里
Uh, maybe a storage facility. A warehouse.

709
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,450
或者废弃大楼
Or an abandoned building.

710
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,880
就这个
That's it?

711
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,690
你怎么想到的
How'd you come up with that?

712
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,050
跟我说的有什么不同
It's the same thing I just said.

713
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,070
你为什么觉得会是这儿
What made you figure this place?

714
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,380
昨天那个女孩  塞琳娜
The girl yesterday, Selina,

715
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,800
她说她待在新的青少年保护机构大楼
she told me she was in a new juvie building.

716
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,570
拉蒙德也这么说  所以我就想
Lamond, the counselor, said the same thing, so I'm thinking

717
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,870
老楼干什么用了
what happened to the old juvie building?

718
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,090
原来  市里准备要爆破掉
Turns out... city's getting ready to demo it.

719
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,440
即使他之前真躲在这儿  估计也早跑了
Look, even if he was here, he's probably long gone.

720
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,970
他只剩一个气球了
He's only got one balloon left.

721
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,220
也知道我们要抓到他了
He knows we're closing in.

722
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,400
就在那儿呢
Or that's it right there.

723
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,000
布洛克
Bullock!

724
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,070
马上放下枪
Drop the gun! Now!

725
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,430
不行啊  警探  我的使命还没完成
I can't do that, Detective. I'm not done yet.

726
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,790
我再说一遍  放下枪
Once more time: drop it.

727
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,940
你该帮我才对
You should be helping me.

728
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,190
你在浪费口舌
You're wasting your breath.

729
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,790
我的搭档觉得你跟你杀的那些渣滓一样坏
My partner here thinks you're as bad as the scum you kill.

730
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
而我倒觉得你是在为民除害
Me, I can see how you're kind of doing us a favor.

731
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,390
所以别杀我  好吗
So don't shoot me, all right?

732
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,790
你跟我一样相信正义
You believe as I do.

733
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,920
我知道是你抓到了那些绑架孩子的人
I know you're the one who caught those child snatchers.

734
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,920
-你为此拿性命冒险  -我也是啊
- You risked your life. - Uh, so did I.

735
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,870
你要保护无辜者吗
You want to protect the innocent?

736
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,100
是的  法律会保护无辜者
Yes. And we have laws for that.

737
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,220
如果执法者是克兰斯顿警督那样的人
And what good are laws when they require

738
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,030
法律又有什么用呢
men like your Lieutenant Cranston to implement them?

739
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,500
还有罗纳德・丹泽尔
And Ronald Danzer--

740
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,000
你真以为他会蹲监狱吗
you really think he would've ever seen the inside of a jail?

741
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,260
还有那个神父
Or that priest?

742
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,250
法律为什么不惩罚他
Why didn't the law punish him?

743
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,490
我把一生献给哥谭的迷失儿童
You know, I have given my life to the lost children of Gotham

744
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,120
因为我想改变现状
because I wanted to make a difference.

745
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,640
你知道我做到了什么吗  什么都没有
And you know what kind of difference I made? None.

746
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,900
因为管理这座城市的人
Because the people running this city

747
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,400
他们弱肉强食  而法律就保护他们
feed off the weak and the law protects them.

748
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,550
你那位市长  把孩子们抓起来
And when your mayor rounded up all those children

749
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,920
送去州北的监狱时
to send off to that prison upstate,

750
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,980
我决定不能再这么下去了
I decided "no more."

751
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,230
我要叫他们知道  世界上是有报应的
I would teach them there are consequences.

752
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,220
你倒是扪心自问  警探
So why don't you ask yourself, Detective:

753
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,790
你到底在为谁而战
who are you fighting for?

754
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,120
被黑帮收买的市长
A mayor in the Mob's pocket?

755
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,440
收受贿赂的警察
Cops on the take?

756
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,790
还是弱势者  无辜者
Or for the weak and the innocent?

757
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,940
你究竟是谁
Who are you, finally?

758
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,520
算了
Aw, forget it.

759
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,990
别  不要
No, no!

760
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,550
你干什么
What're you doing?

761
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,350
-感觉如何啊  -抓住他
- How do you like that? - Grab him!

762
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,420
感觉如何  被自己搬的石头砸到脚喽
How's it feel? You're hoisted by your own petard.

763
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,950
别啊  吉姆
No, Jim.

764
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,950
吉姆  你干什么呢
Jim, what are you doing?

765
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,540
吉姆  松手啊
Jim, let go.

766
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,390
把气球打爆啊
Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!

767
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,610
吉姆
Jim!

768
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,390
放手啊
Let go!

769
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,750
开枪啊
Shoot it!

770
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,220
放手啊
Just let go!

771
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,880
快开枪
Shoot it, now!

772
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,980
卡麦
Carmine.

773
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,720
真是又惊又喜
What a lovely surprise.

774
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,250
我们还没开门  不过为你嘛
We're not quite open, but for you...

775
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,680
你好啊  菲什
Hello, Fish.

776
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,710
就是吃晚饭路过进来看看
Just stopped by on my way to dinner.

777
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,240
我想确保你不会记恨我
I wanted to make sure there were no hard feelings.

778
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,200
怎么会呢
Never.

779
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,780
这才是我的好姑娘
That's my girl.

780
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,330
说到你的姑娘  你今晚最好是为了她
Speaking of your girl, that better be the reason

781
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,500
才不来找我
why you're ditching me tonight.

782
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,960
她叫什么来着
What's her name again?

783
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,330
娜迪亚
Nadia?

784
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,680
娜塔莉娅
Natalia.

785
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,240
不是的  她出了事故
And no. She had an accident.

786
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,230
希望不太严重
I hope nothing serious.

787
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,200
被人抢了
A mugging.

788
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,490
抢了
Mugging?!

789
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,080
自从韦恩夫妇被杀
Ever since the Waynes were killed,

790
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,680
这城市都疯了
the city has gone crazy.

791
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,650
希望干这事的混蛋付出生命代价
I hope the punk who did it paid with his life.

792
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,470
等我们找到他  他会的
He will. When we find him.

793
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,250
还有所有帮他的人也是
Along with anyone who helped him.

794
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,680
你听说马罗尼那边有什么骚动吗
Are you hearing any rumblings from Maroni's camp?

795
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,920
你不会觉得这事
You don't actually believe that Maroni

796
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,750
跟马罗尼有关吧
had something to do with it, do you?

797
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,120
就像你说的
Like you say:

798
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,710
人都疯了  疯狂对生意不利
People are acting crazy, and crazy's bad for business.

799
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,030
尤其我们正要展开计划
Especially with everything on the horizon.

800
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,910
你是指阿卡姆
You're talking about Arkham.

801
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,810
我以为那里关门了
I thought you had that locked up.

802
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,830
保持警惕
Keep your eyes open.

803
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,010
等等
Hold on. Hold on.

804
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,880
等我一下
Give me a second.

805
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,300
还会有其他人
There will be more

806
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,320
我这样的人  警探
like me, Detective.

807
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,120
你知道的  对吧
You know that, don't you?

808
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,640
如果我们尽职就不会了
Not if we do our job.

809
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,330
我们会的  我会的
And we will. I will.

810
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,870
你的机会过去了
You had your chance.

811
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,340
你们所有人
All of you.

812
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,990
你最后的目标是谁
Who was your last target?

813
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,960
义警气球人的复仇之旅
The crusade of the vigilante known as the Balloonman

814
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,650
今晚结束了  他已被警察逮捕
ended tonight when he was apprehended by police.

815
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,940
他是唯一抵抗
He was one man who stood up

816
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,840
正在腐蚀哥谭核心的腐败
to the corruption eating at the heart of Gotham,

817
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,300
甘愿为了拯救法律而触犯法律的人
willing to break the law in order to save it.

818
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,750
哥谭的罪犯今晚能睡个好觉了
Well, I imagine the criminals of Gotham are sleeping well tonight.

819
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,150
他杀了人
He killed people.

820
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,160
他也是罪犯了
That made him a criminal, too.

821
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,610
这话没错
That's very true.

822
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,830
还要别的吗
Can I get you anything else?

823
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,500
不用了  谢谢  阿尔弗雷德
No, thank you, Alfred.

824
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,360
好吧
Right, well, you know...

825
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,060
尽量吃一点  好吗
do try and eat a bit, won't you?

826
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,970
你要是也轻得飘走了就不好了
Be a shame to have you floating away.

827
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,720
...哥谭市警局认为这是胜利
...the GCPD claims a win,

828
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,850
但我不禁想问
but this journalist is left to wonder:

829
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,540
气球人被抓后
now that the Balloonman is gone,

830
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,210
谁将来守卫哥谭人民
who will defend the people of Gotham?

831
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,150
您收看的是7频道7点新闻
This is Channel 7 at 7:00, reporting live

832
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,340
从市中心前哥谭青少年保护机构大楼发来的现场报道
from the former Gotham juvenile facility center in downtown,

833
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,700
给您带来最新的消息
with your minute-to-minute updates.

834
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,240
回到新闻直播间  约翰
Back to the newsroom, John.

835
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,940
你没事
You're okay.

836
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,430
你没事吧
Are you okay?

837
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,180
嗯
Yeah.

838
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,910
我只是摔了一下  没事的
I fell is all. I'm fine.

839
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,230
到底怎么了
What's wrong?

840
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,920
我希望你知道
I want you to know

841
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,780
你什么都可以跟我说
that you can tell me anything.

842
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,050
这座城市病了
The city's sick.

843
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,080
我之前并没有意识到
Sick in a way I hadn't realized.

844
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,870
他们把他带走的时候
When they were taking him away,

845
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,290
那个气球人杀手
this Balloonman killer,

846
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,400
我问他最后的目标是谁
I asked who his last target was.

847
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,990
你知道他说什么吗
You know what he said?

848
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,650
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

849
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,190
他是说  市长  法官
He meant the mayor, judges,

850
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,740
任何位高权重的人
anyone in a position of power--

851
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
他们都有罪
they're all guilty.

852
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,900
不是这样的
But that's not true.

853
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,030
至少他是这么想
It's how he feels.

854
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,390
他们都是这么想
It's how they all feel.

855
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,780
每个人
Everyone.

856
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
所以市民那么喜欢他
That's why the city embraced him.

857
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
因为我们让他们失望了
Because we let them down.

858
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,760
但如果大家都私设公堂
But if people take the law into their own hands,

859
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,180
那法律就形同虚设
then there is no law.

860
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,710
我们就完了
And we're lost.

861
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,870
有警察也那么做
There are cops who do it.

862
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,980
做他做的那种事
The same thing he did.

863
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,240
但你不会的
But you never would.

864
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,780
你觉得我做得出吗
Do you think I could?

865
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,080
不
No.

866
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,170
我了解你
I know you,

867
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,480
吉姆・戈登
Jim Gordon.

868
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,570
我爱你
And I love you.

869
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,700
我去给你拿杯酒
And now I'm gonna get you a drink.

870
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,650
我开吧
I'll get it.

871
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,810
吉姆
Jim.

872
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,170
你好啊  詹姆斯
Hello, James.

873
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,440
老朋友
Old friend.
