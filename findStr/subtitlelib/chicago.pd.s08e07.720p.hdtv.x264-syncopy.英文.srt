18
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
All right, should we run through it one more time?

19
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,370
All right. The targets are the Becerra Brothers,

20
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,450
Enrique and Hector.

21
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,610
Latin Players.

22
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,100
Bought from these guys three times,

23
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,380
so it should be nice and easy.

24
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,810
Nine grand gets us that eighth.

25
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,200
We'll make the exchange, give you guys the positive,

26
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,190
and then take 'em down, book 'em before lunch.

27
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,530
Yeah, one problem.

28
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,620
- You look like Paul Bunyan. - That's what I was going for.

29
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,250
Paul Bunyan was a handsome giant, so thank you.

30
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,850
Cool seeing Makayla at the park the other day.

31
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,740
Good to see her laugh.

32
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,340
Yeah. She's the strongest person I know, Kev.

33
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,470
You? Well, you brought her in.

34
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,190
That's a big challenge.

35
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,750
Yeah, I love it. I really do.

36
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,320
- I love it. - And?

37
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,200
And, um, I can barely crawl into bed at the end of the day

38
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,300
and that's when everything goes perfect.

39
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,180
Probably wouldn't hurt to have another pair of hands,

40
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,160
would it?

41
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,600
Thought about wrapping Ruz into this?

42
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,820
- Yeah, I have. - And?

43
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,360
- Yo, looks good. - Here we go.

44
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,310
- Here we go. - What's up, fellas?

45
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,810
How do? What's up, bro?

46
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,960
- Living the dream over here. - Ain't we all?

47
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,750
A'ight, check it out. That's 9 large.

48
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,160
You can count it if you got to.

49
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,990
All good. I'll get your package.

50
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,950
Right on.

51
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,230
Y'all need a taste of the product?

52
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,050
Nah, man. We're good, we're good.

53
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,040
One of our boys called us,

54
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,080
said he was in the shoulder with this stuff last time.

55
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,920
Yeah, we got that good stuff, man.

57
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,810
Right on.

58
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,670
Come on. We don't play around.

59
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,570
I know.

60
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,740
It's the same recipe as last time, right?

61
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,180
- Tried and true. - Purity, homey.

62
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,560
It's why the crystals are so big.

63
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,760
Oh, I know. That's what I'm talking about.

64
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,070
All right, let's do this.

65
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,020
Jay, get down!

66
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,680
Let's go.

67
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,970
5021 Eddie, 10-1, 10-1! Shots fired at the police!

68
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,930
We're at the 4200 block of South Justine.

69
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,170
We got undercover officers taking fire.

70
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,420
Eddie, are there officers hit?

71
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
Unknown. Approaching now.

72
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,220
All again, we have a 10-1 being called.

73
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,370
Jay, Adam!

74
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,910
Guys, we're okay! We're good!

75
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,090
Shooter's in a silver pickup fleeing southbound.

76
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,590
5021 David, officers are not hit.

77
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,290
I repeat, officers are not hit.

78
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,220
Offenders fled southbound on Justine in a silver pickup.

79
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,020
What the hell just happened?

81
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,760
All right. So where are we?

82
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,410
I got a partial from the shooter's vehicle that fled southbound.

83
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,940
CPIC's running it down.

84
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,000
A newer-model Silverado.

85
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,060
- Any shell casings? - 19 so far.

86
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,250
That'll do.

87
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,590
Assault rifle. Green tip .223s.

88
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,290
All right.

89
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,840
Have Forensic bag, tag, hand-deliver 'em to Ballistics.

90
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,120
Well, we know these two victims

91
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,940
are gang-affiliated meth dealers,

92
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,830
so hit the streets.

93
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,370
Look for beefs, anniversary shootings, all of it.

94
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,640
Get me PODs, ShotSpotters.

95
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,940
Hey, whoever did this damn near took out two of our own.

96
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,310
Don't forget that.

97
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,030
Closest ShotSpotter to the shooting.

98
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,820
Looks like someone else got there first.

99
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,070
It's from 2300 hours.

100
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,480
That's the night before it went down.

101
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,520
Well, tells the shooting was calculated, planned.

102
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,980
- What else you got? - Nothing actionable.

103
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,230
I talked to some of the victims' people.

104
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,500
They say they don't know what's going on or who did this.

105
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,200
Okay. Anything on the shooter's car?

106
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,190
CPIC pieced together the plate from the hot sheet.

107
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,680
Vehicle was stolen three days ago.

108
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,790
We lodged BOLOs, but--

109
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,590
No, vehicle's torched to the rims by now.

110
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,120
We're circling the drain here.

111
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,470
Actually, maybe not, Sarge.

112
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,810
OCD busted into two burners

113
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,760
found at the Becerra Brothers' place.

114
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,390
These are the texts on their phones.

115
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,790
"You sell, you die." "I warned you."

116
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,050
"Muerte." Dead.

117
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,900
There's dozens of 'em.

118
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,760
Someone threatened to kill the Becerra Brothers

119
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
if they didn't get out of the meth game

120
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,820
and then they made good on it.

121
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,130
- Okay, can we trace the texts? - Not to a person.

122
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,230
Texts were sent burner-to-burner.

123
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,620
But to a neighborhood? Yes.

124
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,880
OCD puts them in and around Garfield Park.

125
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,320
Yeah, one of my best CIs, Tommy Lane,

126
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,160
he's a meth guy in Garfield Park.

127
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,950
- Pay him a visit. - All right.

128
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,090
You gotta be kidding me.

129
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Course.

130
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,160
- Is that him? - Yeah, that's him.

131
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,020
Why are you busting my chops?

132
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,930
This is what I always do.

133
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,700
Calm down. I'm asking, not accusing.

134
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,680
Okay, this is me calm when you come to my home

135
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
for the crime of having a good time

137
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,690
and then call me a thief while you're at it.

138
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,050
Only thing I ever stole was my old lady's heart.

139
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,590
God, Tommy.

140
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,620
They should take you to jail for being a stupid sap.

141
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm guilty, my queen. I am guilty of love.

142
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,760
I love you. Okay?

143
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,890
- Stop it. - Tommy.

144
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,670
- Ruz, what's up, bro? - How you doing?

145
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,570
Guys, speak to you privately real quick?

146
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,960
Yeah. Please take care.

147
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,030
- You stay there. - Where am I going?

148
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,670
- We ain't done with you. - My house, my home.

149
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,040
- Tommy. - What?

150
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,000
We got business with this guy.

151
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,260
- With this nitwit? - Yeah, I know.

152
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,400
It seems improbable.

153
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,980
But, uh, you wanna tell us what's going on?

154
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,840
What's the problem?

155
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Look, your boy's having a birthday party for his kid.

156
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,250
The adults got a little wasted, all right?

157
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,890
Neighbors called in a noise complaint.

158
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,230
- That's it? - No, that ain't it.

159
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,260
We got reason to believe your boy stole this bouncy house.

160
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,100
All right.

161
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,460
Look, guys. Do us a favor.

162
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,400
Walk away, I promise you

163
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,480
we'll get this nitwit to shut things down, okay?

164
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Promise.

165
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,450
Take the tap off that keg?

166
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,480
Yes.

167
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,790
We ain't walking away a second time.

168
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,870
Fair enough.

169
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,140
And hey, listen.

170
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,220
Expect to find something bottled, brown,

171
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,210
and moderately expensive in your lockers, okay?

172
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,130
I really appreciate it.

173
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,150
Thank you, thank you.

174
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,450
We'll be fine.

175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,040
Ruz.

176
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,730
Are you literally out of your mind, bro?

177
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,410
Where you been all my life, bro?

178
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,690
Still letting you pick your own partners these days, huh?

179
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,600
Sometimes.

180
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,330
- Feel a chill. - Nah, she warms up.

181
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,040
Don't worry about it. Come on.

182
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,800
Isabel!

183
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
Come party, man. Get a couple of shots!

184
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,510
- Thanks, little man. - You're welcome.

185
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,740
All right, come on.

186
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,990
Dad will be back out in a minute.

187
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,360
- Okay. - Thanks, Isabel.

188
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,710
Really steal the bouncy house?

189
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,700
Course I stole the bouncy house.

190
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
Neighbor's a prick. Finn's having a good time.

191
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,010
God would rather you be a thief than a prick any day.

192
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,730
- So. - So.

193
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,130
What's up?

194
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,250
I need you back in play.

195
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,580
- Come on. - Look, bro.

196
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,080
We got a real bad person or persons

197
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,870
causing a lot of serious trouble.

198
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,200
How serious?

199
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,810
Well, we got two men, brothers.

200
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,450
Glass dealers in New City.

201
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,020
They were both shot and killed yesterday

202
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,180
and we're trying to figure out

203
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,640
who's trying to muscle in on their turf

204
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,420
before more people get killed.

205
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,630
Come on, man. I'm doing this now, you know?

206
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,310
- Birthday cakes, bouncy houses. - I know, I know, I get it.

207
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,210
No, you can't bro. My wife, Isabel, trust me.

208
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,750
Lot of ladies would've left by now.

209
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,790
I pushed things far as I can go, all right?

210
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,260
I'm trying to get clean, get off the pipe, you know?

211
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,840
Got out of that whole scene.

212
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
I got nothing but respect for that.

213
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,500
So check it:

214
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,320
I can get you 5 grand

215
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,520
and the state's attorney's gonna seal your record.

216
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,990
That means you don't have to disclose anything

217
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,500
to any potential employers.

218
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,780
You can do this whole thing right.

219
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,570
You can get a real job, raise your family.

220
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,960
All right, but yo, I gotta talk to Isabel first.

221
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,210
Well, she's already on board. Called her before we came over.

222
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,580
He's conniving, ain't he?

223
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,650
Eh. Let's call it persuasive.

224
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,380
All right, the person you really want is Logan.

225
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,220
- Who? - Logan Teague.

226
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,070
Me and him used to run around the block a few times.

227
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,340
Like I said, I'm out of the game,

228
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,300
but Logan's a player.

229
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,000
Knows everyone out there. He'll--

230
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,790
he'll take us where we need to go.

231
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,990
- Okay. - Nice.

233
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,630
All right.

234
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,050
Hitting him up now.

235
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
Hey, you ready? You clean?

236
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,240
As a whistle.

237
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
How did a whistle become the thing we use

238
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,250
to measure being clean?

239
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,230
Got people's saliva all up in there.

240
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,020
Who uses a whistle, huh?

241
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,670
- Gym teachers? Cops? - All right, yo.

242
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,340
Hey, we gotta be serious now, okay?

243
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,350
This is real.

244
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,630
Yeah, literally not real.

245
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,930
And they said irony was dead.

246
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,050
Wait, what's your name supposed to be again

247
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,570
when we get over there?

248
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,040
- It's Mike, bro. - Mike.

249
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,310
I rest my case.

250
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,550
Tommy, you're gonna remember that, right?

251
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,260
Adam's got himself a live one.

252
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,580
Indeed.

253
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,950
Mike rhymes with bike. Mike, bike, Mike, bike.

254
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,870
Yeah, right. When we get in there,

255
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,970
you don't gotta take it too far.

256
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,490
You don't gotta front like you're back in the game.

257
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:24,990
Right, right.

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,620
You're just making introductions.

259
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,120
Felt like a meet would be good for me, Logan Teague,

260
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,600
you get a little taste, and then after that,

261
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,660
you gotta do what you're not so good at.

262
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,750
Shut the hell up and let me do the talking, all right?

263
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,740
Kay. Mum's the word, Mikey.

264
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,060
All right, so then I'll lay groundwork for a buy.

265
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,930
Cool, cool.

266
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,610
- This it right here? - Yep.

267
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
Here we go.

268
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,080
- Hey, Logan. - Tommy, hey.

269
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,880
What's up, man?

270
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,010
My boy Mike I was telling you about.

271
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,080
Contact confirmed with Logan Teague.

272
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,670
Copy.

273
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,800
- Is that for me? - Yeah.

274
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Smoke on up while we're hanging out.

275
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,870
- For real? - Yeah, customer loyalty, eh?

276
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,690
Oh, dude.

277
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,780
How long we been running together?

278
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,040
I ever tell you I love you, man?

279
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,840
- Never enough. - I love you.

280
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,980
This.

281
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,060
Sweet, sweet Jesus. Sweet, sweet Jesus.

282
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,270
Jay, be advised our CI is using.

283
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,350
This could crap out at any second.

284
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,540
I understand you're in a bit of a pickle.

285
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,060
What do you mean?

286
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,800
What, Tommy didn't tell you he called me and...

287
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,240
gave me a heads-up on your issues?

288
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,500
- He did not, no. - Tommy.

289
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,010
You gotta tell people when you're, you know,

290
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,340
sharing their business.

291
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,270
Oh, yeah, sorry. That's right.

292
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,180
This guy, eh?

293
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah, this guy.

294
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,800
Yeah, no, no. I told Logan how, you know you and me,

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,280
we're all in this new thing together.

296
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,820
Partners, you know?

297
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,930
Moving product up from the suburbs.

298
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,570
Ah, that's right.

299
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,420
This is what's up, man. I also told him...

300
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,940
about our little supply problem, you know,

301
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,620
how the Mexicans, the Players, you know,

302
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,250
are scared as hell after getting shot up the other day.

303
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,300
And look, man, we don't need to know what's up, all right?

304
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,520
It's above our pay grade.

305
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,560
But we do need to know what's down

306
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,030
as in we need a new supplier.

307
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,310
I mean, that's about the long and short of it, man.

308
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,720
You talking about the Becerra Brothers?

309
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,870
Over New City way?

310
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,740
- Yeah. - That's them.

311
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,960
Yesterday's news, literally.

312
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,140
There's a new sheriff in town. Indiana boy.

313
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,250
Monahan.

314
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,920
- Monahan. - Monahan.

315
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,470
He's got beaucoup product to move.

316
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,370
- Made in the USA, too. - Oh, all right.

317
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,200
Well, shoot, that sounds like a guy we should know.

318
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,170
Sounds exactly like a guy we should know.

319
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,340
How much product do you two think you can move

320
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,840
out in the suburbs?

321
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,560
- Half a pound a day, easy. - Pound a day.

322
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,500
Sky's the limit if the glass is clean, bro.

323
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm telling you we got something here.

324
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,740
We got the funnel, we got the funnel.

325
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
Okay.

326
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,530
That's some real weight.

327
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,420
It's a serious situation, baby.

328
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,340
I'll get in touch with Monahan,

329
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,420
see if I can get the ball rolling.

330
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,260
That's what we wanted to hear, man.

331
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,760
That's what I came to you for.

332
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,830
All right, I will leave you be, man.

333
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,830
Have a good one, man. Great seeing you, bro.

334
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,880
See you, Tommy.

335
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,410
- So now you two partners? - What?

336
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,630
Me and Ruz, we're buds.

337
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,390
You better hope so, 'cause now you're on my wing

338
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,170
to the bitter end of this thing.

339
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,350
You guys are a barrel of laughs.

340
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,780
You told Adam you were clean, like, 20 minutes ago.

341
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,290
Yeah, I was clean.

342
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,070
20 minutes ago.

343
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,900
It's like a pack-a-day smoker. Quits every 20 minutes, right?

344
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,900
All right, look. When I'm not using, my head don't work right.

345
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,630
I can't think fast enough, okay?

346
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,980
And that's fine if I'm farting around at home or whatnot,

347
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,540
but in this line of work?

348
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,770
Gotta electric slide, baby, you know?

349
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,170
That's it.

350
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,380
Crystal meth isn't exactly known

351
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,160
to bring out the best in people, Tommy.

352
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,660
I highly disagree.

353
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,780
Look, we got what we wanted.

354
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,910
What is everyone so glum about?

355
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,610
- Tommy. - What?

356
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,200
If you want your money, you want your record scrubbed,

357
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,480
there's no more dope.

358
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,270
Fine.

359
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,050
- Come here, come here. - What's their problem?

360
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Just go home to your family.

361
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,980
Remember why you're doing this, all right?

362
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,740
Hey, where you going? How am I supposed to get there?

363
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,200
Oh, you take a walk.

364
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,410
Take a walk and clear your stupid head.

365
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,860
- What's up, Sarge? - What do you got?

366
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,620
Indiana State Police confirmed the ID of the man

367
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,130
we believe killed the Becerra Brothers.

369
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,480
His name's Keith Monahan. Heavy hitter.

370
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,680
Sold mountains of crystal meth in Muncie.

371
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,700
He's here now.

372
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,940
Indiana's intel says he's here to stay.

373
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,830
They're pretty happy he's our problem now.

374
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,540
They've linked this guy to ten murders,

375
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,460
but Monahan is smart and he's calculated.

376
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,650
Probably knows where to hide the bodies,

377
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,160
so he's one step ahead of them all the time.

378
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,690
They got him on two gun charges which are both misdemeanors,

379
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,250
so he's got virtually no record.

380
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,940
So we're nowhere on the murders?

381
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,050
All right, let's keep chasing the drug angle.

382
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,950
We'll get this son of a bitch off the street that way.

383
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,660
Then we'll make the murders.

384
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,650
So?

385
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,910
So Logan Teague made contact with Monahan.

386
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,750
We fronted like we wanted to move some real weight,

387
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,640
so Monahan's pretty interested.

388
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,660
I got a dry meet on the books with Tommy, my CI,

389
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,590
Logan, myself.

390
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,270
Logan wants to see money,

391
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,750
he wants to know that we're capable,

392
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,940
he wants to set rules and prices,

393
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,950
then he'll make the meet with Monahan.

394
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,280
Okay, let's do it.

395
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,560
I understand you ran into a little trouble with your CI.

396
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,160
Yeah, a bit.

397
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,840
He kind of took one for the team, boss.

398
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,640
And we got what we wanted.

399
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,990
Well, we can't go into a meeting like this

400
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,030
with a CI high on meth.

401
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,190
Just bring him in, put him in the box,

402
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,830
we'll keep him clean until the dry meet.

403
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,500
- Oh, boss, I just don't know - Just bring him in.

404
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,620
All right.

405
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,390
- Wanna go in? - Yeah, I'll be right back.

406
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,250
Tommy ain't here.

407
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,650
He's gone, Ruz.

408
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,820
- Gone where? - I never know.

409
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,910
He's into something.

410
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,490
Well, what does that mean?

411
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,670
Usually, it means he'll be back in a few days,

412
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,330
smell like death, get on his knees,

413
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,510
beg me for forgiveness, sleep 48 hours straight,

414
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,090
then promise me he'll never do it again.

415
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,020
Okay.

416
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm gonna find him for you. I'm gonna find him, yeah?

417
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,590
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

418
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,660
- What, here? - Yeah.

419
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,250
Homan between 15th and 16th.

420
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,480
Son of a bitch.

421
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,860
Keep it together. You don't wanna burn him.

422
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,590
- He's a CI. - I know, I know.

423
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,310
I'm gonna kill him with my bare hands.

424
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,270
You're good.

425
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,270
Oh, crap.

426
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,900
- You ripped me off. - No.

427
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,140
There's a guy selling the same sneakers for far less

428
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,390
over in Independence Park!

429
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,550
Sir, I'll be with you in a minute.

430
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,590
- I'm just handling a customer. - Yeah?

431
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,040
- So dude, yeah, take - Why don't you get the hell out of here?

432
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,150
I'm trying to buy these shoes.

433
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,300
You're trying to buy these shoes?

434
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,550
That's a very nice choice.

435
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,640
- Get the hell out of here! - Okay.

436
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,420
- What are you doing? - You owe me 100 bucks for those, man.

437
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,860
100 bucks? I got 5 grand coming your way, man.

438
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,550
You know what the resale value is

439
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,850
- on Carolina blues, dude? - What's wrong with you?

440
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,940
Look, I'm keeping clean like you want.

441
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,100
I am, okay?

442
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,050
I am and it hurts and it sucks, but I'm doing it.

443
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,990
But I gotta make a living, man.

444
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,910
This is how I put food on my table.

445
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,740
I mean, what are you even doing, man?

446
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,830
You can't just disappear right before a meet.

447
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,280
The two of you! Just get in the car.

448
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,950
How you feeling, bro?

449
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,310
It's freezing in here.

450
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,590
I'm sorry to tell you it's not.

451
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,060
All right, well, hang in there.

452
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,180
I'll go get you a blanket, all right?

453
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
Okay.

454
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,920
All right, we are trying to take down a smart, violent dealer.

455
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,810
Guy puts people in the ground they blink the wrong way.

456
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,510
So I gotta know: can we do it with this guy?

457
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,450
- Yeah. - No.

458
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,790
No.

459
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,570
I'm not saying we surrender.

460
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,210
I'm just saying we cut Tommy lose.

461
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,410
We find another way to get to Monahan.

462
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,060
All right, look. I get it, I do.

463
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,280
All right? I do.

464
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,200
It's just you do not know this guy like I do.

465
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,040
I know that you guys go way back.

466
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,930
He's put in good work for you. You're friends.

467
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,670
But this guy is a mess, Adam. He's a storm of bad news.

468
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,260
Just got a call about another double play.

469
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,730
Looks like it's connected to Monahan.

470
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,420
Have Trudy keep an eye on that guy.

471
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,190
Yeah.

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,330
What's the story?

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,700
Unfortunately, it's a familiar one.

474
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,660
DOA is Ramon Santiago. He's 25.

475
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,540
Let me guess.

476
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,710
Hispanic, documented gang banger, crystal meth dealer?

477
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,070
Yes, sir. Shot and killed by automatic rifle fire

478
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,740
from a vehicle that rolled up on him.

479
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,980
Shell casings are .223s. Green tips.

480
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,980
Same rounds that killed the Becerra Brothers.

481
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,940
- This other victim? - Innocent, this time.

482
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,930
Ramon's girlfriend. Wendy Garcia, 22.

483
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,910
Has a-- had a three-year-old son.

484
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,260
All right, have Ballistics confirm these rounds were fired

485
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,270
from the same weapon used on the Becerra Brothers.

486
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,130
See if that DOA got any threatening text messages

487
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,080
from the same burner.

488
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
I mean, we already know but

489
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,590
let's do the work to connect the two crimes.

490
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,570
Body count's up to four now.

491
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,900
Monahan's doing this as loud and public as possible.

492
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,980
Yeah.

493
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,900
Boss.

494
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,070
Look, I know Tommy's a mess.

495
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,760
He's a liar, he's a cheat, he's a junkie.

496
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,550
That's a hell of a sales pitch.

497
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,570
He's also the best CI I ever had

498
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,280
and I think we can work through this.

499
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,290
At this point,

500
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,970
I don't know if we got a lot of choice in the matter.

501
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,280
We cut him loose now, think we're dead in the water.

502
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,990
Yeah, well, unfortunately, I think you're right.

503
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,070
- Let's get it done. - Yes, sir.

504
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,810
After this thing's over, we're gonna get you some help.

505
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,670
Just worry about getting me my money.

506
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,470
You're sick, Tommy. No way to live.

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,340
Yeah? Well, maybe.

508
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,450
There's a chance I get better.

509
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,450
And however that turns out,

510
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,590
you'll still be an unattractive, Irish prick from Canaryville.

511
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,520
Tommy's got enough strength to talk smack.

512
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,410
I'd say that's something.

513
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,280
He's gonna need more than that.

514
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
All right, so we were thinking,

515
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,780
you know, two pounds to start.

516
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,370
You get that done?

517
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,210
That's what I do. Generate business.

518
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,690
Price'll be 20 per.

519
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,290
20? Damn. I mean, that's pretty steep, man.

520
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,920
With Monahan, I'd encourage you not think of it as a negotiation.

521
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,760
Look, if I can get this thing set up, you gotta understand.

522
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,800
- If you're five minutes late with this guy, he walks. - All right.

523
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,540
You try to change the location on him, he walks.

524
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,730
Who's he, the chosen one? We gotta kiss his ring, too?

525
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,990
Pull the plug, you don't like it.

526
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,170
- What's his problem? - Ah, he's having a rough day.

527
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,360
Don't worry about him.

528
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,220
My brokerage fee is 10%.

529
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,830
Okay, so then we split that with Monahan?

530
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,130
No. No, that's all on you.

531
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,940
Just pay the man so we can get the hell out of here, man.

532
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,090
All right, Logan, look.

533
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,410
First time out, you need it up front?

534
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,450
We can do it up front.

535
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,350
- Are you dry? - I'm good, bro.

536
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,800
Just step off me, man.

537
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,610
Here, knock yourself out.

538
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,090
Knock yourself out.

539
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,490
Damn.

540
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm good, man. Not here to get high.

541
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,630
Let's just finish this, all right?

542
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,660
- You're dry, Tommy. - Logan.

543
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,090
Leave him alone. Let's get this done.

544
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:13,850
Go on.

545
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,400
Why don't you smoke up, too, Mike?

546
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,460
I sell it. I don't smoke it.

547
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,790
I said smoke up, Mike.

548
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,420
He's made. Let's go get him.

549
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,660
He wants to let it play, so we let it play.

550
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,060
What are you doing? I mean, come on.

551
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,810
We all stand to make a hell of a lot of money here.

552
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,050
- What are you doing? - Yeah, that's the idea, yeah.

553
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,570
And you're gonna pull a piece on me?

554
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,700
I gotta protect myself.

555
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,790
There's a lot of sketchy people in this business.

556
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,120
You're starting to make me nervous.

557
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,190
You're making a very big mistake, Logan.

558
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,120
Am I?

559
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,940
Go!

560
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,450
Stop fighting, Logan. Stop fighting, man.

561
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,550
Stop!

562
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,240
Chicago PD! Chicago PD!

563
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,770
What else you got?

564
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,260
There's crystal in his place back there.

565
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,010
We should get him checked on, make sure he's okay.

566
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,870
Yeah.

567
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,430
- You wanted to see me? - Yeah.

568
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,940
What the hell happened out there?

569
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,520
Tommy was a mess. It went south.

570
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
No kidding.

571
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,850
I had to arrest the broker, so I got him in the box.

572
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,280
I'm thinking we flip him, we can get to Monahan that way.

573
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,470
Shut the door.

574
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,230
What's going on?

575
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,890
I got a call from an old buddy of mine,

576
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,770
that sergeant in the 13th.

577
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,450
You happen to recall seeing some crummy liquor store

578
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,620
where all this went down?

579
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,540
I mean, we parked right outside of one.

580
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,130
Well, turns out the owner of that store's got a camera in the alley.

581
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,090
Says he's got you on film.

582
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,260
"Police brutality" are the words being tossed around.

583
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,680
You gotta be kidding me. I pinned the guy's carotid.

584
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,800
I'd do the exact same thing next time.

585
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,380
Boss, I know the new rules.

586
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,540
I know the limitations when we're out there.

587
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,880
But if I say that my life was in danger, which it was,

588
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,900
I mean, we're good.

589
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,180
I'm telling you, boss, no. This was a violent situation.

590
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,730
- Adam. - I didn't do anything wrong.

591
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,160
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

592
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,980
That's just not the math anymore, you understand?

593
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,190
Bro, in this new world order,

594
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,520
what matters is that some jerk is shopping around

595
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,440
the perception that you did something wrong.

596
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,700
That alone is enough to ruin your career,

597
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,100
you understand?

598
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,490
Yeah.

599
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,890
All right.

600
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,650
How's the throat? Mine's a little sore.

601
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,510
We got you dead to rights here, Logan.

602
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,970
Calculated drug conspiracy. That's a Class X felony.

603
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,560
You're looking at six to 30.

604
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,530
That's a long time.

605
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,480
We're not actually finished.

606
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,000
You already got a felony on your record,

607
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,220
so mandatory extension under sentencing guidelines,

608
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,010
you're looking at, I don't know,

609
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,710
let's be generous--50 years?

610
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,530
I ain't flipping on Keith Monahan.

611
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,810
That's a death sentence. I'd rather be in the joint.

612
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,130
Three squares a day,

613
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,590
couple special friends in the shower.

614
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,330
I didn't ask about your sex life

615
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,860
and I didn't ask you to flip.

616
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,930
So what do you want?

617
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,610
Your phone.

618
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,000
Give me the password,

619
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
tell me where you meet Monahan when you do business,

620
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
and I will get you a good deal.

621
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,060
I pulled a piece on a cop. Game over.

622
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,360
I know. You pulled a piece on this cop.

623
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,300
Well, maybe I don't remember it that way.

624
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,280
What?

625
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,280
Let me worry about the details.

626
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,910
Things go well for us, be out of here before you know it.

627
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,370
So.

628
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,710
All right, come on, man. Come on.

629
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,770
- Adam. - Yeah.

630
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,570
What are you doing?

631
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,940
Setting up a buy with Monahan posing as Logan Teague

632
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,460
just like we learned in UC school.

633
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,900
You give Logan a slap on the wrist,

634
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,520
the first thing that he does when he gets out,

635
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,290
he pops Tommy.

636
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,530
- No, that's not gonna happen. - It is gonna happen.

637
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,660
No, look, I'm gonna hold Logan for 24 hours

638
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,670
then I'll send him downstate.

639
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,150
By the time he gets out, he's looking for Tommy,

640
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,370
{\an8}What are you talking about?

641
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,950
he's gonna have to search in nursing homes.

642
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,280
You can bend the truth in there, Adam,

643
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,700
but I heard you give that man your word.

644
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,580
- I don't-- - You promised him something.

645
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,380
Hold on, hold on.

646
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,800
He pulled a gun on a cop, all right?

647
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,580
I mean, like he said. Game over.

648
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,700
Good Lord.

649
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,820
If this too messy for you, look away, please,

650
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,400
'cause I will sleep fine tonight.

651
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,150
Here we go.

652
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,210
Okay.

654
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,690
Game on. 3:00 p.m.

655
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,480
And now he's expecting you and your partner.

656
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,600
Yeah, well, that's what he's gonna get.

657
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,200
You kidding me?

658
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,590
Tommy couldn't make it through that last meeting

659
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,380
- without blowing it up. - I'm gonna check on him.

660
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,740
- Adam, listen. - I will make sure he's okay.

661
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,960
It's gonna be fine, I promise.

662
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,190
I never seen it so bad, Adam.

663
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,960
He can't keep food down; he can't keep water down.

664
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,080
I want him sober, obviously.

665
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,440
Things were just getting good for us.

666
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,320
But I swear to Christ, I'm afraid he's gonna die

667
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,160
before he makes it to the other side.

668
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,660
I--

669
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
I'm sorry.

670
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,150
Tommy, stop. Tommy, stop scratching.

671
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,870
I can't, Steve.

672
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,600
Whatever your name is supposed to be.

673
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,560
It's Mike.

674
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,660
Remember. Mike, bike, Mike.

675
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,850
Mike.

676
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,940
Drug dealer. Suburbs.

677
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,740
Come here. Let's sit you up.

678
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,330
There you go, all right.

679
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,700
Just, uh, maybe the next time we do this,

680
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,010
you pick a name that matches your personality more.

681
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,870
Like Elizabeth.

682
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,710
Or Amanda.

683
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,610
You sit tight. I'm gonna clean you up.

684
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,850
Gonna clean you up, all right?

685
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,030
All right, buddy. Come here, bud.

686
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,380
I want you to bite down on this, all right?

687
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,080
Just real slow. Wet your whistle a little. Here.

688
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,520
Here you go, man.

689
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,520
Yeah. That's nice.

690
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,950
God.

691
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,780
Now, we're close.

692
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,510
I'm not gonna make it.

693
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,530
- Not like this. - No.

694
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,530
There's only one way to the promised land.

695
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,770
You know what that is.

696
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,180
No.

697
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,020
Yeah.

698
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,900
- No, Tommy. - Yes.

699
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,940
- No. - Yes.

700
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,360
Yes.

701
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,770
You said it's off Pulaski, right?

702
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,760
Yeah, just a... just a little further.

703
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,680
Here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,440
Here, yeah. Just dump me off right here.

705
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,810
Okay, okay.

706
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,770
All right. Go, man.

707
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,140
No.

708
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,070
Bro, you can't be serious right now.

709
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,090
If it makes you feel any better,

710
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,070
you can just look at it as payment back

711
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,860
for those sneakers you owe me.

712
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
Isn't gonna make me feel better about this.

713
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,900
How much you need to make it through the night,

714
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,050
turn on that magic?

715
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,030
Two grams, maybe. 60 a pop.

716
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,380
Good man, good man.

717
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,230
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

718
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,820
It's all gonna be worth it in the end.

719
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,170
- Yeah. - Okay.

720
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,210
Adam and Tommy are on their way.

721
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,450
Everybody listen up.

722
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,210
We surveilled the site, we all know our jobs,

723
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,560
but we didn't pick this spot.

724
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,500
There's a lot we don't know

725
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,360
including how much resistance to expect.

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,830
Don't forget Ruzek's in there naked.

727
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,240
He's got no weapon.

728
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,440
Let's make sure everyone goes home tonight.

729
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,910
We got security.

730
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,320
Two guys armed to the teeth.

731
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,580
Heads up. Coming at us.

732
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,670
All right, here we go.

733
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,320
They're greeting our party now.

734
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,260
- Spread. - Yes, sir.

735
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,080
That's a hell of a tricked-out piece, man.

736
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,190
Folding stock, little muzzle suppressor.

737
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,870
What, it can cook you breakfast, too?

738
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,010
What's that thing spit?

739
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,860
Green tip .223s, bro.

740
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,890
You get the street mod, make it a chopper?

741
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,640
No need. Came with a selector.

742
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,180
- Fully auto, then go home. - Amen to that.

743
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,220
- .223s. Green tip, fully auto. - Probably the murder weapon.

744
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,960
Count it.

745
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,080
We got a positive on Monahan.

746
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,870
I don't mean to give the impression

747
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,990
that I need to be friends, 'cause I don't.

748
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,040
Fair enough.

749
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,700
But I am in the midst of a...

750
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,940
significant business expansion.

751
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,380
- Looking to move product. - All right.

752
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,230
Not looking to create competition for myself.

753
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,280
Logan said you two plan to distribute in the suburbs.

754
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,630
That's right.

755
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,740
Tell me more about that.

756
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,780
Yeah, man. We're an open book.

757
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,500
You know, tell us what you wanna know.

758
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,290
- We'll answer any questions you-- - You ever see those birds

759
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,630
that sit on top of them water buffalos?

760
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,580
White suckers. Know the ones?

761
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,230
I used to think,

762
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,410
"What are you doing on top of that buffalo, birdy?"

763
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,860
Turns out he's having a snack. Yeah.

764
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,680
It's true. I saw it on TV.

765
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,850
Yeah, the bird eats the ticks that make the buffalo sick.

766
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,290
It's a win-win for everyone.

767
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,090
Buffalo gets a clean bill of health,

768
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,050
bird gets to have a feast.

769
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,230
Is Tommy geeking out?

770
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,930
He is.

771
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,800
So am I the buffalo? Am I the bird?

772
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,530
You're...

773
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,810
whoever, man.

774
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,160
Dealer's choice.

775
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,250
Eh? See what I did there?

776
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,310
But point is we ain't competitors.

777
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,110
We'd be fools, all right?

778
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,660
We want to be partners.

779
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,970
What does that look like to you?

780
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,960
- Trust. - Trust.

781
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,300
- Trust. - Trust.

782
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,450
Right?

783
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,000
So I'm gonna tell you what our secret sauce is.

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,610
We're gonna take your product, mix it with X, make super X.

785
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,850
Kids love it.

786
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,240
That's why we're hitting up the suburbs.

787
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,180
For the colleges.

788
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,580
Prairie, Wheaton, State.

789
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,600
I got ins all over the place. What do you think's up there?

790
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,990
Listen to that kid.

791
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,490
So bunch of kids,

792
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,020
bored, with a buttload of money,

793
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,220
just waiting.

794
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,780
Waiting for us.

795
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,690
- Super ecstasy? - Yeah.

796
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,620
Yeah, he came up with it.

797
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,190
Yeah, this guy's funny.

798
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,030
Let's keep it simple.

799
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,250
We do this deal today.

800
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,740
Let's let this sit for a minute, simmer.

801
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,870
All right.

802
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,350
Positive. I repeat, we have a positive.

803
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,970
Move, move.

804
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,780
What do you say? Meet back here in a week?

805
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,490
We explore all this other stuff together?

806
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,600
- Done. - Yeah, hell yeah, man.

807
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,300
We'll be here.

808
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,340
You're good, you're good.

809
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,890
What the hell's going on? What the hell is this?

810
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,220
Get out of here, Tommy.

811
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,000
Go now. Go.

812
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,330
Talk to me, Burgess!

813
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,690
- Good, Burgess? - I'm good, I'm good!

814
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,050
5021 George. Shots fired.

815
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,050
Be advised, unarmed UC in the middle of it.

816
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,900
- I don't have a shot. - Copy that.

817
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
Cover me, cover me!

818
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,260
- Hey! - Chicago PD!

819
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,400
On your knees.

820
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,020
Hands behind your head.

821
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
I got this--you guys go. I'll wait for patrol.

822
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,190
Police, stop!

823
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,770
Chicago PD! Turn around!

824
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,800
Turn around, Monahan! Stop moving!

825
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,190
Put the gun down.

826
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,730
Yeah, I don't think I will.

827
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,760
Put the gun down, Monahan.

828
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,860
This thing's over. There's nowhere to go.

829
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,000
Put it down.

830
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,210
Is it over?

831
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,170
Monahan, you don't stop pointing that gun at my friend,

832
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,040
I swear to God, I will drop you!

833
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,150
Put it down!

834
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,180
Put it down.

835
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,480
You ain't gonna shoot me.

836
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,470
Put it down.

837
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,590
Put it--

838
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,870
God!

839
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,290
Ruz, Ruz.

840
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,760
Tommy, Tommy.

841
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,320
Listen, man. I need you to take your hands,

842
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,590
I need you to put 'em right there, okay?

843
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,140
- Hold down, all right? - Sure...

844
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,980
- We'll get you all covered up. - Tommy!

845
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,460
Sarge, we found him at the east end!

846
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,650
Shots fired, offender down! Ruz is okay!

847
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,870
All right? Just keep your eyes open.

848
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,060
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Copy that.

849
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,080
Stop saying, "I'm sorry."

850
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,180
You did good. Not your fault.

851
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,200
There you go, there you go.

852
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,870
I got him.

853
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,130
- Thank you. - Yeah.

854
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,390
I need you to keep your eyes open, eh?

855
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,230
I need you to keep talking to me, all right?

856
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,400
Hey, keep your eyes open.

857
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,140
5021 David, we got a man down, GSW to the chest.

858
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,220
You gotta keep your eyes open

859
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,460
for Isabel and your family, right?

860
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,700
You gotta go home to 'em now,

861
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,260
enjoy the fruits of your labor.

862
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,860
Yeah? Tommy.

863
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,050
Hey, what's-- hey, what's my undercover name?

864
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,300
Elizabeth.

865
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,240
Yeah, that's right. Elizabeth it is.

866
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,640
You keep those eyes open.

867
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,480
You did good, bro. You did good.

868
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,030
You stay with me, Tommy. Tommy, you stay with me.

869
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,950
I screwed up.

870
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,760
Hesitated.

871
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,620
I just had all these voices in my head.

872
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,030
You know, rules and...

873
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,390
not right or wrong, the perception of right or wrong,

874
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,710
and all that crap and I don't have my piece.

875
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,690
Carrying a rifle that's used to murder four people.

876
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,120
This guy's not pointing the gun at me,

877
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,650
he's pointing a gun at Tommy.

878
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,040
And so what the hell do I know?

879
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,980
What do I know?

880
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,570
Can't trust my instincts anymore.

881
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,330
And I think I had a lawful shoot out there.

882
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,040
- You did. - I know.

883
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,300
I know.

884
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,100
Yet I hesitated and I...

885
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,920
didn't pull the trigger until after he shot my friend.

886
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,520
Look, Adam.

887
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,580
Adam.

888
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,590
I mean, we're running point on a whole new thing here.

889
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,390
You're taking all these new rules they're writing in here,

890
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,410
taking them into the chaos out there.

891
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,440
It's not gonna be easy.

892
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,840
Not when you got, what, half a second to decide

893
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,620
whether to take one guy's life in order to save another?

894
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,680
Tell you one thing, right...

895
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,590
I mean, right is still right, Adam.

896
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,790
I think we're all gonna be

897
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,820
groping around in the dark for a while.

898
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,410
Yeah.

899
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,510
You know?

900
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,900
Least we'll be doing it together, man.
