這份法案耗時數年才獲得通過
A bill that took years to get passed.

25
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,760
你簽署了
You sign that,

26
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,790
我就知道我在白宮里有朋友
and I know I got a friend in the White House.

那我就沒有 
Then I don't.

29
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,810
這不是協商
This is not a negotiation,

30
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,690
這是最后通牒  簽署法案  否則
this is an ultimatum. Sign the bill or what?

31
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,290
否則什么 
Or what?

32
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,460

- Is she shot? - Stay down, stay down!

Somebody tried to kill her.

Bill.

Were you behind this?

36
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,490
我今天不會簽那個的
I won't be signing that today.

37
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,140
那是個錯誤
That was a mistake.

38
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,560
你聽命于誰
Who do you answer to?

39
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
你為誰工作
I mean, who do you work for?

40
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,720
或許該給他開抗精神病藥了
Well, maybe it's time to give him one of the antipsychotics.

41
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,660
生日快樂  美國
Happy Birthday, America.

42
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,960
不管弗蘭西斯這五年來對你們說了什么
Whatever Francis told you the last five years,

43
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,300
一個字都別信
don't believe a word of it.

44
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,270
他還在我們身邊  是吧
He's still with us, don't you think?

45
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,800
幸好他死前我們能跟他共度那么多的時光
We're so glad we got to spend so much time with him before he died.

46
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,810
他對我們說了些很有趣的事
He told us some fascinating things.

47
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,050
站住  克萊爾·黑爾
Stop. Claire Hale. 

48
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,660
你想弗蘭西斯了嗎
Do you miss Francis?

49
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,970
我要你宣布  羅杰  我們好派他們去
I want a Declaration, Roger. So we can send them in.

50
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,090
但總統女士
But, Madam President--

51
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,190
國民警衛隊  聯邦緊急事務管理署和環保署
I have the Guard, FEMA and the EPA

52
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,970
都調動好了  就在城外等著
mobilized and waiting on the outskirts of that town.

53
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,760
我剛跟精煉廠聯系過
I just got off the phone with the refinery.

54
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
泄露已經要燒盡了
The leak is well on its way to burning off.

55
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,090
據我所知  空氣質量達到了危險程度
My understanding is that the air quality is dangerous.

56
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,270
污染的確加重了  是的
The levels are somewhat elevated, yes,

57
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,240
-但風向對我們有利  -但也可能變化
- but the winds are in our favor. - And subject to change.

58
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,780
風就是如此
That's how wind works.

59
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,180
一兩天內一切都會結束
This will all be over in a day or two,

60
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,720
但要讓民眾撤離家園...
the idea of keeping these families out of their homes--

61
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,780
這謹慎的預防措施
This is a prudent precaution

62
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,290
我坐鎮時  就希望采取這種措施
and on my watch, that's what I want to happen.

63
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,880
我覺得不應該夸大情況
I don't think we should exaggerate the situation.

64
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,290
你還記得選舉當晚你的情況嗎  州長
Do you remember where you were on election night, Governor?

65
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,590
我可記得
Because I do.

66
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,060
你本來要輸了
You were going to lose.

67
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,910
統計學上講  你是根本不該贏的
Statistically, there is no reason you should have won.

68
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,960
你考慮的時候
Keep the phone away from your mouth

69
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,910
別把電話靠在嘴邊  州長
while you're thinking, Governor.

70
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,400
我聽得到你的喘氣聲
I can hear you breathing.

71
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,790
是
Yes.

72
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,110
我覺得我是有必要宣布進入緊急狀態
I do believe I need to declare a state of emergency.

73
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,360
當然了  這是你的決定
Of course, it's your call.

74
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,410
我向你保證
And I assure you,

75
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,200
聯邦政府會全力支持你
you will have the full support of the federal government.

76
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,990
我曾對自己保證不會像他那樣
I promised myself I wouldn't be like him.

77
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,540
但那就是弗蘭西斯的典型做法  是吧
That was textbook Francis, wasn't it?

78
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,250
但他像遞鹽罐一樣把我交給了他們
But he handed me over to them like a shaker of salt

79
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,770
現在  他們不肯放手了
and now they won't let go.

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,930
這是他們自作自受
This is a wound of their own making.

81
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,670
副總統先生
Mr. Vice President?

82
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,010
請進
Yeah, come in.

83
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,100
需要我等您一會兒嗎  先生
Do you need a moment, sir?

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,230
不用
No, no.

85
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,840
怎么了
What is it?

86
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,700
好
Okay.

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
州長
Governor?

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,190
他們說沒事的
They said it was fine.

89
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,650
就是一股爛雞蛋和垃圾的味兒
It smelled like rotten eggs and trash. That's all.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,530
水龍頭里都是這個味兒
You could smell it coming out of the faucet.

91
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,410
然后我兒子  他開始流鼻血了  我就想
And then my son, his-- his nose started to bleed and I thought,

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,570
-"跟這有關嗎"  -你兒子現在在哪呢
- "Is that related?" - Where is your little boy right now?

93
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,520
現在嗎  他跟他媽在做驗傷
Now? He's in triage with his mom.

94
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,400
-那小家伙是我的心肝  -我知道
- He's my heart, that little guy. - No, I know. I know.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,750
但女士  我可以問問嗎
But, ma'am. If I may. You--

96
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,960
您得告訴我們  這是不是真的
You have to tell us. Is this real or not?

97
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,960
因為  起初他們說我們不需要撤離
Because at first they said that we don't need to evacuate,

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,190
但突然又改口說得撤離
and then all of a sudden that we should.

99
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,410
我要告訴你  一切都會沒事的
I want you to know everything is going to be all right.

100
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,070
我保證
I promise you.

101
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,560
我們指望著那工廠通知我們情況呢
We were relying on that plant to keep us informed.

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,520
先生  你和你的安全
Sir, you and your safety

103
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,800
才是最重要的
is the most important thing.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,140
事實上  貝爾波特所有的家庭
In fact, all of the families of Bellport,

105
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,250
才是唯一重要的
nothing else matters.

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,980
我要感謝奧姆斯泰德州長
I want to give my thanks to Governor Olmstead

107
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,340
他今早快速果決地
for his quick and decisive act this morning

108
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,280
宣布了進入緊急狀態
in declaring a state of emergency.

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,990
聯邦緊急事務管理署  環保署
We have FEMA, we have EPA,

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,190
俄亥俄州國民警衛隊
the Ohio National Guard.

111
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,530
都來了
They're all here.

112
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,820
沒有人應該感到不安全
No one should ever feel unsafe.

113
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,860
...在她自己家里
In her own home.

114
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,420
你怎么會完全不知道呢  馬克
And how is it you have no idea, Mark?

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,760
-這無所謂  -這很有所謂
- It doesn't matter. - Oh, it does matter.

116
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,100
這說明了我們的關系多靠不住
It speaks to this untenable arrangement.

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,770
我說了待會兒再說那個  先考慮回應
Later, I said. Let's stay focused on our response.

118
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,540
她今早本都已經要簽署法案了
She was all set to sign the bill this morning.

119
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,490
我們叫了攝像師和記者什么的候著
We had photographers, a press pool waiting, the whole thing.

120
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,430
-但她沒簽  是吧  -我這就過去
- But she didn't sign it, did she? - I'm on my way there now.

121
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,440
因為她在忙著
Because she was too busy

122
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,860
無中生有地制造緊急狀況
manufacturing an emergency out of nothing.

123
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,630
別忘了是誰升級了事態  好嗎
Look, let's not forget who escalated this. Okay?

124
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,680
什么
Excuse me?

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
如果我們要合作  比爾
If we're working together, Bill,

126
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,670
我需要參與每一個決定
I need to be included in every decision.

127
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,680
每一個
Every one.

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,340
我們沒什么好談的了
This conversation's over.

129
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,170
老天爺啊
Oh, for God's sakes.

130
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,810
我會去貝爾波特跟安奈特碰頭
I'll join Annette in Bellport.

131
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,960
不  你別去
No, you won't.

132
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,290
你們中有一人到場就夠糟了
One of you showing up on site is bad enough.

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,690
安奈特  給我打電話
Annette, call me back.

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,500
馬克
Mark.

135
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,620
馬克  你還在嗎
Mark, are you still there?

136
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,410
是的
Yes.

137
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,450
讓我跟他談談  我再打給你
Let me talk to him. I'll circle back.

138
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,950
大家好
Hello, everyone.

139
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
我是凱爾茜·斯圖爾特
My name is Kelsey Stewart.

140
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,520
代理新聞發言人
I'm the deputy press secretary,

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,810
今天我將為大家回答問題
and I will be taking your questions today.

142
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,490
莎拉
Sarah.

143
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,500
奧姆斯泰德州長是否真的
Is it true that Governor Olmstead

144
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,890
對宣布進入緊急狀態很抗拒
was resistant to declaring a state of emergency?

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,630
州長的確宣布了進入緊急狀態
The Governor did declare a state of emergency,

146
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,890
白宮也贊同了
and the White House concurs.

147
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,940
工廠出了很大的問題
Something very wrong happened in that plant.

148
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,050
請說
Yes.

149
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,780
阿卡斯公司在泄露和爆炸事件方面
Arcas has been slow to provide any details

150
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,790
遲遲不肯公布細節
when it comes to the leak and explosion.

151
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,870
更不用說兩人在事故中喪生了
Not to mention the two lives lost in the accident.

152
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
他們跟白宮配合了嗎
Have they been cooperating with the White House?

153
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,670
現在總統去了第一線
Now that the president is on the ground,

154
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,380
他們似乎是更加愿意配合了
it seems that, yes, they have been more agreeable.

155
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,540
但這不是該問的問題
That's not the real question, though.

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,690
該有人問問
Somebody might want to ask,

157
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,070
謝潑德無限責任公司怎么不出來說話
where is Shepherd Unlimited in all of this?

158
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,090
阿卡斯精煉廠是該家族集團的子公司
The Arcas Refinery is a subsidiary of the family's conglomerate.

159
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,000
你是說謝潑德家族
Are you saying that the Shepherds

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,780
清楚工廠的問題嗎
are personally aware of problems at the plant?

161
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,000
誰該負責  負怎樣的責任
Who is responsible and how

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,570
這正是白宮和總統
is all the White House and the president

163
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,260
此刻想要查清的問題
are trying to find out at this point.

164
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,150
這會對總統
Will this have any effect

165
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,320
準備簽署的去監管法案有影響嗎
on the regulatory bill on the president's desk?

166
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,560
總統不久后就會就此發表講話
The president will be speaking on that shortly.

167
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,070
馬可斯
Marcus.

168
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,380
總統在前總統死前
Was the president planning to divorce the former president

169
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,330
有打算與他離婚嗎
in the days leading up to his death?

170
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,040
我們...
Let's...

171
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,730
-副總統先生  -大家早上好
- Mr. Vice President. - Morning, everyone.

172
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,670
希望斯圖爾特小姐不會介意我回答幾個問題
I hope Miss Stewart won't mind me taking a couple of questions.

173
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,090
副總統先生  請回答一個問題
Mr. Vice President, one question!

174
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,890
馬可斯  你的消息源是誰
Marcus, who's your source?

175
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,870
-匿名官員  -不  這行不通了
- Unnamed officials. - Nope. We don't do that anymore.

176
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,650
我們要名字  你能說嗎
We need names. You have a name?

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,290
說真的  你是哪聽來的
I mean really, where do you get this?

178
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,250
前總統
The former president

179
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,620
生前的最后一晚
spent his last night alive

180
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,540
是在白宮他妻子身邊度過的  就是這樣
next to his wife in the White House. Period.

181
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,730
至于貝爾波特
As for Bellport...

182
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,900
知道全部事實之前  不要急著下結論
let's not jump to conclusions before all the facts are in.

183
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,820
還有什么
What else?

184
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,780
我們還在逐戶查看  但這只是為防萬一
We still going door to door, but it's really a precaution.

185
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,800
床位夠嗎
Are there enough beds?

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,420
我們有幾間教堂地下室
We have a few church basements

187
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,080
如果有必要  還有當地監獄
and the local jail if we need more.

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,400
反正空氣里還剩下的硫化氫
Whatever hydrogen sulfide there is left in the air

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,260
也要消散了
is already dissipating.

190
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,690
再過一兩天  大家就能回自己的床上睡覺
In a day or two, people will be back sleeping in their own beds.

191
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,000
您得明白
You have to understand,

192
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,680
總統女士
Madam President,

193
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,330
幾乎所有人都會對化學品過度反應
most everyone overreacts when it comes to chemicals.

194
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,340
我們有多年的經驗
We have years of experience--

195
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,210
那死于事故的人呢
And the men who died in the accident?

196
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,650
那的確很悲慘  他們都是好員工
That's tragic, of course. They were valued employees.

197
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,080
都是社區里的成員  他們不可替代
Members of the community. There's no way to replace them.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,410
比爾·謝潑德呢
And Bill Shepherd?

199
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,280
-怎么  -他來過電話嗎
- Yes. - Have you heard from him?

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,510
我把情況通知了他和其他合伙人
I've kept him informed, as well as all of our partners.

201
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,980
比爾直接給我打過電話
Bill called me directly.

202
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,760
他們準備采取一切必要措施
They're ready to do whatever's needed.

203
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,580
他們對貝爾波特非常重要
They're important to Bellport.

204
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,850
他們建了當地的運動場
They built the local stadium.

205
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,150
還有這個體育館  他們出資...
Even this gymnasium. They contributed--

206
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,360
我很清楚他們家族的慈善事業
No, I'm well aware of the family's philanthropy.

207
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
我問的不是那個
That wasn't the question.

208
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,800
是的  謝潑德先生一直在密切關注局勢
Yes, Mr. Shepherd has been monitoring the situation closely.

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,580
我想在這一代巡視一圈
I would like to tour the area.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,380
可以嗎  州長
Is that a problem, Governor?

211
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,420
當然  據我所知沒問題
No, no, not to my understanding.

212
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,860
我還想帶您去
I was hoping to get you over to--

213
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,640
我們的驗傷處
to where we set up our triage.

214
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,870
我們最好還是按日程來...
It might be best if we stick to the itinerary--

215
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,140
我想自己親眼看看
I'd actually like to see it for myself.

216
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,540
當然  除非你們說不行
Unless, of course, you tell me otherwise.

217
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,020
不  當然可以
No, of course not.

218
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,790
警衛隊標記了已撤離的房子
The guard marks the doors of the evacuees.

219
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,460
都是標準程序
Pretty standard procedure.

220
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,480
停車  我好像看到了人
Stop the car. I think I see someone.

221
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,220
停車
Stop the car.

222
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,350
總統女士  我們會叫人再回來的
Madam President, we'll have someone circle back.

223
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,590
馬上停車
Stop the car now.

224
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,090
該死
Damn it.

225
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,470
她安全嗎
Is she safe?

226
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,390
沒有百分之百的安全
Nothing is 100% safe.

227
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,160
有人嗎  有人在嗎
Hello. Anyone here?

228
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,450
那男孩差點瞎掉一只眼睛
The boy could have lost an eye.

229
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,680
我們不能那么對待別人
That's not how we treat people.

230
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,380
她怎么能這么做
How could she?

231
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,560
天吶  伊麗莎白  行了
My God, Elizabeth, stop it.

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,250
我養的是個女兒還是野獸
Am I raising a daughter or an animal?

233
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,830
他們才是野獸  他們那么攻擊她
They're the animals, the way they attacked her.

234
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,540
好啊  替她說話吧你就
Oh, of course, take her side. Of course!

235
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,650
她也該了解這世界了
It's time she learned about the world.

236
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,510
漂亮姑娘要對她們的美貌負責
Pretty girls have a responsibility to their beauty.

237
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,310
肯定是她激了那些男孩
I'll bet she dared those boys.

238
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,930
真丟臉
Shame on her.

239
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,000
你怎么就不能乖乖聽話
Why can't you just do as you're told?

240
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,320
是啊  為什么
Why, indeed?

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,300
總統女士  總統女士
Madam President! Madam President.

242
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,830
總統女士
Madam President...

243
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,520
我們最好回去了
might be best if we head back.

244
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,010
房子安全嗎
So, the house is safe?

245
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,840
那喝一口
Drink it then.

246
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,960
我猜也是
I thought so.

247
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,090
-但我在答應什么  -我可以給你讀一遍
- But what am I agreeing to? - I can read it for you.

248
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,050
我識字
I can read.

249
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,960
這是干什么的
And what's this for?

250
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,690
這是讓應用能分析出
That lets the app figure out

251
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,260
我們怎樣才能最好地施以幫助
how we can be most helpful.

252
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,240
可以根據你的具體需求來制定計劃
It can be tailored to your specific needs.

253
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,670
我們想讓你及時了解情況
We want to keep you informed.

254
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,350
我們希望你在事發前就知道要發生什么
We want you to know what happens before it happens.

255
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,450
這是不能靠政府的
You can't trust the government to do that.

256
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
你好  我是賽斯·格雷森
Hello, my name is Seth Grayson.

257
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,290
認識你很高興

258
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,610
我是謝潑德自由基金會的
I'm with Shepherd Freedom Foundation,

259
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,080
可以跟你談談嗎
can I talk to you for a second?

260
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,840
當然  我看了宣傳冊
Sure thing. I was looking at the pamphlet saying just...

261
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,190
是總統
It's the president.

262
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,980
總統女士
Madam President.

263
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,260
是誰的主意  把戒指放他床上
Whose idea was it? To leave it on his bed?

264
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,080
別在這兒說
Not here.

265
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,050
謝潑德自由基金會是來幫忙的
The Shepherd Freedom Foundation is here to help.

266
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,280
聯邦政府將幫助你們
The federal government is here to help you.

267
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,150
是啊  總統女士
Yes, Madam President.

268
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,230
美國的問題要得到解決
The only way America's problems will be solved

269
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,820
就得靠政府和私企聯手
is through alliances between government and private industry,

270
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,370
各司其職
each doing its part.

271
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
我跟三軍統帥可是老交情了
The Commander in Chief and I go way back.

272
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,280
是啊  我知道謝潑德家族會
We do. And I know I have the full cooperation

273
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,770
完全配合我的工作
from the Shepherd family.

274
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,410
阿卡斯這種公司
The blatant disregard for human life

275
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,980
對生命的公然漠視...
exhibited by companies like Arcas--

276
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,070
阿卡斯公司是一心想保護其員工的安全的
Arcas is committed to the safety of its workers.

277
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,790
如果能得到助力
And with the help of...

278
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,360
比如正確的立法  像是《未來法案》
the right kind of legislation, like the FUTURE Act.

279
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,620
此刻正在接受審核
Which is under review at the moment.

280
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,630
法案通過前
Until then,

281
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,550
我要讓環保署的犯罪調查處
I am hereby moving the EPA's Criminal Investigative Division

282
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,820
進駐五角大樓
into the Pentagon,

283
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,430
他們將擁有軍隊的力量和資源支持
where it will enjoy the forces and the resources of our military.

284
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,200
他們會調查這起災難的
And they will investigate this disaster.

285
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,670
我以我丈夫的墳墓起誓
I swear on my husband's grave,

286
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,950
我一定會查明究竟發生了什么
I will find out what happened here.

287
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,700
謝謝您的支持
Thank you for your support.

288
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,510
我本想放在你床上呢
I wanted to leave it on your bed.

289
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,770
別犯傻  那對我沒用
Don't be thick, thick I can't use.

290
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,900
她真提出離婚了嗎
Did she actually ask for a divorce?

291
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,910
那要緊嗎
As if that matters.

292
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,970
如果我被要求給出這么問的憑據呢
And if I'm asked to justify the question?

293
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,620
他們不正面回答  就是足夠的憑據了
It was justified the moment they didn't have an answer.

294
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,910
總統最不希望
The last thing the president wants

295
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,860
談前總統的事了
is to be talking about the former president.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,140
那我問問你
Let me ask you this.

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,420
總統甩開
How did your mother feel

298
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,760
你媽媽的手時  她是什么感覺
when the president yanked her hand away like that?

299
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,050
那不關你的事  馬可斯
That's none of your goddamn business, Marcus.

300
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,460
-抽手  你是這么說的嗎  -是啊
- Recoil? Is that the word you used? - Yeah,

301
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,320
我看就是這樣
that's what I see.

302
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,160
-開玩笑嗎  -不是
- Are you kidding me? - No.

303
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,470
我們真要浪費時間
Are we really gonna waste time

304
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,530
剖析兩個女人之間的一個手勢嗎
dissecting a gesture between two women?

305
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,920
諾拉說得對  我當時在場
Nora's right. I was there.

306
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,060
沒有什么抽手
There wasn't a recoil.

307
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,070
我同意湯姆的話
I gotta agree with Tom here.

308
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,800
我覺得安奈特·謝潑德是想硬拉著總統
For me, it's Annette Shepherd sort of manhandling the president

309
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,510
擺出勝利姿態  然后我看到她驚了一下
as a sign of victory, and then I detect a flinch.

310
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,820
就那么一下下  然后就抽了手
A slight flinch, then recoil.

311
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,130
-抽手...  -她是想切斷自己
- Recoil? I mean-- - She's trying to separate herself

312
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,220
跟原本計劃的弗蘭西斯·安德伍德基金會
from the primary source of the funding for what was to be

313
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,300
-主資金源的關系  -這是關于過失
- the Francis J. Underwood Foundation. - This is about culpability.

314
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,500
她是去貝爾波特要求責任方負責的
She went to Bellport to hold those responsible accountable.

315
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,830
謝潑德無限責任公司這樣的公司一直在被拖后腿
Companies like Shepherd Unlimited have been hamstrung.

316
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,860
所以她要簽署的法案才如此重要
And that's why this bill on her desk is so important.

317
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,900
如果不能執行  立法就毫無意義
Legislation means nothing without proper enforcement.

318
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,340
給環保署武器只是固執
Weaponizing the EPA is wrongheaded.

319
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,530
而且根本不能...
And it does nothing to make--

320
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,920
與其給她的每一個行為找負面動機
Instead of ascribing negative motives to her every action,

321
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,150
我們為什么不能承認  安德伍德總統
why can't we just accept that President Underwood

322
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,290
去做了總統該做的事
was out there being presidential?

323
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,440
她讓你
She put the fear of God

324
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,600
和你的新朋友感到害怕了  格雷森先生
into you and your new friends, Mr. Grayson.

325
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,890
做總統該做的事  就該簽署法案
Being "Presidential" means signing the bill

326
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,200
更新陳舊的監管
and modernizing antiquated regulations.

327
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,350
你怎么會知道
As if you would know.

328
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,220
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

329
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,990
她丈夫  你曾是他政府的成員
Her husband, whose administration you were a part of,

330
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,490
本來就要...
was about to--

331
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,540
正準備建立一個慈善基金會
Was in the midst of setting up a philanthropic foundation.

332
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,340
她丈夫都要被起訴了
Her husband was about to be indicted.

333
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,900
什么  八字沒一撇的事
Excuse me, there wasn't even a grand jury.

334
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,250
我有可靠消息稱
I have it on good authority

335
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,220
他要被起訴了  而她要赦免他
he was about to be indicted, and she was about to pardon him.

336
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,090
但她還想離婚
But she also wanted a divorce.

337
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,090
好挽救自己  撇清關系
To save herself. Distance herself.

338
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,470
因為  拜托  難道你能說
Because, come on. Are you telling me

339
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,880
她對他的作為一無所知嗎
she knew nothing of what he was up to?

340
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,150
-如果他有罪  她也有  -湯姆
- If he was guilty, she was guilty. - Tom? Tom,

341
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,310
我十分尊敬你
I have great respect for you

342
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,840
還有你在《先驅報》的工作
and the work you've done at the Herald.

343
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,010
但你能就她自己的表現來評述她嗎
But are you even capable of defining her on her own terms?

344
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,780
抱歉  前一秒她還是悲傷寡婦
I'm sorry. One minute she's playing the grieving widow

345
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,810
-下一秒  她又借題發揮  -正是
- and the next, she's riding on the coattails. - Case in point.

346
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,210
雖然這么說很過分
This may be an unseemly thing to say,

347
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,390
但很可能
but it's quite possible

348
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,370
她丈夫的死  是總統走了大運
her husband's death was the president's lucky day.

349
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,550
你在這里可以暢所欲言
You can say whatever you want in here.

350
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,410
不管你有什么感覺  有什么想法
Whatever your feeling, thinking.

351
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,630
我質疑你的能力
I'm questioning your ability.

352
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,290
我的能力
My ability?

353
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,150
能不能分辨有道理的多疑和...
To tell the difference between justifiable paranoia and--

354
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,520
你還用那個詞嗎
Do you use the word anymore?

355
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,500
"瘋狂"
"Madness?"

356
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,460
你對什么感到多疑
What do you feel paranoid about?

357
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,690
我自己吧
Myself, maybe.

358
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,430
我們為什么做我們做的事  為誰而做
Why we do what we do and for who?

359
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,030
誰更邪惡  醫生
Who's more evil, Doctor,

360
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,670
發令者還是執行者
the taskmaster or the tasked?

361
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,140
你覺得弗蘭西斯·安德伍德背叛了你嗎
Do you feel like Francis Underwood betrayed you?

362
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,630
我覺得我在想是誰背叛了他
I guess I'm wondering who betrayed him.

363
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,550
你覺得呢
Who do you think?

364
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,870
你嗎
You?

365
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,530
我不知道我們的治療是否還能幫我
I don't know if these sessions are helping me anymore.

366
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,980
你為什么給我開藥  醫生
Why are you trying to drug me up, Doctor?

367
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,030
我覺得你該考慮一下
I think you should consider it.

368
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,100
氯氮平
Clozapine.

369
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,170
你肯定知道那會把人變成什么樣
You must know what that does to a person.

370
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,210
現在又有了新的抗精神病藥物  道格
They're a newer class of antipsychotics, Doug.

371
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,420
副作用
The side effects

372
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,510
不像以前的那些那么嚴重了
are not as sensational as some of the older ones.

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,070
你不非得這樣受罪的
You don't have to suffer like this.

374
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,340
據我所知
From my understanding,

375
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,460
光是副作用就能讓你顯得
the side effects themselves can make you look--

376
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,430
我又得問  你是否還用"瘋狂"這個詞
And again, I'm asking you if you use this word "mad."

377
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,920
你開玩笑嗎
Are you fucking kidding me?

378
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,410
什么
Pardon?

379
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,890
你要一邊看表
You're gonna talk to me about side effects

380
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,240
一邊跟我聊副作用嗎
while you look at your fucking clock?

381
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,270
不  你說得對  抱歉
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

382
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,490
我們還是明天下午繼續吧
We're gonna have to take this up tomorrow afternoon.

383
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,130
這個話題要重大得多
This is a much bigger conversation.

384
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,970
不  我就現在說
No, I'm talking now.

385
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,780
抱歉  但你的時間到了
I'm sorry, but your time is up.

386
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,880
我才不在乎時間
I don't give a fuck about the time.

387
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,010
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper.

388
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,910
我很高興你終于決定
I'm glad that you finally decided

389
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,750
好好利用你在這里的時間
to take advantage of your time here,

390
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,980
但你清楚規矩
but you know the rules.

391
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,590
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

392
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,320
斯坦普先生  拜托
Mr. Stamper, please.

393
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,280
我也不想叫人來  但我會的
I don't want to have to call someone, but I will.

394
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,150
這太扯了
This is bullshit.

395
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,570
你舅舅可不高興
Your uncle is not happy.

396
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,170
你知道你有多少次
Are you aware of how many of your sentences

397
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,710
張口就說他怎樣嗎
start with you quoting him?

398
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,800
他是對的
He's right.

399
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
這場鬧劇適得其反
This circus backfired.

400
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,130
-我覺得你很棒  -你舅舅覺得
- I thought you were wonderful. - Your uncle thinks

401
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,520
-我們惡化了本就糟糕的局面  -媽媽
- we've made a bad situation worse. - Mom.

402
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,440
現在我成了這事的臉面人物了
Now I'm the face of this thing.

403
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,690
我們會利用這點幫我們的
Which we will use to our advantage.

404
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,930
她直接點了我們的名字
She called us out by name.

405
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,660
我們想怎么扭轉輿論都行
We can spin it any way we want.

406
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,090
在國會想辦法
Work the Congress.

407
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,830
就算她否決了法案  他們也能推翻她的決策
Even if she vetoes the bill, they can override it.

408
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,470
她反應過度了
She overreacted.

409
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,380
-還讓我出了丑  -相信我
- And it made a fool of me. - I'm telling you,

410
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,580
你贏了
you won.

411
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,620
她覺得是她贏了
She thinks she did.

412
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,290
我認得那個表情  相信我
I know that expression, trust me.

413
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,130
她都想不好自己是麥克白夫人還是麥克白
She can't decide if she's Lady Macbeth or Macbeth.

414
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,960
-接下來讓你舅舅處理  -不
- Your uncle takes it from here. - No.

415
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,470
這對我沒什么私人感情
This isn't personal for me,

416
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,150
不像對你和比爾舅舅
not like it is for you and Uncle Bill.

417
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,140
你知道他討厭關注
You know he hates the spotlight,

418
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,800
不管是對我們誰
for any of us.

419
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,270
他更喜歡老式的手腕
Prefers an old school way of dealing with things.

420
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,150
-我  -別以為你什么都知道了
- I... - And don't think you know everything.

421
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,690
因為不是的
Because you don't.

422
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,910
讓我跟比爾舅舅談談
Let me talk to Uncle Bill.

423
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
他住進了海亞當斯酒店
He's taken a suite at the Hay-Adams.

424
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,500
弗蘭克以前的房間
Frank's old room.

425
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,910
我是道格·斯坦普  聯邦檢察官女士
It's Doug Stamper, Madam US Attorney.

426
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,130
-你怎么拿到這個號碼的  -別掛
- How did you get this number? - Don't hang up.

427
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,540
你再打來  讓你的律師打去我辦公室
The next call I expect is from your lawyer. In my office.

428
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,590
那可不好
You really shouldn't.

429
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,690
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper,

430
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,330
-這非常...  -我要撤供
- this is highly-- - I'm going to recant.

431
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,080
你在聽嗎
Are you there?

432
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,510
是的
Yes.

433
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,410
我要說明事情會怎么發展
I'm going to lay out how it's going to go.

434
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,090
如果我說錯了  你就打斷我
And you stop me at any point if I'm wrong.

435
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,390
但我要撤供
But I'm going to recant.

436
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,520
所以你需要換新的檢察官
Which means you're going to need a new prosecutor.

437
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,970
因為你得回避
Because you're going to have to recuse yourself

438
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,700
好出庭指證我
so you can testify against me.

439
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,520
我們的這通電話
And this call we're on,

440
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,450
對你會不利的
is not going to look very good for you.

441
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,160
你在法庭上說的一切都會被判為傳聞
Anything you say in court will be ruled hearsay.

442
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,870
法官
And the judge,

443
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,620
如果心情好會要求出示更多證據
if he's in a good mood, is going to ask for more evidence,

444
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,120
而你和你的新檢察官卻拿不出
and you and your new prosecutor aren't going to have any.

445
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,960
等等  等等
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

446
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,270
這個案子將無法成就你的事業
This case isn't going to make your career.

447
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,970
能改變你人生的案子
The case that's going change your life

448
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,150
是對克萊爾·安德伍德的起訴
is the prosecution of Claire Underwood.

449
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,250
真是可怕
It's gruesome,

450
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,810
這里發生的事
what's gone on here.

451
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,080
我親自檢查了所有登記簿
I checked all the log books myself.

452
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,780
還詢問過行政管家
I spoke with the executive housekeeper.

那他的戒指是神奇地出現在了他的床上

455

我感覺
My feeling is,

456
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,380
我們該關注的不是這件事本身
it's not the fact of it that we should be focusing on.

457
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,390
而是
But...

458
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,990
它意味著什么
what it means.

459
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,900
告訴我  馬克  什么樣的人會掘開他的墳墓

把戒指從他冰冷僵硬的手指上
and remove a ring from his cold...

461
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,570
摘下來
hard finger?

462
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,610
就是那些在拿弗蘭西斯的赦免
The same people that are generating this drum beat

463
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,350
和你的離婚請求做文章的人

464
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,710

You've turned it into a spectacle, and now they will not stop.

你想把余下的任期都消耗在
Do you want to spend the rest of your presidency

473
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,860
維護你死去的丈夫

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,050
和他的

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,100
有一些很不錯的候選人
some wonderful candidates for the position.

514
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,960

你相信她嗎  斯圖爾特小姐
Do you believe in her, Miss Stewart?

521
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,240
我相信
I do.

522
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,020

要知道有一些厲害的勢力
I want you to know there are powerful forces out there

很想看她失敗
that are invested in seeing her fail.

525
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,560
所以你會聽到謠傳  和暗示
So you're gonna hear rumors. You're gonna hear innuendos.

526
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,510
你得照你的要點講

洛杉磯外的圣費爾南多谷起火了
There's a fire burning in the Valley outside of Los Angeles.

536
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340

544
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,180
是基于已有技術  但是
Well, it's based on pre-existing technology, but...

545

基本上  他們交出了自己的手機
Essentially they're handing over their phones,

你也知道
which as you know,

572
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,580
-誰雇傭的  -我們還不知道
- Hired by who? - We don't know yet.

573
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,220
但他們掙的錢夠多  其中一人剛在

切薩皮克灣買了第二棟房子

他們

576
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,100
闖進了您在加夫尼的住所  女士

我怎么沒收到通知
And why wasn't I alerted?

579
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,200
因為沒人收到通知
Because no one was alerted.

580
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,490
他們什么都沒動
They left it completely untouched,

581
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,030

as far as anyone can tell.

582
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,040

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,460
我就會伸手到衣兜里去  看能找到什么
I'd slip my hand into a coat pocket to see what I could find.

你把你發現的東西偷走了嗎
Did you steal what you found?

596
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,360
沒偷薄荷糖  那太殘忍了
Not the mints. Because that would be cruel.

597
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,900
是你嗎
Was that you...

598
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,630

on the way to the airport?

599

00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,910
你就是對強勢女人心軟
You know, you have a weakness for strong women.

604
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,010
真的
No, really.

605
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,910
你覺得她們需要你幫助
You think they need your help.

606
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,980
不是吧
Really?

607
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,150
-還抽呢  -不
- Still? - No, no.

608
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,830
我現在嚼口香糖了
I chew now.

609
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,020
我就是喜歡
I just like to...

610
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,670
玩這個
play with this.

611
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,260
等等
Wait.

612
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,190
她來了
She's here.

613
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,830
總統女士  鄧肯·謝潑德
Madam President, Duncan Shepherd.

614
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,980
-你好  -克萊爾
- Hello. - Claire.

615
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
安奈特
Annette.

616
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,520
你見過鄧肯了
I see you've met Duncan.

617
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,550
-我們走吧  -好
- Shall we? - Yes.

618
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,820
可不許再抽我手了
Don't ever recoil from me again.

619
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,100
50多棒啊
Ain't 50 nifty?

620
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,350
你上次把我拉進洗手間里
I think the last time you dragged me into a bathroom,

621
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,020
好像是為了炫耀你的吻痕
it was to show off your hickey.

622
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,580
我覺得你哥哥不會收手的  安奈特
I don't think your brother is gonna let up, Annette.

623
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,380
除非我直接俯首稱臣
Until he gets his ring kissed directly, I think.

624
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,720
這讓我想起了你曾經的丈夫
Reminds me of someone you were married to.

625
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,430
不  比爾和弗蘭西斯可很不一樣
No. Bill and Francis are very different people.

626
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,480
是啊
Agreed.

627
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,260
我睡過他一次
You know I slept with him once.

628
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,880
你哥哥嗎
Your brother?

629
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,490
你丈夫
Your husband.

630
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,780
我知道
I know.

631
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,830
有意思
Interesting.

632
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,330
不過想來  也不奇怪
Though, come to think of it, I guess it makes sense.

633
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,500
什么
What does?

634
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,710
你們的婚姻不介意那些
That your marriage allowed for that.

635
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,030
那是98年的競選
Well, it was the '98 campaign.

636
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,970
弗蘭西斯的對手勢頭很猛
Francis was facing a robust challenger,

637
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,360
你們在華府的哪個籌款宴會上碰面了
and there you were at some DC fundraiser or other.

638
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,130
是在聯合車站
It was at the Union Station,

639
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,220
-東大堂  -對
- East Hall. - Yes.

640
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,180
你晃著手里的支票簿
And there you were, dangling your checkbook.

641
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,270
所以聽上去像是挺不錯的交易
So, it sounds like a favorable transaction all around.

642
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,350
-他是那么跟你說的嗎  -我從不問細節
- Is that what he told you? - I never asked for details.

643
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,490
我當時是挺好奇
I mean, I was curious.

644
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,240
真的
I really was.

645
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,320
他吻技還不錯
He was a good kisser, I'll say that.

646
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,820
但其他的  太不給力了
But then the rest was so underwhelming.

647
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,420
感覺他的心沒全在那兒
Felt like he wasn't all there.

648
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,880
就好像他沒...
Like, he wasn't...

649
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,110
完全投入
all in, so to speak.

650
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,980
當然了  我第一個念頭...
Of course, my first thought, and...

651
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,380
大部分女人都會如此吧
isn't this true of most women?

652
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,930
我想會不會是我
Was to wonder if it was me.

653
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,350
我的床技是不是
Was I somehow less skilled

654
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,030
比我自以為的要差
than I like to believe I am?

655
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,650
這我就不知道了  安奈特
Well, I can't really answer to that, Annette.

656
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,580
我知道
I can.

657
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,930
是他
It was him.

658
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,190
而且
And...

659
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,730
我敢說他跟你也一向是如此
I bet it was never very different with you.

660
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,350
哪怕是你
Even you.

661
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,470
金發女神
The blonde goddess.

662
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,940
哪怕是跟你  對嗎
Even with you. Am I right?

663
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,120
我真的現在才意識到
It's really only dawning on me now.

664
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,930
你做出的犧牲
The sacrifice you made.

665
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,850
我都有點可憐你
I sort of pity you.

666
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,560
你這么多年來是怎樣有苦說不出
What you must have denied yourself all those years.

667
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,460
我現在就要讓你閉嘴了  安奈特
And this is where I tell you to shut your mouth, Annette.

668
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,540
你根本不懂婚姻
You don't know anything about marriage,

669
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,170
跟別說我的了
much less mine.

670
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,740
隨便你怎么安慰自己  克萊爾
Tell yourself whatever you want, Claire.

671
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,110
我們都清楚真相
We both know the truth.

672
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,780
他在走廊那邊的備餐廚房等你
He's waiting for you down the hall in the prep kitchen.

673
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,420
我哥哥
My brother.

674
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,010
我現在還會呢
I can still do it by the way.

675
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,980
你呢
Can you?

676
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,310
你錯過了晚餐
Well, you missed dinner.

677
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,320
你想吃什么  我可以讓他們給你做
I can have 'em make you whatever you like.

678
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,430
我不餓
I'm not hungry.

679
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,740
秘訣在于放多少
The secret here is how much

680
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,650
檸檬汁
lemon juice you put in.

681
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,730
能調和黃油
Balance out the butter.

682
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,630
大家都喜歡荷蘭汁
People and hollandaise.

683
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,780
覺得那是錢的味道
They think it tastes like money.

684
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,120
-酒店般的享受  -你想找什么
- A night at the hotel. - What where you looking for?

685
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,410
加夫尼宅邸里沒有什么值錢的東西
There's nothing in the Gaffney home of value.

686
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,060
弗蘭克做過些事
Frank did things.

687
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,560
你怎么
And you just, what?

688
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,550
就當沒看見嗎
Look the other way?

689
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,990
你沖我開的那一槍  這么魯莽不像你啊
That shot you took at me, it's not like you to be so reckless.

690
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,280
你不好嚇
You don't scare easy.

691
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,200
這事關國家的未來
The future of our country is at stake.

692
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,430
這聽上去
Does that sound...

693
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,850
做作嗎  天真嗎
pat to you, naive?

694
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,080
完全不會
No, not at all.

695
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,460
你以為我在五角大樓就沒朋友了嗎  克萊爾
Do you think I don't have friends at the Pentagon, Claire?

696
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,970
你或許想讓我的四年任期很不好過...
You may want to make my four years in office miserable--

697
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,650
我只是希望你按說好的做
All I want you to do is behave, as promised.

698
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,210
你可以去挖戒指  或其他你能挖到的東西
You can dig up a ring or whatever else you can get your hands on.

699
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,280
但那不代表
But that doesn't mean

700
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,120
我不會也讓你一樣不好過
I won't make your time a living hell as well.

701
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,620
雷蒙德·塔斯克有次說你
Raymond Tusk said about you one time,

702
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,590
我們是一起出席什么晚宴  他說...
some dinner we were at, he just said it--

703
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,710
我現在是應該
This is where I'm supposed to be

704
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,590
有點害怕聽到他說了什么
a little bit afraid of the answer,

705
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
-是吧  -他說"我不知道
- I suppose. - He said, "I don't know,

706
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,930
她真是個人
whether or not she's a person...

707
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,520
還是在扮演一個人"
or just playing the part of one."

708
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,190
我當時還覺得這話很奇怪  但或許這是真的
And I thought it was so strange at the time, but maybe it's true.

709
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,860
你真是
Just...

710
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,690
不通人情
unreachable.

711
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,780
我知道這對你很難
I know it'll be hard for you.

712
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,620
但你得平等地對待我  比爾
But you're going to have to treat me as an equal, Bill.

713
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,050
你怎么處理你丈夫的遺囑的
What did you do with your husband's will?

714
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,780
那是份可撤銷的信托
It was a revocable trust.

715
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,190
我都處理好了
All done.

716
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,070
我不是說那個
I'm not talking about that one.

717
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,560
我是說另一個
I'm talking about the other one.

718
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,350
新的那份
The new one.

719
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,410
道格·斯坦普肯定會想看到那份
Bet Doug Stamper would love to see the contents of that one.

720
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,850
上面寫了什么
What's in there anyway?

721
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,280
你竟不惜一切
That you would go to such lengths

722
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,070
讓他看不到
to keep him from it?

723
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,230
克萊爾·黑爾有個秘密
Claire Hale has a secret.

724
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,680
道格拉斯·斯坦普這會兒正在跟聯邦檢察官
Douglas Stamper is meeting with the US District Attorney

725
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,090
會面
as we speak.

726
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,510
他出來了  克萊爾
He's out, Claire.

727
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,270
他不會再回去了
And he's not going back in.

728
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,290
你需要我的幫助
Now, you need my help.

729
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,720
今晚晚些時候
Later tonight,

730
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,030
我要眼看著你簽署
I'm going to watch you sign that bill

731
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,190
你桌上的那份法案
that's sitting on your desk.

732
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,810
"對于死者
"To the dead,

733
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,310
王國毫無意義
a kingdom means nothing.

734
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,500
他們已經擁有安寧和永恒了"
They have their requiem and eternity."

735
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,130
是歌劇《麥克白》  不是戲劇
That's Macbeth. The opera, not the play.

736
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,160
你現在只需要出去
All you have to do now is just go on out there

737
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,870
跟你最久最親愛的朋友站在一起
with your oldest, dearest friend and...

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,930
把她的手高高地舉起來
hold her hand up high.

739
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,500
總統女士
Madam President.

740
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,820
你并不真認為美軍是無關緊要的吧[S03E02]
You don't really think the military is irrelevant?

741
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,730
我在我的法官室里
I watched your confirmation

742
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,610
觀看了你的聯合國大使提名表決
from my chambers for the UN.

743
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,120
不是我最好的時刻
Wasn't my finest hour.

744
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
笑得最響的[男]人...
Well, he who laughs loudest--

745
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,980
還是"笑到最后"
Or is it "laughs last"?

746
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,740
"最后"  是"女人"
"Last." "She."

747
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,570
-我是文森特·阿布佐  -第九巡回法院
- Vincent Abruzzo. - Ninth Circuit.

748
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,150
我很不適應這樣的場合
I am no good at functions like this.

749
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,010
我一般都在這樣的活動上找把椅子
I tend to find a chair at these things

750
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,080
然后就坐一晚上
and sit in it for the rest of the evening.

751
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,660
-總統女士  -嗯  很榮幸認識你
- Madam President. - Yes. Well, it's been a pleasure.

752
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,830
總統女士  容我說一句
Madam President, if I may say,

753
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,410
我很高興總統辦公室總算迎來一位女性
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman in the Oval Office.

754
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,510
雖然歷時很久  但...
The arc of history is long, but--

755
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,420
中年白人男子的統治結束了
The reign of the middle-aged white man is over.

756
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,550
比爾·謝潑德這樣不肯放手的人  必須下臺
The Bill Shepherds of the world who won't let go, have to go.

757
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,250
除了你  還有別人知道寄給他的那份文件嗎
Does anyone except you know about the document that came for him?

758
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,660
當然沒有
No, of course not.

759
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,440
因為如果有別人拿到了那份遺囑
Because if anyone else gets their hand on that will--

760
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,210
那完全是你知我知
That is strictly between us.

761
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,330
我們才剛發現他失蹤了
We only just discovered that he was missing.

762
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,180
我聯系了聯邦檢察官  才得知
I put a call into the US Attorney and was just informed

763
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,750
指控已撤銷
charges have been dropped.

764
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,150
這怎么可能
How is that even possible?

765
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,610
我幾天前以為自己丟了手機
I thought I'd lost my phone a couple of days ago, but...

766
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,370
但現在我可以確定
But now I'm certain that

767
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,670
是他拿走了  打電話做了筆交易
he took it and reached out to make a deal.

768
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,710
我可以選好大陪審團
I can have a grand jury impaneled

769
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,840
一周內就開始對證人進行取證
and we can be taking testimony from witnesses within a week.

770
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,640
你找了誰
Who do you have?

771
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,840
杜蘭特國務卿嗎
Secretary Durant?

772
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,760
還有別人
And others.

773
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,520
我相信不用我告訴你是非對錯
I'm sure I don't need to talk to you about what's right or wrong.

774
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,160
但依我的經驗  大部分人到最后
But in my experience, most people, in the end,

775
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,790
都會不惜一切地保護自己
will do whatever they need to, to save themselves.

776
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,400
你覺得你的勝算大嗎
Do you think you have a strong enough case?

777
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,820
那要看你的了
That depends on you.

778
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,030
如果我要拿自己冒險
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,

779
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,720
我需要知道你能贏
I need to know you're going to win.

780
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,900
這個城市可以很記仇
This can be a very unforgiving town.

781
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,010
我在給你重新開始的機會
I'm giving you a chance to start over.

782
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,110
-得了  -我可以拿豁免權
- Come on. - I can offer you immunity

783
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,420
換取你的證詞
for your testimony.

784
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,500
但是  當然了  斯坦普先生  我并不能就
But, Mr. Stamper, of course, I can't give you any guarantees

785
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,800
你或前總統的名聲做出擔保
when it comes to your reputation or that of the former president.

786
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,190
你得在公開法庭上作證
You would have to testify in an open court.

787
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,870
這是我們的條件
That is the deal.

788
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,690
我要咨詢下我的律師
I should consult with my lawyers.

789
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,620
謝謝你前來  斯坦普先生
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stamper.

790
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,110
與我們一起支持達拉斯年輕女性
Join us in supporting the Dallas Scholarship Fund

791
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,290
獎學金基金
for Young Women:

792
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,440
志遠
Take aim.

793
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,040
看看這些了不起的面孔
Look at these marvelous faces.

794
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,160
她們是未來的面孔
The faces of our future.

795
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,720
我非常榮幸
And I am so, so honored

796
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,660
能夠向大家介紹
to be chosen to introduce to you

797
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,430
美國總統  克萊爾·安德伍德
the President of the United States, Claire Underwood.

798
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,080
我看著這些杰出的年輕姑娘
I look at these brilliant young women

799
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,970
激動得難以言表
and words fail me.

800
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,060
這是什么
What's this?

801
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,510
他們發給了我們這個  它們能干什么
They gave us these. What are they gonna do?

802
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,760
我可不喝那水
Yeah, I'm not drinking the water,

803
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,560
絕不  我告訴你
no fucking way, I'll tell you that.

804
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,040
實在不行我就去坎頓買
I'll go all the way to Canton to buy it, if I have to.

805
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,710
格雷森先生
And... Mr. Grayson,

806
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,840
關于這個應用  他還對你說了什么
what else did he tell you about the app?

807
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,770
沒說什么了  你可以上網去看
Nothing. You can go online and check it out.

808
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,370
因為我認識的很多人
'Cause a lot of people I know

809
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,530
在總統走后還是下載了
signed up for it even after the president left.

810
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,890
他說...
He said...

811
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,180
格雷森先生嗎
Mr. Grayson?

812
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,360
對  他
Yeah, him.

813
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,580
它們能讓我們在事發前就知道
That they were gonna tell us what was gonna happen

814
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,240
-要發生什么  -那怎么說
- before it happens. - How?

815
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,460
我不知道
Look, I don't know.

816
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,640
伊薩卡在哪里
Ithaca's, like, where?

817
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,210
希臘有一個
There's one in Greece.

818
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,470
紐約州北也有一個
And the other's in upstate New York.

819
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,000
猜猜哪個是我的家鄉
Guess which one I'm from.

820
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,570
是一份報紙  每周印發一期
It's a paper, it comes out once a week.

821
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,250
這是不可避免的
It was going to happen,

822
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,370
因為之前就發生過
because it happened before.

823
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,420
我們都上報到環保署了  但是
We complained all the way to the EPA, but...

824
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,860
沒辦法
whatever.

825
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,940
只不過這次的爆炸比較嚴重
Only this time the explosion was bad.

826
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,830
是啊  死了人  公司早就知道
And yeah, some guys died. And the company knew.

827
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,850
他們知道的
They knew.

828
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,500
歡迎回家
Welcome home.

829
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,430
真巧  我剛煮上咖啡
Good timing. I just put on coffee.

830
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,990
現在喝咖啡有點晚了吧
A little late for coffee.

831
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,980
我們有好多要談呢
Well, we have so much to talk about.

832
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,480
我很高興你出來了  道格
I'm glad you're out, Doug.

833
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,280
我都不知道你為什么會進去
I don't know what you were doing in there.

834
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,800
聯邦檢察官怎么樣了
How's the US Attorney?

835
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,690
杜蘭特國務卿在商談她的出庭
Secretary Durant's negotiating her appearance.

836
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,470
如果
And if...

837
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,590
凱茜被勸說不去了呢
Cathy should somehow be dissuaded?

838
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,310
-不發聲了呢  -那一切都不了了之
- Silenced? - Then it all goes away.

839
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,510
是啊  但他們還是會想知道
Yes, but they'll still want to know

840
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,890
誰知道什么  什么時候
who knew what, when.

841
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,860
我挺清楚的
I feel pretty clear.

842
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,490
你覺得是我叫你背鍋的
You think it was me who asked you to take the fall

843
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,520
-因為是我開的口  -他告訴我是你了
- just because I said the words, right? - He told me it was you.

844
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,970
-他悄悄對我說的  -你就信了
- He whispered it in my ear. - And you believed him.

845
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,700
你總是相信他
Like you always believed him.

846
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,240
我是這么想的  佐伊·巴恩斯自殺了
Well, here's what I believe. Zoe Barnes killed herself--

847
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,690
其他的事我會得到赦免
And I expected to be pardoned for the rest.

848
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,240
他死后  我一直受到束縛
Since his death, my hands have been tied.

849
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,920
但我認為上天給了我們一份禮物
But I believe the universe has given us a gift.

850
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,370
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

851
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,160
這么說吧
Well...

852
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,030
我們都失去了一個
We both lost someone

853
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,030
改變了我們人生軌跡的人
who shaped the course of our lives.

854
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,940
有好的改變  也有壞的
For good, but also for ill.

855
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,630
現在我們
And now here we are

856
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,150
意外地自由了
unexpectedly free.

857
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,710
可以選擇不一樣的方法
To take a different tack.

858
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,980
我們想做什么都行  道格
We can do whatever we want, Doug.

859
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,940
我們的命運一直糾纏在一起
And we've been entwined, you and I,

860
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,520
不管愿不愿意
like it or not,

861
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,460
這幾十年來都是如此
for decades now.

862
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,000
但我覺得
But I think...

863
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
我們有權分道揚鑣了
we deserve to go our separate ways.

864
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,890
唯一的問題是
The only problem is

865
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,610
我們有個緊急的問題要處理
we have something urgent to attend to

866
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,070
凱茜·杜蘭特
called Cathy Durant.

867
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,140
然后我們就終于自由了
And then we can finally be free.

868
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,970
做我們真正想做的
Do what we really want.

869
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,250
做我們需要做的
Do what we need to do.

870
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,650
道格·斯坦普想要什么
What does Doug Stamper want?

871
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,510
你是想抹去他嗎
Are you trying to erase him?

872
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,640
因為你做不到
Because you can't.

873
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
我沒有別的意思
I'm not trying to do anything

874
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,030
只是想做好現任美國總統
except be the sitting President of the United States.

875
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,670
你不該認定
It's wrong to assume

876
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,860
弗蘭西斯的野心跟我的完全一致  道格
Francis's ambitions directly aligned with mine, Doug.

877
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,170
要想不被與他的可疑行為聯系在一起
The best way to not to be associated with his questionable deeds

878
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,470
就得做好事
is to do good.

879
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,930
至少我是打算這么做的
That's what I plan to do, anyway.

880
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,500
你覺得好笑  是嗎
Oh, you find that funny, do you?

881
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,300
是真的
Well, it's true.

882
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,050
我就不懂他看好了你什么
I never understood what he saw in you.

883
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,740
這副皮囊的確不錯
I mean the outside, sure.

884
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,330
但內心
But the inside...

885
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,810
-莉安的死  -不
- LeAnn's death. - No.

886
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,530
你根本沒在乎過她
You never cared for her.

887
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,070
并不非得如此
It wasn't necessary.

888
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,610
我也這么跟他說了
And I told him so.

889
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,430
但是...
And yet...

890
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,250
道格  幫個忙
Doug, do me a favor.

891
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,790
閉上眼睛
Close your eyes.

892
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,610
拜托
Please.

893
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,600
他把這個留給了你
He wanted you to have them.

894
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,810
這種事就你這個年紀來說
For this to happen at this point in your life,

895
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,870
預后并不樂觀
the prognosis is not good.

896
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,710
我知道
I know.

897
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,420
有人殺了弗蘭西斯
Somebody killed Francis,

898
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,360
卻不希望他死
and yet they don't want him to die.

899
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,010
我們最后一次通話的那晚
That last night, the last time we spoke,

900
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,850
就是我在總統辦公室里拒接了他的電話
was when I declined his phone call in the Oval Office.

901
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,380
已經快兩個月了  他不想再等了
It had been close to two months, and he was tired of waiting.

902
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,530
于是他自己跑來了白宮
So he showed up here in the White House.

903
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,070
像個小賊
Like a thief.

904
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,980
當時好可怕
It was terrifying.

905
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,150
他暴跳如雷  說話都不清楚了
He was furious, slurring his words.

906

"你怎么就不能乖乖聽話  克萊爾"
"Why can't you do as you're told, Claire?"

907
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,030
我告訴世人他死在了我們的床上
I told the world that he died in our bed,

908
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,900
但那不是事實
but that's not the truth.

909
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,410
我那晚上把自己鎖在了我的房間里
I locked myself in my room that night,

910
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,000
早上醒來時  發現他死在了自己房里
woke up in the morning and found him dead in his.

911
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,310
他們殺了他  好讓我閉嘴
They killed him to shut me up.

912
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,610
我必須徹底埋葬弗蘭西斯
I need to bury Francis, once and for all.

913
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,350
簽字還需要人幫忙嗎
Do you need help signing it?

914
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,400
別  比爾  謝潑德  夠了
No. Bill. Shepherd, enough.

915
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,830
其實  我有個條件
I actually have one condition.

916
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,380
放回去
Put it back.

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}根據美國勞工部發布的10月就業數據
新增非農就業崗位25萬  失業率3.7%
工資增長速度為2008年以來最快
許多特朗普的支持者認為  這些數字
一要歸功于共和黨2017年末通過的減稅法案
二要歸功于特朗普政府一系列的去監管措施
在過去兩年中  特朗普政府信守共和黨"小政府""少插手"的理念
大幅度廢除聯邦行政法規和監管條例
到今年7月為止  白宮共廢除176項監管性法規  節省開支230億美元
其中環保署在2018年就取消/廢除了10項法規
而這一數字預計會在2019年增長到30項
但去監管在刺激經濟增長的同時  也增加了發生環保災難的可能

{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}今年三月  美國英國多家媒體揭露  在2016年大選期間
一家名為"劍橋分析"的公司在用戶不知情的情況下
從臉書上獲取用戶個人信息  并將其賣給特朗普競選團隊
新聞曝光后  臉書股價大幅下滑  執行總裁扎克伯格
也不得不到國會山作證  接受議員們的嚴詞問詢
此后臉書和其它一些網站在用戶隱私政策上進行了改進
過去十年中  互聯網和移動終端在美國政治生活中發揮的作用越來越大
但同時也帶來了一系列的嚴重問題
目前美國共和黨和民主黨都對社交網絡公司的一些操作有很大意見
不過雙方所關注的問題不盡相同
民主黨指責社交網絡上假新聞泛濫  影響了選舉結果
而共和黨則抱怨硅谷的公司在網絡上刻意打壓保守派言論
因此要求立法監管社交網絡的呼聲越來越大
硅谷數家大公司的老板都曾被叫到國會山接受議員們的問詢
支持和反對監管的兩種力量也正在激烈較量中  尚未分出勝負

{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}美國有著非常嚴格的環保法規  聯邦環保署權力很大
下屬的環保執法機構犯罪調查處雖然只有200名左右的探員
但是這些環保先鋒有非常獨立的執法權  可以攜帶槍支  執行逮捕
2017年聯邦環保署的執法隊伍共罰沒收繳了50億美元的款項
在罪案調查過程中  環保署的執法部門也會同其它聯邦執法部門合作
不過劇中被調駐到國防部的情況在現實生活中還不曾出現
環保署自身執法權限很大  在對付大公司的時候一般也不需要五角大樓介入
近年來倒在環保署鐵拳下的最大一個目標是德國的大眾公司
由于在尾氣排放問題上作假  在環保署的調查下
大眾公司被罰款28億美元  并支付15億美元的補償款
涉案的一名公司高管和一名工程師也被判入獄
因為共和黨的去監管主張  在特朗普主政之后  環保署力量被大幅削弱
其下屬的執法部門調查的案件也照往年有很大幅度的減少
