20
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,980
Autism -- a mental condition

21
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,150
characterized by difficulty in communicating.

22
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,610
Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?

23
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,940
You saved his life.

24
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

25
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,260
Never forget, you're the smart one

26
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,320
and I'm proud of you, Shaun.

27
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,940
My brother went to Heaven...

28
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,470
...in front of my eyes.

29
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,000
He's got a serious deficit.

30
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,080
We hire Shaun,

31
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,690
and we give hope to those people with limitations

32
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,940
that those limitations are not what they think they are,

33
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,180
that they do have a shot!

34
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,220
If Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

35
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,040
I will resign my position as president of this hospital.

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,270
Where to?

37
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,900
San Jose - St. Bonaventure Hospital.

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,270
I'm a surgical resident.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,840
Today is my first full day.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,480
I meant floor.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh, ground floor.

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,790
I'm taking the bus.

43
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,150
This is Mitchell Brand, 55 years old,

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,650
post-op day one - from a radical prostatectomy.

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,450
Morning, Mitchell.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,470
I'm Dr. Melendez.

47
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,100
These are my residents Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,590
Your surgery went perfectly.

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,430
Yeah.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Am I ever gonna walk again?

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes. Of course.

52
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,930
This is Mitchell Brand.

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,180
I reviewed his chart.

54
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,950
He's 55 years old from Chicago,

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,390
divorced with two children.

56
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,860
You did a radical prostatectomy on him yesterday.

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,650
There are many possible complications

58
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,270
but none related to motor neurons.

59
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,280
There is no chance you won't be able to walk.

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,050
He -- he wasn't worried about his legs.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,390
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,030
There's a significant chance of impotence.

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,910
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,700
No, the bus was late.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,950
The schedule was clear.

66
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,870
They post it online.

67
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,490
But the 4 bus was late which meant --

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,930
- You're late. - Five minutes, we've all been --

69
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,230
On your first day, no less.

70
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,150
It is your responsibility to be here.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
if you are not,

72
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,090
you have failed in your responsibility,

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,370
which makes it your fault.

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,260
Okay, how can it be my fault?

75
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,570
I did nothing wrong. The bus --

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,950
Yeah.  This is gonna work out great.

77
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,270
The board clearly made the right choice in hiring you.

78
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,710
Thank you.

79
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,570
Dr. Melendez,

80
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,590
we've got an emergent consult in the E.R.

81
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,580
You should be fine if you can leave it alone for a couple days.

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,150
Four days of indigestion,

83
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,200
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,380
And a lot of pain, apparently.

85
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,850
- Did you give her morphine? - Yeah, 10 milligrams.

86
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,180
Hasn't touched her pain.

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,710
You have time to get a CT?

88
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah. That's why I called you.

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,030
That's very big.

90
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,490
Yes, it is.

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,150
What are we looking at?

92
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,200
It's definitely abutting the aorta and the left kidney.

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Renal angiomyolipoma?

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,110
- Do you see an extensive blood supply? - No.

95
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,140
Maybe some kind of neurogenic tumor.

96
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,690
Or maybe a lymphoma.

97
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,840
She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor.

98
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,720
Malignant?

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,740
- That means it's killing me, right? - Yes.

100
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,720
Not necessarily.

101
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,240
We're just speculating right now.

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
No.  It's definitely malignant.

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,880
If it weren't malignant --

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,270
Please stop saying "Malignant."

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,410
Should we talk outside?

106
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,250
Give her more morphine. As much as she wants.

107
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,630
You scared her.

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,730
Didn't need to be so blunt.

109
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,690
Why?

110
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,400
Her prognosis is terminal without immediate medical intervention.

111
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,680
Isn't that scary?

112
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,790
Well --

113
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,420
That fear does her no good.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,900
Does she have a malignant sarcoma?

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?

116
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,930
We need intra-operative staging for the biopsy,

117
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,320
extensive dissection of the retroperitoneum,

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,860
and excision of the mass with wide, clear margins.

119
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,690
I want in.

120
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
You do know you're drooling, right?

121
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,230
About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.

122
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,570
Real person. Right behind that door.

123
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,910
It's called bedside manner --

124
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,650
no such thing as outside-the-door manner.

125
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,150
It is exciting, Claire.

126
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,600
We'd be saving a life, and we'd be learning.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,560
See?

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,950
Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,210
With all due respect, doctor --

130
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,030
Comments that start that way rarely come across that way.

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,690
- I was going to say that's an excellent call. - Thank you.

132
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,380
Jared, prep the surgical team.

133
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,660
Sir, what do I do?

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,800
Scut work.

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,290
What's scut work?

136
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,010
Today, I'm gonna need my surgeons to have no distractions.

137
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,410
So I'm gonna need you to handle those distractions.

138
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,500
All the work they do every day that they hate doing,

139
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,070
you're handling it for them.

140
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,280
Make sure they know we still need a consent on that one.

141
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,960
Am I being punished for something?

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,870
No.

143
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,130
Okay.

144
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,220
So that's it?

145
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,750
You just accept my answer at face value?

146
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,890
Why?

147
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,480
You're very arrogant.

148
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,570
Arrogant people don't think they need to lie.

149
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,180
So you must be doing this to teach me.

150
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,310
I look forward to learning from scut work.

151
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,760
Say "Ahh." 

152
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,480
How long will this be?

153
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,880
Seven minutes.

154
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,450
Without any complications,

155
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,510
it takes seven minutes to do a discharge examination properly.

156
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,670
Dr. Dunsmuir has already cleared him to go

157
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,500
- and we need the bed. - Okay.

158
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
Protocol requires that the surgical department also clears him.

159
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,330
You have an ear infection.

160
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,810
Yes, that's why he's here.

161
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,250
My hearing's been a little muffled,

162
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,660
and I've had some ringing.

163
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,270
They gave him amoxicillin.

164
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,810
And we're sending him home.

165
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,270
Which is why you're here.

166
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,040
To send him home.

167
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,500
I'd like an MRI of the head and internal auditory meatus.

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm not being discharged?

169
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,610
What do you think is wrong?

170
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,580
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

171
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,740
I don't want to scare you.

172
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,090
Shaun.

173
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,330
What are you doing down here?

174
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm waiting for her to fart.

175
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Flatulence.

176
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,020
But I'm using the word "Fart" in front of the patient

177
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,240
to be more casual.

178
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,670
But you're the president of the hospital,

179
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,450
so I'll say "Flatulence" to you.

180
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, I appreciate that.

181
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,480
Why are you doing that?

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,340
She had her deviated septum repaired.

183
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,300
Before we can release her,

184
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,490
we have to be sure she isn't suffering from post-operative ileus.

185
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,780
This is what Dr. Melendez feels

186
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,010
you'll be most useful doing today?

187
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,790
Waiting for farts?

188
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,530
I'm not just waiting for farts.

189
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,420
Thank Goodness.

190
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,170
I'm doing all the scut work.

191
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,650
Well...

192
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,540
Welcome to your surgical residency.

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,590
Thank you.

194
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,440
There. I think that was it.

195
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,210
I don't think so.

196
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,900
I'll wait a little longer.

197
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,220
This is important.

198
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,390
The procedure is called a laparotomy.

199
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,030
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

200
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,430
So, we make a long incision down the middle of your abdomen,

201
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,510
expose the tumor --

202
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
Am I going to die?

203
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,680
Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon I have ever seen --

204
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,020
Can this all wait?

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,140
You have a very serious condition.

206
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,100
It's not advisable to --

207
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,210
Just a couple of weeks. My son is getting married next weekend.

208
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,950
They look very happy.

209
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,200
After the initial incision --

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,020
They've been planning this for months.

211
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
If they have to reschedule --

212
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,480
Well -- well, this -- this is complicated surgery,

213
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,840
but if all goes well,

214
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,610
recovery is pretty easy.

215
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,410
No need to reschedule anything.

216
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,210
And if it doesn't?

217
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,090
If it doesn't go well?

218
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,510
My husband died in a car accident

219
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
a couple of years ago.

220
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,480
Mark is our only child.

221
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,190
I can't die - right before his wedding.

222
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,330
I can't.

223
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,390
You're not gonna die.

224
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,680
You will be at the wedding.

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Looking beautiful.

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
Okay.

227
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,710
You're not supposed to make promises like that, Dr. Browne.

228
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,550
Yeah, I told her what she needed to hear.

229
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,080
Officially, our legal department's policy is --

230
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,510
tell the ugly truth -- the uglier the better.

231
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,540
Is that what you did?

232
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't think that's what you did.

233
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

234
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,990
She needs to have the surgery.

235
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,710
Scaring her would change nothing.

236
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,040
Right, because a much better policy

237
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,680
would be to lie to all of our patients

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,890
whenever it makes you feel better.

239
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,160
No, it doesn't make me feel better.

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
It makes her feel better.

241
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm pathetic.

242
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,870
What?

243
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,140
I am pathetic.

244
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,260
And here's my thinking, so just --

245
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,020
just bear with me,

246
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,560
because it kind of insults both of us.

247
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,120
You met that woman an hour ago,

248
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,980
and you lied to her.

249
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,200
A pity lie because you obviously care about her.

250
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,530
A pity lie that has absolutely zero upside for you,

251
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,890
but I can't make you, the world's softest touch,

252
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,090
care about me.

253
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,740
I need a consult.

254
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,680
What? You have a question about this?

255
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,800
This patient is perfectly healthy.

256
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,540
There's not even any artifact in these images.

257
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,530
Yeah, which in turn raises an interesting medical question --

258
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,840
why the hell did this patient get an MRI?

259
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,300
I don't know anything about this.

260
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,280
Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it.

261
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,750
It's your responsibility, which makes it your fault.

262
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,120
What -- How did you --?

263
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,140
It's my department. It's my job to know everything.

264
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,710
Well, then, since I work for you,

265
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,670
doesn't that make all of this actually your fault?

266
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, I'm sorry, i stopped listening after "I work for you."

267
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,800
Does that hurt?

268
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,260
Yes.

269
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,500
Does that hurt?

270
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,590
Yes.

271
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,600
Does that hurt?

272
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,900
Yes.

273
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,660
She has a tummy ache.

274
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,240
- That's what they do -- they ache. - Shh.

275
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,170
She's just trying to get out of school. Again.

276
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,650
Where do you think she learned that from?

277
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,310
You don't think she hears you calling in sick to work

278
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,870
right before you go golfing?

279
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,410
I like school.

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,640
Me too.

281
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,480
What did you eat for dinner last night?

282
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,060
Cereal.

283
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,560
- I thought you made meatloaf. - I did.

284
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,580
And it got cold while we were waiting for you.

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase --

286
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,290
What tests are you ordering?

287
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,220
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

288
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,900
For a tummy ache? Hmm?

289
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,690
Yes.

290
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,930
I'm concerned it may be...

291
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,830
Shall we talk outside?

292
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,990
I told you something was wrong.

293
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,970
You're happy she might be sick?

294
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,810
I'm happy you're wrong.

295
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,790
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

296
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,650
Have they been bickering like that the whole time?

297
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,160
I didn't notice. They aren't sick.

298
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,110
Yeah, they're what we call a vector.

299
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,030
A carrier. A cause of disease.

300
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,100
- You mean the parents? - Yeah.

301
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,400
That little girl has a tummy ache

302
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,430
because mommy and daddy won't stop fighting.

303
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,260
This isn't a medical issue. Send them home.

304
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,840
Could be intestinal malrotation,

305
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,490
which could quickly become fatal.

306
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,890
And every patient in this hospital could have malaria,

307
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,270
but that doesn't mean we're gonna go around testing

308
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,210
for every condition we think they could have.

309
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,780
For example, that MRI you ordered

310
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,520
on the guy with the ear infection?

311
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,930
Nice call, genius.

312
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,910
Thank you.

313
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,630
I was being sarcastic.

314
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,950
It's normal. He's healthy.

315
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,100
Send him home, too.

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,170
Why are you smiling?

317
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Because you're right.

318
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,250
So you thought he was making a mistake

319
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,580
and didn't say anything?

320
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,000
Just stood by watching, taking notes

321
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
while he wasted everybody's time?

322
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,920
Is that your job?

323
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,490
In my experience,

324
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,960
doctors don't listen to nurses.

325
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
And they only talk to us to lecture us

326
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
when they figure we screwed something up.

327
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,740
From now on, you don't run any tests you don't have to run.

328
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,900
How do I know if

329
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,840
a test is needed until after I run it?

330
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,210
She'll tell you.

331
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,080
Today, she's your boss.

332
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,070
I could never eat before surgery.

333
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,100
Puke? I could do that.

334
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,060
I get cranky if I don't eat.

335
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,510
- I hear Shaun made the call. - Mm.

336
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,620
He's an excellent diagnostician.

337
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,680
You should get him a job in radiology.

338
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,420
He doesn't want to be a radiologist.

339
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,900
He wants to be a surgeon.

340
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,720
That's what we hired him to be.

341
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,030
That's what I worked damn hard to hire him to be.

342
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,190
Not a glorified orderly.

343
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,810
Every resident does scut work.

344
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,640
So you're treating him like anybody else?

345
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,720
- Are you? - Yes, yes, I am.

346
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,910
He more than earned the right to be here.

347
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,640
He has had to get past people like you

348
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,810
and their prejudices every step of the way.

349
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,910
- Prejudices? - Yeah, prejudices.

350
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,350
You have any idea how many patients

351
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,040
he's scared the crap out of today?

352
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,940
How many wasted tests he ordered?

353
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,320
So teach him.

354
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,380
I'm doing that.

355
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.

356
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,270
Okay.

357
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,220
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will pull rank.

358
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,090
This is my hospital.

359
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,810
But it's my team.

360
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,660
You can't tell me how to run my team.

361
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,800
How are you doing?

362
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,950
What's the point of sarcasm?

363
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,730
Like, sometimes, - it's a way of critiquing people

364
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,260
in a way that's funny

365
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,930
so they don't feel quite so bad.

366
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,380
Isn't it just lying?

367
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,290
well, it's not lying,

368
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,080
because people know you're lying.

369
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm not good at that.

370
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,080
You may remember me from last year.

371
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,520
We sell chocolate bars every year

372
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,050
to pay for our class trip to Mt. Rushmore.

373
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,550
Okay.

374
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,480
But this year we're not going to Mt. Rushmore,

375
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,350
because Kenny can't go.

376
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,170
He's got cancer.

377
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,670
So, Samantha had the idea

378
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,910
that if he can't go, none of us would go,

379
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,790
and we all thought that was a great idea.

380
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,270
So, we're gonna have a party at the hospital for him.

381
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,570
There are two Kennys in your class.

382
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,320
Is it Kenny L. Or Kenny M.?

383
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,500
No one's sick.

384
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,260
Well, you lied?

385
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,160
- You weren't supposed to lie. - Yeah.

386
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,040
And you and me aren't supposed to starve.

387
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,460
We need money for food.

388
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,630
Was any of that true?

389
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,710
Yeah.

390
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,010
We're not going to Mt. Rushmore.

391
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,630
I can't discharge people

392
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,520
if I think they might still be sick.

393
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,830
of course not. Why would you?

394
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,120
Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday my boss today.

395
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,660
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

396
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,500
No.

397
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,870
What did you think this job was?

398
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,420
To save people's lives.

399
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,660
No.

400
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,070
I mean, yeah, - sometimes we do save lives.

401
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,540
But the job...

402
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,520
It's doing whatever Melendez asks us to do.

403
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,710
Paging Dr. Browne.

404
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,000
Paging Dr. Browne to the O.R.

405
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

406
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,850
I'm first assist today,

407
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,590
and I'll be leading the timeout.

408
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,500
- Patient's name? - Stephanie Willis.

409
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,230
Scheduled surgery?

410
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,190
Excision of an indeterminate retroperitoneal tumor.

411
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,840
We don't anticipate any complications with the surgery.

412
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,000
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

413
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,150
Ten blade.

414
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,890
Ten blade.

415
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,430
Let's remove a tumor.

416
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Excuse me.

417
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,960
No.

418
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,920
It might be infected.

419
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,470
It's not.

420
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,350
There is some discoloration.

421
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,830
He's 82 years old.

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,410
Everything is discolored.

423
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,020
Once we get through the muscle layer,

424
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,320
proceed carefully.

425
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,100
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

426
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,290
Heart rate 60.

427
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,580
She's holding steady.

428
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,480
I've opened the facia.

429
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,570
You kept your puke?

430
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah, I thought you'd want to see it.

431
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,090
It looks like puke.

432
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,610
No. No, no. It's not the regular color.

433
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,940
Your puke has a regular color?

434
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,680
Yeah.

435
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,900
It is a bit of an unusual color.

436
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,560
We could order some...

437
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,490
I'm sending you home.

438
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,990
You sure?

439
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,710
It -- It's safe for me to go home?

440
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,610
I don't know what to say.

441
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,170
You'll learn.

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
By doing.

443
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,570
My brother said there's a kid named Kenny,

444
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,210
and he's sick, and there might --

445
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,720
you should give us money.

446
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,600
So, am I okay?

447
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,030
Am -- Am I okay?

448
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,800
According to all hospital rules

449
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,230
and direct instructions given to me, yes.

450
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,440
We need a better exposure of this tumor.

451
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,850
Let's get the deep Balfour in here.

452
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,980
Deep Balfour retractor

453
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,530
Let's get this thing open.

454
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,240
I've got to see where it's safe to cut.

455
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't see anywhere where this tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,510
Claire, tell me you got something.

457
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,650
I've got nothing.

458
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,370
This tumor is way bigger than it looked on the scans.

459
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,690
I...I can't even see her aorta.

460
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,490
That's a problem.

461
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,630
Is that the girl with the bickering parents?

462
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,360
Didn't we send her home four hours ago?

463
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,820
Dr. Murphy,

464
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,510
Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.

465
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,280
That won't be necessary.

466
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,680
The tumor's entirely encased the large abdominal arteries.

467
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,720
That's very bad.

468
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,860
If it's in the artery walls,

469
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,600
it's going to be impossible to cut out without killing her.

470
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,790
You should get a biopsy to determine where the margins are.

471
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,160
Thank you.

472
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,670
You're welcome.

473
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,120
I was being sarcastic... again.

474
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,780
I-I see, because you are already know everything I said,

475
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,200
and you already sent a biopsy to the lab?

476
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Yes, 'cause I'm a doctor, too.

477
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,500
Yes. But you need me?

478
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,330
Yeah, I need you to run down to the lab and hurry them along.

479
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

480
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,030
I'm a surgical resident.

481
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,140
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.

482
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,530
When will the results be ready?

483
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,210
When I get to it.

484
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,570
It's very important.

485
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
They're all very important.

486
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,740
Let me see the other test orders.

487
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,580
I'll tell you which ones are most important,

488
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,260
and you can do them in that order.

489
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,760
I'll be honest and fair.

490
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,880
That is not the way that it works.

491
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Now go wait your turn.

492
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,900
Do it again.

493
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,750
- Get the hell away from me, you moron. - Let's get out of here!

494
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

495
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,650
If you want to get anything in life, Shaun,

496
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,140
there's one thing you got to do.

497
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,560
Never be afraid.

498
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,830
You're the moron!

499
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,750
If you don't do - Dr. Melendez's test right now,

500
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,060
I will throw a rock through your window.

501
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,020
Well, I wouldn't want that.

502
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,210
Go have a seat.

503
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,960
Your results will be ready in 15 minutes.

504
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,720
You got a minute?

505
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,620
I have a patient lying in the O.R.

506
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,150
waiting for lab results,

507
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,470
and I'm sitting here trying to figure out

508
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,420
what the hell I'm gonna do next,

509
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,880
and I don't like any of my options,

510
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,680
so...yeah, unfortunately it seems I do.

511
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,790
Okay, we can talk another time.

512
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,960
Glassman talked to you?

513
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,500
I don't have a problem with an autistic doctor.

514
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,650
No, you just have a problem with one working for you.

515
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,390
Really? That's how you see me?

516
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,930
Let's not make this personal.

517
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,760
You're accusing me of prejudice.

518
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,160
I have a problem with the doctor who has a problem with communication.

519
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,740
Okay, let's make this personal.

520
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,310
Who do you respect at this hospital?

521
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,210
You and Glassman.

522
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,480
And who do you not respect?

523
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,340
And does it bother you

524
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,760
that it looks like - you're on the wrong team?

525
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,880
If the tumor hasn't invaded into the arterial walls,

526
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,660
we could create a plane of dissection.

527
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,400
Well, if it's a noninvasive liposarcoma

528
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,030
we can work it off from the outside.

529
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,490
Blunt dissection and tissue forceps --

530
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,940
peel it off piece by piece.

531
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,190
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

532
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,900
Well, that sucks.

533
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,220
Yes, it's sad.

534
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,620
The surgery's impossible.

535
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,430
Well, might as well wake her up --

536
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,290
let her know she has three months to live,

537
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,810
offer palliative care.

538
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,630
The surgery isn't impossible --

539
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,870
just, very, very, very difficult.

540
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes, in the sense that we'll be operating blind.

541
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,310
Yes, because the left kidney is in the way.

542
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,710
The healthy left kidney.

543
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,370
Both kidneys are healthy, Jared.

544
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,420
She only needs one.

545
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,630
Without the left one, it's theoretically possible

546
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,300
to access the tumor and remove it.

547
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,470
You're suggesting we cut out a perfectly healthy organ

548
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,930
- just to get a better view? - Yes.

549
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,670
- But she might die anyway. - Yes. Quite probably.

550
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,620
I have to go. I have a boil to lance.

551
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,450
I mean, it's a brilliant...

552
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,840
very, very, very terrible idea.

553
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
Close her up and wake her up.

554
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,930
Who wants to join me when I tell her

555
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,470
she has six weeks left to live?

556
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,900
There is one possibility.

557
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,700
If we removed the left kidney,

558
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,140
we might be able to get a good enough view

559
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,520
to successfully remove the mass.

560
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,080
Take out a healthy kidney

561
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,840
to get a better view?

562
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,260
That's insane.

563
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,620
A good view's half the battle in any operation.

564
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,930
Most likely outcome is we'd be depriving her

565
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,240
of what little time she has left.

566
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,510
But if we succeed...

567
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,220
No --

568
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,970
You want to do this 'cause it's exciting.

569
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,100
You want to be a hero.

570
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,810
But if you fail, this woman dies.

571
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,490
She misses her son's wedding.

572
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,420
Well, that's the issue, isn't it?

573
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,590
You promised this woman she'll be okay.

574
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,630
She had to do this surgery.

575
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,570
I might as well tell her good things.

576
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,330
The reason we don't make patients promises

577
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,880
isn't just for legal.

578
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,550
Jared's right. Your judgment is compromised.

579
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,120
- I still think -- You're not objective.

580
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,470
Who the hell is?

581
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,070
We should at least wake her up,

582
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,600
explain what we found, what we're hoping to do,

583
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,400
and get a new consent.

584
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,510
What we're hoping to do

585
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,810
is exactly what you told her we were going to do --

586
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,060
remove that tumor.

587
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,380
The only thing we'd be explaining is

588
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,080
why you undersold the risks.

589
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,960
We're doing the surgery.

590
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,750
And, Jared, - you're my new number two.

591
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,930
Mayos.

592
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:35,960
Mayos.

593
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm going to open the fascia and expose the kidney.

594
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,740
You clamp the renal hilum.

595
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,450
Clamp.

596
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,330
Clamp.

597
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,370
We just cut off the blood supply to a perfectly healthy kidney.

598
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,360
If we needed color commentary,

599
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,470
I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.

600
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,530
Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor.

601
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,730
Yes. I sent him home.

602
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,470
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

603
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,300
He actually came to the president of the hospital instead.

604
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,460
H-He said you sent him home

605
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,790
even though you thought he was sick.

606
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,470
I specifically never said that.

607
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,140
- I made sure not to say that. - No. Oh.

608
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,480
What -- what the hell does that mean?

609
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,350
- What does that mean, Shaun? - A-Am I healthy?

610
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,780
- Probably. - You're a doctor.

611
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,620
You're -- - you're supposed to know. 

612
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,300
No, we're not -- Nobody knows anything for sure.

613
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,730
Anybody could drop dead of a heart attack at any time.

614
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,920
Who is this guy?

615
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,810
Am I -- Am I gonna have a heart attack?

616
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,910
Shaun has some difficulty with certain social interactions,

617
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,230
- but if he says that - - I don't give a crap what he says.

618
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,380
W-What do you say?

619
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,520
Am I healthy?

620
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,650
I've reviewed your chart,

621
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,210
and I can say with complete confidence

622
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,690
that you are in peak physical condition.

623
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,820
Thank God.

624
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,040
Shaun, people need reassurance.

625
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,600
I told him he was safe to go home.

626
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,710
I was very clear. W-With your words --

627
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,850
Your actions said something completely different.

628
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,640
No, they didn't.

629
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,780
My actions were completely silent.

630
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,220
When you reassure someone, they have to receive it.

631
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,650
You have to gauge

632
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,620
whether they actually are reassured.

633
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,910
You understand?

634
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,070
When did you review Trevor's chart?

635
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,200
I didn't.

636
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,310
It's not really a lie.

637
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,470
If you say - that he is safe to go home,

638
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,320
then I know for a fact that he's safe to go home.

639
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,420
I sent a girl home today.

640
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,040
How often do people develop stomach issues

641
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,300
because of their brain?

642
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,620
Based on my personal experience?

643
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,940
Every single day.

644
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,800
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase

645
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,110
for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff.

646
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,910
She might have a tummy ache caused by stress.

647
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,590
Or she might not.

648
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,400
Hi, Shaun.

649
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,790
Hi, Carly.

650
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,270
That's a lot of tests for an upset stomach.

651
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,620
You could get in trouble.

652
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,220
That's definitely true.

653
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,220
Remove the kidney.

654
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,020
All right. It's coming out.

655
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,550
OK.

656
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,990
Let's get in there with some suction, Claire,

657
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,090
so we can get a better view of what we're dealing with.

658
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,710
There it is.

659
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,510
It's a mess.

660
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,270
Yes, it is.

661
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,110
But now it's a mess we can see.

662
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
Everything is within normal range.

663
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,660
Slightly elevated lactate and amylase,

664
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,160
and she's very small.

665
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Normal should be lower.

666
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,250
Normal should be lower.

667
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,160
What do you think she has?

668
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,310
Thank you.

669
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,150
W-What the hell? It -- it's after 1:00.

670
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,590
I ran tests.

671
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,980
The results were ambiguous.

672
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,360
I think Martine has intestinal malrotation

673
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,850
and that a volvulus has occurred.

674
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,130
Ambiguous tests told you this.

675
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,830
It's a genetic condition.

676
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,940
The symptoms - are very similar to stress.

677
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,290
Call us in the morning.

678
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,180
Okay, she may not be alive in the morning.

679
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,790
Does your boss know you're here?

680
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,160
No, I think he'd be upset with me for being here.

681
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,740
I am not waking my daughter up in the middle of a school night

682
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,130
because of some freak.

683
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,240
And you don't need - to call me in the morning,

684
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,800
because I'll be calling your boss in the morning.

685
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,150
Were you being sarcastic?

686
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,120
- How hard is it to get rid of someone. - I told him --

687
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,230
You're right. I'm weird.

688
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,330
Part of my weirdness is that I perseverate.

689
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,360
That means I keep thinking about things.

690
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,070
So I will keep knocking on your door

691
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,070
until I know Martine is okay.

692
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,370
Martine.

693
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,550
Martine.

694
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,520
Martine.

695
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,670
Martine, you need to wake up!

696
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,540
- Honey? - Martine?

697
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,310
She vomited.

698
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,380
I-I can't wake her!

699
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,310
I'll call 911.

700
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,210
N-No. There's no time.

701
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,840
- Do you have a car? - Yeah.

702
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,450
Shaun...

703
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,900
...what's wrong?

704
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
What's wrong?

705
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,040
You called me. What's wrong?

706
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,880
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

707
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
What's -- You don't have to say the whole thing, okay?

708
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,310
Just one thing, okay?

709
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,710
One thing, My -- my brother.

710
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,180
Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now, hold on.

711
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,540
Her pulse is too weak to perfuse her organs.

712
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,220
What? What does that --

713
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,620
Jerry!

714
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,220
Please hurry.

715
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,180
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

716
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,720
She has bradycardia with hypovolemic shock.

717
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,350
- She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline... - Go!

718
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,390
...and a liter of saline.

719
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,390
- Wide open, please! - Coming through!

720
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,130
Her pulse is better. She needs an ultrasound.

721
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,590
That is it.

722
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,490
I think you got it all.

723
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,870
- You "Think"? - No. You definitely did.

724
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,040
I just can't quite believe it.

725
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,860
It was your idea.

726
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,400
You should have more confidence.

727
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,950
Nice work, Doctor.

728
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,450
There.

729
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,900
The small bowel is twisted around the superior mesenteric artery.

730
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
Martine needs surgery immediately.

731
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,760
We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.

732
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,260
N-No. Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

733
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,860
Part of Martine's bowel is dying

734
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,120
- and killing her with it. - No.

735
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,010
You cannot make these calls on your own.

736
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,660
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

737
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,520
He was very clear.

738
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,300
It's past midnight, which means it's tomorrow,

739
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,060
which means you're no longer my boss.

740
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,640
Is this the O.R. scheduler?

741
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,550
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

742
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,530
Prepare an O.R. for surgery.

743
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,940
Ten blade.

744
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,260
Ten blade.

745
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,480
I'll take it from here.

746
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,940
Nice diagnosis. I'll handle the repair work.

747
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,180
Is Stephanie okay?

748
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,970
Yes.

749
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,180
Jared had an excellent idea, and she's gonna be fine.

750
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,440
- Light. - Light.

751
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,940
Would you like me to assist?

752
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,830
Mm, pretty basic --

753
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,620
I think I can take this one on my own.

754
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,060
Go home. Get some sleep.

755
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,460
Let him stay.

756
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,740
Dr. Andrews, I believe our opinions

757
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,390
on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy --

758
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,330
That battle is lost.

759
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,890
Shaun is here, - and we have to accept it,

760
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,670
and we will treat him like any other resident.

761
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,540
Sir, it's my team.

762
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,000
And it's my department.

763
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,960
Dr. Murphy.

764
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,890
Back on suction -- congratulations.

765
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,320
I am gonna get a drink.

766
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,990
I'm way too wound up to sleep.

767
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,620
You care to join me?

768
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,810
For either?

769
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,990
Don't think so.

770
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,700
Seriously?

771
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,370
We were just part of something amazing.

772
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,310
We reached into that woman, and we healed her.

773
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,220
And you're what?

774
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,660
Cranky?

775
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,940
Maybe you could learn something from me.

776
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,750
Like what?

777
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,130
To steal credit?

778
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,100
Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?

779
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,550
No, but I fought for it.

780
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,320
I went out on a limb for him.

781
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,160
I deserve credit for that.

782
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,430
Why didn't you rat me out as soon as I brought it up?

783
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,460
It seemed beside the point.

784
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,250
No, you didn't rat me out

785
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,920
'cause you thought the idea was crazy.

786
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,670
You were letting me take the fall.

787
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,620
Is that fair?

788
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,840
My idea if it fails, but Shaun's if it succeeds?

789
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,690
But I'll tell you what --

790
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,050
I'll accept that you're right.

791
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,660
I'll apologize to the whole team

792
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,060
if you prove to me that you're not a hypocrite.

793
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,230
How am I supposed to prove something like that?

794
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,140
Our patient's about to come out of anesthesia.

795
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,080
Tell her the truth.

796
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,020
When she wakes up and hears what we did,

797
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,900
how we miraculously saved her life,

798
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,650
be honest with her -- about credit.

799
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,890
Tell her - you didn't want to do it.

800
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,150
Tell her that you wanted to send her home to die.

801
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,310
I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.

802
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,790
I heard you tried.

803
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,350
You're welcome.

804
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,610
Just a friendly warning --

805
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,760
I know you have no interest in helping Shaun.

806
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,570
You figure you'll give him a little authority,

807
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,880
he'll screw something up,

808
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,190
and then you'll be done with him,

809
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,040
and then you'll be done with me.

810
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,950
You're right about me.

811
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,740
I am getting old

812
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,580
and maybe a little emotional.

813
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,970
Maybe I over-committed.

814
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,610
But you're wrong about Shaun.

815
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,240
He's gonna handle anything you throw at him.

816
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,420
Either way, if he succeeds,

817
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,730
I'm the guy who just backed him.

818
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,820
And if he fails, I'm the president.

819
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,300
Everything went great.

820
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,170
Thank you. Thank you.

821
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,380
- Thank you. - There were complications --

822
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,990
- But I'm okay? - Yeah, but the surgery --

823
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,220
I don't care.

824
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,430
You saved me. Thank you.

825
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,330
My son's going to be here soon.

826
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,070
I told him - you said it would be okay,

827
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,560
but he flew in anyway.

828
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,790
You saved me.

829
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,240
You're gonna be a beautiful mother of the groom.

830
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:26,000
{\an9}BGM: Take Care by Beach House

831
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,530
Go on and take a bow.

832
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,620
You've earned it.

833
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,940
Why does it matter who gets credit?

834
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,190
It matters because - the people who get credit,

835
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,940
they don't have to do scut work.

836
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,700
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much. 

837
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,860
Thank you!
