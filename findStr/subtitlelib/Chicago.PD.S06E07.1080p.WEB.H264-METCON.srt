1
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,055
Twenty years ago,

2
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,144
this neighborhood
was all deep-dish.

3
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,669
Now it's flatbread and kabobs.

4
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,671
Things change.

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,021
Yeah, I hear you.

6
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,587
Welcome, brothers.

7
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:23,588
That's Akeem.

8
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,155
Welcome.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,854
America is not
the land of freedom.

10
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,988
It is the land of inequality.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,731
Minorities don't wear chains,

12
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,515
but they are still slaves

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,997
to a system
that serves the rich.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,348
The shiny toys of capitalism

15
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,481
mean nothing to Allah.

16
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:51,094
This is why Islam
is such a threat to America.

17
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,401
What they want,
what they live for,

18
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:57,535
can only be accomplished
by our elimination.

19
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,365
So that the wheels of greed
and capitalism

20
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,367
can continue to turn.

21
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:06,109
Only through Allah
will we deliver

22
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,980
the equity and the sovereignty.

23
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:12,202
So we must fight
at whatever cost

24
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:15,901
to serve the eternal truth.

25
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,816
Allahu Akbar.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,601
Allahu Akbar.

27
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:20,428
Allahu Akbar!

28
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:21,907
Allahu Akbar.

29
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,866
Allahu Akbar!

30
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,129
Allahu Akbar!

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,137
I got eyes on Akeem.

32
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,008
Copy.

33
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,151
Why are you here?

34
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,500
I came to talk to Akeem.

35
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:50,608
Wait, wait, wait!
Give him a sec.

36
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,807
Kevin doesn't have a gun.

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,417
He's got this.

38
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,637
He's not seeing visitors.

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,508
Peace, brother.

40
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,989
Relax. I'm only here to help.

41
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,077
Understand me?

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,644
Jamel.

43
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,820
What is it?

44
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:12,175
I found Abdul walking around...

45
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,177
Abdul.

46
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,136
You know this part of the mosque

47
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,528
is forbidden to you.

48
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,616
Yes.

49
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,358
Brother Akeem,
I'm terribly sorry,

50
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,794
But I have to talk to you.

51
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,187
About what?

52
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,928
I want to join the fight.

53
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,104
I can't wait anymore.

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,299
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:30,759
The bombing.

56
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:36,286
Last week at the Army
recruiting station.

57
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,766
Tell me, Abdul.

58
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,899
What is your opinion
on this action?

59
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:44,773
My opinion is
you didn't go far enough.

60
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,992
A bomb is nice,

61
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,256
but it's gotta do damage.

62
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,912
People have to die.

63
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,567
I feel your anger, Abdul.

64
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,527
But we had nothing to do
with that bombing.

65
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,315
We fight with our hearts
and minds.

66
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,143
The time is coming

67
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,711
when much will be asked of you.

68
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,756
Be patient.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,282
Be ready.

70
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,732
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

71
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,449
I tried to get Akeem
to talk about the bombings.

72
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,753
- He shut me down.
- Are you sure

73
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,780
his security guard
didn't make you?

74
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,348
Jamel just hates Americans
on principle.

75
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,481
My cover's still good, though.

76
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:41,893
All right, so stay under.
Keep pushing.

77
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,397
I don't know
what we're waiting for.

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,398
These guys already
detonated one bomb.

79
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,790
Let's bring Akeem in.

80
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,377
We don't have any evidence
he's involved.

81
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,761
The "Chicago Must Burn"
manifesto

82
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,554
was uploaded from a computer
inside that mosque.

83
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:51,816
You ask me, that's proof enough.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,668
Well, if you ask me, it's not.

85
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,932
We need solid evidence
before we move on Akeem.

86
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,718
There's too many eyes on this.

87
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,198
Another bomb threat.

88
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,286
VA Hospital.

89
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,287
You and Hailey go check it out.

90
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,158
All right.

91
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,248
Be safe.

92
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,249
What do we got?

93
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,467
So far, nothing.

94
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,836
Just like the last four
bomb scares.

95
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,731
My dogs are gonna put in
for overtime.

96
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,385
The witness who called it in

97
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,058
said he saw a guy with a beard
and a backpack

98
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,103
who looked Middle Eastern.

99
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,868
And he got a bad feeling.

100
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,411
Great, so we're chasing
bad feelings.

101
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,523
The joke is our witness

102
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,959
is here for cataract surgery.

103
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,395
He's legally blind.

104
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:42,586
Hey, are you okay?

105
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,587
Yeah, I'm good.

106
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,154
Cordon off this area,

107
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,112
I want a one-block perimeter.
Are you guys okay?

108
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,549
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

109
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,943
- I need some help over here!
- Hey, hey!

110
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:54,337
You're gonna be all right.
I got you, okay?

111
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,662
- Femoral?
- That's what it looks like.

112
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:56,750
- All right.
- I'm gonna get a doctor.

113
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,298
- Yeah!
- No time.

114
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,299
Here, give me
some pressure on this wound.

115
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,343
I'm gonna tie it off.

116
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,127
Here. Hey, hang in there.

117
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,346
Stay with us, all right?

118
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,000
- You're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

119
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,630
You're gonna be all right.
Hang in there.

120
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,483
Come on, come on, come on!
Get her up!

121
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:16,403
Get a clamp on that femoral
or we're gonna lose her!

122
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,188
You're gonna be all right!

123
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,386
Guessing that wasn't the first

124
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,690
fragmentation wound you've seen.

125
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:28,110
No. 75th Rangers. Jay Halstead.

126
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,285
Chicago PD now.

127
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,722
5th SF Group, Fort Campbell.

128
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,158
Jake Miller.

129
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,073
I know the name.

130
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,075
I've heard epic stories, man.

131
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,469
Yeah.

132
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,470
Excuse us.

133
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,471
What do we got?

134
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,777
Single detonation.

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,256
We're sweeping the premises now.

136
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,519
Trying to sort out the damage.

137
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:46,911
All right, we need to anticipate

138
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,653
secondary devices
targeting first responders.

139
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:52,656
I want you to widen and ziplock
a four-block perimeter.

140
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,180
- Nobody gets in or out.
- Gotcha.

141
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,486
Hey, Sarge.

142
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,550
Talked to a vet
named Jake Miller.

143
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:58,923
He confirmed the initial ID.

144
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,664
Bearded Middle Eastern man
with a backpack.

145
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,536
- Okay, we'll run with it.
- All right.

146
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,365
- Hey, you okay?
- It's not mine.

147
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,714
This is ground zero.

148
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,020
- Got it.
- Some kind of shape charge.

149
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,021
Little structural damage,

150
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,022
but most of the force

151
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,241
went into the monument.

152
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,938
Hit a couple
of these cars as well.

153
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,679
Bomb Squad's still
collecting forensics,

154
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,396
but it appears to be
the same type of device

155
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,466
that was used at
the Army recruitment center.

156
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,032
All right, find
surveillance video

157
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,294
and look for more witnesses.

158
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,533
Lot of windows in this building.

159
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:27,038
Somebody saw something.

160
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,476
Hank.

161
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,347
Will Graff.

162
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,523
You're a long way from D.C.

163
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,090
I'm gonna need
all your intel, Hank.

164
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,396
We'll be taking this over.

165
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,441
- It's my city.
- My jurisdiction.

166
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,835
I'll need the files.

167
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,314
Look.

168
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,404
Before you blow this up,

169
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,058
you should know
I got a man undercover

170
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:50,105
inside Akeem Dabiri's mosque.

171
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,020
Okay.

172
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,804
What's his name?

173
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:56,198
Forget it.

174
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,896
So what are you proposing?

175
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,724
We share intel.

176
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,422
We'll do the legwork,

177
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,598
you take the glory.

178
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,949
I want regular reports.

179
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,082
And, Hank, do not
screw me on this.

180
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,694
Come on, guys.

181
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,567
Bomb tech Sarah Scott.

182
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:18,631
Sergeant First Class, retired.

183
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,178
Senior NCO.

184
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,200
Made it through three tours
in Afghanistan for this.

185
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:25,314
Left behind a husband
and two daughters.

186
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,316
Witnesses?

187
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,361
Just the two vets.

188
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,060
Both saw the same thing,
a bearded man with a backpack.

189
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,149
And both said that
he looked "Middle Eastern."

190
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,586
What about surveillance
video at the VA?

191
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,196
This is all we got.

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,502
Cameras are garbage,

193
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,505
but this is our suspect
walking into the VA.

194
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,420
Labs came back on the explosive.

195
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,943
Peroxide, acetone.

196
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,903
It's highly unstable
but it's still an ISIS fave,

197
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:51,558
becauseget this...
Dogs can't smell it.

198
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,646
The bomb was on a timer

199
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,647
loaded with 16 penny nails

200
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,039
and ball bearings.

201
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,495
Same as the bomb
at the recruitment center.

202
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,738
Forensics is tracking it.

203
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,280
All right, see if anyone
in the mosque

204
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,305
is in the trades.

205
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,655
You know, framing, roofing,

206
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,134
that kind of thing.

207
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,353
Here's CTA's footage

208
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,094
at the time of the bombing.

209
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,791
Found a guy that matches
our description.

210
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,314
Gray hoodie, beard.

211
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,056
Now that's him exiting
the L at Taylor Street.

212
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,494
It's a block away
from Akeem's mosque.

213
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,775
It was 28 minutes
after the blast.

214
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,322
All right, enough is enough.

215
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,323
We know that Akeem is involved

216
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,716
so let's go pick him up.

217
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,110
I agree. Bring him in.

218
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,546
All right.

219
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,593
Jay.

220
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,333
Look, I know
these kind of cases,

221
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,205
they can bring up bad memories.

222
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,773
Sarge.

223
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,775
Somebody just died.

224
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,646
Just follow the facts.

225
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,040
All right.

226
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,827
Where was I this morning?

227
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,656
This sounds like a line
from one of your movies.

228
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,620
This is not a movie.

229
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,012
To answer your question,

230
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,711
I was leading prayers
this morning.

231
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,626
And then I took my wife
to the dentist.

232
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,671
She needed a root canal.

233
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,673
This man was seen
in the VA this morning

234
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,674
at the time of the bombing.

235
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,546
Do you recognize him?

236
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,808
Why would I recognize him?

237
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,026
Because he looks Muslim?

238
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,940
No.

239
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,289
Because we have a photo of him

240
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,813
28 minutes after the bombing

241
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,696
exiting the L station
a block from your mosque.

242
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,947
Lots of people
live near my mosque.

243
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,384
But I promise it wasn't me.

244
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,865
We didn't say it was you.

245
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,824
I don't know this man.

246
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,652
And I had nothing to do
with the bombs.

247
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,020
I find that pretty hard
to believe.

248
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,655
Why?

249
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,005
Because I exercise my right
to free speech?

250
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,615
No, because I read
your anti-American,

251
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,138
hate-spewing manifesto

252
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,488
posted the day before
the first bomb went off

253
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:39,056
at the Army recruiting center.

254
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,972
I know nothing
about any manifesto.

255
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,148
But it came
from inside your mosque.

256
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,367
Over your Wi-Fi.

257
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,848
We have the computer forensics
to prove it.

258
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,241
Your forensics prove nothing.

259
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,461
I don't control the internet.

260
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,724
Or any other people
in my community,

261
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,421
or what they do or say.

262
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:00,904
Tell us about the Gauge Park
Islamic Relief Fund.

263
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:04,255
Yeah, we ran your financials.

264
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,606
I assumed as much.

265
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,216
So what is it?

266
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,870
A charity

267
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,611
for displaced refugees.

268
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,614
Do you think we're stupid?

269
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:18,008
It's a 501c3.

270
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,143
You can look it up
yourself, please.

271
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,274
Now,

272
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:27,409
if you're going to charge me,
charge me.

273
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:31,718
If not, I'm leaving.

274
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:34,958
We should have held
onto him, Sarge.

275
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,505
Yeah, but we have no evidence.

276
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,048
Yeah, but we could have
kept him in a cold cell

277
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,726
for 47 hours
without evidence, right?

278
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,684
Relax.
We kicked the hornet's nest.

279
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,294
Now let's see how Akeem reacts.

280
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:44,687
Sarge?

281
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,123
We found another security camera

282
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,038
near the VA, outside a 7-Eleven.

283
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,737
Look, this is our suspect
walking towards the VA

284
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,390
five minutes before the bombing.

285
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:55,002
This is the suspect right after
the bombing, no backpack.

286
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,405
Did you text these pics
to Kevin?

287
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,395
Yeah, he recognizes the guy.

288
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,701
His name is Tariq Hassam

289
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,157
and I just got a match
on facial rec.

290
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,531
He works at a loading dock
in Little Kabul.

291
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,664
Hit it.

292
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,709
Hey. You the foreman?

293
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,015
- Yeah?
- We're looking for

294
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,407
one of your workers,
Tariq Hassam.

295
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,539
Why?

296
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,540
Because we're looking for him.

297
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,541
Where is he?

298
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,890
He's loading a truck.

299
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,631
Tariq Hassam!

300
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,721
Chicago PD, on the ground!

301
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,027
Chicago PD, hands in the air!

302
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,159
Nowhere to hide, man.

303
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,903
Hey, I'll get the back!

304
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,568
The target's on the roof.
We don't have eyes.

305
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,892
Right here, right here.

306
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,810
Antonio!

307
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:17,737
Antonio.
We got a problem up here.

308
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,955
Put the phone down!

309
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:23,046
Put it down. Show me your hands!

310
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,371
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

311
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,397
Come on, man.
We don't want to hurt you.

312
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:30,445
Keep your hands
where we can see them!

313
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:45,373
Allahu Akbar!

314
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:02,042
I'll take it. Thanks.

315
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,173
Got the phone.

316
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,305
Or what's left of it.

317
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,567
All right, get it to OCD.

318
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,395
Find out who he called
before he jumped.

319
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,981
It confirms he's working
with a partner.

320
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,094
No, it confirms
he made a phone call.

321
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:12,356
That's it, that's all we got.

322
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,357
Sarge, these guys
don't work alone.

323
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:14,794
Jay, I told you.

324
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,188
We're gonna take this
one step at a time.

325
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,494
So call the bomb techs,

326
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:22,018
get into Tariq's house,
scrub it.

327
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,804
I'll loop in the Feds.

328
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,573
Door's safe.
No wires, no triggers.

329
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,207
Living room looks clear.

330
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,445
All right, we're good here.
We're gonna take the lead.

331
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,557
You guys get upstairs.

332
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,560
- All right.
- Crossing.

333
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:46,042
- You ready?
- Go.

334
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,401
Clear.

335
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,450
Go, go.

336
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,768
- You got me?
- Yeah.

337
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,906
Standbypossible target
in the basement.

338
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,561
Copy that.

339
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,455
Chicago PD.
Let me see your hands.

340
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,480
Don't move.

341
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,568
Show us your hands now.

342
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,675
Everybody clear the area.

343
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,918
Possible offender with a bomb.

344
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,811
No, no, hold on,
hold on, Jay, hold on.

345
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,402
Wait, wait, wait. Hailey, stop.

346
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,466
Hailey, what are you doing?

347
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,839
We're not gonna hurt you.

348
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,798
We're not gonna hurt you, okay?
Hailey.

349
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,167
Hailey, she might have a bomb.
What are you doing?

350
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,584
Okay?

351
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:50,585
We just want to see your hands.

352
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,673
Can you put your hands up?

353
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,370
Hailey! Get out of the way.

354
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,806
Just wait. Hold on!

355
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,243
We're not gonna hurt you, okay?

356
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,244
Let me just see. Let me see.

357
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,942
Hailey.

358
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,180
It's a baby. It's a baby, okay?

359
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,727
She's just scared.

360
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,053
- Show us what's underneath.
- She's scared, Jay.

361
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,297
Hold on.

362
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,082
Okay.

363
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,956
She's unarmed.

364
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,308
It's okay. Aw, okay.

365
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,484
Okay.

366
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,017
You okay?

367
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,149
Yeah, I... yeah.

368
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:34,498
You?

369
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,674
Yeah.

370
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:37,998
We're not mind readers, Hailey.

371
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,851
We didn't know what was
underneath that burqa.

372
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,332
I know. Until we did.

373
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,682
Until we saw it was a baby.

374
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,380
Well, not necessarily.

375
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,340
She's not gonna hurt
her own child.

376
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,516
I have seen it happen.

377
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,391
I know, but you're not
in Afghanistan anymore.

378
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:58,696
Her name's Ara Hassam.

379
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,698
She's Tariq's sister.

380
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,005
Documents are good.
Not on any watch list.

381
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,486
She came from Kabul
three weeks ago to visit Tariq.

382
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,922
Interesting timing.

383
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,402
Background check looks clear.

384
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,187
You guys, I got something.

385
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,928
Jay, you know what that is?

386
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,366
Yeah, it's a NATO
service medal for valor.

387
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,194
It belongs to Tariq.

388
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:19,678
Hold on, the guy
who blew up the VA

389
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,545
has a NATO service medal
for valor?

390
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,373
I got something else.

391
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:27,508
Application to become
a U.S. citizen.

392
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:31,991
And look who the sponsor is.

393
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:38,562
Thanks.

394
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,783
Do you know who this is?

395
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,480
Yeah.

396
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,700
Yeah, that's Tariq Hassam.

397
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:48,746
We did two tours together.
He was my translator.

398
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,574
You wrote him a letter
of recommendation.

399
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,185
Yeah, I did.

400
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:53,925
Easiest letter I ever wrote.

401
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,710
Why is that?

402
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:59,627
Tariq saved more American
lives than I can count.

403
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,981
Okay, what's going on?

404
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,070
What happened?

405
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,768
We believe Tariq planted
the bomb at the VA.

406
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,858
What? No.

407
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,470
No. That's impossible.

408
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,254
I-I don't believe that
for a second.

409
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,952
The evidence is pretty solid.

410
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:24,521
Where is he now?
What, did you arrest him?

411
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,958
No, he's dead.

412
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,790
When we went to arrest him,

413
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:36,881
Tariq killed himself.
He jumped off a building.

414
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,716
If you don't mind me asking,

415
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,979
why didn't you ID Tariq
at the VA?

416
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,807
Excuse me?

417
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:54,290
You were 50 feet away from him.

418
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,466
Like I told you.

419
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,077
Okay? I barely saw the guy.

420
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,296
I just, I caught
a glimpse of the beard

421
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,124
and the backpack.

422
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,866
Not to mention Tariq is, like,
the last person on Earth

423
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,824
I would ever think would do
something like this.

424
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,478
Why, because he loved America?

425
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,827
No.

426
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,787
Because he hated extremists.

427
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,137
When the Taliban found out
that he was working for us,

428
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,010
they raped and killed his wife.

429
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:23,102
When's the last time
you saw Tariq?

430
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,843
I don't know. It was...

431
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,326
a while ago.
We kinda lost touch.

432
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,023
But make no mistake.

433
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:36,289
The Tariq that I knew
was a good man.

434
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,987
He was a patriot.

435
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,909
You buy his story?

436
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,737
Miller's? Yeah, why wouldn't I?

437
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,608
You really think
he didn't recognize Tariq?

438
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,001
A guy he did two tours with?

439
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,742
I just think he wasn't
paying attention.

440
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,309
Or he's covering for him.

441
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:58,224
He's got two Purple Hearts
and a Silver Star

442
00:18:58,267 --> 00:18:59,679
for saving the lives of a
couple downed Apache pilots

443
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,183
who were under fire.

444
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,707
He's not covering for anybody
detonating bombs.

445
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,016
They got a hit on Tariq's phone.

446
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,672
Last call is to Akeem. Shocker.

447
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,326
Now we got to find
some evidence.

448
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,371
All right, I'll call Atwater.

449
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,225
Approaching Akeem's office now.

450
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,577
All right.

451
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,319
I hope he knows what he's doing.

452
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,191
He'll signal if he needs us.

453
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:58,327
Yep. I'm in.

454
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,245
Pretty simple office.

455
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,378
Lots of paperwork.

456
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,989
Prayer books.

457
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:14,213
Got a spot for a bug.

458
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:21,002
Move and you die.

459
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:30,968
It's Homeland.

460
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:31,969
You violate our right

461
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:32,970
to free speech!

462
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,015
Our right to assemble!

463
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,364
This is America?

464
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,539
This ain't right!

465
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,064
This whole city can go to hell.

466
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,370
We gotta get him out of there.

467
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:44,373
- No, we can't blow his cover.
- Adam...

468
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:50,336
Abdul, right?

469
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,339
Tell me everything.

470
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,317
First of all, I don't even
know why the hell I'm here.

471
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,579
I told you,
I didn't do anything.

472
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,735
Yeah, we just want to
talk to you.

473
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,259
And your brothers.

474
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,999
Get me a lawyer.

475
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,653
That's not the way
it works, Abdul.

476
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,525
I need answers.

477
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,572
Slow down.

478
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,052
Doesn't have to
go down like this.

479
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,358
Turn around and face the wall.

480
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,944
You don't know what the hell
you're doing.

481
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,337
We're gonna find out
where you and your friends

482
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,405
planted the next bomb.

483
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,711
Come on, man. Listen to me.

484
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:20,627
You have three seconds.

485
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,325
Listen to me! I'm an undercover
cop for Chicago PD...

486
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:24,283
Agh!

487
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,849
Shut the hell up

488
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,286
and give me something!

489
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,896
- Hey! Hey!
- Hell is wrong with you?

490
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,245
What the hell are you doing?

491
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,899
- Who the hell are you?
- Who am I?

492
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:33,030
Stay calm. Hank, relax.

493
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:36,904
Like I said, we made a mistake.

494
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,298
I told you I got a man under.

495
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,603
You don't give me a heads up?

496
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,301
I asked who your guy was.

497
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,434
You told me to go to hell,
remember?

498
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,184
Look. We're sorry.

499
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,814
If we'd known beforehand,
it wouldn't have

500
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,319
gone down like this.

501
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,712
- Okay?
- Okay.

502
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,453
Let's move on

503
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,716
and talk about these bombs.

504
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,370
So why the raid?

505
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,459
Is there something we need
to know about?

506
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,287
We picked up some chatter
this morning.

507
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,028
Another attack is imminent.

508
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:18,380
So we hit the mosque.

509
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:19,903
Now what?

510
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,123
We're gonna talk to Akeem.

511
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,951
Do what we have to

512
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:27,215
to get him to talk to us.

513
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,698
In the meantime,
I suggest we put you

514
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:34,265
back in the cell
with the other suspects.

515
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:37,312
See if you can gather
any more intel.

516
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,663
You okay with that, Kev?

517
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,535
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

518
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:45,364
Okay.

519
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:52,196
Me and you gonna
sort this out one day.

520
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,461
Next time no zip ties,
no batons.

521
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,726
Graff interrogated Akeem
for five hours.

522
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:00,640
Didn't crack.

523
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:01,858
Claims he knows nothing about

524
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:02,859
the bomb, manifesto,

525
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:03,947
Tariq, none of it.

526
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:04,948
What about the other guys?

527
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,167
Same thing.

528
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,405
Yeah, and I got nothing
on Tariq.

529
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,387
Everybody I talked to said

530
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,866
they thought he was off.

531
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,520
Nobody actually knows him.

532
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,237
Some people said they thought
he was undercover.

533
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,481
Well, regardless, we have intel

534
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,221
that another attack
is in the works.

535
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,788
Right, Graff said
that the new threat

536
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,182
was posted online yesterday
at a Chicago public library.

537
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,986
All right, we got people
looking through surveillance

538
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,315
but so far nothing.

539
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,554
Antonio and I have been
scrolling through.

540
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:26,709
Tariq's various phones.

541
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,407
We found five or six photos

542
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,234
of Tariq and another man,
about the same age,

543
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:31,279
same ethnicity.

544
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,387
That was taken three days

545
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,803
before the first bomb went off.

546
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,022
- You run the photo?
- Yeah.

547
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,284
Came back negative.

548
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,566
But we did get a hit
on bomb fragments.

549
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,721
- Yes.
- Sixteen penny nails,

550
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:39,548
to be exact.

551
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:40,593
All right, track down

552
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,637
the specific batch number

553
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:42,899
and find the distributor.

554
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,423
Already on it.
We got the lot number

555
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,574
and delivery dates.
We're just closing in

556
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,556
on retailers in the area.

557
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,253
More witness statements
from Patrol.

558
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,908
We're wasting our time.
We know who's responsible.

559
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,171
Well, we might have
missed something.

560
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,391
Kim, Adam, split them up
and dig in.

561
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,567
Kev, I want you back
at the mosque.

562
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,090
See what you can learn.

563
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,918
You two go find Miller.

564
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:05,966
Maybe he can ID the guy
in the photo with Tariq.

565
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,187
Sherie Miller?

566
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,450
Yeah?

567
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,862
Detective Halstead
and Detective Upton,

568
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,454
Chicago PD.
We're here to see Jake.

569
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,542
Why, what's the matter?

570
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,630
Nothing's wrong, ma'am.

571
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,370
We just have a few questions.

572
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,764
Um, well, he's not here.

573
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:25,202
When does Jake usually get home?

574
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,161
That depends.

575
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:31,034
Whywhat's this all about?

576
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,341
Do you know these two men?

577
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,692
Yeah, that's Tariq
and his cousin Rafi.

578
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,302
And how do you know them?

579
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,739
Jake and Tariq served together

580
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,393
and his cousin Rafi
is visiting from Kabul.

581
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:43,917
We just had dinner last week.

582
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,702
So they still see each other?

583
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,617
Yeah, of course. Those two had

584
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,837
a pretty powerful bond.

585
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,580
The things that they saw,
that they did?

586
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:58,366
They're like brothers.
They'd die for each other.

587
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,197
That's a call to prayer.

588
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,504
Happens five times a day.

589
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,505
Makes Jake a little crazy.

590
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,029
Why is that?

591
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,900
You come home
after years at war,

592
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,423
looking for a little
peace and quiet

593
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,424
only to learn that
the very people

594
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,600
you were fighting

595
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,820
just moved in next door.

596
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,169
I get it, but...

597
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:23,043
it's not the same people.
Just the same religion.

598
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,087
Well.

599
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,088
It's easy for you to say,

600
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,351
'cause you weren't there.

601
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,744
Thank you so much for your time.

602
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,877
Will you let Jake know
that we stopped by?

603
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,835
Yeah.

604
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,840
So Miller's lying about

605
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,122
still being in touch with Tariq.

606
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,321
Yeah.

607
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:41,764
We got a hit yet
on that wholesaler?

608
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,474
The one who was selling
the nails used in the bomb?

609
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,152
Antonio was on it.
Let me call him.

610
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,370
All right.

611
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:47,546
Like I said on the phone.

612
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,373
I didn't sell it
to no terrorist.

613
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,699
I only had three sales
on that batch.

614
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,289
Just show us your video.

615
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,421
Yeah, I got it queued up.

616
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,379
Figured you guys
would be asking.

617
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:58,600
Here's the first purchase.

618
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,210
That don't look like
no terrorist to me.

619
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:03,213
Save the commentary and scroll.

620
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:07,348
Next purchase, 412.

621
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:10,873
Freeze it.

622
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,312
Thank you.

623
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,638
We'll need an expedited warrant.

624
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,074
I'll call Voight,
and have a judge lined up.

625
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,597
You tell the team we'll stage
a block away

626
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,840
from Miller's house.

627
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,769
Chicago PD, open up!

628
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,466
- Where's Jake?
- He's not home!

629
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,574
We have a warrant, ma'am,

630
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,295
if you could step to the side.

631
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,039
What the hell is this?

632
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,712
We think Jake's involved
in the bombing attacks.

633
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:48,844
- This floor is clear.
- What?

634
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,130
- Jake?
- Where is he?

635
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,871
He was here,
and then when I said

636
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,065
that you were looking for him,
he grabbed his keys

637
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,327
and he took off. Where'd he go?

638
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:55,483
I-I don't know, but

639
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:56,721
I could tell that something
was wrong.

640
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:57,703
Something's really wrong.

641
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,139
What do you mean?

642
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:00,836
Just in the way
that he looked at me.

643
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,838
The way that he...
That he said good-bye.

644
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,885
I swear I don't know
anything, but he...

645
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,191
he hasn't been okay
since he got back.

646
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,323
He needs help.

647
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:12,021
I got something.

648
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,160
You know anything about this?

649
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,009
It's for a storage trailer.

650
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,992
He rents it from our landlord.

651
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,341
What does he keep there?

652
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:28,516
He works there.

653
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,910
He flips motorcycles
to make extra cash.

654
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,235
Sit on the house.
Make sure she doesn't

655
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,695
warn him off.
He might come back.

656
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,977
I'm gonna hit up Voight,
fill him in.

657
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,567
Roger that.

658
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:39,875
Please, just promise me
you're not gonna hurt him.

659
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,749
Ma'am.

660
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:48,817
Are we really doing this
without bomb tech?

661
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,844
Damn right.
We don't have any time.

662
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,584
It's clear.

663
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,915
Okay, this is...

664
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,309
Scary as hell.

665
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,790
Yeah.

666
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,854
Acetone and hydrogen peroxide.

667
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,880
That's his cocktail.

668
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,621
He's still cooking.

669
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,755
What is all this?

670
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,977
It wasn't Akeem's call to prayer

671
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,718
that triggered Jake.

672
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,197
Listen to this.

673
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,982
"Six U.S. soldiers were killed

674
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,114
"when their patrol triggered
an IED near Lashkar.

675
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:46,637
"Lone survivor was Jacob Miller.

676
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,074
"Sunni warlords credit funding

677
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,557
from sympathetic parties
in America."

678
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:50,685
He underlined "funding."

679
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,382
Jake must think that Akeem

680
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:55,646
is funding terrorism
against American soldiers.

681
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,779
Okay.

682
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,694
Okay.

683
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,217
So where's Miller now?

684
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,958
What's the strategy here?

685
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,022
It's an end game tactic.

686
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,067
You create a false retreat.

687
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,396
You flank, you ambush,

688
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,616
and you take out
the objective yourself.

689
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,097
He's going after Akeem.

690
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,361
We gotta call Kevin.

691
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,711
Come on, Kev, pick up, pick up.

692
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,712
5021 Henry...

693
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,800
Jake Miller's involved.

694
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,062
He's on his way to the mosque.

695
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,586
You gotta get everybody out now.

696
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:25,676
Hey.

697
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,113
No phones in the prayer hall.

698
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,289
Sorry, that was my cousin.

699
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,856
The FBI are at my house
right now

700
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,094
and they're on their way here
to round us all up

701
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,815
all over again. We gotta go.

702
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,339
We should leave right now.

703
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:37,558
No.

704
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,820
We stay.

705
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,256
We have done nothing wrong.

706
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,737
Freeze!

707
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,132
Nobody move!

708
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,701
Everybody get down
on the ground now.

709
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,616
- I said down!
- Stop, stop.

710
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,270
Get down on your face!

711
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,707
Put your hands above your head.

712
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:03,192
No.

713
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,541
You!

714
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:07,544
Down on your face! Now.

715
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,830
Please tell me
someone's listening

716
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,551
over the COH.

717
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:15,988
I got 30 people in here.

718
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,641
Miller has a gun

719
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,817
and an explosive.

720
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,861
I am unarmed.

721
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,081
I need help now.

722
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:25,998
Where is he?

723
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,348
Akeem's not here.

724
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:29,847
Homeland security,
they grabbed him up.

725
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,568
He's in lock-up.

726
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:36,138
If you want Akeem, you need
to let these people go.

727
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,886
Everybody crawls
to the wall now.

728
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,149
If anybody speaks another word,

729
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,585
I press this button,

730
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,457
we all blow up together.

731
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,372
Move.

732
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,722
Move!

733
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,250
- Talk to me, Trudy.
- Mobile command just landed.

734
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,556
We're pushing out four blocks

735
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,794
and trying to clear
all these buildings.

736
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,689
- Can you make it happen?
- Yeah.

737
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:06,952
Atwater inside?

738
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,128
Yeah. We can hear him,
he can't hear us.

739
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,478
Sounds like Miller's got
the IED strapped to his body.

740
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:12,914
He's got the remote in his hand.

741
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,698
Kev won't be able
to take him down alone.

742
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,744
It's too risky.
Bomb Squad's three minutes out.

743
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,615
- Sarge?
- Yeah.

744
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,506
There's no line of sight
into the prayer room.

745
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,810
I can get us elevated positions,

746
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,229
but unless he moves
to the front...

747
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,336
No, no, no. Let me get inside.

748
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,101
I can talk to him.

749
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,407
Hang on.

750
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,601
Atwater convinced him to open up

751
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,583
a line of communication.

752
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:32,629
They're sending someone out.

753
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,590
5021, I got a hostage
coming out.

754
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,722
Get me an ambulance
past that barricade.

755
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,420
Copy that, 5021.

756
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:52,475
Hey. I got a hostage coming out.

757
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,260
It's all right. Come on out.

758
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,652
It's okay.

759
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,132
Don't worry.

760
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,786
No one's gonna shoot.

761
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,007
These guns are here
to keep you safe.

762
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,965
It's okay.

763
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,445
It's all right.
The phone's for me.

764
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:06,620
Just keep walking.

765
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:09,231
That's right. Come to me.

766
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,538
Atta kid. It's okay.

767
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:12,645
All right, just hand me
the phone.

768
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,019
Hand me the phone.

769
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,498
All right. Now get behind me.

770
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,822
Stay between me
and the building.

771
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,024
Stay between
me and the building.

772
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,895
We're gonna be fine.

773
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,637
We're okay.

774
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,814
I'm gonna take this call.

775
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:28,772
This is Sergeant Hank Voight.

776
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,818
How we doing in there, Jake?

777
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:35,475
I want Imam Akeem Dabiri
brought to me.

778
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,824
Okay.

779
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:40,567
Okay, we can talk about that.

780
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,699
But you know,

781
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,832
you know, Akeem
is in federal custody.

782
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,877
So it's gonna take some time.

783
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,184
But I'll set the wheels
in motion right now

784
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:50,707
but you gotta
work with me, okay?

785
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,493
No. You have half an hour.

786
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:54,668
That's not enough time.

787
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,061
You have half an hour!

788
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:59,673
Or I will start killing them
one by one.

789
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,022
Go around the back.

790
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,719
Lock is broke.

791
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,382
- Miller, are you there?
- It's okay, FBI.

792
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,210
Hank.

793
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,753
Man, we sure as hell
got this one wrong.

794
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,039
Yeah, and we kicked Akeem.

795
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,495
He's on his way.
You established contact?

796
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,955
- I did.
- Good. We're setting

797
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,715
a breach plan.
We'll be ready to move in 20.

798
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,046
Wait a secondAtwater
is inside with 30 hostages.

799
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,482
That's why we're moving now.

800
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:27,894
We'll give your men
a tactical plan.

801
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:31,313
Wait. The second you breach,
he'll detonate.

802
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,054
Look, we got a line of contact.

803
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,490
We got 30 minutes to get inside.

804
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,709
Not enough time, Hank.

805
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:36,884
Sir, I can get to Miller.

806
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,190
This is our jurisdiction.

807
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,452
Will.

808
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:42,890
Stand down.

809
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,152
Sarge.

810
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,719
Sarge, let me do this.

811
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,982
Atwater said the rear entrance
isn't secure.

812
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,636
- Jay.
- No, I can do this.

813
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,812
I get Miller.

814
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,817
Let me talk him out.

815
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,255
You know what happens
if you can't.

816
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:12,659
Jake? It's Jay Halstead.

817
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,488
I'm unarmed, all right?

818
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,926
Everybody face the wall!

819
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,234
You take another step,
I blow this place.

820
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:25,106
I hearl hear you, man.

821
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,805
We're working on Akeem.
That's why I'm here.

822
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,129
I gotta see proof of life, Jake.

823
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:33,027
You know how this works, right?

824
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,291
So I'm coming out, okay?
I'm unarmed.

825
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:37,945
See?

826
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:40,208
No vest.

827
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,167
I got no gun.

828
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,257
Keeping my hands raised, okay?

829
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,999
Just gotta make sure
everybody's okay.

830
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:52,177
That's good. That's good,
it looks like nobody's hurt.

831
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,719
That means you and I got a way
out of here.

832
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,136
'Cause I'm gonna be honest,
Jake,

833
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,635
things are gonna go bad
for you really quick

834
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,400
if you don't let me help you.

835
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:59,967
You bring me Akeem

836
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,796
or I drop these people
one combatant at a time.

837
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,798
Please, Jake, don't...
Don't do this, okay?

838
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,843
There is another solution.

839
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,585
You just gotta let me help you.

840
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,197
Just let me help.

841
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,287
Put the gun down.
Hand me the remote.

842
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,170
You and I can walk out
the front door together.

843
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:20,292
I promise you I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

844
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,858
Okay?

845
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:25,993
You gotta let me help you.

846
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,603
Jake.

847
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,910
Look atlook at them.

848
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:33,305
They're terrified
right now, Jake.

849
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:36,308
They're not combatants, man.

850
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,746
They're civilians, Jake.

851
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:43,489
They're citizens.
They're people.

852
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:45,795
Jake.

853
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,884
They're Americans.

854
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:50,844
You swore to protect them.

855
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,498
What are you doing?

856
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,630
That's as far as you come.

857
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:57,198
Okay.

858
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,683
What, you think I'm crazy?

859
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,685
No, no, I don't. I don't.

860
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,687
You think this is PTS,
this is...

861
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,211
trauma from the war?

862
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,345
You think I'm having an episode?

863
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:16,217
Maybe, Jake.

864
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,653
I don't think I'm over there.

865
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,003
No. I'm in my own backyard.

866
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,744
I'm standing on my soil.

867
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,050
Don't you get it, Halstead?

868
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,747
You were there! You remember!

869
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,837
These people have come
to destroy us.

870
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,535
But nobody gets it

871
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,058
because we're all too busy

872
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,277
tweeting about the president.

873
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,018
We're posting pictures
of our dogs.

874
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:38,544
You want to help me?

875
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,720
You bring me Akeem.

876
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,375
Bring me Akeem.

877
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:46,856
Buddy.
Think of your wife right now.

878
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,162
Think of your wife.

879
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,687
You bring me Akeem now,
or I kill them.

880
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,559
Please don't do this, Jake.

881
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,518
You don't think I'll do it.

882
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:57,867
Miller.

883
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,566
You are a war hero, Miller.

884
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,742
Act like it.

885
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,266
Yeah, you're damn right I am.

886
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,441
And this ends now.

887
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,670
Go. Go.

888
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:23,458
We got hostages coming out!

889
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,399
Jay, we gotta go.

890
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:59,755
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

891
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,324
Praise Allah.

892
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,936
Where the hell's your detective?

893
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,634
You knew we had
a breaching plan.

894
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:09,809
I told you to stand down.

895
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,071
Back off, Will.

896
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:13,247
Back off?
I'm gonna have his badge.

897
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,251
He defused the situation.

898
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,252
I mean, you want to report it

899
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,081
differently, feel free.

900
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:22,145
When you do, maybe I should

901
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,866
have my undercover officer

902
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,653
report the treatment
he experienced.

903
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:28,654
Or the interrogation techniques

904
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:32,832
used on Akeem Dabiri,

905
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,704
an innocent man.

906
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:39,882
And he's right over there.

907
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:44,060
Maybe we should talk to him.

908
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,149
Just let it go.

909
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,196
Take the win and walk away.

910
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,862
Hey. Give you a ride home?

911
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,516
I'll buy you a beer.

912
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,908
Thanks, I think I'm just...

913
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,867
Yeah, I know you
want to be alone,

914
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,914
but this is just
part of the thing, so.

915
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,135
What thing?

916
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:17,006
It's a thing that works

917
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,140
between us. Bad case.

918
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:23,099
One of us doesn't want
the other one around.

919
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:25,537
The other one stays anyway.
We talk.

920
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,888
We feel better and we're able
to go to work the next day.

921
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,630
It works.

922
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,417
I screwed up, Hailey.

923
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:40,073
It didn't even occur to me
that Miller could be involved.

924
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,118
If it's on you, it's on me too.

925
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,251
No, you had a bad feeling.

926
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:48,690
I couldn't even see it.

927
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:52,912
A lot of horrible things
happened when I was overseas.

928
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,304
And I know I can't just, like,

929
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,959
flip a switch and turn that off.

930
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:59,571
But I do the work.

931
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:05,272
You learn to deal with
the triggers and the stress.

932
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:08,449
The war was a part of my life.
It's not who I am.

933
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:12,410
Not anymore.

934
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,282
I just had no idea
I had any anger.

935
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:19,068
Or bias.

936
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:23,029
You just saved 30 lives.

937
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:26,598
Thirty Muslim lives.

938
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:29,470
That's a good day.

939
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,994
Don't be so hard on yourself.

940
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,871
Thanks.

941
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:44,050
Buy you a beer?
