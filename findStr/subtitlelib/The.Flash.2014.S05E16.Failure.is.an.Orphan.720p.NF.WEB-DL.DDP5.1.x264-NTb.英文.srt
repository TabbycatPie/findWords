17
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,380
The cure is finished, and it works.

18
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,060
Now we can use it on Dwyer,

19
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,100
and then his connection to the dagger will be broken.

20
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,120
What's wrong?

21
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,180
The timeline.

22
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,130
I've charted this timeline from Anthro the First Boy

23
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,570
to Kamandi the Last.

24
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,670
I know all of it.

25
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,400
I know its crests, I know its valleys,

26
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
I know what we must do to defeat Cicada.

27
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,130
Or rather, I knew.

29
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,790
This is a photo of the last public sighting

31
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,080
of Flash and Cicada.

32
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,790
Their final confrontation.

33
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,320
Dad's last chance to use the cure on Cicada.

34
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,110
I've been trying to engineer a moment like this

35
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,260
the whole time I've been there.

36
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,290
Now, watch.

37
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,370
See this?

38
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,350
That is a new timeline struggling to break through,

39
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,920
manifesting itself right before our eyes.

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,060
Is it a good timeline, or is it a bad timeline?

41
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,800
That doesn't matter.

42
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,030
What matters is it's new and, as such, unpredictable,

43
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,920
and we may lose our window of opportunity.

44
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,480
So we need to find Cicada before the timeline changes.

45
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,720
Why did it change?

46
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,680
Did I screw something up?

47
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,560
No.

48
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,360
No, no.

49
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,210
You've done very well, little runner.

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,000
But a new variable is coming, something big is coming.

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Or someone.

54
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,070
Well, it's interesting that you say that, sir,

55
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,780
since it's your company that's denying

56
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,690
the Robertson family's claim.

57
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,180
Yes, of course, I have the contract right in front of me.

58
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,530
And it says that animal attacks

59
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,480
do not fall under Acts of God,

60
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,270
and that includes gorillas.

61
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,300
The Citizen looks forward to your statement.

62
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,620
Thanks, babe.

63
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,620
Are you ready to do this thing now?

64
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,340
Hell yeah, we just got to find Nora.

65
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,630
It's her big day after all.

66
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,110
You don't think she's too busy, do you?

67
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,940
Okay, people, think!

68
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,820
We haven't seen Cicada since the rooftop fight,

69
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,890
which means the only way to track him down is to figure out

71
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,660
who his next meta-human target's gonna be.

73
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,040
Have we double checked every bank robbery,

74
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,090
every lab break-in?

75
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes, yes! We have looked at all of that, all right?

76
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
And all the criminals that are in custody

77
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,390
are simply mere mortals.

78
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,540
What about the ones on the street?

79
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,270
Frost says that no new metas have shown up

80
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,800
since Norvock went into WITSEC.

81
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,080
Are the satellites tracking for dark matter

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,660
or meta-gene bursts or Element X?

83
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,410
Yes, yes, and yes.

84
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,410
They're scanning for everything.

85
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,560
Congratulations, you raised a menace.

86
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,490
Your daughter, so energetic.

87
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
This is pretty impressive.

88
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,960
Um, and I... and I know with the cure working,

89
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,970
we're all ready to put Cicada to rest,

90
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,770
but I'm sure he'll resurface soon.

91
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,800
And then you're going to give him the chance

92
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,100
to take the meta-human cure?

93
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,690
Yes, exactly.

94
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,660
Even Dwyer deserves a choice,

95
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,360
we just got to convince him to do the right thing.

96
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,200
Are you ready?

97
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,480
This is gonna be one of the biggest challenges

98
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,010
of your career as a hero.

99
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,330
Do you know what you're going to say?

100
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
Oh, yeah... you know, yeah.

101
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,480
I've... I've got some loose thoughts.

102
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,350
Oh, great.

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,500
Well, that instills all of us with confidence, right?

104
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,120
Loose thoughts? What are you going to say?

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,530
"Hey, most bloodthirsty enemy! Stop."

106
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Guys, it worked for Marlize.

107
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,450
Maybe not so much for Savitar, but...

108
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,220
I will figure out what to say to him, all right?

109
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,210
I got this.

110
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,530
I know you do, Dad.

111
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,110
Which is why we need to try everything to try and find him.

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,820
Okay?

113
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,210
Maybe we should go on patrol?

114
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,570
- Patrol, you say? - What this is, World War II?

115
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
Wow, this is crazy.

116
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,720
There is something nuts going on at Jitters.

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,740
Do you think it's a meta-human?

118
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,000
- Probably. - You should...

119
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,220
- We should check it out. - Yeah.

120
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,220
- For sure. - Yeah.

121
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
- Y-yeah. Go! - I'm...

122
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,930
- You two did this. - You made her.

123
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,840
You are responsible.

126
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,660
Well, well, well.

127
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,690
It is nice to see someone back at his desk.

128
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,140
Oh, hey, Foxy.

129
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,590
It's good to be back.

130
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,850
After three months of sipping Wally's Tibetan butter tea,

131
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,030
I actually kind of missed this break room coffee.

132
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,460
Hey, you have any idea where I can get my hands

133
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,500
on the Cicada task force file?

134
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,290
Babe, you're standing in it.

135
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,250
What?

136
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,350
I've been trying to catch up on what I've been missing.

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,450
Uh, speaking of which...

138
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,870
you ever seen this woman?

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,050
Uh, Dr. Vanessa Ambres.

141
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,430
Born and raised in Central City,

142
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,480
got her MD from McNider U.

143
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh, that's interesting.

144
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,010
This says she treated Orlin Dwyer and Grace Gibbons

145
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,170
on the night of the Enlightenment.

146
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,390
Yes, and she has been treating Grace ever since,

147
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,230
even though she's an ER doctor,

148
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,710
and the nurses report a whole slew of drugs missing

149
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,730
from the coma ward.

150
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,250
You think she's working with Dwyer?

151
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,010
The guy got stabbed, struck by lightning.

152
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,140
He's got a hole in his chest.

153
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,270
Somebody has got to be patching him up, right?

154
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,760
I think we should be asking the doctor a few questions.

155
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,240
All right, let's do it.

156
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,600
Oh, you want to come with?

157
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,040
- Yeah, I want to come with. - What?

158
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,090
Uh, yeah, yeah.

159
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,800
- Yeah! - All right, partner.

160
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,610
- Partner. I like that. - Yeah.

162
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,540
Okay, I thought something big was supposed to be going on down here.

163
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,580
Oh, I don't know. It's pretty big.

164
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,140
Feast your eyes on the newest addition

165
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,660
to the Jitters menu.

166
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,820
The XS-presso.

167
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,150
I got my own drink!

168
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,310
It's pretty schway, right?

169
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,570
Think of what could be next.

170
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,030
An XS action figure? XS Day?

171
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,880
Guys, you are embarrassing me.

172
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,830
We're just really excited.

173
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,240
I mean, we still haven't even gone on a trip together

174
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,170
or made Grandma Esther's famous sweet potato pie recipe.

175
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,090
Did you put karaoke on the list like I asked?

176
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,730
I think so, actually.

177
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,370
- Just a sec... - Let me see this.

179
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,340
Okay, there are so many things on this list.

180
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,990
Well, I mean, we've got time.

181
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,020
Okay, is that a real alert or another fake one?

182
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,720
No, this one's real.

183
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,110
M-20 at CCU, Chemistry Department.

184
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,210
- A meta attack. - Yeah, let's go. Come on.

185
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,260
Been a while since high school chem,

186
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,920
but that does not look like proper lab safety.

187
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,670
I need this! Leave me alone!

188
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,770
Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes any acid.

189
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,990
You have the cuffs?

190
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,870
Let's go get him.

191
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,460
- We don't need to. - What?

192
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,790
Look at this burn mark.

194
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,020
That acid guy, he... he must've been there

195
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,330
when the photo was taken.

196
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,340
What are you talking about?

197
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,840
Dad, today's the day you stop Cicada.

198
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,730
Slow down. Say that again?

199
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,130
There's a photo, it's in The Flash museum, of Flash and Cicada...

200
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,070
the last time they were ever seen

201
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,670
confronting each other in public,

202
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,570
and in the photo, by Flash's feet,

203
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,150
the exact same burn mark left by the meta

204
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,120
that we just fought.

205
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,990
This acid meta was at their final confrontation?

206
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,950
He must be Cicada's final target.

207
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,750
His final target before I vanish

208
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,890
and he starts killing again.

209
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,900
Why is Nora just telling us

210
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,540
about this crucial meta now?

211
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,930
Because a lot of the stuff from my timeline is unreliable.

212
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,960
You know, uh, different metas, different victims,

213
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
different circumstances.

214
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
But this time, everything's exactly the same.

215
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,680
So far.

216
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,850
If Cicada goes after this acid meta,

217
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,690
that means that today's the last day

218
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,880
we're going to confront him.

219
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,620
And our last chance to stop him.

220
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,720
Yeah, all right, well, then, I gotta figure out exactly

221
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,660
what I'm gonna say to him.

222
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,610
You'll find the words, Dad. I'll help you.

223
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,210
And I am going to start working on facial rec

224
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,740
for this Acid Master.

225
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,970
Yup, that's what I'm going with.

226
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,300
Always trust your gut, kids.

227
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,050
And we'll figure out a way for you to talk to Cicada

228
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,190
without him killing you.

229
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,790
Well...

230
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,020
if it all works out, then...

231
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,320
looks like today could be the end of our journey.

232
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,760
Yeah.

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,010
And I guess everyone starts moving on.

234
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,060
- Nora. - Oh, hey, Mom.

235
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,340
Um, look, I've really gotta hurry and go help Dad.

236
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,250
Yeah, I know, it's just...

237
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,280
I guess you might be going home tomorrow.

238
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,590
Yeah, I guess so. Um, mission accomplished.

239
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,240
Well, if you two need a break after a while,

240
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,030
Papa Joe taught me the famous West family right hook.

241
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,260
I-I would love to teach you.

242
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,290
- Nora? - Sorry, uh, sorry, Mom.

243
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,560
I just, uh, thought of something

244
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,540
that's going to help Dad... I-I got to go.

245
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,090
Babe, this is a first!

246
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,980
We've worked together before.

247
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,350
We have, Detective,

248
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,660
but anytime we did anything even close to this,

249
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,020
I didn't have my abilities.

250
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,380
Okay, here we go.

251
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,870
Uh, if I fiddle with my ring, you know,

252
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,480
assume that means she's lying

253
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,590
and then you just get in there and, mm, mm,

254
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,280
do your thing.

255
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,230
You cop it up.

256
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,950
Prednisone, sirolimus, abatacept.

257
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,130
All drugs classified as immunosuppressants.

258
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,980
They also happen to have all been reported stolen from this facility.

259
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,370
I'm aware of the report.

260
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,170
What I'm wondering is

261
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,630
why it warrants the interest of the DA?

262
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,420
We believe that the missing medications

263
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,150
are connected to a much higher profile case.

264
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,190
Orlin Dwyer.

265
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,390
Grace Gibbons' uncle.

266
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,890
Is he still at large? I don't really watch the news.

267
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,980
Yes, he's very much at large.

268
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,930
And we have reason to believe that those exact medications

269
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,220
are the ones that Dwyer would need to treat his injuries.

270
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,730
What are you saying exactly?

271
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,260
The records of the stolen meds

272
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,440
continued after Dwyer stopped visiting the hospital.

273
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,050
Which means that someone here

274
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,860
may be still supplying them to him.

275
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,400
Sounds like a good theory,

276
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,300
but I don't know who that could be.

277
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,710
Everything I know is in those reports.

278
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,990
Okay, okay.

279
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,500
That's enough for now.

280
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,710
Thank you very much for your time.

281
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,570
Of course.

282
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you doing?

283
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,020
You're just gonna let her walk away like that?

284
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,880
I-I didn't want to scare her.

285
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,470
We don't have enough evidence.

286
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,810
We don't even have a motive.

287
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,450
So, then, let me keep doing my thing!

288
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm not used to going into an interview

289
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,450
factoring in your meta-abilities.

290
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,300
I-I'm used to going in using my gut.

291
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,220
What about my gut?

292
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,940
All due respect, this isn't about your gut.

293
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Look, Cecile, what I meant to say was...

294
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, Joe.

295
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,930
You said exactly what you meant,

296
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,310
and you know what, right now,

297
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm about to say something that I mean.

298
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,390
Maybe we shouldn't be working on this together after all.

299
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,240
Oh, man.

300
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,920
Okay, the clock's ticking,

301
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,980
and we have no clue how to convince Cicada

302
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,880
to take the cure,

303
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,870
but we still have our best weapon.

304
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,980
- Your journal. - Your legacy.

305
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,700
One of the biggest things history remembers

306
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,240
about The Flash is your ability

307
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,360
to change people's hearts and minds,

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,770
especially your enemy's,

309
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,700
and I have dozens of entries about those times.

310
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,170
Any chance you've got the future words

311
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,540
I say to Cicada in there?

312
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,040
Nope, but I have your past words.

313
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,610
Magenta, she wanted to drop an oil tanker on a hospital,

314
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,710
but you convinced her she was a good person.

315
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,580
You said, "Use that good to beat the bad."

316
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,850
Magenta had split personalities.

317
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,720
She literally had a good side and a bad side.

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,550
That's not gonna work with Cicada.

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Leonard Snart,

320
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,330
he said he didn't want to be saved

321
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,720
and you still found a way to convince him to save himself.

322
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,950
"There's a part of you that knows

323
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,160
you don't have to let your past define you."

324
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,130
Except Snart had already worked with us at that point.

325
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,750
Killer Frost, you dared her to kill you.

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,970
"Come on, live up to your name, Killer Frost!"

327
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,300
- And what did she do? - Nora.

328
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,880
Amunet, Plastique,

329
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,380
the list goes on and on.

330
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,790
Nora, all... all of these times are... are different.

331
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,580
Cicada doesn't even care if he lives

332
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,940
when this is over.

333
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,910
What am I supposed to say that he'll care about?

334
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,280
You'll know.

335
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,550
The Flash always knows.

337
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,660
So, when you think about it, an anti-dampening array

338
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,370
is the way to stop him in his tracks.

339
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,550
Sherloque, are you happy to be going home soon?

340
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,830
Of course I'm happy to go back.

341
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,180
I just feel that...

342
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,540
somehow there's more work to be done here.

343
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,610
I think he's, uh, talking about his lady friend.

344
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,810
You know, I have a bit of experience with these, uh,

345
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,410
long-distance relationships.

346
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,160
I got one word for you. Holo-cube.

347
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,120
These things work wonders.

348
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,440
And I request that you stop speaking possibly forever.

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,550
I can deduce from your conversation when you came in

350
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,900
that you have indeed tracked down Cicada's next target

351
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,270
but do need help facilitating the conversation

352
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,640
between Cicada and The Flash.

353
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Correct? Yes? Oh, good.

354
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,700
Come with me and I will give you the solution.

355
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,210
When did you figure it out?

356
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,420
I will miss you both very much.

357
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,310
But you will miss me more! Allez!

358
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,630
Philip Master!

359
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,190
We good?

360
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,660
Yes, Philip Master is secure in the pipeline.

361
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,490
Wait, Acid Master's real name is Philip Master?

362
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,420
This is it. Just like in the photo.

363
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,620
The last confrontation between Flash and Cicada.

364
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,990
Oh, what's the matter?

365
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,620
You don't have one of these?

366
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,420
Bye-bye.

367
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,640
Cicada!

368
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,860
How long does he have?

369
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,320
He has to hold that dagger for 60 seconds, maybe less.

370
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,310
Flash better figure out what he's going to say fast.

371
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,090
He will. I know he will.

372
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,720
I don't want to fight.

373
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,500
We have a cure.

374
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,830
What are you talking about?

375
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,310
We have a way to cure meta-humans.

376
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,490
We have a way to take their powers away.

377
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,100
We want you to take it.

378
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,540
And why would I agree to do that?

379
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,640
Your legacy.

380
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,490
I know how this ends.

381
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,700
You keep killing,

382
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,470
and you're remembered as a monster, not a hero.

383
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,100
But we can change that together,

384
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,860
you can have a different legacy.

385
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,930
You just have to choose it.

386
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,120
I don't give a damn about my legacy.

387
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,870
That was it. That was our last chance.

388
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,960
We ran citywide facial recognition scans

389
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,590
and scanned for dark matter signals

390
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,770
from Cicada's dagger.

391
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,870
That was our last shot at confronting Cicada.

392
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,710
We don't know that.

393
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,510
We're changing the timeline.

394
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,460
That photo that Nora saw at the Flash museum,

395
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,440
it could be different now.

396
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,050
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

397
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,380
After all... the timeline is malleable.

398
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,780
I just don't understand why our plan didn't work.

399
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,730
Yeah, you guys did everything right.

400
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,740
The only reason it didn't work

401
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,360
is because I couldn't convince him.

402
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,290
Dad, you're the Flash.

403
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,460
When the Flash speaks honestly from his heart,

404
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,920
people listen.

405
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,810
Not all people.

406
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,730
Let's keep searching.

407
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm gonna check the Cicada files at CCPD.

408
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,900
See if I missed anything.

409
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,230
Nora.

410
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,670
We just... we just need to create

411
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,670
another window of opportunity, okay?

412
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,760
Dad couldn't convince Cicada to take the cure.

413
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,770
He just... he just needs to find the right words.

414
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,040
Bare.

415
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,010
What are you doing here so late?

416
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,990
We hit a wall at S.T.A.R. Labs tracking Cicada.

417
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,710
Thought a change of scenery would help, but...

418
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,730
Keep your head up, man.

419
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,270
We'll find him. We always do.

420
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,260
Honestly,

421
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,870
I'm more worried about what happens when we do.

422
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,310
Our whole plan depends on me being able to convince Dwyer

423
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,550
to just take the cure.

424
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,330
The last time I tried...

425
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,190
I don't think I've ever struck out so hard.

426
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
Wow, that's saying a lot

427
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,830
considering your track record at the plate.

428
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,060
Wait, what exactly did you say to him?

429
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,970
That he was creating a legacy of fear,

430
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,450
one that would go down in history,

431
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,550
but that we could work together to change that.

432
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,850
That sounds like something the Flash would say.

433
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,470
Well, I am the Flash.

434
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,830
Look, that man's a zealot.

435
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,820
He sees you in that suit

436
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,110
and all he sees is the thing he hates.

437
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,330
Meta-human, superpowers,

438
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,030
the thing that took his niece away from him.

439
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,910
He can't see past the Flash,

440
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,380
but what he doesn't know...

441
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,920
There's a whole lot more to you than that.

442
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,530
Be more Barry Allen. Human.

443
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,040
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,020
Thanks. I'm gonna dive back in.

445
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,180
I'll let you get back to running down Ambres.

446
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,190
Actually...

447
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,020
me and Cecile ran into a wall ourselves.

448
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,680
We are... uh, she... like, working together.

449
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,100
I mean, ever since she got her powers,

450
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,790
it's like she's a human lie detector.

451
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,510
How is that a bad thing?

452
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,560
You know I've always prided myself

453
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,770
on being able to read people, right?

454
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,520
But Cecile and these powers, I mean, she puts me to shame.

455
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,790
Well, you just got to remember that you guys are a team.

456
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,530
That makes her strengths your strengths

457
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,700
and yours hers.

458
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,550
So if you let her do what she's great at,

459
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,790
it's only going to create more room

460
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,330
for you to do more of what you're great at too, right?

461
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,540
Well, damn.

462
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,070
You're getting real good at these pep talks, Bare.

463
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,020
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

464
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,830
Hey, Nora.

465
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,650
Hi, Nora.

466
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,370
Yeah.

467
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,920
Do you want to turn that down a little bit?

468
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,790
Oh, sorry.

469
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,480
What are you listening to?

470
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,420
Sped-up archives of the Flash's comm recordings.

471
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,140
I thought that if I listen to his best appeals,

472
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,520
I could figure out what exactly worked so well.

473
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,920
And did you?

474
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,720
No, not yet.

475
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,780
But if I run the transcripts through the computer,

476
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,670
I can extrapolate recurring key words

477
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,330
from his most successful appeals

478
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,760
and create a sort of "Best of Speeches" Speech.

479
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,690
Well, um,

480
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,690
why don't you let your dad think about it

481
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,010
and we could go to the rooftop of Jitters.

482
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,670
It's a great place to clear your mind,

483
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,400
plus it's got the best views of the city.

484
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,160
You want to go sightseeing? Right now?

485
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,140
What... is this from that list of yours?

486
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,600
Well, yeah, but...

487
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,860
All day I've been trying to figure out a way to stop Cicada

488
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,720
and all day you've been trying to pull me away.

489
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,050
Why are you pushing this list?

490
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,310
I mean, it's just the last time

491
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,380
that we may get to spend together.

492
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,980
Nora, I mean, once we stop Cicada,

493
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,040
you'll go back to your time and...

494
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,300
Us like this together will end.

495
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,780
Mom, it doesn't end.

496
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,460
We have our whole future together.

497
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,710
Yeah, for you it'll feel like no time has passed

498
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,320
but for me, it'll be decades before I...

499
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,560
see you like this again.

500
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,070
Uh, no, it's okay.

501
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,960
Um, I will catch up with you later.

502
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,330
Joe.

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,580
What's going on?

504
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,040
Why'd you want me to meet you here?

505
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,280
Look, I know the last time we tried to work together

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,020
went a bit south.

507
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,080
Oh, a bit?

508
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,730
You're right. I'm sorry, Cecile.

509
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,000
I let my pride get in the way,

510
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,430
and I didn't lean on your strengths

511
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,920
when I should have.

512
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,410
But you know me,

513
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,930
I'm not a man who makes the same mistake twice.

514
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,230
So...

515
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,600
Would you do me the honor

516
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,210
of joining me in this interrogation?

517
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,350
You do what you do best, I'll take care of the rest.

518
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,720
Get 'em, girl.

519
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,230
Detective. DA.

520
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,680
This is starting to border on harassment.

521
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,710
I have told you everything I know.

522
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,470
That's not true.

523
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,780
We know that you've been funneling meds to Orlin Dwyer.

524
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,770
Well, if you knew that,

525
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,320
then I'd be arrested and not sitting here.

526
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,120
Let me correct myself.

527
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,050
We have a strong hunch,

528
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,810
but I bet if we were to go through

529
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,150
the video camera footage from the hospital,

530
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,450
we'll find proof that you were assisting Dwyer.

531
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm a doctor.

532
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,110
I mean, why would I condone a vigilante murderer?

533
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,480
Because of what happened to Darius.

534
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,700
Darius.

535
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,850
It hurts you to even think about it.

536
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,500
My fianc¨¦  was killed by meta-humans

537
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,600
during Zoom's rampage.

538
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,360
So, yes, it hurts to think about him.

539
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,400
Hurt enough for you to help Dwyer kill other meta-humans?

540
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,320
Correct me if I'm wrong,

541
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,600
you took an oath to do no harm, right?

542
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,950
Can you truthfully say you've upheld that oath?

543
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,210
That guilt that you feel right now?

544
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,870
There's a way to make up for it.

545
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,450
All you have to do is help us find Orlin.

546
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,330
What, so... so you can put him in jail? Kill him?

547
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,180
No, so we can cure him.

548
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,710
It's not possible.

549
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,630
Maybe not with the medicine you've been giving him,

550
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,390
but S.T.A.R. Labs has created a treatment

551
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,780
that turns metas back into normal human beings.

552
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,920
I can't take you to him.

553
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,750
Okay, okay, then help us set up a meet.

554
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,650
Look, Dr. Ambres, it's clear.

555
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,440
You've come to truly care for Dwyer.

556
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,920
So we're asking you now...

557
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,230
help us save his life.

558
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,830
I can make contact, and I can share the location.

559
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,480
I have rounds in an hour

560
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,270
and patients that I can save tonight.

561
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,530
So am I free to go, please?

562
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,670
I love my job.

563
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,690
I can stay here all night.

564
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,250
And we will, unless you tell us

565
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,420
what you're keeping hidden right now.

566
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,400
Yo, yo. I got your text. You talked to Ambres?

567
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,100
Cecile and I together got through to her.

568
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,130
She's going to show us where to find Dwyer.

569
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,630
Joe, that's amazing.

570
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,970
Yeah, Ambres told us something else.

571
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,790
Dwyer's niece, Grace? She's a meta.

573
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,270
So le petit Dwyer is a meta.

574
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,880
Wait, I thought we scanned Grace for meta powers

575
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,060
when Nora entered her brain.

576
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,220
We did but that was back when her DNA was 100% human.

577
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,780
Her powers must have activated

578
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,340
in just the last few weeks, right?

579
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,770
Yeah, Ambres told Joe that the wound in Grace's head

580
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,860
recently started glowing and mutating.

581
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,560
Now all we need to do is get Dwyer to listen to you, again.

582
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,360
Killer Frost can put him on ice from the neck down.

583
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,070
Better yet, I can re-sequence the Speed Force Bazooka

584
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,500
- to overload him with negative tachyons. - Yes.

585
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,830
- Absolutely. - So that he's stuck there...

586
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,110
Tachyon, shmack-yon. No, no.

587
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,250
La Machine  ¨¤  M¨¦moire!

588
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,760
We could go inside Dwyer's mind.

589
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,720
- Oh, about that... - Guys...

590
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,540
- No, La Machine  ¨¤  M¨¦moire! - Last time? I think...

591
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,680
Guys, hey!

592
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,310
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

593
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,770
but I think we need to take a different approach.

594
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,900
No powers, no crazy plans.

595
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,470
The Flash can't convince Cicada to stop this,

596
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,320
but... maybe...

597
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,270
I can.

598
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,450
Dad's back.

599
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,750
He says Papa Joe's got news about Dwyer.

600
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,650
Okay, good. I guess we should get over to the Cortex.

601
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,170
You know, I had a list too.

602
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,860
Your wedding, Auntie Jenna's baby shower,

603
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,270
Jitters, The Enlightenment.

604
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,810
Those were all the moments in time

605
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,480
you wanted to go back and see us?

606
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,400
Yeah, so I could have memories and experiences

607
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,800
with all of you.

608
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,430
I get it.

609
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,250
I should've been sensitive and I-I'm so sorry.

610
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,270
- It's okay. - No, it's not.

611
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,120
I was so focused on making sure Flash beat Cicada,

612
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,650
I forgot what I was supposed to really be focused on.

613
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,580
You and Dad.

614
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,480
You're the reason I came back to this time,

615
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,510
not fighting big bads or getting my own XS-presso.

616
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,630
So that I could spend time with my parents.

617
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,600
My family.

618
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,280
I don't know how much time we have left together

619
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,820
or how much of your list we're going to get done,

620
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,670
but from now on, every moment we have left,

621
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,820
we're going to make it a memorable one.

622
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,170
I promise.

623
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,430
Well, I guess we can cross off "Hugging while drinking tea"

624
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,580
- off our list. - Yeah.

625
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,450
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

626
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,260
- No, it's fine. - We were just...

627
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,940
We were just talking about Mom's list.

628
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,740
Um, so I heard Dad has a lead on Dwyer?

629
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,090
We have a location.

630
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,690
I'm going to head there any minute.

631
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,600
Does Flash know what he's going to say this time?

632
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,070
Actually, I think I'm just gonna talk to him,

633
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,790
father to father.

634
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,250
That's a really good idea, Dad.

635
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,980
Hey, Doc.

636
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,040
Dr. Ambres told us where to find you.

637
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,800
I just want to talk.

638
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,350
There's no more talking.

639
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,750
Every time one of you metas comes near the rest of us,

640
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,190
good people get hurt.

641
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,950
This is what you all deserve.

642
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,590
Does that include Grace?

643
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,090
Ambres hasn't told you.

644
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,000
Grace. She's a meta.

645
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,940
The night the satellite crashed,

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,030
she was hit with a piece of shrapnel inflected with dark matter.

647
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,560
That's... that's why she's in a coma,

648
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,660
and now it's changing her.

649
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,250
That's a lie.

650
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,730
And that's why Ambres told us where to find you.

651
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,000
She's afraid.

652
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,350
She's afraid you're going to do the one thing you can't come back from.

653
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,250
I know how much you care about Grace.

654
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,200
You're trying to make the world a better place for her.

655
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,820
She didn't choose to be a meta,

656
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,470
but she is.

657
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,990
Does that mean she deserves to die?

658
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,980
No.

659
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,270
I would never hurt Grace.

660
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,620
Then you'd let her grow up in a world of fear.

661
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,440
Where there's someone out there hurting people like her.

662
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,670
The cure, it will heal Grace and you.

663
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,170
And why should I believe you, Flash?

664
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,140
Because I'm a father too.

665
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,330
My daughter, I love her more than I ever thought possible.

666
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,380
I would do anything to make the world

667
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,480
a better place for her.

668
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,260
And I think you would too.

669
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,630
So do it.

670
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,320
We made an arrangement.

671
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,580
We cure him and then Grace.

672
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,700
Okay.

673
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,300
Why are we here and not at a hospital?

674
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,420
We have to be sure that the cure is successful.

675
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,380
We created it.

676
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,420
We're the ones who know how it works.

677
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,140
Once administered, the cure will take 60 seconds

678
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,950
to eliminate the meta-human powers in your system.

679
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,120
That means the wound in your chest will then open.

680
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,700
You'll need me to suture it shut

681
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,870
so you don't bleed out.

682
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,020
Why not Doc Ambres?

683
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,630
She's being held for questioning.

684
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,310
No, it's Ambres, or we're done.

685
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
All right, we'll get her.

686
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,810
If anything goes wrong,

687
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,740
or if you're lying to me,

688
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,020
I'll kill every...

689
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,570
last...one of you.

690
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,120
And we're certain everything in this room is sterile?

691
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,500
Of course.

692
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
Everything except that.

693
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,380
That thing's not negotiable.

694
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,870
That rage of his, it's...

695
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,020
Joe, I can't.

696
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,580
Are you going to stay?

697
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,220
Uh, yeah, just in case.

698
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,810
- Okay. - All right, babe.

699
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,990
Good job today.

700
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,620
You too. Partner.

701
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,850
We never could have done this without you guys.

702
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,610
Well, I'm glad it worked out,

703
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,110
but when this is over, he's going to jail,

704
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,910
for a long time.

705
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,830
Okay, one fresh serving of piping hot meta-human cure.

706
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,520
I'm just supposed to trust that that thing works?

707
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,390
Has it gone through any human testing?

708
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,150
It's gone through giant shark testing.

709
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,920
It's a long story.

710
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,910
It's okay, Doc.

711
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,010
I wanted to tell you the truth about Grace.

712
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,370
I just couldn't find the words.

713
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,670
You were just trying to keep her safe.

714
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,450
I'll always be thankful for that.

715
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,120
See you on the other side.

716
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,630
There we go.

717
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,700
Injecting the cure.

718
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
His vitals are spiking.

719
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,160
How can we tell if the cure is even working?

720
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, it's working.

721
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,810
My powers are back.

722
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,310
Which means Dwyer's powers must be gone.

723
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,180
It appears your sojourn into the past was a success.

724
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,530
Congratulations.

725
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,820
Thank you.

726
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,800
You as well. It's your, uh, 38th Cicada?

727
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,040
That's right, yes.

728
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,180
38th Cicada. Trente-huit Cicada.

729
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,300
Alley-oop!

730
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,430
But, of course, there's some business here

731
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,610
that remains unfinished.

732
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,870
For instance, how did you know before you saw the burn marks

733
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,570
in the photograph that it was a meta-human

734
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,530
that would lead us to Cicada?

735
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,350
Uh, I...

736
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,390
You know, I just had this feeling

737
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,250
that something big was coming.

738
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,350
They're working on him now.

739
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,590
I will be so happy when this is all over with.

740
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,890
What's going on?

741
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,960
What happened to the power?

742
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,360
I have no idea.

743
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,330
I should check the Med Lab.

744
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,590
- Someone's coming. - Who?

745
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,880
Cicada?

746
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,610
Where's that coming from?

747
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,390
Cisco!

748
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,000
- Hold on! - Iris.

749
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,400
- Careful. - I can't see anything.

750
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,320
Here.

751
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,220
Cisco, we need power.

752
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,400
We got a much bigger problem.

753
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,780
Cicada?

754
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,930
How the hell did that happen?

755
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,450
I don't know, but he's coming here and he looks pissed.

756
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,920
We have to move now.

757
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,270
I've got to keep patching him up.

758
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,390
Stand back.

759
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,010
There.

760
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,520
- He's in the hallway. - Get the hell out of here.

761
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,120
Iris! Get down!

762
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,280
Come on!

763
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,350
Who are you?

764
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,990
Please, whoever you are.

765
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,410
I only came here to make him human again!

766
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,270
I helped him!

767
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,160
Please!

768
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,360
Please don't do this!

769
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,720
Nope. They're all toast.

770
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,650
Well, better the computers than us.

771
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,670
- Joe. - Are you okay?

772
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,160
- I'm okay, I'm okay. - I'm a little bruised, but...

773
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,250
Everybody else?

774
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,310
Yeah, we're okay.

775
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,730
- Guys... - Dr. Ambres didn't make it.

776
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,010
There's no sign of them anywhere.

777
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,720
I don't understand what happened.

778
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,100
I mean, we got Dwyer, we gave him the cure.

779
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,950
If... if Cicada doesn't exist anymore, who was that?

780
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,390
Someone worse.

781
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,840
I've missed you.

782
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,560
Uncle Orlin.
