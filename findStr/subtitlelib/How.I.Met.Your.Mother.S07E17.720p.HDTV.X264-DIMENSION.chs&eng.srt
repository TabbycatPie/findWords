1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,009
孩子们 我永远不会忘记
Kids, I'll never forget the first time

2
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:05,679
我第一次跟你们妈妈表白
I told your mother I loved her.

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,697
那是在纽约的一个雨天
It was a rainy day in New York.

4
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,049
我们刚吃过一顿巨难吃的午饭
We just had a horrible lunch.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,017
要看的电影又没座了
The movie we wanted to see was sold out,

6
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,102
我只是看着她
and I just looked at her

7
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:15,004
说出了 我爱你
and said, "I love you."

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,423
坦白心迹对我来说其实挺难
It was a big deal for me.

9
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,025
我很久没跟女孩表白了 自从
I hadn't said that to a girl since...

10
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,811
我爱你 罗宾
I love you, Robin.

11
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,363
我认真的
I'm serious.

12
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,317
你还记得当初我们怎么分开的么
Do you remember why we broke up in the first place?

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,618
我们问彼此 今后五年
We asked each other, "Where do you want

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,770
想去哪里呢”
to be in five years?"

15
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,989
我们的答案有着天壤之别
And our answers were just too different.

16
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,357
你看 五年过去了
Well, it's five years later,

17
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,544
现在我们在哪里呢
and where are we?

18
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,379
我们还站在这个
Standing on the roof

19
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:42,198
我初次吻你的屋顶
where I kissed youfor the first time.

20
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,303
我知道这挺不容易接受的
I know this is a lot to process,

21
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:48,472
我不是要给你什么压力
so no pressure here.

22
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:52,058
只是问问 你怎么想的呢
Just... what do you think?

23
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,544
啊 我说 你也累够呛啦 大半夜的
You know what? You're exhausted, it's late.

24
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:55,545
咱去挺尸吧哈
Let's just go to sleep.

25
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,713
晚安哈
Well, good night.

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,985
尼玛我干了些什么啊
What the hell was that?

27
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:03,487
没事 我可以弥补
Okay, I can fix this.

28
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,707
我偷偷去野营的时候
I-I was just temporarily insane because of my Lyme disease,

29
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,712
被虱子叮了 得了莱姆病 
which I got on a camping trip that I didn't tell her about

30
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:17,751
所以 所以我刚才突然抽了
because... I go camping in secret.

31
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,586
绝了
Perfect.

32
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,671
或者我就说 对不起 咱还是好朋友
Or I could say, "I'm sorry, we're great as friends.

33
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,290
刚才那些就当我没说过”
Let's just forget I ever said anything."

34
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,291
唔 这个听着好点
Yeah, that's probably better.

35
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,376

我是说 我的情绪还混乱着呢
I mean, it's been 24 hours of emotional mayhem,

报道马勒斯尼沙狂欢节 她兴奋坏了
asked her to go to Moscow to cover Maslenitsa.

56
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:31,357
不过 当她发现这是个年度牛油节的时候
She was less thrilled to discover

57
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,243
她就没那么兴奋了
Maslenitsa is the city's annual butter festival.

58
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,746
更宓氖 她得在那呆整整一礼拜
Even worse, she'd spend an entire week with all those

59
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:40,400
跟那些油乎乎的俄国人还有她的致命敌 帕特里斯

Oh, God, where's my cough syrup?

73
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:07,794

You're gonna make it.

87
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,099
哥们 泰德总得有点界限吧
Man, Ted really needs to work on his boundaries.

88
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,218
嘘 你俩真心吵啊
Shh, guys, seriously.

89
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,488
你怎么在我俩床上啊
Why are you in our bed?

90
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,741
我坐着醉鬼列车 正好被困在这了
I took the drunk train and got stuck out here.

91
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,227
哎呀呀 宿醉好难受啊

我预感接下来的的话我一点也不想听
Okay, I already know I don't want to hear this.

97

你说如果我们爱爱了

00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,242
预感很对 一点不想听
Yeah, I was right. I don't want to hear this.

99
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:15,261
我非常非常的神勇
...and I did a really good job...

100
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,512
请滚蛋
Please leave.

101
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:20,416

那有没有可能 这货就会变成我的种呢
...that I could turn that into my baby?

102
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,751
我觉得我要吐了
I think I'm gonna throw up.

-晨吐吗  -显然不是
-Morning sickness?  -No.

104

你还记得
Do you remember back

108
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,931
圣诞节的时候她情绪低落 你都不知道原因是啥
at Christmas when she was upset, you didn't even know why,

109
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,401
就花了8个小时准备圣诞的灯光
<i>and you spent eight hours setting up Christmas lights</i>

110
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,269
在公寓里等着 就为了让她高兴起来
<i>in the apartment just to cheer her up.</i>

111
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,438
这是精神基友应该做的 精神基友
That was a platonic friend thing. A platonic friend thing?

112
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,157
真的么 泰德 让我问你一个问题
Really? Ted,let me ask you a question.

113
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,909
你会为我那么做么
Would you have done that for me?

114
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,745
你也许会的 你就是这么好的一个朋友 泰德
You probably would have.You're such a good friend, Ted.

115

就是 我走了以后
Just, while I'm gone,

118

不要乱翻我们的东西
don't go snooping around in our stuff.

119
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,223
我知道你认为我们有一盘春宫带藏在某个地方
I know you think we have a sex tape hidden somewhere,

00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,693

又是罗宾
Robin again?

125
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,412
为什么每个人前仆后继的追罗宾
Why does everyone keep going after Robin?

126
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,948
为什么就没有一个人中意老娘呢
How come no one ever takes a run at me?

127
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,316
巴尼每天都在追你
Barney hits on you every day.

128
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:29,252
对 不过他就是想和我滚床单

可恶 莉莉 你为什么总是跟我对着干
Damn it, Lily, why are you rooting against me?

153
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,349
我不是跟你对着干

154
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,100
不 你就是

marshall bets lily that if ted goes bald, he'll totally pull it off

163
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:15,808
额滴神呀 他们把我们的生活作为赌局
My God! They're placing bets on our lives.

164
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,028
不好意思 泰德秃顶是不可能帅的
And I'm sorry, Ted cannot pull off bald.

165
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,813
你们认识泰德  我是对的吧
You know Ted. I'm right about this.

166
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:27,319
泰德 我是你的好朋友 我为什么要跟你对着干呢

莉莉赌 泰德和罗宾最后不会走到一起
Lily bets Marshall that Ted and Robin won't end up together.

169
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,518
所以 莉莉打赌我和罗宾不能走到一起
<i>So, Lily was betting against me and Robin.</i>

170
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:39,811
我还不知道

171
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:42,097
好吧 你想和罗宾一起么
Okay, you want to make it work with Robin?

172
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,232
你应该让她知道你的存在
You need to stay on her radar.

173
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,184
给她打电话
Call her right now.

174

176
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,324
当飞机着陆时 她打开手机

发现信箱里满是你的信息
she turns on her phone

178

179
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,425
泰德 不要给她留语音信息
Ted, don't leave her any voice mails.

180
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,000
为什么不
Why not?

181
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,484
因为 因为你应该去俄罗斯
Because...Because you need to go to Russia.

182
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,869

所以我应该带她去红场散步
So I just walk up to her in Red Square

188
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:18,667
再带一束玫瑰

189
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,302
或者乘着我的热气球
Or float down to her

190
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,054
降落在她的面前
in my hot air balloon

191
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:25,357
带着十束玫瑰
with ten dozen roses!

192

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,345
不是这样
Not like this.

195
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:34,682
我先回去下 我还要写一些十四行诗
If you'll excuse me, I've got some sonnets to write.

坐下 泰德 你会想听这个的
Stay put, Ted. You're gonna want to hear this.

伙计们 这是啥
Guys, what's this?

198
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,857
马修和莉莉开始解释了
<i>And Marshall and Lily explained.</i>

199
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,843
这是从十年前开始的
<i>It all started ten years earlier.</i>

200
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:46,678
他们在寻找一个爱好
<i>They had been looking for a new hobby</i>

201
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,413
作为夫妻可以一起分享的爱好
<i>they could do as a couple.</i>

202
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,032
我已经错过了新手课程
I already missed the beginner's lesson.

203
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,634
也许我不该去
Maybe I shouldn't even go.

204
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,053
啊 不管了
Ah, screw it.

205
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,472
我看过奥运会的 我知道怎么滑
I've seen the Olympics. I know what I'm doing.

206
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:59,674
我滑雪去喽 衰人们
I'm going skiing, bitches!

207
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,855
他必然会摔断腿
He's gonna break his leg.

208
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,323
他不会的
He's not gonna break his leg.

209
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,908
我赌20刀他会
20 bucks says he does.

210
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,547
莉莉和马修打赌
"Lily bets Marshall

211
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,451
说泰德会在滑雪时摔断腿
that Ted will break his leg skiing."

212
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:33,024
你们绝对不会相信的
You would be amazed.

213
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:36,027
从缆车上掉下来的人可多了
People fall off ski lifts all the time.

214
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,746
呃 上厕所去也
Well, I gotta hit the head.

215
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:48,022
好吧 断的不是腿
Well, he didn't break his leg.

216
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,258
其实 我想说的 呃
Yeah, I gotta say that, um,

217
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,645
打赌赢钱让我感觉
making money off this bet just makes me feel...

218
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,246
从没这么年轻过是吧
More alive than you've felt in years?

219
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,265
正解 新爱好
Yes! New hobby!

220
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:01,786
我们需要一个钱箱 一些亮片和胶水
We need a cash box, some glitter and some glue!

221
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,322
你们一直在拿我们打赌吗
You've been betting on us?

222
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,241
好像我们是一堆在某个
Like we're a couple of hobos

223
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,792
二逼高富帅的后院里
fighting over a sandwich

224
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,278
抢三明治的流浪汉
in some psycho preppy kid's backyard?

225
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,664
才不是 这不过是婚姻的产物
No, this is just what happens in marriage.

226
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,631
你会觉得无聊
You get bored.

227
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,333
找不到事情做
You run out of things to do.

228
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:16,784
我们都到做模型的地步了
We were making models.

229
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,503
你们这些老光棍在外面
You single people are out there

230
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:20,922
整天喝酒睡女人
with the drinking and the sleeping around...

231
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,257
飞机模型
Model airplanes.

232
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,458
郎情妾意 跨凤乘龙
The grinding and the bumping

233
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,294
玉体横陈 香汗淋漓
and the hot sweaty bodies.

234
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,629
还有会转的小螺旋桨
...with little propellers that spin.

235
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,565
诶 这个蛮有意思的
Oh, this one looks interesting.

236
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,633
莉莉 我以为你说你想要的
Lily, I thought you said you wanted to.

237
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:33,852
你的主意啊
It was your idea.

238
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:37,238
我节食一周就为了可以上镜
I starved myself for a week to get camera-ready.

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
你早餐时吃了个熊掌面包啊
You had a bear claw for breakfast.

240
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,242
对啊 就一个熊掌面包啊
Yeah, <i>a</i> bear claw.

241
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,477
我 我改主意了
I-I changed my mind.

242
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:47,481
我不想让巴尼看到我们那啥
I-I just don't want Barney to see us doing it.

243
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,284
巴尼永远不会发现的
Barney is never gonna see this.

244
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,485
算了吧 巴尼是大神啊
Oh, come on. It's Barney.

245
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:54,339
他终归会看到的
Eventually, somehow he's gonna see it.

246
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,523
想赌吗
Want to bet?

247
00:10:55,525 --> 00:11:00,378
这么说 还真有黄带啊
So there really is a sex tape.

简单的说 这些长期赌局
Anyhoozles, just... long-term bets,

249
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,273
就是我们犯二的时候打的

250
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,507
你怎么样啊 泰德
What about you, Ted?

251
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,676
发型不错哟
Your hair's looking good.

252
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,229
莉莉和马修打赌说泰德和罗宾
"Lily bets Marshall that Ted and Robin

253
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,781
最后是不会在一起的
won't end up together."

254
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,951
好嘛
Wow.

255
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:25,570
这么一来就水落石出了
So now it's becoming clear why...

256
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:28,122
你们这样极尽可能的毁掉我未来的幸福
you've been trying to sabotage my future happiness.

257
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,541
就他妈为了赢一个赌
To win a bet.

258
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,708
算了吧 泰德
Come on, Ted.

259
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,827
这个赌我们已经打了很久了
We made that bet so long ago.

260
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,748
而且 兄弟啊 这个赌真是太让人抓狂了
And boy, it's been a real nail-biter.

261
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,217
泰德和斯黛拉都订婚了
Ted and Stella got engaged.

262
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,385
给钱
Pay up.

263
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,870
还没定论呢
Not yet.

264
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,871
我们正在驱车前往婚礼现场哦
We are driving to the wedding.

265
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,206
给钱
Pay up.

266
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,208
再等等
Not yet.

267
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:51,012
我们就在婚礼现场哟
We are at the wedding.

268
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,046
给钱
Pay up.

269
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,714
还没完
Not yet.

270
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:58,836
擦
Damn it.

271
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,688
我真是不敢相信
I can't believe you guys!

272
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,940
我被人丢在神坛
I got left at the alter,

273
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,775
而你们关心的就只是个破赌吗
and all you cared about was some stupid bet?

274
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,527
我一直都支持你 但我……
I never stopped rooting for you, but I...

275
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,529
泰德 我从来没有跟你唱过反调
Ted, I'm not rooting against you.

276
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,865
我就是觉得罗宾不适合做你妻子
I just don't think Robin's the girl you marry.

277
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,534
这就是我最初打这个破赌的原因
That's why I made the stupid bet to begin with.

278
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,670
我想说 没错 都过去五年了
I mean, yes, it's five years later,

279
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,538
你还没有找一个人安定下来
and you haven't settled down with anyone else,

280
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,525
但是你和罗宾也没有往这方面靠啊
but you haven't settled down with Robin, either.

281
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,877
这里面一定有原因的
There must be a reason for that.

282
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,762
到底哪里不对劲
What's standing in the way?

283
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,438
上帝啊
God...

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,524
如果你帮我找到黄带
if you help me find this sex tape,

285
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,860
我将洗心革面 重新做人
I am going to make some changes in my life.

286
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,362
我再也不沾花惹草
I am going to stop sleeping around,

287
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,148
再也不酗酒 不搞恶作剧
quit drinking so much, no more shenanigans.

288
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,818
我将全心全意 尽我所能
I am going to devote my entire life

289
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,538
行善布施 赞美汝名
to doing good deeds,and praising your name.

290
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,773
你要找的是这个吗 巴尼先森
Is this what you're looking for, Mr. Barney?

291
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,127
不用了 兄弟 找着了
Never mind, bro. Found it.

292
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,881
我找到了
I found it!

293
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:03,084
伟大的耶稣安拉毛主席啊 我找着了 泰德
Sweet glory hallelujah, I found it, Ted.

294
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,453
你是我认识的唯一一个还有录像机的二货
You're the only idiot I know who still owns a VCR,

295
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,121
所以恭喜 你赢得了唯一一张
so you are the lucky winner of the

296
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:09,623
和我一起围观我们最好的朋友们
"Who gets to sit next to me and watch our best friends

297
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,726
欲火焚身走火入魔”奖券
go bananas all over each other"" sweepstakes.

298
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,812
向老掉牙的视频神器致敬
To the outdated viewing device!

299
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,764
然后我终于明白了我和罗宾
And then I realized why Robin and I

300
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,233
五年了还没有复合的原因
hadn't gotten back together in the last five years.

301
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,486
噢 我的天啊
Oh, my God.

302
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,338
罗宾爱的人是你啊
Robin's in love with you.

303
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,810
我之前居然都没注意到
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

304
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,510
罗宾一直爱着你
Robin is in love with you.

305
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,946
不 相信我 她没有
No, she's not. Trust me.

306
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,414
不 她爱你
Yes, she is.

307
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,599
你们之间发生了什么
Something happened between you guys.

308
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,251
导致你和诺拉分手
That's why you broke up with Nora.

309
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,104
那天晚上 我见你在她房间里
That night, I saw you in her room,

310
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,723
房间里有玫瑰花瓣 蜡烛
there were rose petals, candles...

311
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,525
你看见了
You saw that?

312
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,644
那你估计还看到
Well, then, maybe you also saw

313
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,647
花瓣和蜡烛统统被丢进了垃圾袋里
those rose petals and candles going into a garbage bag.

314
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,866
接着巴尼告诉我发生的一切
And then Barney told me everything.

315
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,485
他和罗宾的一夜情
How he and Robin hooked up.

316
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:01,571
他为了罗宾和诺拉分手
How he broke up with Nora to be with her.

317
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,658
他想着罗宾也会为他做同样的事情
How he thought she would do the same for him.

318
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,411
罗宾是如何伤了他的心
How she broke his heart.

319
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,966
她选择了凯文
She chose Kevin.

320
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,469
我是非常伤心 但我想
It hurt, but...

321
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,087
他们是相爱的吧
I guess they're in love.

322
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,522
他们昨晚分手了
They broke up last night.

323
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,674
可惜
Bummer.

324
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,977
管他呢 咱先拿马修和莉莉的性爱录像带打些赌吧
Anyway, let's make our own bets about this sex tape.

325
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,430
我说马修身上肯定有一处穿孔
I've got Marshall with a surprise piercing

326
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,898
赔率5:1
at five-to-one odds,

327
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,567
莉莉修剪过"着陆区"赔率10:1
Lily with a landing strip, ten-to-one,

328
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,436
马修修剪过"着陆区"赔率1:1
Marshall with a landing strip, even money.

329
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,938
我才不信这鬼话
I don't believe this.

330
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,440
你爱过罗宾
You were in love with Robin,

331
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,658
现在你知道她分手了 你的反应就是"可惜"
you find out she's single, and your reaction is "Bummer"?

332
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,776
那你想让我说什么 泰德
What do you want me to say, Ted?

333
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,446
我以为我们之间有什么
Whatever I thought was there,

334
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,232
她却不这么想
she thought differently.

335
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,118
所以说...不 罗宾现在单身不关我什么事
So... no, I don't care that Robin is single again.

336
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,005
这样的话 如果罗宾跟别人恋爱 你不介意吗
So if Robin started dating someone else, you wouldn't mind?

337
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,090
不
Nope.

338
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,759
就算和她谈恋爱的那个人是我
Even if that somebody else was me?

339
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:59,846
就算和她谈恋爱的那个人是你
Even if that somebody else was you.

340
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,698
--真的吗 --真的 
Really? Really.

341
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,867
嘿 哥们比娘们重要 对吧
Hey, bros before hos, right?

342
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,503
无论罗宾伤我多深
No matter how mad she made me,

343
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,122
她永远是我哥们
Robin's still my bro.

344
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,041
如果 呃 你能让她开心的话
And if, uh, you make her happy,

345
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,676
我也会开心
then that makes me happy.

346
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:17,230
巴尼 你知道吗 你真的长大成熟了
Barney, you've really grown up, you know that?

347
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,698
谢谢
Thanks.

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,284
现在来看咱们俩朋友的性爱录像带吧
Now let's watch our two best friends have sex on tape.

349
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:22,869
我去做爆米花
I'll make the popcorn.

350
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,205
别看那盘带子
Don't watch that tape!

351
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,124
要看那盘带子
Watch that tape!

352
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,691
诶呀 不好意思 我就是想赢得那个赌注
Well, sorry, I just really want to win the bet.

353
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,360
现在 放映开始
And here we go.

354
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,796
好好好 好吧 巴尼
O-okay. Okay, fine, Barney.

355
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,965
看我们有点淫荡的家庭录影吧 但你可先听好了
Watch our dirty little home movie, but be forewarned,

356
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,300
在一分钟那儿
at about the one minute mark,

357
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,169
你会看到我做这个表情
you're going to see me make this face.

358
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,140
天啊 那是咱骑摩托车时
Oh, God, that's the face you made

359
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,474
-你脸上的表情 -是啊
the day we rode motorcycles. Yeah.

360
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,926
是啊是啊 你真想看吗
Yeah. You really want to see that?

361
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,645
而且 你想听我发出这个声音吗
A-and do you want to hear me go, uh...

362
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,218
不可能是这个声音 不可能
It can't sound like that. It can't.

363
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,987
我认得那个声音 我隔着墙听到过
I know that noise, I've heard it through the walls.

364
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,572
我以为哪个邻居养了只病猫呢
I thought the neighbors had a sick cat.

365
00:15:58,574 --> 00:15:59,739
好吧 巴尼 你可要知道
Okay, but, Barney, just remember,

366
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,691
你也会看到好多这个
you'll also be seeing a lot of this:

367
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,027
喔耶~~  喔~~ 耶~~
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

368
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,745
就像这样 但那时我没怀孕
It's this, but I'm not pregnant.

369
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:09,082
我皮肤跟大象的一样 松垮垮的
My skin is loose, like an elephant.

370
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,368
我的咪咪又大又活泼
My boobs are perky and plump.

371
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,453
我的呻吟犹如一条蔫不拉几的老狗
I slobber like a confused old dog.

372
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,789
-我打我自己的屁股  -我打我自己的屁股
I slap my own ass. I slap my own ass!

373
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,745
巴尼
Barney...

374
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,014
那是哥的录像机
that was <i>my</i> VCR.

375
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,132
泰德
Ted...

376
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,351
那不过是一台录像机
it was a VCR.

377
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,024
一周后 罗宾回来了 我去机场接了罗宾
A week later, I picked Robin up at the airport.

378
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,316
她给我讲了俄国之行的很多事情
She told me all about her trip.

379
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,236
接着我带她去她最爱的饭店吃饭
And took her out to dinner at her favorite restaurant.

380
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:51,274
夜晚将尽时 有一件事算是清楚了
And by the end of the night,one thing had become clear:

381
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,627
我们两个不会有结果 是吧
It's not going to happen, is it?

382
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:56,379
抱歉
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,467
是因为巴尼
It's because of Barney.

384
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,935
什么
What?

385
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,470
才不是
No.

386
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,921
巴尼和我  我们
Barney and I... we...

387
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,058
不  不  就是
No. No. It's just...

388
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,411
你知道 最近的事情太疯狂了
You know, things have just been so crazy lately.

389
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:15,966
我生命中的一切都那样  不稳定
Everything in my life is... unstable.

390
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,152
在为数不多的事物中 只有你是我可以依赖的
I mean, you're one of the few things that I can count on.

391
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,806
我真的不想把这一切都搞砸
And... I really don't want to mess that up.

392
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:28,028
我们...  我们还有那个约定 是吧
We-we... we still have our deal, right?

393
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,648
如果我们都...在40岁的时候还单身的话
If we're both still...single when we're 40?

394
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,816
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,622
不 对不起 罗宾
No. Look... I'm sorry.

396
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,624
我 我不能守着那个约定了
I-I can't do that anymore.

397
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,343
只要那扇门还开着一点点
As long as the door is even a little bit open,

398
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,629
我就有这感觉 我就想着
I have this feeling that I'll just be...

399
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,266
等下去 等到你40岁 看我还能不能和你在一起
waiting around to see if I win the lottery when you turn 40.

400
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,053
我想你明白你现在对我的感觉
I think you know how you feel about me now,

401
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,957

我觉得 时间不会改变这一切
and... I don't think time's going to change that.

402
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,843
请告诉我
Just tell me.

403
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,612
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

404
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,637
不爱
No.

405
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:19,963
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,831
我们做朋友挺好的
We're great as friends.

407
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,999
让我们
Let's just...

408
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,701
忘了刚刚我说的话吧
Let's just forget I ever said anything.

409
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,643
酒吧 你自个 马上
Bar. Alone. Now.

410
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,095
这只是路上的一个小障碍而已
It's just a bump in the road.

411
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,730
你们注定要在一起的
You guys are meant to be together.

412
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,098
你可不能放弃啊
You can't give up.

413
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,382
你们还是有可能的啊
You... i-it can still happen.

414
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,483
没可能了 马修
No. Marshall...

415
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,102
要不你试试带着十束玫瑰
What about the hot air balloon thing,

416
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,853
乘热气球那招
with the ten dozen roses?

417
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,655
-还有你那首十四行诗写得咋样了 -老兄
-And how's the sonnet coming, buddy? -Dude.

418
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,074
你打赌押错对象了 别挣扎了
You bet on the wrong horse. Let it go.

419
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,560
不管你信不信
Believe it or not,

420
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,278
我对这事儿还有点开心
I'm happy about this. I'm...

421
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,331
我终于可以继续往前看了
I can finally move on.

422
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,833
这可是件好事
This is a good thing.

423
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,002
真的
Really.

424
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,408
嘿 罗宾
Hey, Robin.

425
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,876
- 嗨 
-Oh, hey. - Hey.

426
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:09,078
嘿 我差点都忘了 这是莉莉的吹风机
Hey. Uh, look, before I forget,here's Lily's hairdryer.

427
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,598
我好像都借了几百年了
I borrowed it, like,a million years ago.

428
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,099
没事 你留着用吧
Yeah, you can keep that.

429
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:14,434
呃 是这样的
Um... Hey, listen,

430
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,085
泰德告诉我了你们的事儿
Ted told me what happened with you guys,

431
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,854
他还说 他能够平静的接受
and he says that he's at peace with it.

432
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,589
噢 是吗
Oh, really?

433
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,141
挺好的
That's good.

434
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,926
他说谎了 罗宾
He's lying, Robin.

435
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:27,313
他只是想表现得很坚强 但他还是很难受
He's trying to be strong,but it's killing him,

436
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,233
所以 作为他最好的朋友
and so, as his best friend,

437
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,202
我必须告诉你
I have to say something that...

438
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,537
他太爱你了 以至于说不出口
he loves you just way too much to say.

439
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,224
你得搬出去了
You gotta move out.

440
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,379
我知道
I know.

441
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,749
Shake It Out- Florence+The Machine

442
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,749
所有的食尸鬼都出来玩耍
? And all of the ghouls come out to play ?

443
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,387
所有的恶魔都想要他的鲜肉
? And every demon wants his pound of flesh ?

444
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,457
但是我更愿意独自保留些东西
? But I like to keep some things to myself ?

445
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,678
我更愿意保持坚强
? I like to keep my issues strong ?

446
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,533
黎明之前总是最黑暗的
? It's always darkest before the dawn ?

447
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,354
我曾是一个傻瓜 我也曾盲目
? And I've been a fool and I've been blind ?

448
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:12,242
我无法把过往抛在身后
? I can never leave the past behind ?

449
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,327
我看不到路
? I can see no way ?

450
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,997
我看不到路
? I can see no way ?

451
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,734
我总是拖着马四处游荡
? I'm always dragging that horse around ?
