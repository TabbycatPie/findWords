1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,620
Thank you for flying JetBlue.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,290
Welcome to Las Vegas.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,950
Here you go, here you go.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,810
That was quick.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,970
You skip the line when you're on the excelsior level.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,490
Three rooms adjoing, top floor.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,490
Silver, pretty.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,780
Platinum, so don't wave that around everywhere.

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,020
People'll get jealous.

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,060
Maybe wa it around a little.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,830
My friend Burt Tanner runs the hotel.

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,350
He comped us a few rooms

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,860
because we sold him some closets

14
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,410
for his high-roller suites.

15
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,470
Zebrawood, heated sock drawer,

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,560
the works.

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,880
Hey, luxury bathroom,

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,770
it's me, lowly closet.

19
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,260
Watch your back.

20
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,770
Mitchell?

21
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,360
Langham?

22
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,540
Hey, Cam,

23
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,450
I-it's Langham and Tim!

24
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,200
What are you boys doing here?

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,440
Bachelor-party weekend.

26
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,560
We're getting married in June.

27
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,410
What?

28
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,020
Oh, we really wanted to invite you,

29
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,770
but Tim's family is huge --

30
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,400
Relax. We're getting married in May

31
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,560
and you're not coming, so...

32
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,650
Mitchell.

33
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,320
Oh, look at us moving on.

34
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,060
It's almost like you never dumped me in an e-mail

35
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,300
the morning after I told you that I loved you.

36
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,900
Well, y-- in my defense, e-mail --

37
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,920
it was new back then...

38
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,900
...and it was still a blurry line

39
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,340
as to what was appropriate and...

40
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,760
Well, we have a pretty packed weekend.

41
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,070
Oh, we do,but if you guys have some time,

42
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,060
here's our itinerary.

43
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,180
- Okay.  - Come play.

44
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,960
- Oh, yeah.  - Fun. Bye.

45
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,060
- You guys, congratulations.   - Thank you.

46
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,010
Oh, my gosh,

47
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,120
an actual gay agenda.

48
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,930
Looks like we're not gonna see much of you two this trip.

49
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,900
- No. - No, no.

50
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,690
We are not participating in any of this.

51
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,520
They're very judgy about bachelor parties.

52
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,770
I offered to throw them one,

53
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,180
and I got a whole lecture.

54
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,540
We're 40. We have a child.

55
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,890
We've been together for 10 years.

56
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,780
That's the one.

57
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,310
It's just not who we are anymore.

58
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,110
Listen to this -- "Bananas and cabanas pool party."

59
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,180
- Oh, Cam.  - Yeah.

60
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,760
"Most creative speedo

61
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,710
wins tickets to the kilty pleasures."

62
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,650
- No!  - Please.

63
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,000
What is the kilty pleasures?

64
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,230
This.

65
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,830
We will be maintaining our dignity in the spa, thank you.

66
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,410
I mean, come on,

67
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,060
have you ever seen a scottish person this tan?

68
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm embarrassed even looking at it.

69
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,480

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,020
It's like my mom's hugging my feet again.

76
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,460
I'm gonna go do some shopping.

77
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,050
Oh, well, maybe we'll catch up later.

78
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,320
No, you have your day,

79
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
I'll have mine.

80
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,070
Well, how 'bout the bar at like 5:00?

81
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,060
Sure.

82
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,830
She was icing me,

83
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,490
but I deserved it.

84
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,880
For the first time in my whole life,

85
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,140
I was neglecting her.

86
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,380
I'd been invited to audition

87
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,550
for a secret magic society in Las Vegas,

88
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,400
but in all my rehearsals,

89
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,040
I'd paid no attention to Claire.

90
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
I even left her alone in a movie theater once.

91
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,150
Oh, no.

92
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,000
I let Phil think I was still mad at him

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,930
because I needed a little time to myself.

94
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,280
Come to mama! Yeah!

95
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,010
Years ago, Phil and I put aside money

96
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,540
for a trip on our 25th anniversary,

97
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,650
but I lost that money on

98
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,610
a girls' weekend in vegas.

99
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Since then, I've been on a secret mission

100
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,810
to win that money back,

101
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,480
and if things go well this weekend,

102
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,220
I am even.

103
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,640
Vegas, you have a gambling problem,

104
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,300
and her name is Claire.

105
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,890
Knockity-knock-knock.

106
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,110
Mr. Dunphy, I presume?

107
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,410
Yes. Who-- hi.

108
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,180
I'm Leslie Higgins

109
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,310
it's a boy's name where I'm from.

110
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,030
I'm your butler.

111
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,220
Oh. Butler. Cool.

112
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,610
Yes. As an excelsior guest,

113
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,590
uh, I'm at your beck and call 24/7.

114
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,900
Anything you need, big or small, I can

115
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,170
Can I just segue, sir,

116
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,960
to the importance of discretion in my job?

117
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,530
I'll just pop those --

118
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,010
Oh, no, no, no. Never mind those.

119
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,620
- As you wish.   - They're for an appointment I have later.

120
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,480
The less you know about that, the better.

121
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,830
A myriad of apologies, sir.

122
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,920
If there's nothing else...

123
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,610
Oh, hang on.

124
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,490
Actually, do you know where I can get a cape laundered?

125
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,510
Opera or superhero?

126
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,320
I'd rather not say.

127
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,910
I overstepped the mark by asking.

128
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,700
Uh, could I just, uh, quickly point out

129
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,320
our luxury bath service, sir?

130
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,660
We have five outrageously decadent baths

131
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
that I can prepare for you at a moment's notice.

132
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,900
Uh, I should just point out, though,

133
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,210
that our Pharaoh's Fantasy does take a dash longer,

134
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,430
normally, because our Nubian lives off-site.

135
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,510
Um...if there's nothing else,

136
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,360
I'll just help you with your case.

137
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
Uh, no, uh --

138
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,200
- I'll get that.  - Yeah.

139
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,880
All right. Thank you.

140
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,080
- I love cucumber water.  - I know.

141
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
- If I were president   - I know, I know.

142
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,780
Cucumbers in the reservoirs.

143
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,540
Giant cucumbers.

144
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,190
Mr. Pritchett?

145
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,880
Yes, hi.

146
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,760
All right, I'll see you in 90 minutes.

147
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,400
- Enjoy.   - Thank you.

148
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,430
Mr. Tucker?

149
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,290
Mr. Tucker?

150
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,770
We had a few no-shows for the Britney concert, so...

151
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,170
One, please.

152
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,470
Uh, what about Mitchell?

153
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,730
It's Vegas -- he doesn't need to know what I'm doing.

154
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,170
I don't need to know what he's doing.

155
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,040
So if you see him,

156
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,250
maybe don't mention what I'm doing.

157
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,180
Oh. Understood.

158
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,030
So, do you have anything on the aisle?

159
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,380
Yeah?

160
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,340
Rasputin's Dalmatian drowned in the Volga.

161
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,650
I thought he was allergic to dogs.

162
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,460
You're thinking of Merlin.

163
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,760
And it was peanuts.

164
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Okay, everybody.

165
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,670
We have a visitor.

166
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,520
Welcome Phil Dunphy.

167
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,350
Hey, Phil.

168
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,590
Hey. I'm so honored to be here.

169
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,780
You may recognize my -- my screen name,

170
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,460
Abracadunphy17.

171
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,530
That's you?

172
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,030
You're up in the middle of the night a lot.

173
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,580
My wife grinds her teeth.

174
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,890
But let me tell you another story.

175
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,110
It's about the miracle of metamorphosis.

176
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,760
- Uh, Phil   - They say the only constant is change --

177
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,760
Phil, we're gonna get to your trick in just a minute.

178
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh. I'm sorry.

179
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,570
Got a little excited there.

180
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,580
The heroes of the underground-magic blogosphere --

181
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,640
"Flashpaper" Finelli, Kaiser Mayhem, the Kid.

182
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,880
When you think about it,

183
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,370
it's crazy they're all alive at the same time.

184
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,220
Jay, I'm feeling a little cold.

185
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,480
Maybe I should buy a scarf.

186
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,060
Sure, get a couple of 'em.

187
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,890
Why, I know it's a little extravagant,

188
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,580
but we're excelsior now --

189
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,770
might as well look it.

190
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,060
Many years ago, when Jay was in Las Vegas,

191
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,770
he bought Barkley,

192
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,510
the doggy butler.

193
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,450
I hate Barkley.

194
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,160
I knew if Jay saw Rebarka,

195
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,950
he would want her too.

196
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah, that's her name -- Rebarka.

197
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,590
Uh, but, uh -- you know,

198
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,830
if we're going to gamble,

199
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,490
maybe I need my lucky sweater.

200
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,580
Can you go and get it in the room?

201
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,010
Who has a lucky sweater?

202
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,480
You wore two different shoes to watch the Super Bowl.

203
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,370
Fine.

204
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,780
No, Jay!

205
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,030
Other way.

206
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,630
I like that way.

207
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,870
Sorry, sir. This is a private elevator.

208
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,310
No need to apologize.

209
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm glad you're on top of this stuff.

210
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,780
That's only for the excelsior level.

211
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,470
This elevator goes to the top floor.

212
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,450
I thought excelsior was the top -- 62.

213
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,300
Mandalay Bay has 63 floors.

214
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,660
Top floor is excelsior plus.

215
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,380
Wait, they're allowed up there?

216
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,890
They're wearing dungarees.

217
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,160
61, 62...63!

218
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
Son of a bitch!

219
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,180
Come on, let me see an eight.

220
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,370
I want to see an eight.

221
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,560
Seven out.

222
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,170
Sorry.

223
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,800
We'll get 'em next time, baby.

224
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
Claire. Give me your key.

225
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,610
I need to charge something to your room.

226
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,700
Hang on a second.

227
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,340
Four. Point is four.

228
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,390
Okay, odds on four and a five each on "C" And "E."

229
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,500
What are you talking about?

230
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,970
It's the lady version of Barkley.

231
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,880
I have to put it on hold

232
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,900
so that Jay, if he sees it, he can't buy it,

233
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,580
and then I will cancel the charge before we leave.

234
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,330
Winner-- four the hard way!

235
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,270
Oh, yes! Finally!

236
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,410
Can I have the key?

237
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,380
Oh, no, honey. You're not going anywhere.

238
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
You're my good-luck charm.

239
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,130
Give these a blow, beautiful.

240
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,220
And how was your massage?

241
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,080
So re--

242
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
So, so relaxing.

243
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,190
Sorry, my masseuse was blasting the Enya.

244
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,410
So, what are you gonna do next?

245
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,520
A long soak?

246
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,500
A long sauna?

247
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
I think a sauna.

248
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,030
Yeah, I think I'm gonna do a soak.

249
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,190
Ooh, a soak does sound nice.

250
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,610
Maybe I'll do a sauna.

251
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,650
Is that-- is that glitter on your face?

252
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,950
Yeah, I think my masseuse might moonlight.

253
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,770
Vegas.

254
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,050
- All right, I'll see you in an hour.  - Okay. Yeah.

255
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,470
Enjoy it. Really have fun.

256
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,000
Relax, Mitchell.

257
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,030
Phil, you're up.

258
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,110
Okay.

259
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,510
The miracle... of metamorphosis.

260
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,610
They say the only constant is change.

261
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,900
Well, all of that is about to ch-- be different.

262
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,430
Note the simple burlap sack,

263
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,240
the kind you'd find in any home.

264
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,460
If you'd be so kind as to assist me,

265
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,110
the-- the-- the Kid,

266
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,390
I'll endeavor to prove that some change is glacial,

267
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,760
while some change is instantaneous.

268
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,070
Now, if you'd be so kind as to raise the simple burlap sack

269
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,910
above my head and pinch my wrists.

270
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,780
You'll note, the clock says exactly 4:02.

271
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,970
I have 3:15.

272
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,130
Yeah, I have 6:35.

273
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,730
Kaiser Mayhem!

274
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,530
It's what I do.

275
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,280
Wait, it's 5:20?

276
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,760
I actually have to call my wife.

277
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,750
Oh, no, Phil, you can't just stop in the middle of a trick.

278
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,820
That's a cardinal rule.

279
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,800
Guys, it's an emergency.

280
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Don't tell me you've never

281
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,890
had to call your spouse.

282
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,760
Oh...there's-- there's people for you.

283
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,800
Come on, Claire. Please pick up.

284
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,050
And the lady wins again.

285
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,750
Yes! Yes!

286
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,440
I did it! I did it!

287
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,870
I did it! I won back my money.

288
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,390
Oh, suck it, the house.

289
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,630
Claire, the key.

290
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,980
Yeah, okay, here you go.

291
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,380
And, hey, buy yourself something sparkly.

292
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,600
Gloria, there's a floor above us.

293
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
- What?!   - I know. It threw me, too.

294
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
Excelsior plus.

295
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
But to the people on that floor,

296
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,350
we're excelsior minus.

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,410
Mm, what is up there?

298
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,750
You need a black card to get in.

299
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,890
All we've got is this stupid silver one.

300
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh, I thought it was platinum.

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,540
It's crap.

302
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,660
Uh, why-

303
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,960
why don't you call your friend Burt

304
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,370
and tell him that we need the black card?

305
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,380
Because he's not my friend.

306
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,000
I never really even met him.

307
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,840
I think I heard him cough one time on a conference call.

308
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,310
I don't know why he would treat me this way.

309
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,550
- Oh, come on!   - What?

310
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,160
Oh, come on! You're Jay Pritchett!

311
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,970
You're gonna find your friend Burt

312
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,920
and tell him who you are,

313
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,710
and you're gonna get the black card,

314
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,420
because when you set your mind on something,

315
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,860
nobody can stop you!

316
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,480
Right!

317
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,590
Wait!

318
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,080
Go that way.

319
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,810
Excuse me,

320
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,360
how much is that doggy in the window?

321
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,580
I had finally taken back from Vegas what Vegas took from me.

322
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,790
That's a feeling of satisfaction I can't describe...

323
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,690
Because it didn't last very long.

324
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,830
- Oh, hey, Claire.  - Yeah?

325
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,530
- Have you seen Cam?  - No.

326
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,580
Although...we should stay in one place so he can find us.

327
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,320
How about a blackjack table?

328
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,690
Oh, no, I'm really worn out from my massage, the sauna...

329
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,570
It was just-- it was a lot of detoxing.

330
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,700
You know what you need?

331
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,860
- Some toxing.  - No.

332
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,190
Hand of blackjack, couple of tequilas.

333
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,960
Come on, it'll be fun. Do it.

334
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,300
You sound just like the kid who bullied me

335
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,840
into smoking my first cigarette.

336
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,470
Maybe this time you won't tell on me.

337
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,710
- And then hit.  - Yes.

338
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,920
And then hit. And then stay.

339
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,660
- I know. I have it.   - Okay.

340
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,240
18, 19, 18.

341
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,600
You are in a great position right now.

342
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,740
Oh, the dealer has 21.

343
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,560
Hers is better.

344
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,100
I am so sorry, Mitchell.

345
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,940
I promise you, we did everything right.

346
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,480
Don't be mad.

347
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,630
- I'm not mad.  - Really?

348
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,450
T-that was -- that was thrilling. I'm...

349
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,450
- My pulse is racing.  - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

350
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,150
- Thank you so much for making me do this.   - Yeah.

351
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,430
I'm going to play another hand.

352
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,560
We're going to play another hand.

353
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
No, alone.

354
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,890
- Not with you. You're bad luck.   - Really?

355
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,270
Go -- far.

356
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,340
The minute I got rid of her,

357
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,800
I couldn't lose.

358
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,350
Oh, gambling's fun.

359
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
And easy.

360
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,450
Hey, big spender.

361
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,560
What are you doing?

362
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,890
Gambling. I'm a gambler now.

363
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,480
- Look at you, letting loose.   - Yeah.

364
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,310
Yeah, I guess I figure

365
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,040
whatever mischief one might get into in Vegas

366
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,110
kind of remains here within the limits of the city, you know?

367
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,470
- That's a cool way to think about it.  - Yeah.

368
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,240
You know, I'm really glad that you came over here.

369
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
Really? Why is that?

370
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,270
Well, I always hated the way

371
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,150
that things ended between us, you know?

372
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,050
Maybe now we can go out on a better note.

373
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,530
- That's nice.   - Yeah.

374
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,110
Oh -- oh, my god!

375
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,550
6-2-3-3, that's -- that's my room number.

376
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,850
Huh. Um, hit me.

377
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,530
Seven!

378
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,600
That's 21, huh?

379
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,260
Yes! Yeah! Ah!

380
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,620
Whoa, check you out.

381
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,440
I guess tonight's my night to get lucky.

382
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,000
I would say.

383
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,480
- Here you are. - Thank you.

384
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,190
- Maybe I will run into you again, huh?   - Okay.

385
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,210
Oh, you...

386
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,030
There are $2140, Higgins,

387
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,940
for nothing -- nothing!

388
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,050
I want to do something crazy.

389
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,570
Okay, I'm gonna order a bath.

390
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,330
Sir, it seems to me like you've gone mad.

391
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,260
Okay, this is what I want.

392
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,400
I want something romantic,

393
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,820
but also a little dangerous.

394
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,960
Romantic, dangerous --

395
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
might I suggest, sir, the techno bath?

396
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Your heart will throb with the bass

397
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,940
while your eyes take in an off-the-scale laser light show

398
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,610
from that most intimate of V.I.P. arenas

399
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,640
-- your own tub.

400
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,690
Okay. I want that.

401
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,110
That's what I want.

402
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,900
Me thinks the little red riding hood may be a big, bad wolf.

403
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,480
I'll be back shortly with supplies.

404
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,500
Okay!

405
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,360
Ah, Mr. Dunphy! How are...

406
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,410
...we this evening?

407
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,220
Not so good.

408
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,070
I'm in a tight spot with my lady.

409
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,120
You know what might help?

410
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,220
One of those -- one of those luxury baths.

411
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,480
Ah, get yourself out of some hot water

412
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
by getting her into some.

413
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,750
Wow, so good.

414
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,750
Might I suggest the Michael Buble Bath?

415
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,910
You are a mind reader.

416
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm not a mind reader, sir.

417
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,290
I've just been in the bath-buttling business

418
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,290
since the early '90s,

419
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,030
despite my fresh face.

420
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,240
So I tend to know what these situations need.

421
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
- I'll get the water going. - As you wish.

422
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,420
Same price either way.

423
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,230
Burt says he's gonna be here any minute.

424
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,440
We got to really lay it on for this guy --

425
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,210
best scotch, put on something sexy.

426
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,870
I... have a great idea!

427
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,340
Cigars!

428
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,200
A man like Burt appreciates a good cigar.

429
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,950
Good thinking!

430
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,240
Of course, upstairs, the butler would be here already.

431
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm telling you,

432
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,560
we might as well be sleeping in the basement.

433
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,740
I said hold it, not deliver it!

434
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,900
Okay, there.

435
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,050
Come here.

436
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,020
Stay in Claire's room.

437
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,960
Hey, honey. I'm in the bathroom.

438
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,910
Honey?

439
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,850
Okay, I-I know I messed up,

440
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,560
But sit tight -- I got a little surprise for you.

441
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,050
Higgins, you got a minute?

442
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,770
60 an hour.

443
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,670
They all belong to you, sir.

444
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,410
I need a couple of primo cigars, A.S.A.P.

445
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,230
I'm not a stickler for how they got in the country.

446
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm also expecting a special Scotch delivery.

447
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,020
I need a shave.

448
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,440
Burt can't see me like this.

449
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,790
Unfortunately, the shaving butlers are all --

450
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,510
I know, excelsior plus.

451
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,110
- Are you decent?   - I am.

452
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,550
Well, not for long.

453
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,940
My partner should be here any minute.

454
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,490
Is it me, sir,

455
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,000
or is the air positively fizzing with erotic anticipation?

456
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,720
Yeah.

457
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, I forgot the ice.

458
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,330
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get it.

459
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,100
Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that.

460
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,020
No, not a problem.

461
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,670
As you wish.

462
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,140
Same price either way.

463
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,270
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

464
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,600
I-I'm looking for Mitchell.

465
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,790
Oh, yeah, he's expecting you.

466
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,200
In fact, he's asked me to draw the two of you a bath.

467
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,800
- This is crazy.   - Yeah.

468
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,170
I believe that's the plan.

469
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,700
Enjoy.

470
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,560
Thank you.

471
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,070
Oh, good. You're back.

472
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,220
How's Claire seem?

473
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm sorry?

474
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,370
You must have seen her out there. Is she mad?

475
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,630
W-what's she doing?

476
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,030
Uh, she's dusting, sir.

477
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,310
Oh, she always cleans when she's mad.

478
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,950
Do me a favor --

479
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,570
Bring her a drink

480
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,560
and tell her to get comfortable on the couch.

481
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,690
She's -- she's allowed on the furniture, is she?

482
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,530
She's my wife.

483
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,570
Oh, good! I've been looking for you.

484
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,950
Well, you should have been looking for somebody

485
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,510
who was looking for you,

486
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,560
because that's what I was doing.

487
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,090
Come on, I have a surprise for you.

488
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah, I-I've been thinking

489
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,430
we need to stop being so uptight.

490
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,610
We are in Vegas.

491
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,160
Let's have a little fun.

492
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,070
Well, I'll have to wrap my head around that, but okay.

493
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,510
Now, I have just the way to kick it off --

494
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,740
something we could do together.

495
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,460
It's a little extreme,

496
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,220
- but I think it might be just what we need.   - Okay.

497
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,270
Go on in.

498
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,560
Are you crazy?

499
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,690
Oh, come on, Cam, we deserve this.

500
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,270
All right, you get started,

501
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,090
and then I'll jump in when it starts to heat up.

502
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,850
Mitchell!

503
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,910
Come on. Then I will throw you into it, tiger.

504
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,370
Rub a dub dub.

505
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,140
Dear, no.

506
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,240
Langham.

507
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,800
Both of you?

508
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,170
Huh. Well, okay.

509
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,800
No. No. No, not okay.

510
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,700
What are you doing here?

511
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,820
You gave me your room key.

512
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,720
What?!

513
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,600
Don't act so shocked.

514
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
You told me at the bachelor party

515
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,150
you two lead separate lives.

516
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,460
You went to the bachelor party?

517
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,050
Yes, and I was starting to feel bad about sneaking around,

518
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,210
but I guess I shouldn't have,

519
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,650
Now that I see what you're up to.

520
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm not up to anything!

521
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
I left my key by mistake.

522
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,450
We're all obviously tense.

523
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,440
Let's take a deep breath...

524
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
Get in the tub...

525
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,540
That's not happening.

526
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,020
You want to tell me

527
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,710
how you "Accidentally" gave someone your key?

528
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,960
You want to tell me why you spent all day

529
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,030
sipping tequila out of some guy's navel?

530
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,760
You saw that?

531
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,500
I guessed.

532
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,230
Hi, guys. What's going on?

533
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,570
Hey, Claire. Can you please just come back?

534
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,540
We're in the middle of an argument.

535
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,190
Oh. Bet I know why.

536
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,610
Are you guys getting in the bath?

537
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,170
Or I'm way off.

538
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,930
Langham!

539
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,490
It's Tim.He can't know I'm here.

540
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,350
He has insane trust issues.

541
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,460
Insane?

542
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,890
Langham, are you in there?

543
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,490
- Go out this door.  - In here.

544
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,980
Gloria, hurry up, will you?

545
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,600
He's on his way up.

546
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,350
I need to shave.

547
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,930
Oh, you're here.

548
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,830
Jay Pritchett.

549
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,920
Thanks for stopping by.

550
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,820
Nice robe.

551
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,180
Like Hef, Back In The Day.

552
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

553
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,940
I like your lifestyle.

554
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,460
I want a taste of it.

555
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,180
Well, s-sure, that's flattering, but...

556
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,820
Okay, the bathroom is all you--

557
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,790
Gloria, it's Burt Tanner!

558
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,540
That's not Burt Tanner,

559
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,240
that's Long-ham.

560
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,440
Langham!

561
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,600
What's that thing doing here?

562
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,350
Just enjoying a dirty martini

563
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,890
before a cleansing romp in the bath.

564
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,690
That's not who the bath is for.

565
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,560
Oh, my mistake.

566
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Welcome...Claire.

567
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,670
You're certainly gonna be clean

568
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,110
by the end of the night, aren't you?

569
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,130
Jay, I forgot all my hair products!

570
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm going to borrow from Claire.

571
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,440
Okay, the coast is clear.

572
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,260
Jay!

573
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,550
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

574
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,500
Hey. Phil, there you are.

575
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,320
Ducky! How'd you know where I was?

576
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,820
Magicians run this town.

577
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,690
Really?

578
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,440
No. I'm a shaving butler up on plus.

579
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,790
Look, I felt bad about how things went down today,

580
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,970
and I-I just wanted to give you another shot.

581
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,260
Right this way.

582
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,510
I really think you're gonna like what you see.

583
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,390
Okay, let me just get everything set up.

584
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,990
Metamorphosis.

585
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,310
They say the only constant is change.

586
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,030
I-I'm sorry, what -- I-- s-- what is that?

587
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
Oh, I don't even know.

588
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,120
Something my wife bought.

589
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,470
Let me just get rid of it. Here we go.

590
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,990
Really, uh, rubbing it in on that wife thing, huh?

591
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,030
Metamorphosis.

592
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,380
Burt!

593
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,920
Nice of you to come down a floor

594
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,730
and see how the other half lives.

595
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,110
If you will,

596
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,530
raise it above my head and pinch it at my wrists.

597
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,220
Go ahead and make it good and tight.

598
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,150
Don't be easy on me.

599
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,810
Okay.

600
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,810
Now...

601
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,730
as the lowly caterpillar becomes the majestic butterfly,

602
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,950
as the tiny acorn becomes the mighty oak,

603
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,910
so, too, do we complete our...

604
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,830
metamorphosis.

605
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,350
So, it's the Governor's Bluff.

606
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,070
Well, it's a huge twist on the Governor's Bluff.

607
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,900
No, no, no, no, no!

608
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,870
There were other elements.

609
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,960
You just kind of threw me off.

610
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,040
I forgot -- I was gonna --

611
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,640
as a flourish I was gonna use one --

612
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,630
A-- that's amazing!

613
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,650
Y-you lull me with this--

614
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,030
- with this hacky quick change,

615
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,530
and the whole time,

616
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,150
you're changing the fake dog into a hot maid?

617
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,590
It's brilliant! It's magic!

618
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,560
No, that's metamorphosis!

619
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,080
Like you, Burt,

620
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,960
I enjoy the finer things.

621
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,750
As a matter of fact,

622
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,000
that's probably the Cuban I ordered for you.

623
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,190
Cam, if you wanted a bachelor party,

624
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
you should have just said something.

625
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,090
Well, I didn't know I wanted one until we got here.

626
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,620
And you're so "Eh, eh, eh,"

627
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,800
- I-I was afraid to say anything.   - Okay, all right.

628
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,690
Lucky for the two of you,

629
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,700
I know you better than you know yourselves,

630
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,620
and what the two of you need

631
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,030
is a little guilty pleasure,

632
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,980
or should I say...

633
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,010
The Scotch delivery you had me on the lookout for, sir.

634
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,860
I like your style, Pritchett.

635
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,090
You're in.

636
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,540
Vegas.

637
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,730
This reminds me of my late grandfather.

638
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,380
He was Scottish?

639
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,520
He was a stripper.

640
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,050
There we go.

641
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,490
You've got the touch, kid.

642
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,760
I was blessed with my mother's small hands, sir.

643
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,110
Shall I order your complimentary,

644
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,740
in-room, hot-stone massage?

645
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,920
Complimentary?

646
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,710
All part of the excelsior-plus experience, sir.

647
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,570
Might be nice after a dip in your private lap pool.

648
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,950
Oh, where has this been all my life?

649
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,230
You know, I saw a harpist in the elevator.

650
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,760
Can we get that for our brunch tomorrow?

651
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,620
If it was up to me, yes, but unfortunately,

652
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,710
that is reserved for our excelsior-ultra guests only.

653
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,770
62, 63, 64!

654
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,650
Son of a bitch!
