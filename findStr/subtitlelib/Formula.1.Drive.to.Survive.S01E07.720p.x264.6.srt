1
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:19,365
<i> In Formula One,</i>
<i>every race, every season,</i>

2
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:22,045
<i>you need to be at the top of your game.</i>

3
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,165
<i>But when you go through a tough patch,</i>
<i>you can have doubt.</i>

4
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,885
Spa 2012 was a big moment in my career.

5
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,765
<i>And we're racing in Belgium.</i>
<i>It's a good start for Hamilton.</i>

6
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:41,005
<i>Grosjean cutting across Lewis.</i>

7
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,885
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

8
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,685
<i>- Grosjean over the top of Alonso.</i>

9
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,125
<i>It has a massive impact!</i>

10
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>Alonso's out, Hamilton's out,</i>
<i>Kobayashi's out.</i>

11
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,245
<i>Real drama at the start of the race.</i>

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,805
<i>And, uh, I'm afraid I've got to say</i>
<i>I think that's Grosjean's fault.</i>

13
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,445
<i>After that race,</i>
<i>I went to see a psychologist</i>

14
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,045
<i>to get myself in a better place.</i>

15
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,725
<i>If you use a trainer</i>
<i>to get your body in shape,</i>

16
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,645
<i>why wouldn't you use a psychologist</i>
<i>to train your head?</i>

17
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,925
Let's go up and down here,
do a few of our running drills.

18
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:45,965
Just loosen up the hips. That's good.

19
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:49,525
<i>My name is Romain Grosjean.</i>
<i>I'm 32 years old,</i>

20
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:52,565
and I'm racing in Formula One
for Haas F1 team.

21
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,205
<i>I was born a competitor.</i>

22
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,365
Go for it.

23
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,165
<i>Everything I do,</i>
<i>I always try to be the best.</i>

24
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,325
Quicker.

25
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:06,485
<i>Whether it's playing tennis</i>
<i>or running or cooking</i>

26
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:08,725
<i>or being in a racing car.</i>

27
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:11,125
But it's been a rough start of the season.

28
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,645
<i>Right, on board then,</i>
<i>with Grosjean.</i>

29
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,445
<i>He's weaving around,</i>
<i>trying to get temperature into the tires.</i>

30
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:32,245
<i>Grosjean, who was</i>
<i>up into a brilliant position</i>

31
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,445
<i>has now crashed behind the safety car.</i>

32
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,725
I'm fucking speechless.

33
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:46,085
<i>That looks like Romain Grosjean,</i>
<i>just going right across the track.</i>

34
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,405
- <i>Are you okay, man?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

35
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:55,085
I can't fucking believe it.

36
00:02:57,325 --> 00:03:00,365
<i>All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah.</i>

37
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,045
<i>What has happened</i>
<i>to the Haas driver?</i>

38
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,685
Fifteen. One more to go.

39
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:17,845
<i>We are among</i>
<i>the best in the world</i>

40
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,725
<i>because we made it to Formula One.</i>

41
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:24,605
<i>There are only 20 seats</i>
<i>in the world in our sport.</i>

42
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:28,205
<i>A lot of people want to come through</i>
<i>and get your seat.</i>

43
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,885
You need to keep performing
or you can be out of the job.

44
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:33,805
Two to go.

45
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:42,005
<i>Welcome to the south of France,</i>
<i>to the French Grand Prix.</i>

46
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:45,205
<i>Yes, we are back in France</i>
<i>after an absence of ten years,</i>

47
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,405
<i>and it's round eight</i>
<i>of the Formula One championship</i>

48
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,005
<i>in 2018.</i>

49
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:54,285
<i>Hello, ladies and</i>
<i>gentlemen. We're happy to welcome you...</i>

50
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:04,165
<i> I'm Swiss and French.</i>

51
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,285
<i>I'm a Swissman</i>
<i>because I hate being late.</i>

52
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,245
<i>I'm always on time.</i>
<i>And I love chocolate.</i>

53
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:13,925
So, I guess there is no more cliché
than that for Switzerland.

54
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:19,485
<i>But, my mother was French</i>
<i>and I was raised under a French flag.</i>

55
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:22,245
So, you know,
it's like a dual personality.

56
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,165
- Romain, come this way!
- Thank you!

57
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,045
<i>A home driver hoping</i>
<i>to make a point here this weekend</i>

58
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,005
<i>is Romain Grosjean.</i>

59
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,165
<i>Still no points so far this season.</i>

60
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,805
<i>I think it's gonna give</i>
<i>an extra boost,</i>

61
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,725
<i>hearing "La Marseillaise," seeing</i>
<i>all those French flags in the grandstand.</i>

62
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:42,045
<i>I'm really hoping</i>
<i>that that's a turnaround in the season</i>

63
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,845
and things are going perfectly
all weekend long.

64
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,405
When can you start the work, you think?

65
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,685
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

66
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:05,245
<i>Haas F-1 is the newest team.</i>
<i>We're in our third season now.</i>

67
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:07,725
<i>The biggest goal is</i>
<i>to finish better than last year.</i>

68
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,165
We'll see if we can, uh, get four.

69
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:21,405
To describe Romain as a driver is...
actually, I wouldn't say difficult,

70
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:23,205
but he's very fast.

71
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:26,245
<i>On a good day, Romain,</i>
<i>I think he's one of the best out there.</i>

72
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,085
<i>But he makes mistakes.</i>

73
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,565
If the driver keeps crashing,

74
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,965
the biggest thing is he loses,
sometimes, his confidence.

75
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:35,725
Okey-dokey.

76
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,165
-Sweet, thank you, boys.
-Okay.

77
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,485
<i>I think the task for Romain</i>
<i>for the rest of the season</i>

78
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,165
is to be consistent.

79
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,525
He's delighted to be racing here
in France at Circuit Paul Ricard,

80
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,285
his first time racing
in a French Grand Prix.

81
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,565
I'm gonna jump down
and get some questions from the guys.

82
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,165
Good afternoon, Romain.

83
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:58,205
Who are you going to be
driving for next year?

84
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,405
Oh!

85
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:07,605
For now, I do not know. We will focus
on the next races. It’s the first time...

86
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,925
<i>Formula One isn't like other sports.</i>

87
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:13,285
Contracts are negotiated,
they are signed...

88
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:14,525
who knows when.

89
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:19,125
And that's why you've always got
to be performing as well as you can.

90
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,485
You're very happy with Haas,

91
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,805
-but obviously, time will tell.
-Correct.

92
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,525
Right, ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together.

93
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,845
Thank Romain Grosjean for his time.
Wish him well.

94
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,285
Good luck, my friend.
Good luck.

95
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,885
Just coming
straight on the racing line.

96
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,885
Yeah.

97
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,005
<i>Romain is out of contract</i>
<i>at the end of this season.</i>

98
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:46,125
<i>Whether he remains in Formula One</i>
<i>is massively open for debate.</i>

99
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,525
In sixth, it's quite
a high speed. It's like fourth or fifth.

100
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:49,765
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,685
<i>He's so experienced.</i>
<i>On his day, he is so good.</i>

102
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,805
But he's falling apart this year.

103
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,925
<i>You're only as good as your last race,</i>

104
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,165
<i>and right now, Romain's last races</i>
<i>are not that much to write home about.</i>

105
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,365
<i>Bonne chance!</i>

106
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,525
- They like you.
- They do.

107
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,045
We like you too.

108
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:21,445
<i>We're getting towards the start,</i>
<i>then, of qualifying.</i>

109
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,645
<i>But for the drivers, Martin, it's kind of</i>
<i>their first real competitive chance</i>

110
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,085
<i>to get a feel for this track because...</i>

111
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,605
<i>Saturday afternoon</i>
<i>sees qualifying</i>

112
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,085
<i>to determine the starting order</i>
<i>for Sunday's Grand Prix.</i>

113
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,965
His total is...

114
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,365
<i> The further back you qualify,</i>

115
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,805
<i>the harder your race</i>
<i> is going to be on Sunday,</i>

116
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,765
<i>and the harder job you're going to get</i>
<i>scoring points.</i>

117
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:59,405
<i> Well, I think every driver</i>
<i>feels an incredible amount of pressure.</i>

118
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:03,365
<i>I know Romain is feeling the pressure.</i>

119
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:10,045
<i>I know that Kevin is an adversary to him.</i>

120
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,285
<i>So, he-- he feels that.</i>

121
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,645
<i>Your teammate is,</i>
<i>in many ways, your worst enemy.</i>

122
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,325
<i>I get on well with Romain</i>

123
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:24,485
<i>and I think we have</i>
<i>a healthy relationship as teammates.</i>

124
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,365
<i>But, you know, we are here to do</i>
<i>our own thing and focus on ourselves</i>

125
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:29,965
<i>and do the best for ourselves.</i>

126
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,525
<i>I don't ever think about,</i>
<i>you know, crashing the car.</i>

127
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,645
<i>I'm willing to do anything</i>
<i>to get those results.</i>

128
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,725
<i>Good guys never win.</i>

129
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:47,045
<i>In Formula One, if you're just</i>
<i>a good guy and let your teammate pass by,</i>

130
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,645
<i>that doesn't work.</i>
<i>You will never be successful.</i>

131
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,405
It's part of the game.
At this level, uh, you need to fight hard.

132
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:56,925
Okay.

133
00:08:57,405 --> 00:09:00,765
Once more,
because we will perform a start.

134
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,045
<i>Okay.</i>

135
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,365
<i>It kind of shows you</i>
<i>the personalities of Formula One guys.</i>

136
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:13,925
<i>They don't wanna anybody to pass them.</i>

137
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:18,045
<i>And a green light, and so the cars</i>
<i>can come out onto the track.</i>

138
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,565
<i>And, boy, do these boys</i>
<i>need to practice.</i>

139
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,045
<i>They're so damn competitive,</i>

140
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,725
<i>even if they're walking out the door,</i>
<i>they'll race to the door.</i>

141
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,045
<i>That's just their nature.</i>

142
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:29,605
<i>They won't let anybody beat them</i>
<i>at anything.</i>

143
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,205
- <i>Radio's good, turn one.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

144
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,605
<i>Okay, push, now. Good.</i>

145
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,845
Okay, done. We're green or red?

146
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,285
<i>We're green.</i>

147
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,645
<i> Okay, it's gone. Let's go now.</i>

148
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,885
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

149
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:07,005
<i> Onboard with Romain Grosjean.</i>
<i>Looking really fast.</i>

150
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,805
<i>Pushing that Haas to the limit.</i>

151
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:14,245
<i>Okay, good lap.</i>
<i>He's 1.6 behind.</i>

152
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,885
<i>He's on push.</i>
<i>We need a very big back-off lap.</i>

153
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,245
<i>Romain Grosjean</i>
<i>next across the line.</i>

154
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,205
<i> What a good lap.</i>

155
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:32,845
<i>Romain was very fast.</i>
<i>He couldn't do anything better.</i>

156
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,965
But he needs to consistently
get the best out of the car.

157
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,885
<i>Romain, driver default Charlie.</i>

158
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,845
<i>Okay, Hamilton, three,</i>
<i>puts you in a half behind on a push,</i>

159
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,445
<i>and we are gonna go</i>
<i>for a timed lap.</i>

160
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,045
<i>We're going for it.</i>

161
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,165
- No!
- Shit, he crashed.

162
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,925
Fuck me.

163
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:23,765
<i>The Haas is out of qualifying,</i>
<i>but it has red flagged the session.</i>

164
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,045
Fuck!

165
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,005
<i> Are you okay? Are you okay?</i>

166
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,605
<i> Yeah. I can't engage reverse.</i>

167
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:35,925
Okay, understood.

168
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,365
<i>It doesn't want to go reverse.</i>

169
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,485
- <i> Okay.</i>
<i>- I can't reverse.</i>

170
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,685
<i>All right, just take your time.</i>
<i>Take your time.</i>

171
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,325
<i>Romain Grosjean in his home race</i>

172
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:48,125
<i>in Q3,</i>
<i>after all the smiles to get this far,</i>

173
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:52,405
<i>now comes the agony and the despair</i>
<i>for the Haas team.</i>

174
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:54,645
He's overcooked it.

175
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,925
<i> I fucking-- I mean, I don't</i>
<i>know how long I can live like this.</i>

176
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,765
<i>At some stage, I need to do something,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

177
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,605
<i>I cannot keep on doing...</i>
<i>just finding excuses for him.</i>

178
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,085
He'll come back here then?

179
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:20,645
Yeah. Yeah, when
he comes back here...

180
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:23,965
- Chill out for two minutes. Okay.
- ...and then go straight down, yeah.

181
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,485
- Let's not be negative.
- Okay.

182
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,645
<i>Well, after a crash,</i>
<i>you're never very proud.</i>

183
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:35,845
<i>Especially when, you know,</i>
<i>you've got a good car</i>

184
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,925
<i>and a good chance for a good Grand Prix.</i>

185
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,685
<i>And of course, you're...</i>
<i>you're frustrated, you're disappointed,</i>

186
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:44,805
<i>you can be sad,</i>
<i>you can be angry.</i>

187
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:52,125
Feel good?
Want to go to your room?

188
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,405
Yeah.

189
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:57,165
<i>Most of the time, you keep</i>
<i>your helmet on and your visor down</i>

190
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:03,285
to protect yourself and create a bit
of a gap with the outside world.

191
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,325
You only had a tiny bit of throttle
in the rear one, so...

192
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,205
How are you?

193
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:22,965
I'm too tired. I can't sleep.
All this bad luck is draining me.

194
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:24,325
I thought it might, uh--

195
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,085
I always fight bad news,
bad news, bad news.

196
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,245
It's just too much.

197
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,045
And you never rest. You always
have a negative feeling of what's next.

198
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,805
Of course. Of course.
What's gonna happen next?

199
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,525
And here we are again, negative, boom!

200
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,565
Fuck's sake.

201
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:42,085
I didn't do a foot wrong
all fucking weekend.

202
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,205
Sorry...

203
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,725
There's no need.

204
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,565
-There was no need.
-I know.

205
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:02,405
Fucking hell, Romain, we cannot--

206
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,205
I know there's no need...

207
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,685
Right. Okay.
Let's not dwell on it. Come on, yeah?

208
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,045
-We still got good car, yeah?
-Yeah, we do.

209
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,965
We'll score points tomorrow, yeah?
Come on. Okay? Positive.

210
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,805
<i>It was all very good</i>
<i>until it went all very wrong.</i>

211
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,085
<i>In my opinion, it's not even a mistake.</i>
<i>He tries too hard.</i>

212
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,725
<i>That is my opinion about him.</i>

213
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:31,925
He wants to be faster, obviously,

214
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,205
and then gets into situations
where the car cannot be as fast

215
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:39,285
<i>because it isn't there.</i>
<i>You need to know how far you can go,</i>

216
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,845
<i>and I think he just tried</i>
<i>to go to the edge and sometimes,</i>

217
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:44,045
a few times too often,
goes over the edge.

218
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:46,645
Fuck me.

219
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,285
<i>With Romain Grosjean</i>
<i>out of qualifying,</i>

220
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:55,165
<i>all the Haas team's hopes</i>
<i>now rest with Kevin Magnussen.</i>

221
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,365
<i> We have one time lap,</i>
<i>one time lap.</i>

222
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:02,605
<i>Come on, let's put the lap together.</i>

223
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:16,005
<i> And that's ninth place</i>
<i>for Kevin Magnussen.</i>

224
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,605
<i>A disappointing result all around</i>
<i>for Haas.</i>

225
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,885
<i>The car showed</i>
<i>a lot of pace on this track.</i>

226
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:25,325
Both you and Kevin look really
disappointed at the end of today,

227
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:29,045
but you have a great car underneath you.
Confident it'll be smiles tomorrow?

228
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,125
Hopefully, yeah. We'll, try to be--
to get some luck for once.

229
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:34,445
Well done. Thank you.

230
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,245
<i>- </i><i>It's okay to start?</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

231
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,165
Okay.

232
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:46,685
Obviously, it was a very disappointing
qualifying for the potential we got.

233
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:49,605
Um... can we start
with you, please, Romain?

234
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:53,005
I don't have any explanation
for losing the rear that way.

235
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,605
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

236
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,605
- It just went...
- Okay, understood. Right.

237
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,925
<i> In Formula One,</i>
<i>you do feel lonely sometimes,</i>

238
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:09,365
because there aren't many people
that can understand

239
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,605
what you're going through.

240
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:17,405
<i>If you do a mistake on the track,</i>
<i>a lot of people are talking about it.</i>

241
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,845
<i>You can be a hero and you can be a zero</i>
<i>within five seconds.</i>

242
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:26,685
I think his confidence
is seriously taking lots of hits now.

243
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:29,325
Like he gave up the "why,"
he don't care anymore about it.

244
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,925
It's my opinion about this.

245
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,245
Because you have nothing to lose.

246
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,445
You know how you're strongest
when you have nothing to lose?

247
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,005
-No?
-Yeah.

248
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,845
We're in 19, the whole sport
is what is on the line, you know?

249
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:41,805
Yeah.

250
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:55,205
Yeah? And you try to place him?

251
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,965
We are trying to place him.
Exactly.

252
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:04,685
All right. Can I just have a few--
few minutes?

253
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,805
I want to explain a little bit of things.

254
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:10,565
I think it was time again to do a dinner,
just to show our appreciation

255
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,485
for what you guys are doing for the team,
you know?

256
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:18,125
We're having very promising results,
but have very little points.

257
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,005
And I think we are all aware of it.

258
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,885
The only one having points, actually,
is him, you know?

259
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,525
Romain is not here.

260
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,845
Maybe he didn't want to come
because he had no points, maybe.

261
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,045
Or maybe I didn't invite him
because he doesn't deserve any food.

262
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,885
I will tell him tomorrow, by the way,
you know, that I said this, so,

263
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,765
you don't have to run to him
and tell him, you know?

264
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,245
I'm brave enough to say it myself.

265
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,165
But, no, I think
we always are competitive.

266
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:43,125
Actually sometimes, me personally,

267
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:45,885
I cannot wait to go to next race
 because having a car like this,

268
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,045
you don't have always in your career,
you know?

269
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,165
So we just need to get a little bit lucky.
Uh... we don't need a lot of luck.

270
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:56,125
We just need to get rid of the unluckiness
and we will be fine.

271
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,325
So, I just want to say, guys,
we still believe in everybody.

272
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:02,925
You know, we had issues,
but I think we still keep fighting hard.

273
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:06,685
Enjoy the evening and, uh, enjoy the meal,

274
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:10,485
and thank you very much from our side.
Thank you, guys.

275
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:43,845
<i> The goal for this race</i>
<i>is to make as many points as possible.</i>

276
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,925
<i>And then what I expect is to make points</i>

277
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:51,045
<i>and bring results with a car like ours,</i>
<i>uh, every weekend.</i>

278
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:05,205
<i> Romain, loud and clear</i>
<i>and okay to push</i>

279
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,605
<i>and remember... fifth gear.</i>

280
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,685
<i>We should be able</i>
<i>to see the lights.</i>

281
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,005
<i>And we're getting ready</i>
<i>for the lights to go on</i>

282
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,965
<i>and the return of Grand Prix racing</i>

283
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,925
<i>to its birthplace of France.</i>

284
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,685
<i>It's lights out and away we go!</i>

285
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,285
<i>The top two get away very well.</i>

286
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:27,085
<i>Sebastian Vettel is now in hot pursuit</i>
<i>as they head down towards turn one.</i>

287
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,045
No!

288
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,685
Oh, fucking hell!

289
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:43,005
I got bad, bad hit by behind.

290
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,685
<i>No problem. As far as we can tell,</i>
<i>everything's okay on the car.</i>

291
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,285
Nice!

292
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,845
<i> Currently P-8.</i>

293
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,765
<i> And that is Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>under pressure from Romain Grosjean.</i>

294
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,885
<i>Grosjean tries to go around the outside.</i>

295
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,005
Man, he completely forced me
off the track again.

296
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,325
We saw it. No problem, keep going.

297
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:15,925
<i>Vettel behind.</i>

298
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,085
<i>Vettel goes for a move on Grosjean.</i>

299
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,365
<i>That looked very, very easy.</i>

300
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:36,285
<i>Nico Hülkenberg has been getting</i>
<i>after that Haas.</i>

301
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,725
<i> Again? Fuck's sake!</i>

302
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:49,085
<i> Here goes Bottas.</i>

303
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,405
<i>He's now going wheel to wheel</i>
<i>with Grosjean.</i>

304
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:56,405
<i>Through the Beausset</i>
<i>and squeezes the Haas off the track there.</i>

305
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,005
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

306
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:02,925
<i>Hey, I was just got pushed</i>
<i>off the track by Bottas again.</i>

307
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,645
Okay. We saw that. We saw that.

308
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,005
No. Just tell him.

309
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:13,405
Just focus on driving, not fucking whinge.
Fucking hell.

310
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:25,405
<i>But here comes Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>on Brendon Hartley into the chicane.</i>

311
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:35,605
<i>Onboard with Kevin Magnussen,</i>
<i>running in tenth place.</i>

312
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,085
<i>The battle with Stoffel Vandoorne.</i>

313
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,405
<i>Still three laps</i>
<i>of spot one available.</i>

314
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:47,845
<i> Kevin Magnussen gets past</i>
<i>Stoffel Vandoorne</i>

315
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:51,325
<i>and up into ninth place now</i>
<i>for the Haas.</i>

316
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,965
<i>Okay, you're catching up on Sainz</i>
<i>and pulling away from Leclerc.</i>

317
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,965
<i>This is a good job.</i>
<i>Come on, boy.</i>

318
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,565
<i> There's a loss of power</i>
<i>for Carlos Sainz,</i>

319
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,365
<i>and you can now see Kevin Magnussen</i>

320
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:08,405
<i>and Valterri Bottas closing in</i>
<i>on the Spaniard.</i>

321
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,045
<i>And this could be bonus position finishes.</i>

322
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,125
Come on, Kev.
Come on, come on, come on.

323
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,605
<i>You have the DRS.</i>

324
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:27,885
<i>P-6, P-6.</i>

325
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:30,525
Excellent job, man.

326
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,005
Pressure's good.
Car looks good.

327
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,405
Three laps to go.

328
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:41,205
<i>But can Valterri Bottas get past</i>
<i>Kevin Magnussen here?</i>

329
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,645
<i> P-6, come on, boy.</i>

330
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,285
Hang on, Kevin!

331
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,885
<i>Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>is gonna hold him off.</i>

332
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,965
<i>Magnussen finishes sixth.</i>

333
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,485
<i>Checkered flag.</i>

334
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,685
<i>Today it was</i>
<i>a very solid performance, Kevin.</i>

335
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:21,685
<i>Amazing, guys.</i>

336
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:25,765
<i>Well done. Well done.</i>
<i>Some more points.</i>

337
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:29,365
<i>Let's keep it going.</i>
<i>We're doing well. We're doing well.</i>

338
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,645
We got a heck of a little driver there.

339
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:37,445
Yeah, it's too bad Grosjean
couldn't make up one spot.

340
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:40,805
<i> And that's Roman Grosjean</i>
<i>crossing the line in eleventh position,</i>

341
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,565
<i>just one place outside the points.</i>

342
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:44,485
<i> Checkered flag. Checkered flag.</i>

343
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,565
<i>You drove well.</i>

344
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:50,605
<i>Sorry we didn't quite get on the points.</i>
<i>Kevin got, uh, P-6.</i>

345
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,725
<i>Uh, mate, the rules are a joke.</i>

346
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:58,845
<i>I got pushed twice off the track.</i>

347
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:04,125
<i>Yeah, result was disappointing.</i>

348
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:07,805
<i>Um, it's not--</i>
<i>I was not expecting to come 11th.</i>

349
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,325
-Fantastic.
-Fantastic.

350
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:13,925
<i>It's always difficult to see</i>
<i>your teammate doing well and you not.</i>

351
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:15,045
-It's a good time.
-Yeah.

352
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,125
Okay.

353
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,965
Good job, man.
I kept on seeing the fighter.

354
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,325
-Yeah.
-Okay, I was shitting myself.

355
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:26,645
<i> In any sport at this level,</i>
<i>you just need to be determined.</i>

356
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:30,685
<i>But I think life generally is like this.</i>

357
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:34,325
If you always let other people get on,
you stay behind.

358
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:46,565
<i> I think at this stage</i>
<i>of the season, looking at drivers,</i> uh...

359
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,045
<i>we're looking around.</i>

360
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:49,565
Thank you.

361
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:53,125
I think Romain knows what to do,
that he keeps his seat.

362
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,285
He's well aware of it,

363
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:58,725
that we cannot have any more
accidents and damages,

364
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:02,605
but we will talk about it and see
what is best for the team to go forward.

365
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:09,205
<i>The present form</i>
<i>from the beginning of the season</i>

366
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:10,925
<i>is not where I should be</i>

367
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:12,205
<i>and it's not what I can do...</i>

368
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,565
<i>because I know that I can come back</i>
<i>to the level I want to be.</i>

369
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:21,845
And therefore, I will keep my seat.

370
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:28,565
<i>Romain Grosjean on his way</i>
<i>to getting his first points</i>

371
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,045
<i>since Japan last year.</i>

372
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:31,925
<i>Whoo hoo hoo!</i>

373
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,605
<i>Grosjean comes home fourth.</i>

374
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,205
It's amazing.
I hope he found his mojo back.

375
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:42,805
<i> Stand by for action.</i>
<i>It is the U.S. Grand Prix.</i>

376
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,725
<i>We never had a good result</i>
<i>in a home Grand Prix.</i>

377
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,085
I hope this is the year.

378
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,925
<i>It's a chaotic</i>
<i>opening lap of the race.</i>

379
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:54,725
<i>Contact with Romain Grosjean.</i>
