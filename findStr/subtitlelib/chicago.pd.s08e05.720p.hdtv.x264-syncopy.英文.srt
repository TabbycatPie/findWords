18
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,360
You know, every time we have a day off,

19
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,090
we just end up at O'Malley's.

20
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,420
Even doing the outdoor thing, that place has an aftertaste.

21
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,530
We gotta stop going there.

22
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,800
No, O'Malley's was a necessary evil.

23
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,070
I needed to play darts. I needed to win.

24
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,630
Even though I didn't do any winning whatsoever.

25
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,760
You still got that beer from last weekend?

26
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,050
No. I think I have the awful stout, though.

27
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,720
- That's it? - Yeah.

28
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,170
Yum.

29
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,160
Are you gonna want one of these?

30
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,040
Nope.

31
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,480
All right.

32
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,380
- We still watching that movie? - Yes.

33
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,490
All right. Gimme these legs here.

34
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,100
Okay.

35
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,270
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

36
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,830
I'm really not that sorry, though.

37
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,610
I hate this rug so much.

38
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,760
This is a stupid rug.

39
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,220
My rug would've fit in here much better.

40
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,550
You are never gonna put your ugly rug in my apartment.

41
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,870
I was gonna put my rug in here

42
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,340
and it was gonna be beautiful with the d¨¦cor.

43
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,420
So what's happening right now?

44
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,970
Are you gonna even pretend to clean it up?

45
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,240
Or just--just gonna leave it?

46
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,690
I wasn't even gonna pretend. It's fine. It's just a splash.

47
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,890
It's not a splash. My rug is soaked.

48
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,030
It's a splash.

49
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm too comfortable. Come on.

50
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,280
And you're very warm.

51
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,860
You smell like O'Malley's.

52
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,440
So do you.

53
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,710
Like, uh, whiskey and smoke. Winter.

54
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,980
- I like it. - You like it?

55
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,460
Don't we know better than this?

56
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
Do we?

57
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,240
If not, we might be insane.

59
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,250
I've been trying to keep the beard a little soft,

60
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,040
so I got this oil.

61
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,400
- Let me feel. - No.

62
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,520
- It's beautiful. - No, no.

63
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,420
Thank you.

64
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,400
So is this part of our relationship now?

65
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
We're accepting that every six months or so,

66
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,280
we sleep together?

67
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,790
It'd be real right with me.

68
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,590
Yeah.

69
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,800
Or we could try the version

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,850
where we sleep together on the regular.

71
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,080
What version is that?

72
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,600
That would be called dating.

73
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,120
We already act like a couple.

74
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,370
Is it so crazy that we try again?

75
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,740
- Yep. - Why?

76
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,660
Because, uh, I think I know what I want now.

77
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,030
Fine.

78
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,110
I want all of it, Adam.

79
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,010
I want the proposal,

80
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,320
I want getting married in some bad banquet hall,

81
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,110
I wanna have babies, I want the job,

82
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,120
I want the mess, I want the whole thing.

83
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,040
- Kay. - Still wanna talk to me about dating?

84
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,790
Yes.

85
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,730
- No, you don't. - CPD assist requested by CFD.

86
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,470
Traffic accident, Astor and Scott.

87
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,350
Go ahead and answer it.

88
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,620
Pull the ripcord.

89
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,790
5021 Eddie. Two plainclothes officers responding

90
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,920
to CFD's request for backup.

91
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,300
- Will advise once on scene. - Copy that, 5021 Eddie.

92
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,000
Hurry, please.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
- Hey, you need help with her? - He ran the intersection!

94
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,450
No, no, she's not why we called for the assist.

95
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,650
It's him. Something's not right.

96
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,500
- Is it a DUI? - I don't know.

97
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,300
Sir, please stay still.

98
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,180
Sir.

99
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,850
No. Those injuries aren't consistent with the crash.

100
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,080
No, none of it's consistent at all with the crash.

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,110
Whatever happened happened real recent, though.

102
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,230
Sir, can you look at me? My name's Officer Adam Ruzek.

103
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,810
Can you tell me who did this to you?

104
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,160
No, no, no, no!

105
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,670
I need you to stay still.

106
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,740
I'm okay.

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,980
Sir, you may feel fine, but you're not.

108
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,840
I need you to stay right where you are.

109
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,870
There's blood on the outside of the door.

110
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,540
- I am fine! - Hey, hey, buddy--

111
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,840
- You got him? - Yeah.

113
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,830
- You got this guy's name? - Yeah.

114
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,590
BMW's registered to a Jeff Trubin.

115
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,090
No priors, single, lives downtown.

116
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,190
Couldn't get anything. Guy's still unconscious.

117
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,140
Pretty brutal beating.

118
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,590
I mean, happened inside the car,

119
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,670
then maybe somebody dragged him out, beat him some more?

120
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,190
I don't know. Maybe it was a domestic?

121
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,700
Maybe it was a passenger?

122
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,250
This one doesn't really add up.

123
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,090
2261, can I get a direct mobile

124
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,200
to whoever is assigned paper at Astor and Scott?

125
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,820
Think I got a related incident.

126
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,390
Yeah. 5021 Ida.

127
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,110
We're held down at Astor and Scott.

128
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm two blocks south from ya.

129
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,200
Got something strange.

130
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
Think you might wanna talk to this witness.

131
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,690
We'll take it.

132
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,080
Copy that. We're on the way.

133
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,910
Seems way too coincidental

134
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,600
not to be related to your accident.

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
He called 911 about 30 minutes ago.

136
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,530
All right. Hey, sir.

137
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm Detective Halstead, this is Detective Upton.

138
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,840
Sir, you mind going through it again?

139
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,630
Yeah, sure. So, I was working right over there

140
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,280
and I heard some screaming, so I looked over

141
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,160
and I saw three guys go past wearing masks.

142
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,080
- Masks? - Yeah, ski masks.

143
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
They were runnin' like hell.

144
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,380
One of 'em had a crowbar.

145
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,450
Another was tucking something into their waistband.

146
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,530
A gun, I guess.

147
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,940
Then all of a sudden, a gray SUV came up.

148
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,280
They hopped in and sped away.

149
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,100
Then about a minute later, a blue BMW came speeding by.

150
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,110
A blue BMW?

151
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,500
I could see the driver. His face was really bloody.

152
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,470
What about the gray SUV?

153
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,530
Did you get a look at that driver?

154
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,240
- Get the plates? - No, I'm sorry.

155
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,670
All I saw were the kids in the masks

156
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,230
- and the side of the SUV. - Kids?

157
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,520
I mean, I didn't see their faces,

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,960
but by the way they're running, the way they were dressed,

159
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,190
the way they were screaming at each other,

160
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,200
I could tell they were kids.

161
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,630
Seemed like teenagers.

162
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,310
Caught a strange one.

163
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,460
The only witness was the guy that called it in.

164
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,380
And the victim?

165
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,260
Blood tox came back negative for drugs and alcohol.

166
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,320
The guy's still unconscious

167
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,890
but Med's gonna contact as soon as we can question him.

168
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,960
Okay, so what do we think happened?

169
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,420
Well, right now, we're betting on a failed carjacking.

170
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,120
Been a 40% increase in carjackings

171
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,160
in that neighborhood this month alone.

172
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,000
Perfect territory.

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,100
There's a through line from downtown,

174
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,340
usually pretty void of pedestrians,

175
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,190
meaning there's a hell of a lot of high-end vehicles

176
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,500
on a quiet street.

177
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,680
The victim was driving a $90,000 BMW,

178
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,830
and there was evidence of a beating

179
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,260
inside and outside the car, so they pulled him out.

180
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,060
So a new, young crew tries to jack Jeff's car,

181
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,180
things go wrong-- maybe Jeff fights back

182
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,690
or the kids get spooked.

183
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,140
Crew takes off, hop in their buddy's car

184
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,310
and Jeff tries to drive away.

185
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,840
We got a hit on the offender's car.

186
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,010
Gray SUV was clocked on PODs two blocks away.

187
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,710
Nice. You get an angle on the windows?

188
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,980
Can't see inside or see plates,

189
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,840
but I ran the car through our HOT file.

190
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,400
Gray SUV was reported stolen two months ago

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,610
by a Jessica Ramirez. Now, the kicker?

192
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,420
Jessica works at a DCFS center

193
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,510
with kids aging out of the system.

194
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,930
Teenagers.

195
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,260
Okay, that's good.

196
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,900
Why don't you guys check it out?

197
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,260
So your SUV was stolen from here?

198
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,380
Uh, no.

199
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,460
Well, I mean yes, it was,

200
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,670
but I had parked it around back in the lot.

201
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,590
And the kids here have access to it?

202
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,780
Sure. But really, anyone has access.

203
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,160
The lot's open to the street.

204
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,320
What, you really think just anyone took your car?

205
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,610
I don't know.

206
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,450
At this point, I kind of just assumed my car was gone for good.

207
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,200
Right.

208
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,350
Well, Jessica, look.

209
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,130
We're looking for a crew of teenagers

210
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,740
that were involved in what we believe to be

211
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,470
a pretty brutal attempted carjacking,

212
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,090
and they're using your SUV.

213
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,580
So I understand you want to protect these kids, but--

214
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,360
I noticed my spare keys were missing, uh,

215
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
after I called the police.

216
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,260
These kids, they have it rough.

217
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,400
I was just trying to give them a moment of peace, but...

218
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,330
my spare keys were in the drawer.

219
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,500
You know who might've taken 'em?

220
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,290
No, but I know the kids who had access.

221
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,230
A lot of names. 13 teenagers.

222
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,150
Be hard to find, too.

223
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,720
Kids that age out notoriously disappear.

224
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,700
Makayla?

225
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,250
Hi! Hi, you!

226
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,390
What are you doing here? What's going on?

227
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,950
- What's happening? - They took me here.

228
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,580
What's she doing here? What's happening?

229
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,930
I'm sorry. Are you...

230
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,060
Officer Kim Burgess.

231
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,470
We worked the Ward homicide case.

232
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,310
What's she doing here? Where's her guardian?

233
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,090
Where's--where's-- where's Kathy?

234
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm sorry, I can't lawfully give you any details

235
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
of a minor's case without the correct authorization.

236
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,220
Understood, but clearly, I know Makayla,

237
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,460
and--and I know her social worker, Alanah.

238
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,340
You'll have to speak to Alanah, then.

239
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,820
Makayla, honey? Come on.

240
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,900
Hey, can we--

241
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,950
can I--can I--

242
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,820
Real quick. Real quick, Makayla.

243
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,910
Why don't you go talk to this nice lady?

244
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll call Alanah,

245
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,330
and then I'm gonna make sure everything is okay, all right?

246
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,040
- I promise. - Okay.

247
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,910
Lot of reasons she could be here.

248
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,830
Yeah, I know.

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,980
Alanah's not answering.

250
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,600
Kim and Ruz, you got ears in?

251
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,340
Yeah. Go ahead.

252
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,910
Call came in over the zone.

253
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,440
On-view carjacking, three masked offenders.

254
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,630
Sounds a whole lot like our crew.

255
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,170
Jay and I are around the corner.

256
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,890
Call came from the intersection of Kostner and Wilcox--

257
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,710
Jay!

258
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,410
God damn it!

259
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,480
Help!

260
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,850
Help me!

261
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,710
Chicago PD! Stop!

262
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Chicago PD! Get your hands up!

263
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,570
- Come on! - Come on, come on!

264
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,160
Three masked offenders fleeing on foot.

265
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,180
- Copy that. - It's okay.

266
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,330
It's okay, we got you.

267
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,880
Two of them are armed! They went that way!

268
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,910
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

269
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,940
Two offenders heading westbound.

270
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,920
One broke off of gangway mid-alley.

271
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,450
Copy. Headed back your way.

272
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,190
Hey, police!

273
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,990
Medics took the victim to Chicago Med.

274
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,560
Had signs of a massive heart attack.

275
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,460
His name's Troy Wrightman, 62 years old.

276
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,660
This is his car.

277
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,250
Married, no children, no priors.

278
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,750
The kids that we saw fleeing--

279
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,820
looks like they were three males and a female.

280
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,870
Ruzek's talking to a witness.

281
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,730
Says he saw two kids rush the car.

282
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,160
Two? What happened to the third?

283
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,060
Don't know. Says he saw two.

284
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,060
Here's what's weird.

285
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,860
The kids ran off, they opened the doors,

286
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,370
they ripped the victim out, they beat him,

287
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,910
- and then they took off running. - So, what,

288
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,430
you guys got here and scared 'em before they can

289
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,390
- actually take the car? - I don't think so.

290
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,850
We got here right as the SUV was about to hit the alley.

291
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,440
Seemed like a getaway car.

292
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,450
You don't need a getaway car for a carjacking.

293
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,210
No.

294
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,100
Guy's pockets were rabbited. No wallet.

295
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,810
Maybe we're looking at a robbery crew.

296
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,000
Hell of a lot of trouble for a wallet.

297
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,490
Yeah. I don't know.

298
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,560
All right. Keep working the scene.

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,050
I mean, we got one witness. Maybe there're more.

300
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,010
Dig into this Troy.

301
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,890
Search that SUV top to bottom. Whole thing's evidence.

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,940
Yeah.

303
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,690
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,800
- Was that Alanah? - Yeah.

305
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
- Everything good? - Yeah, I think so.

306
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,290
I guess Kathy missed some school pickups

307
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,020
so the teacher had to call DCFS,

308
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,230
but now Makayla and Kathy are back together,

309
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,510
and they're offering Kathy extra support, so...

310
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,470
- That's good. - That's good.

311
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
Okay, where we at?

312
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,150
I connected with Med.

313
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,440
Our two victims, Jeff and Troy, are conscious,

314
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,900
but they're refusing police help.

315
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,310
They don't wanna talk.

316
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,450
We searched the SUV top to bottom.

317
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,890
We found 2 grand in cash

318
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,810
and six wallets with the IDs in 'em.

319
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,650
Upton and Atwater are chasing that right now.

320
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,820
Car's loaded with stuff.

321
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,060
It's like these are street kids.

322
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,850
They're living in there.

323
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,830
Maybe they use the car when it gets cold out.

324
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,400
Right. So we ran those profiles

325
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,560
of those other robbery victims from the six wallets.

326
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,410
Definitely a pattern.

327
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,350
- They're all men? - Yeah.

328
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,330
Three of the IDs have prior pops for solicitation,

329
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,310
so we ran the crime scenes with that information in mind.

330
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,090
First one is five blocks from a male stroll,

331
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,310
second one is two blocks from a corner Vice recently ID'd.

332
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,450
The kids are prostitutes robbing their johns.

333
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah.

334
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,410
Which makes sense why

335
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,470
our witness only saw two kids rush the car.

336
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,210
The third one was already inside.

337
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,400
They take the job, get into a car, go into a quiet place--

338
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,040
the other kids are there waiting to rush the car.

339
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,560
Explains our 2 grand in cash.

340
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,640
So the kids get tired of touching their johns,

341
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,090
find a new way to make money.

342
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,280
I mean, they're doing this to survive, right?

343
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,890
Well, let's run that DCFS list again with this in mind,

344
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,460
loop in Vice, hit every stroll and corner

345
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,630
young prostitutes frequent, any place street kids crash.

346
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,340
We just took their car and all their cash,

347
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,190
so they gotta know the heat's on 'em.

348
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,450
Let's find these kids before they get more desperate.

349
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,640
This case, the kids, the prostitution...

350
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,910
it's starting to remind me

351
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,490
of the case where we lost the baby.

352
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,250
Yeah.

353
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,200
Do you ever wonder if maybe

354
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,510
that's the reason we're even closer now?

355
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,460
Like, why we want to be together all the time,

356
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,020
why we act like a couple...

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,460
because of this terrible thing that happened to us?

358
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Of course it is.

359
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,530
What?

360
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,320
That's not a good thing, Adam.

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,160
- Why not? - Because it's not real.

362
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,090
It's not closeness, it's just trauma.

363
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,700
- It's not real? - No.

364
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,720
- Kim, hold on. - Yeah.

365
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,140
You and I, we've always been us, all right?

366
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,750
- Then we were gonna have a baby. - Yeah.

367
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,070
So we fell in love with something together,

368
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,220
then we lost something together.

369
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,010
I mean, sometimes trauma just brings people closer.

370
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,220
Why is that not real?

371
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,640
Excuse me. We're with Chicago PD.

372
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,130
Looking for a few teenagers that might work this spot.

373
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,990
Can you tell me if you recognize any of these folks?

374
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,820
Wouldn't I be in trouble

375
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,550
if I knew there was hooking going on here?

376
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,410
Bro, I'd be impressed if you didn't know

377
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,270
there was hooking going on here.

378
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,550
We can make it harder on you if you don't talk, buddy.

380
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,270
- Him. - Miguel Reyes?

381
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,090
People here don't tell me their names.

382
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,920
When was the last time he was here?

383
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,420
- Now. - Now?

384
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,110
'Less he got a job.

385
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,260
Usually smokes on the corner by himself.

386
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,470
Thanks. I'm gonna circle around the block.

387
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,560
Yeah, sounds good.

388
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,720
Adam, I think I got eyes. Northwest corner.

389
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,210
And I think he's alone.

390
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,800
All right, copy that. I'm on the way.

391
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,000
He's running!

392
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,560
Chicago PD! Stop!

393
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,560
Adam, southbound on Normal Avenue!

394
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,420
Copy you. I'm headed back for you.

396
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,130
Miguel Reyes, put your hands up right now!

397
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,980
That's barbed wire.

398
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,570
Look around you. You got nowhere to go.

399
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,970
Let's go.

400
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,470
Okay, his name is Miguel Reyes, 18.

401
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,700
Just aged out of care two months ago.

402
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,070
Was removed from his home at age seven due to abuse.

403
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,490
History of complex trauma.

404
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,790
He spent the last decade shuffling through groups homes.

405
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,680
Had any priors?

406
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,900
Yeah. He's got one vandalism charge, but that's it.

407
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,400
Social worker said he's a sweet kid.

408
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,680
Just reactive. He's learned to fight back.

409
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,930
No current address, and besides an aunt in Georgia,

410
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,090
he's got no family. The kid's on his own.

411
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah. Let's do this.

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,750
All right, Miguel.

413
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm gonna explain to you exactly what you're looking at here.

414
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,030
We know you were involved in a string of armed robberies

415
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,000
alongside three other teenagers.

416
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,050
Your last victim, Troy, he had a heart attack.

417
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,750
It almost killed him.

418
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,230
No one killed anybody.

419
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,930
But you're saying you were there?

420
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,390
No, I-I definitely didn't say that.

421
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,450
Miguel, you and your friends--

422
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,990
and they're your friends, right?

423
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,290
Started robbing people

424
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,020
so you wouldn't have to turn tricks anymore.

425
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,630
I can understand that.

426
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
But the problem is you robbed these men.

427
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,830
You beat them, you had a gun, you had a crowbar.

428
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,690
That's aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.

429
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,180
That's decades in jail, okay?

430
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,890
So the best thing that you can do for yourself

431
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,800
and for your friends would be to cooperate with us.

432
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,270
No.

433
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,140
Right.

434
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,220
Miguel...

435
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,280
if you talk to us,

436
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,760
we can explain your story to the state's attorney,

437
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,680
you understand?

438
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,240
We'll tell 'em who you are, who your victims are.

439
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,780
You talk to us, we can help.

440
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,880
I've been helped by people like you my whole life.

441
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm sure that's true.

442
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,490
I don't need any more help.

443
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,600
That I don't believe.

444
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,130
I'm not saying I did anything,

445
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,440
but they're not my friends.

446
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,420
They're my family.

447
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,910
So even if I did know something,

448
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,000
I promise I wouldn't ever tell either of you.

449
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,280
You think he knows we got nothing concrete on him?

450
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,720
It is all circumstantial.

451
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,310
We gonna need this boy to talk.

452
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,750
I say we release him.

453
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,650
He said it himself. Those kids are his family.

454
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,270
He's not gonna talk 'cause of them,

455
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,060
but he will go right back to them if he can.

456
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,370
He's got nowhere else.

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,750
Okay, so let's release him. Just keep eyes on him.

458
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,140
We'll bring 'em all in.

459
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,170
- Kev. - What's up?

460
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,300
Just--quick question.

461
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,430
What did you need when you were first raising Jordan and Vinessa?

462
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,480
Like, what kind of support did you need?

463
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,840
Everything.

464
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,740
Whole time I was...21. Drowning in it.

465
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,690
Yeah, I needed everything.

466
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,340
Okay, thanks.

467
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,050
I'm sorry to bombard you like this.

468
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,580
- It's okay. - Oh, good.

469
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,600
Okay, great, 'cause I just-- I don't know.

470
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
I wanted to let you know that I am here to help

471
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,900
however you need--babysitting, getting help with services,

472
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,150
- whatever you need. - I see my social worker.

473
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,890
I know that, I just--

474
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,420
there can never be too many people, right?

475
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,110
Okay if I say hi to Makayla real quick?

476
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,790
Maybe not the best time.

477
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,320
Sure, of course.

479
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,250
Maybe another time.

480
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,670
I just wanted to know that you're both doing okay.

481
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,740
That's all I--

482
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,530
Kathy, are you okay?

483
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,010
I can't do this anymore.

484
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,140
- What can't you do? - This.

485
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,300
I-I can't be a mom to her.

486
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,360
No, you can. You're doing great, and I'll help you.

487
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,230
I can't do it.

488
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,730
Makayla's with DCFS already.

489
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,700
Kathy, listen to me. You can be her mom.

490
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,750
You're capable, you're so much more than you know--

491
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,870
Just don't. Don't--don't do that.

492
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,640
She is unhappy. I'm not good for her, okay?

493
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,690
I've tried everything.

494
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,790
I take my pills, I go to work,

495
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,620
I see the social worker, everything, and I can't do it.

496
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,220
I understand. I--

497
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,640
My cousin would've never wanted this for her kid.

498
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,150
Makayla was the love of her life.

499
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,300
- She's the love of mine. - Okay, so what if I help you?

500
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,030
What? Who even are you?

501
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,040
I mean, what right have you to be in my home

502
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,000
telling me anything?

503
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,350
- Kathy, please-- - Go.

504
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,140
- Kathy-- - Get out of my house.

505
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

506
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,240
- We lost Miguel. - What?

507
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,060
Kid's a flippin' jackrabbit.

508
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,960
He came straight here after the 21st.

509
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,470
He ducked in and out of,

510
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,660
I don't know, eight alleys, gangways.

511
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,730
I think he squats in one of these buildings on this block.

512
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,180
Yeah.

513
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,290
What's going on? You all right?

514
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,160
Not really.

515
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,470
- I think I made a big mistake-- - Whoa, there he is.

516
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,210
Miguel!

517
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,710
Stop moving.

518
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,630
Are you injured?

519
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,420
Help me. Please, this way.

520
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,270
You gotta tell us what's going on!

521
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,740
Hey, hey, listen! Hey! Slow down! Stop!

522
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,180
Slow down-- we can't help you

523
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870
if you don't talk to us. Kim.

524
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,790
Run, run! Police! Run!

525
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,220
- Stop, stop! - I'll meet you there!

526
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,920
Get over there! Hands on the wall!

527
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,290
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

528
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,870
Help her!

529
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,760
Kim, Kim!

530
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
- The girl. - Oh, my God.

531
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,900
5021 Ida, emergency. Roll an ambo to 1800 Kedzie.

532
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,610
I'm in a vacant on the west side.

533
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,000
Female down. Head trauma.

534
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,960
Got two male offenders fleeing on foot.

535
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,760
- Copy that. - We didn't do this! We brought her home!

536
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,890
What the hell happened to her?

537
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,950
Ambo en route.

538
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,490
- I don't-- - Miguel!

539
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,630
We needed the money, okay?

540
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,780
We were too nervous to do another robbery,

541
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,430
so she was gonna work a normal job.

542
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,030
- Who was the john? - I don't know.

543
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,240
- Who, Miguel? - He freaked out! He beat her!

544
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,140
- Who, Miguel? Who? - I don't know!

545
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,510
- I need a name, tell me! - I don't know!

546
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,730
House is clear. Where's my ambo?

547
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,170
What's her name? Give me her name.

548
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,290
- Lily. - Okay.

549
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,130
Lily, stay with us, all right?

550
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,540
I'm not leaving you. I won't leave.

551
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,230
- Come on, Lily. - You're gonna be okay.

552
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,960
You're not alone.

553
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,260
Both kids are in the wind, but they won't get far.

554
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,250
All of their belongings, last of their cash,

555
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,260
it's all here.

556
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,040
The girl, Lily, is being rushed to surgery.

557
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,060
Doesn't look good.

558
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,570
We still don't know who beat her?

559
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,590
A john. Ruzek's running the car outside.

560
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,530
It's probably his.

561
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,740
It sounds like the two kids drove Lily here

562
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,560
and then Miguel stopped talking, so that's all I got.

563
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,770
- All right, let's find something. - Yeah.

567
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,790
I found the other two kids' IDs.

568
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,320
Samuel Wilton and Michael Jeffries.

569
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,050
16, 17 years old.

570
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,570
Gun.

571
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,970
Car outside is a rental.

572
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,570
Links back to a Robert McKinney.

573
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,480
62, two priors for solicitation, one for a domestic.

574
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,890
I gotta think he's our john.

575
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,590
- You got an address? - Yeah.

576
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,710
- We got this. - All right.

577
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Talked to Platt--she's gonna send two patrol cars

578
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,270
- to the house now-- - He broke both her cheekbones, her skull.

579
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,590
Take it myself.

580
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,660
Wait, what?

581
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,480
Send me the address. Kim and I are on the way right now.

582
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,720
One gsw, and guessing we're gonna

583
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,060
get some good prints lifted from that bar.

584
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,700
He's also got substantial scratching and bruising

585
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,260
on his face and arms. Signs of a struggle.

586
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,050
We're not sure. Looks like multiple offenders.

587
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,500
We're real close to a stroll. Might've picked someone up.

588
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,940
Lily. He picked Lily up.

589
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,210
Beat her, tried to rape her, and then a friend stepped in.

590
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,010
She's a victim on a case you're working?

591
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,580
No, she's an offender.

592
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm gonna go call Voight.

593
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,790
I-is Lily okay?

594
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,540
She's still in surgery.

595
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,140
Miguel, you need to talk to us now.

596
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,630
- Tell me what happened. - No.

597
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,290
- Where are your friends? - I'm not an idiot.

598
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,620
You think I'm gonna tell you that now?

599
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,000
You told me that Lily was gonna do a normal job.

600
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,450
You and your friends were looking out for her,

601
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,430
but she didn't want to do it, so the john got mad,

602
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,070
- beat her, tried to rape her... - Stop.

603
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,330
- You heard screaming... - Stop!

604
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,280
And saved her! Miguel, that is self-defense!

605
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,070
And that is the kind of thing that we can prove!

606
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,540
Not after what we did! We robbed those men!

607
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,830
- We beat them. - I know.

608
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,690
That's what I'm telling you.

609
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,750
But without your friends confirming your story,

610
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,470
without you talking to us,

611
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,680
all I got standing in front of me

612
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,650
is a kid who brutally robs people,

613
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,320
who isn't cooperating,

614
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,020
who told his buddy offenders to run

615
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,860
after you killed a man together.

616
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,780
That's what the state's attorney's gonna see.

617
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,650
Come on, sit down. It's okay, sit.

618
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,440
Miguel.

619
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,120
Son...

620
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,520
You're already going away for the robberies.

621
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,090
I can't help you there.

622
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,500
But the timing matters.

623
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,080
You're a good kid who was dealt a bad hand...

624
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,880
And you played it wrong.

625
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
Miguel, you're still young.

626
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
This is still your life.

627
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,080
And you're gonna spend the next four decades

628
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,200
staring at concrete if you don't talk to me now.

629
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,250
Come on.

630
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,830
But my friends will have a chance.

631
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,320
- No. - No.

632
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,100
I mean, they won't.

633
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
He's telling you the truth

634
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,850
because the chances are we will find them,

635
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
and it's a lot harder to claim self-defense once you've run.

636
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,030
And let me tell you:

637
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,560
if they cross state lines, that's it, we can't help them.

638
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,420
You can't guarantee me that you can help now.

639
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm all they have. They're all that I've ever had.

640
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,590
I need to help them.

641
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,370
No, you need to help yourself right now.

642
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,360
No, no. I'm not gonna hurt them.

643
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,710
There's a chance you guys don't find them,

644
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,810
that they'll have a shot at something.

645
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm done talking to you.

646
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,690
Miguel.

647
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,850
All right, Miguel is not gonna roll on his friends.

648
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,160
So what do we have?

649
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,400
Ballistics did come back

650
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,330
on the 9 millimeter from the shooting at the house,

651
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,440
and it's match for the killing.

652
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Forensics also came back as a match for the SUV.

653
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,200
We got three separate prints on the crowbar.

654
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,550
One of 'em is Miguel's.

655
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,960
All right, what do we have on Michael and Sammie?

656
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,820
Nothing yet.

657
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,240
We're up on buses and train stations.

658
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,630
We've got investigative reports out.

659
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,610
Yeah, I mean, we've been digging,

660
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,780
but they were in foster care for over a decade.

661
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,740
They got no family, no connections to anybody

662
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,690
other than each other. I mean, it's gonna be

663
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,270
tough to pinpoint where they're gonna run to.

664
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,780
We have enough evidence to charge Miguel on all counts.

665
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,050
Okay, so we start processing charges on Miguel.

666
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,910
Maybe once they feel real, it'll scare him into talking.

667
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,120
So that's it?

668
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,900
They're kids.

669
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,540
They were doing this to put a roof over their heads.

670
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,810
They've got these dream houses scribbled in their notebooks.

671
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,680
They're kids with no place to go,

672
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,890
a system that failed them.

673
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,150
Hell, they're robbing their johns,

674
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,850
and the answer is, "They can go to jail"?

675
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,780
That's the best we can do for them?

676
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,510
Look, I get it, but...

677
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,100
they did rob these men.

678
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
One of 'em's dead, and Miguel's not talking, so...

679
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,380
unless you got a better play I'm not thinking of...

680
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,370
I don't have another play.

681
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,690
Okay, so keep searching.

682
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,170
Okay?

684
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,160
Miguel's only chance is we find his friends

685
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,510
so they can corroborate his self-defense story.

686
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,440
- Let's go. - Hello?

687
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,110
- You confronted Kathy? - I went to offer help.

688
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,360
But it turned into accusations?

689
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,540
Well, I didn't mean for it to.

690
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,690
She filed a complaint.

691
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,580
Okay, is this--

692
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,980
is this really what we're gonna talk about?

693
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,240
You're Makayla's social worker,

694
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,920
and we're not gonna talk about Makayla?

695
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,520
You want this to have a clean solution.

696
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,070
Yes, I want this to have a solution.

697
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,990
Well, it's way more complicated than that.

698
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,350
It's also way more complicated than you falsely believing

699
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,760
that everyone here isn't doing their very best.

700
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,790
Yeah, well--I'm-- I know, sorry.

701
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,520
Kathy is dealing with mental issues.

702
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,650
Anxiety, depression.

703
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,840
If we keep Makayla in her care,

704
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,010
there's a thousand possible bad outcomes.

705
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,830
Kathy is telling us it's not best for either of them,

706
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,030
so we find an alternate placement.

707
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,470
- A group home? - For right now, yes.

708
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,420
What if Makayla came home with me?

709
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,420
I know you feel for her,

710
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,480
but there are so many ways to be there for a child

711
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,220
without fostering them.

712
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,040
She's a child who's just experienced trauma,

713
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,450
she's a Black child,

714
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,620
you're a cop with a very demanding job

715
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,540
who's white, who's single.

716
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,080
None of this is to be discouraging.

717
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,770
That's all fine,

718
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,650
but these are very real issues you need to think about.

719
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,540
Makayla deserves someone... committed.

720
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,440
It's just--you can't make a decision like this

721
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,190
in a moment when life seems unfair.

722
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,690
- Hey. Anything? - Nothing.

723
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
The kids moved last night,

724
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,010
and I don't think we clocked 'em.

725
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,680
Hey, uh, might have them.

726
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,500
Patrol car report of a stolen Chevy downtown around 5 A.M.

727
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,480
POD caught it. Two teenage offenders.

728
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,200
Physicals match Michael and Sammie.

729
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,870
There we go. We got a BOLO on that?

730
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,490
Patrol's actually got it in a truck lot on Ashland--

731
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,860
unoccupied.

732
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
That's gotta be them. We'll take it.

733
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,040
There's our Chevy.

734
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,770
Keys are still in the car.

735
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,890
- Hey. - Hey, how you doin'?

736
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,590
Morning. We're with Chicago PD.

737
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,700
We're looking for the two kids that were driving the Chevy

738
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,240
that's parked out front.

739
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,090
You recognize either of these guys?

740
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,290
No. Haven't seem either of them.

741
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,830
Got anybody else working here this morning?

742
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,460
- Just me. - Security cameras?

743
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,680
No. City might have some down the way.

744
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,170
You got none on the lot whatsoever?

745
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,610
No, sorry. Kids do come here to hitch a lot, though.

746
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,850
A lot of trucks move in and out.

747
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,030
Thanks very much.

748
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,730
Listen, I'm gonna go around back.

749
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,870
Yeah.

750
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,480
I'm gonna keep checking, but back looks clear.

751
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,620
Front, too.

752
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,410
We could pull the PODs nearby,

753
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,090
maybe grab whatever semi they hopped into.

754
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,970
We're hours behind them, Adam.

755
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,600
If they're smart, they'll keep switching trucks,

756
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,770
keep hitching.

757
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,580
Already gone.

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,650
Nothing on any PODs.

759
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,060
Yeah, nothing on traffic cams,

760
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,070
no security footage.

761
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,570
There's just every reason to believe

762
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,540
they already crossed state lines.

763
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,620
Process Miguel,

764
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,250
get out leads, messages on Michael and Sammie.

765
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,840
Look, chances are some state policeman will pick 'em up soon.

771
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,050
Okay, Miguel.

772
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,110
Patrol will be here in a few, transport you to County.

773
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,480
- What about Lily? - She's still unconscious.

774
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,750
It's too early to know the damage,

775
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,120
but they think there will be some.

776
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,250
- I can let you know. - Okay.

777
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,290
Miguel, when we were in that abandoned house,

778
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,850
when you told Michael and Sammie to run,

779
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,960
you said, "I'll meet you there."

780
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,240
Is "There" where you were gonna build a home together?

781
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,130
Where is "There"?

784
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,440
Your friends ran. They crossed state lines.

785
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,450
I told you before what that would mean,

786
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,900
what their chances would be.

787
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,660
They will be picked up by state police

788
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,080
who are looking for them.

789
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,820
I know you wanna protect them.

790
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,760
That's why you're doing all this.

791
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,090
I do, too.

792
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,570
So tell me, Miguel,

793
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,340
where is "There"?

794
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,850
They're in Iowa.

795
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,650
Yeah, I've got credible information

796
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,780
that our offenders are fleeing to Iowa,

797
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,520
so I've limited the investigative alerts

798
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,320
to your jurisdiction alone.

799
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,510
No, nothing down south.

800
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,220
No, no other BOLOs or alerts needed.

801
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,760
Yeah, Iowa. Thank you.

802
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,390
- You're still here? - Yeah.

804
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,210
I'm just finishing up.

805
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,410
Sorry we can't solve every case and save every kid.

806
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,110
You know, I never told anybody this,

807
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,840
didn't even tell Adam...

808
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,310
but a couple of months after I lost the baby,

809
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,270
I looked up that girl that I saved in the motel room.

810
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,750
Really?

811
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Think I thought it would make me feel something.

812
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,270
Called her mom.

813
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,630
Said she hadn't seen her daughter in months.

814
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,650
She'd run away, and she was gone.

815
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,220
What would you think if I took Makayla in?

816
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,790
I think that would change her life.

817
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,910
I know I'm not her family, I know I'm a cop, I'm white.

818
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,550
I know these are real things.

819
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,810
You're right.

820
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,980
You are not her family and you are white,

821
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,370
so you're gonna be up against a lot.

822
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,200
I think I can do right by her.

823
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,960
Kim, you asked me what I needed before.

824
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,730
It wasn't about me, it was about what they needed.

825
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,480
I had to keep my family together.

826
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,330
Had to make sure that Vinessa and Jordan

827
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,080
didn't get stuck in a system

828
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,830
that I knew they couldn't get out of.

829
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,020
So, yeah, it was impossible.

830
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,210
We did need everything.

831
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,100
I just--

832
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,150
I was theirs...

833
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
you know what I'm saying?

834
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,510
I loved them, and that took care of the rest.

835
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,540
And if you got that, you'll be good.

836
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,020
- I was coming to find you. - Yeah?

837
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,640
Hey, do you wanna get some dinner?

838
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,580
Before you say yes, I want to tell you

839
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,800
that I'm gonna turn off our radios as a preemptive strike.

840
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,470
That way, you'll have to talk to me.

841
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,300
Kathy gave up her parental rights.

842
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,200
No. Why?

843
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,680
Because she loves Makayla and wants what's best for her.

844
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,710
- But where's Makayla gonna go? - With me.

845
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,640
Really?

846
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,200
Like, on a temporary basis?

847
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,140
Well, for now, but Alanah's working on it.

848
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,610
There's a lot of red tape, logistics, but it's possible

849
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,360
it could become a more permanent situation.

850
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,370
- Like you fostering her? - Yeah.

851
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,990
- Really? - Yeah.

852
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,400
Okay. Have you thought that through?

853
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,270
I mean, what would that even look like?

854
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,680
- I don't know. - Kim?

855
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,090
Adam, you can say whatever you want to say.

856
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,810
It's not about what I want to say, it's just, I mean--

857
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,590
that's a lot, you know?

858
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,290
You know you can't replace what we lost.

859
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,530
I'm not trying to.

860
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,520
I feel something for this kid. I do.

861
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,210
- I feel close to her. - I understand.

862
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,130
But just yesterday, we're talking about trauma

863
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,230
and you told me how that's not real, right?

864
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,640
Right. Well, what if you're right?

865
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,000
What if it doesn't matter?

866
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,090
I know that this might change what we have,

867
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,760
you know, what we can have.

868
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,660
Kim, that's not why I'm saying any of this.

869
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,820
It's just not.

870
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm always gonna be in your life.

871
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,700
That's not gonna change.

872
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,260
It's just this is, like...

873
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,510
I'm a little worried that this is a reaction,

874
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,420
that you just can't stand the idea

875
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,570
of seeing another kid lost.

876
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,380
Hey, you.

877
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,190
So I know all this has been pretty weird, probably, right?

878
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,860
Look, this might be another big, weird change,

879
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,280
but I was thinking, if you're okay with it,

880
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,190
that maybe you could come home with me.

881
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,970
You know, we could be like a family

882
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,240
and take care of each other-- if you're okay with it.

883
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,440
Okay.

884
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,230
Okay.

885
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,500
Okay.

886
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,260
Okay, all right, okay.

887
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,790
Just hop on in.

888
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,740
Hmm, this thing.

889
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,280
- You want me to... - Is there--yeah.

890
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,620
Why don't you do it and I'll just--I'll watch.

891
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,390
All right, you're all set.

892
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,420
I'll be seeing you both very soon.

893
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,430
- You guys have fun. - Bye, Alanah.

894
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,680
Just you and me.

895
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,190
Yeah?
