18
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,430
My name is Barry Allen,

19
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,590
and I am the fastest man alive.

20
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,310
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

21
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,000
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

22
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,960
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

23
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,060
After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse,

24
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,000
I ran back in time

25
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

26
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,450
I restored the timeline to how it was,

27
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,550
only to find things weren't as I left them.

28
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,630
I brought new threats to our world,

29
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,170
and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.

30
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,350
I am The Flash.

31
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Previously on "The Flash"...

32
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,340
They don't see your potential.

33
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,090
- I do. - You want to train?

34
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,060
I'll train you.

35
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,840
You're Allen's friend, Dr. Snow.

36
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,300
I'm begging you, don't turn her in.

37
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,080
I will do anything you want.

38
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
Tender your resignation, effective immediately.

39
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,110
It's a story--it used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

42
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,780
Something's changed with our future.

43
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,890
- God, what did I do? - My brother's dead.

44
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,360
Now I'll never make another memory with Dante again.

45
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,510
You're only a man, Flash.

46
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,390
But I am a god.

47
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,300
I am Savitar.

48
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,030
Now we know Alchemy's just a lackey.

49
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,600
Julian, become my servant once more.

50
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,090
Become Alchemy.

53
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,930
It's been six months since I arrived here in India.

54
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,920
Though I have faith it's out there,

55
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,000
the voice that once drove me has waned.

56
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,720
And I fear my quest may be for naught.

57
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,770
Julian, come quick.

58
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,970
I think we found it.

59
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,310
This is it. Here, hold this.

60
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,090
This is it.

61
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,690
I can feel it.

62
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,150
I think we should wait before we open it.

63
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,830
It needs to be set free.

68
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,740
Took the words right out of my mouth.

69
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,520
Well, I guess Earth-19's Christmas is just like ours.

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,060
Some traditions are multi-versal.

71
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,100
So, um...

72
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,640
any more info on Savitar?

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,960
Nope, all the we know is that he's a speed god

74
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,760
and you're the only one who can see him.

75
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,810
All right, well, Alchemy is Savitar's high priest

76
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,180
and he gets his power from the stone

77
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,520
that he uses to create meta, so I was thinking

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,930
if we can find out what that thing is,

79
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,660
maybe we can figure out how to stop him.

80
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,480
I want to see if I can dig something up.

81
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,770
I know this is our first Christmas together as a couple

83
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,970
and I want everything to be perfect, but...

84
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,760
You need to get to this.

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,310
Yes--no, I totally get it.

86
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,010
I got a dissertation here from Oxford University

87
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,170
about the myth of an ancient Hindu weapon

88
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,970
called the Brahmastra.

89
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,900
Legendary artifact with incredible powers,

90
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,580
capable of--wait for it--

91
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,420
Creating metas.

92
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,830
Creating meta-humans.

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Guys, that looks just like Alchemy's stone.

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,180
More importantly...

95
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,610
look who wrote this paper.

97
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,910
Julian?

98
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,470
Love what you've done with the place.

99
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,300
Allen.

100
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,970
Thought we had a deal.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,390
I keep your frosty friend's secret,

102
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,710
and you never darken these doors again, remember?

103
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,410
I just need some information from you

104
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,240
about that stone that Alchemy uses.

105
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,020
And you've come to me because?

107
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,810
Apparently, you know a lot about it.

108
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,590
Well, why don't you tell me everything you know?

109
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,130
And you'll never hear from me again.

110
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,970
Fine.

111
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,820
Many years ago, I heard about the Brahmastra,

112
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,540
or as it's colloquially called,

113
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,860
the Philosopher's Stone.

114
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,540
It is said to be the first object to give human beings powers.

115
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,160
Like the Particle Accelerator.

116
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,860
Over the years, it got lost.

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,970
I became quite obsessed with trying to find it.

118
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,560
Did every piece of available research I could

119
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,500
and much to my parents' dismay,

120
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,030
I used my future inheritance

121
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,300
and funded an expedition to try and find it.

122
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,470
But we never found it.

123
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,860
Pretty soon after that, I came here.

124
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,890
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

125
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,020
In your research, have you ever come across

126
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,550
the name Savitar?

127
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,500
How do you know that name?

128
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,060
I've done some research of my own.

129
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,090
As far as I know,

130
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,340
Savitar is the first meta with speed.

131
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,970
That's all I know, Allen.

132
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,800
And I suggest that you don't waste your time on this.

133
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,510
Move on.

134
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,430
All right.

135
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,450
Julian.

137
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,860
Here you go.

138
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,350
One whiff of aliens and all the crazies come out.

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm gonna be buried under these alien files

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,150
until next Christmas.

141
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,470
Well, if by some Christmas miracle

142
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,940
you dig yourself out sooner,

143
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,710
we do it up at the West house on Christmas Eve.

144
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,510
Turkey, tree, Grandma Esther's eggnog,

145
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,720
the whole shebang-- and we would love for you to come.

146
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,460
One condition: I bring the nog.

147
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,450
My Grandma Millie's recipe, it is gonna knock your socks off.

148
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,810
Oh, wait a minute.

149
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,970
We gonna have a little nog-off.

150
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,920
Really?

151
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,810
Grandma Esther versus Grandma Millie.

152
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh, you know I love a challenge, Joe West.

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
May the best grandma win.

154
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,790
I am so sorry for your grandma.

155
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,750
We'll see.

156
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,030
- Fine. I'll pick you up, all right? - Christmas miracle.

158
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,010
I told everyone inside I'd let them live

159
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,990
if they followed instructions.

160
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,330
But I tricked them.

161
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,490
Which is so me.

162
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,370
Give it up, Trickster!

163
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,060
Hiya, Swiftie.

164
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,560
Will you do me the honor of allowing me to kill you?

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
You're out of ammo.

166
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,700
But I'm not out of bombs.

167
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,860
What do you say we take in the afterlife, big boy?

168
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,130
- Nice timing. - You're welcome.

169
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,730
There's something wrong with my eyes.

170
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,830
I'm seeing double.

171
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,610
The Flash hit me too hard!

172
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,010
I'm gonna sue you, saucer-head!

173
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,170
One day, I'll own that helmet,

174
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,380
and I'll use it as an ashtray or a candy dish.

175
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,180
No, wait, a hubcap!

176
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,200
I had that, kid.

177
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,510
That's what I always say.

178
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,170
Let me go.

179
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,870
Especially when I didn't have it.

180
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,840
So I'm assuming you didn't come all the way to Earth-3

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
to stop my Trickster.

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,260
I have something I need to talk to you about.

183
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,560
A speedster.

184
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,520
Calls himself Savitar.

185
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,480
- So... Savitar. - Yeah.

186
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,430
Apparently, you've grown powerful enough

187
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,690
to challenge him.

188
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,010
Who is he?

189
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,720
Don't know, never seen him.

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
You're the first speedster I know of who has.

191
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,330
But every story I ever heard about Savitar

192
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,610
is basically the same.

193
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,360
Savitar was the first man ever granted speed.

194
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,720
And over time, he became the god of motion,

195
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,370
the fastest of us all.

196
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,520
Before Savitar graces an Earth with his presence...

197
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,110
He sends a predecessor to prepare for his arrival.

198
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,500
Alchemy.

199
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,390
What's he preparing for?

200
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,460
A battle with you.

201
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,570
Why me?

202
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,240
You're threatening his power.

203
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,660
How do you know all this?

204
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,360
Speed Force myths, legends, rumors.

205
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,720
If Savitar's come for you once,

206
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,170
he'll be back.

207
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,390
Then I'll be ready.

208
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,830
We'll be ready.

209
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,330
Run! Wallace, run!

210
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,980
You got to torque to the left!

211
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,940
- How'd I do? - How'd you do?

212
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,250
Oh, I don't know, why don't you see for yourself.

213
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,880
Hold up, are you saying I'm faster than Barry?

214
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,470
I'm saying that at this point in his training,

215
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,100
you're faster than Barry.

216
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,430
You're faster than Barry, you're faster than Barry,

217
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,880
you're faster than Barry!

218
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,690
- We got to tell everyone. - Not a good idea.

219
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,860
- Why not? - Self-preservation, basically.

220
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,620
Look, Wallace, you have tremendous potential.

221
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,850
Yes, clearly, but one thing I've learned

222
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,810
since coming to this Earth is you do not trifle

223
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,460
with the West household.

224
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,850
No, you know-no, say you're with me.

225
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,550
- Yeah, I'm with you. - Yeah!

226
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,510
Now, we're gonna work on your--your--yeah, your dodging

227
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,540
and your weaving.

228
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,670
I've read every Hindu textbook there is on mythology

229
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,870
and spirits and demigods and nothing.

230
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,850
No mention of Savitar, not once.

231
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,840
In my experience, the answers usually tend to come in time.

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,920
Yeah, I can't just sit back

233
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,000
and wait for Savitar or Alchemy to attack.

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,620
You can't worry about what may or may not lie ahead.

235
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,710
Besides...

236
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,640
it's Christmas.

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,400
A time to be with the ones you care about.

238
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,320
You know, it's just, Savitar's still out there.

239
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,340
Yeah, but not right now.

240
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,740
And your beautiful girlfriend is.

241
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,020
Get your head out of the books

242
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,340
and back into your life with your loved ones

243
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,350
while you have them.

244
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,930
Hey, Jay thinks he figured out a way to find the stone.

245
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,440
You okay?

246
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,090
I don't know.

247
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,570
I keep seeing my brother.

248
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,870
Everywhere-here, in the cortex...

249
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,580
Well, this is your first Christmas since Dante died.

250
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,230
Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you.

251
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,430
Yeah.

252
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,580
Probably.

253
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,450
There was this one Christmas, big family affair.

254
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,080
and Dante and I, you know,

255
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,100
we used to fight all the time as kids,

256
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,910
but that one Christmas,

257
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,460
we didn't fight.

258
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,460
We just sat and we talked and we drank

259
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,140
a whole bottle of whiskey, and...

260
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,520
that whole night, we were laughing.

261
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,250
It's...

262
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,100
And that one night--

263
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,790
that one night, it was like we felt like brothers.

264
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,170
The last Christmas before my dad died,

265
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,910
it snowed and snowed.

266
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,630
He and I just sat inside, watching old movies

267
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,770
while the whole world turned white.

268
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,950
It was magical.

269
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,750
Are we about to be the Grinches this year?

270
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,900
Nice use of restraint.

271
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,190
Yeah, well, I shopped,

272
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,210
and I shopped, and now,

273
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,310
I am ready to drop into your arms.

274
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,580
I'm sorry I missed Christmas shopping with you.

275
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,230
It's okay. I have everything I need.

276
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,750
So are you as excited to give me my present

277
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,790
as I am to give you yours?

278
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,060
Yeah, of course.

279
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,720
Definitely. Yeah.

280
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,920
You did get me something, right?

281
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,840
I did get you something, yeah.

282
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,440
I just--I haven't wrapped it yet, is all.

283
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,630
- Okay. - Okay.

284
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,530
Okay, um, by the way, after you told me about

285
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,410
Julian's archeological dig,

286
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,420
I started doing some digging of my own.

287
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,560
Turns out, a few years ago,

288
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,420
four scientists were killed in an excavation in India

289
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,950
and Julian was the point person.

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
He didn't mention that.

291
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,690
You said he was obsessed with that stone for years.

292
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,810
What if he was covering something up?

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,340
Or someone?

294
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,360
You think this is about Alchemy?

295
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,390
There's only one way to find out.

296
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,540
Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone.

297
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,040
I think he found it back on that archeological dig.

298
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,830
You think he's working with Doctor Alchemy?

299
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,680
He's not answering my calls.

300
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,210
Hey, everyone.

301
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,810
Gang's all here, what's going on?

302
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,620
I think that Julian is connected to Doctor Alchemy.

303
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,020
Jay, we got a hit.

305
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,760
There's energy coming from the top of the Schults building.

306
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,830
- That's the stone. - Are you ready?

307
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,770
- Ready. - All right.

308
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm coming, too.

309
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,040
- No you're not. - No.

310
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,590
Dad, I'm ready.

311
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,490
You--just tell them about how fast I am.

312
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,080
Tell them about the training.

313
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,640
- Training? - Training?

314
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,540
Training. The vocal training.

315
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,070
Because we're thinking of going caroling.

316
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,540
We're gonna talk about this later.

317
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,610
We're definitely gonna talk about it.

318
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,830
With energy form this stone,

319
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,960
and this building as a refractor,

320
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,370
I shall restore the powers of all the metas from Flashpoint.

321
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,240
They will become the servants of Savitar.

322
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,870
It's over, Alchemy!

323
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,350
Please tell me you're seeing him.

324
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,990
I see him.

325
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,510
We have to take him together.

326
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,820
No, I'll cover Savitar,

327
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,670
you just get that stone!

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is not your fight, Garrick.

329
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,340
Julian.

330
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,910
Where am I?

331
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,780
What's going on?

332
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,980
Let's just say you're gonna be our guest for a while.

333
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,190
You.

334
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,670
I always suspected you had your own private facility

335
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,760
for holding enemies.

336
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,480
You care to explain what I'm doing in it?

337
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,360
- I know you're Alchemy, Julian. - What?

338
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Turning innocent people into meta-humans,

339
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,860
worshipping this Savitar?

340
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,680
Sorry, um, I'm still not following.

341
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,920
You think that I'm Alchemy?

342
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,870
That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.

343
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,860
Is that a mask?

344
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,280
I've never seen that before in my life.

345
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,460
I caught you!

346
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,160
I caught you wearing this mask.

347
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,390
You're trying to set me up.

348
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,180
You're framing me, aren't you?

349
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,250
The Flash, of all the people, you're setting me up.

350
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,450
- The hero. - You're insane.

351
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,730
The great hero!

352
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,360
I want my phone call, when do I get my phone call?

353
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,830
How you feeling?

354
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,740
Not too bad for a guy

355
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,230
that got beat up by a myth.

356
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,170
- Yeah? - You stopped him.

357
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,420
Well done, Barry.

358
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,320
It was nice, having you out there with me.

359
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,030
Yeah, I never had a sidekick.

360
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,540
- Oh, I'm your sidekick? - Well, as a senior partner.

361
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,990
Senior citizen is more like it.

362
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,810
I'll bet your dad would've been proud of you.

363
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,760
Right?

364
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,660
Hey, why won't you just take it easy, all right?

365
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,080
- I¡¯ll see you in a little bit. - Yeah.

366
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,030
What do you think about what Julian was saying?

367
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,910
I know that every bad guy we've ever had

368
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,330
has pretended to be our best friend, while really being

369
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,290
an evil, murderous bastard, but...

370
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,220
I think if he's lying,

371
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,230
he sure believes the hell out of his own lie.

372
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,070
Okay, well what do we think about this box?

373
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,170
It's creepy.

374
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,970
Like, "Indiana Jone" melt your face creepy.

375
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,880
Have you guys figured out anything about it yet?

376
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,120
It's nothing.

377
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,800
It's something.

378
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,190
No, I mean the box is literally nothing.

379
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,250
I've run it through every possible test I can think of--

380
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,140
MRI, X-ray, mass spectrometer, the photon shifter.

381
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,650
Not a single reading. Nothing.

382
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,810
It's like the box

383
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,140
doesn't even exist.

384
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,320
Two weeks ago, I almost lost you to Alchemy,

385
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,350
then last week aliens.

386
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,550
- My heart can't take it, Wally. - Dad, he gets it.

387
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,320
- Iris, does he? - I think so, yeah.

388
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,740
And you...

389
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,300
A couple weeks ago. You were telling me

390
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,170
how you believed in me and my instincts,

391
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,260
and now you're encouraging Wally to do exactly the opposite?

392
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,250
I don't know how much encouraging he needed.

393
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,020
What's the deal with you?

394
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,340
You have some psychotic need to make other people like you

395
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,430
no matter what?

396
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,890
I wouldn't call it psychotic.

397
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,400
No, my deal is,

398
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,190
I find people's true talents,

399
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,610
and I just marshal them along.

400
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,350
Do you even have your own opinions?

401
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,160
Stop. Stop banging on H.R.

402
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
This was all me, okay?

403
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,530
I pushed him to train me.

404
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,750
I pushed him to help me.

405
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,190
Wasn't like anyone else was lining up to do it.

406
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,560
Hey. What's up?

407
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,800
It's Wally.

408
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,440
I don't get it, Bar, it's like his brain goes to sleep

409
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,180
and somebody else is at the wheel.

410
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,960
Have you been losing time? Blacking out?

411
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,380
Hours passing, waking up somewhere different?

412
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,060
Not being sure of how you got there.

413
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,820
- No. - No?

414
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,680
No!

415
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,950
I've had enough of these baseless accusations

416
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,780
and ridiculous theories of yours.

417
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,400
Julian, I'm trying to help you!

418
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,920
But you need to trust me.

419
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,630
Says the man in a mask.

420
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,400
No, you're right.

421
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,020
I should've known.

422
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,220
I should've guessed it.

423
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,100
The unexplained absences, your passion for metas.

424
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,700
Your general thumbing your nose at authority.

425
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm sure you had a good laugh behind my back.

426
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,870
I actually wished I could've told you before.

427
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,350
So why tell me now?

428
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,590
Because I need you to trust me, Julian.

429
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,930
You are Alchemy.

430
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,500
I just don't think you're aware of it.

431
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,400
Now, have you been blacking out?

432
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,960
Yes.

433
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,080
When did it start?

434
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,400
My sister, Emma, died when I was 20.

435
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,170
And it really broke the family up, you know?

436
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,200
Mom and Dad weren't speaking,

437
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,740
they wouldn't even stay at the house.

438
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,570
One night, I was there alone,

439
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,270
and she came back to me.

440
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,120
She stood right in front of me,

441
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,880
clear as day--a ghost or a vision, I don't know,

442
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,860
but...

443
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,520
she was real.

444
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,060
What happened?

445
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,160
She told me about the stone.

446
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
She told me where to find it,

447
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,210
she told me that if I got it,

448
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,680
then it would bring us back together again.

449
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,930
And at that point, mate,

450
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,720
I would've done anything to have her back.

451
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,790
That's what I did.

452
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,500
I mounted an expedition to India.

453
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,220
Days we searched, weeks.

454
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,340
Nothing.

455
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,940
And then we found it.

456
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,250
And the next thing I remember, I woke up in the hotel room.

457
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,260
I...

458
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,540
didn't remember anything,

459
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,710
and that's when the blackouts started happening.

460
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,960
There was a news report saying that

461
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,430
every other member of my team had been found...

462
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,600
dead at the site.

463
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,130
I panicked, I thought they were gonna blame me for their deaths,

464
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,100
so I ran.

465
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,770
I ran to America.

466
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,460
What happens when you black out, Julian?

467
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,960
How does it start?

468
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,600
I hear the voice.

469
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,830
Cisco.

470
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,480
You're losing it, man,

471
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,650
you're losing it.

472
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,930
Stop scaring me!

473
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,230
Whatever you are, it's not cool, okay?

474
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,200
I know exactly what you are.

475
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,620
You are a figment of my grief.

476
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Please just leave.

477
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,340
I can't do that, Cisco.

478
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,350
This is not real.

479
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,040
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic. Caitlin!

480
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,350
If you leave,

481
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,650
I'm gonna have to leave, too.

482
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,570
So you're telling me that -- that

483
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,250
every time I'm blacking out...

484
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,710
You've become Alchemy.

485
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,970
That's impossible.

486
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,370
Alchemy is a monster,

487
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,910
he's been terrorizing people for years.

488
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,230
Look, it's not you.

489
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,460
Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.

490
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,330
I know that this is hard to believe,

491
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,180
but you have to start accepting what's happening to you.

492
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,050
Don't you want us to be together again?

493
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,600
The stone.

494
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,130
It's the key to everything.

495
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,980
It can transform people.

496
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,930
Open it and I can be reborn.

497
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
We can be together again.

498
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,060
We can have that bottle of whiskey.

499
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,630
After all, it is Christmas, hermano.

500
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,010
It's the time of miracles.

501
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,730
I just want this to be real.

502
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,130
Just open the box.

503
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,300
I love you, Cisco.

504
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,250
Dante.

505
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,490
Dante?

506
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,720
What's that?

507
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,290
- Guys, what's going on? - Cisco's workshop.

508
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,990
Barry, he opened the box.

509
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,180
Wait.

510
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,610
Cisco?

511
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,060
Bow to your god.

512
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,620
What is happening?

513
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,360
We can't see it,

514
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,950
just like at Alchemy's lair.

515
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,450
Savitar's loose.

516
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey, Jay, Jay, you're still too badly hurt.

517
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,480
Remember: dodge and weave.

518
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,210
Wally, no!

519
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,450
I can see him.

520
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,080
Great. Get his attention.

521
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,980
Yo, metal mouth.

522
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,100
Clearly, nobody taught you how to play nice with others.

523
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,340
Cisco? Cisco, you have to close the box!

524
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,310
I'm gonna save Dante.

525
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,420
It's -- that's not Dante, it's Savitar.

526
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,960
Please, he's using your memories against you!

527
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,580
You're a good brother, Cisco.

528
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,110
Cisco, we're running out of time.

529
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,810
Please, just hand me the box.

530
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,350
I won't lose him again.

531
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,710
I will not lose my brother again!

532
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,200
Cisco, Dante is gone.

533
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,270
I'm so sorry, but there is nothing you can do about it.

534
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,900
But there are people you can save right now.

535
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,520
If you don't close that box,

536
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,970
Barry and Wally will die.

537
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,180
If you do, we can't be together.

538
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,810
Cisco, listen to me!

539
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,450
Don't.

540
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,510
Lo siento, hermano.

541
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,350
Thanks.

542
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,840
You kidding? That was awesome.

543
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,450
Are you sure you're okay?

544
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,940
Still in one piece.

545
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,730
I don't know what happened.

546
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,780
So now that the box is closed,

547
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,480
Savitar's, what, gone for good?

548
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,270
I don't know, but we need to find out.

549
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,250
Cisco?

550
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,370
If we can't use this box,

551
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,390
Julian, he may be our only link

552
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,950
to Savitar now, right?

553
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,740
I think we can use both of them.

554
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,180
If Caitlin's right and this thing

555
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,540
messes with brainwaves,then I have a plan.

556
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,250
You put my son's life in danger again.

557
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,850
And he saved Barry's life.

558
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,940
Joe, why...

559
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,650
why do you think I help Wally?

560
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,190
'Cause I'm selfish, I get something--

561
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,210
I don't get anything out of it.

562
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,510
I help Wally 'cause the kid is special.

563
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,470
He's extraordinary.

564
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,990
His powers are extraordinary and--look, I get it.

565
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm--I'm not his dad and I don't have the same

566
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,870
safety concerns as you, of course not,

567
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,600
but Joe, one thing I do know,

568
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,620
the longer you deny someone their potential,

569
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,930
the more they're gonna look for it elsewhere.

570
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,840
So what am I doing here?

571
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
Okay, Julian, today when I was fighting Savitar,

572
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,500
it--he and Alchemy, they had the same voice.

573
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,520
All right, what does that mean?

574
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,920
I don't think there is an Alchemy,

575
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,500
I think it's Savitar speaking through you.

576
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Savitar clearly possesses someone who rallies worshippers.

577
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,170
But he's like a poltergeist, he needs a medium to manifest himself.

578
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,070
You.

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,370
Right, but what does that mean?

580
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,030
We think we figured out a way

581
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,630
to sync your brain to the stone.

582
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,400
And it'll allow us to speak directly to Savitar.

583
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,070
I thought--

584
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,620
If you want to try to be free of this,

585
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,960
you need to trust us.

586
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,830
I've never liked you, Allen.

587
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,010
Yeah.

588
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,630
Having a little s¨¦ance with your friends now

589
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,040
is not gonna help change that fact.

590
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,590
You do know that.

591
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,950
Fine, I'll try it.

592
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,660
Deep breaths.

593
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,340
- Okay? - Yeah.

594
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,050
You're gonna count backwards from ten.

595
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,500
Te--

596
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,590
That was quick.

597
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,380
Okay, so, um, how long till this works?

598
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,830
Not really sure, it may take a minute for his brain waves--

599
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,880
Hello, Barry.

600
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,020
It's been a while.

601
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,850
Savitar?

602
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,580
None of you are on your knees.

603
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,460
It's a smart move to bow before a deity.

604
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,790
You're not God.

605
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,380
To be a god, you just have to make people

606
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,840
believe you are.

607
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,340
No one believes in you.

608
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,290
You should, Iris.

609
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,580
I hold the power of life and death over all of you.

610
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,320
How do you know so much about us?

611
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,750
I know you, Caitlin.

612
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,410
Cisco, Joe, Wally.

613
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,450
The fake Wells.

614
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,570
I know your fears and I know your weaknesses.

615
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,950
I know you better than you know yourselves.

616
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,830
I know your destinies.

617
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,640
One shall betray you.

618
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,630
One shall fall.

619
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,480
One will suffer a fate far worse than death.

620
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,670
This is the knowledge I have for you.

621
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,020
About your everlasting damnation.

622
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,740
Who are you?

623
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,340
I am the future, Flash.

624
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,690
What do you want from us?

625
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,810
Everything!

626
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,360
Everything you took from me, I want it back.

627
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,670
And I'm gonna take it back.

628
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,990
Then, I will destroy you.

629
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,890
Then why haven't you already?

630
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,290
If you're all-powerful, then why don't you just

631
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,620
go ahead and kill us all now, be done with it?

632
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,090
Because you can't.

633
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,140
You did this to me.

634
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,600
You trapped me in eternity.

635
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,970
Your future self-- you did this to me, Barry.

636
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,340
And now the age of my revenge rises.

637
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,150
My freedom is at hand.

638
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,190
You will feel my wrath.

639
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,440
The wrath of Savitar!

640
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,430
Did it work?

641
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,710
That was so scary.

642
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,710
I mean, that was-- was it not truly frightening,

643
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,560
what the voice and the prophesies and the--

644
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,720
it was--I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?

645
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.

646
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,510
Do you think the things that he said about

647
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,440
one of us betraying him and one of us dying

648
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,890
could really be true?

649
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,690
I mean, if it really was future Barry

650
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,330
that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere,

651
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,690
then maybe he knows what happens to future us.

652
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,840
He doesn't.

653
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,300
He's never getting out of wherever he's trapped.

654
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,590
So how are we supposed to stop him?

655
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,030
The stone.

656
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,820
Jay's right, the stone has been the key to everything.

657
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,220
It's--it's how he controlled Julian,

658
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,740
it's how he's created more metas.

659
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,270
So we destroy the stone and Savitar is gone for good.

660
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,000
It's impossible to destroy.

661
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,900
It's been around forever, there's a reason for that.

662
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,960
Why don't we just bury it again,

663
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,740
put it back in the ground where you found it?

664
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,130
"Jumanji"

665
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,000
Someone would just find it and we'd be right back

666
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,100
where we started.

667
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,110
We need to make that box disappear forever.

668
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,110
There's only one thing we can do with it.

669
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,050
Throw it into the Speed Force.

670
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,430
- Wait, you can do that? - Oh, yeah.

671
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,160
The Speed Force is eternity itself,

672
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,840
an endless void of time and energy.

673
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,160
It'd be like trying to find it after it got lost in space.

674
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,270
But that stone is loaded with gravimetric force.I mean,

675
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,500
I don't think you could run fast enough

676
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,910
to reach the Speed Force and carry that at the same time.

677
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,350
He can with my help.

678
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,820
We run as fast as we can.

679
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,490
You trail behind me, siphon off some of my speed,

680
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,340
combine it with your own, and when you have enough,

681
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,480
throw that thing deep into the Speed Force.

682
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,230
And that would work?

683
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,800
We need to find out.

684
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,350
Sure you're up for this, Flash?

685
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,600
You got it, Flash.

686
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,250
I'll let you know when you reach optimal speed.

687
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,260
All right.

688
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,160
Ready...go!

689
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,250
Jay's moving really fast, this might actually work.

690
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,930
Now, Barry!

691
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,830
In other legal news, the highly publicized trial

693
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,490
of Jared Morillo, AKA "Plunder," comes to a close.

694
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,910
Morillo was found guilty of grand theft

695
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,400
and aggravated assault after he was caught by the Flash

696
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,320
robbing the Central City Museum earlier this year.

697
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,390
Don't!

698
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,410
Please don't!

699
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,420
Don't do this.

700
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,460
Now, finally, I am free of you.

701
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,500
Barry, I love you.

702
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,070
No, don't say that, all right?

703
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,140
You're gonna be all right.

704
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,330
- I'm begging you, just-- - Barry!

705
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,750
You lose, Barry.

706
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,560
No!

707
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,870
Iris. Iris, hey...

708
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,540
No. Iris.

709
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,620
Iris, Iris...

710
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,490
Jay?

711
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,800
What the hell was that? Where was I?

712
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,200
The future.

713
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,550
I've never run to the future.

714
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,450
I've traveled to the past,

715
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,300
but I always came back to the present.

716
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,180
I saw myself.

717
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,710
And Iris. And

718
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,030
Savitar, what--

719
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,510
he killed her.

720
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,400
That's five months from now.

721
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,690
Is that actually gonna happen?

722
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,650
- I don't know. - You don't--

723
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,230
You shouldn't have seen that.

724
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,160
This doesn't make sense, we--

725
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,170
we just got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.

726
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,590
I mean, Savitar shouldn't have even been there!

727
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,940
Oh, my God.

728
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,090
This is where the newspaper in the time vault changed.

729
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,360
The byline, this is why it's not Iris, this...

730
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,990
Iris didn't write that story anymore

731
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,920
eight years from now, because...

732
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,980
she's dead.

733
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,070
Barry...

734
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,780
I just watched her die.

735
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I saw myself try to save her, but I wasn't fast enough.

736
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,110
Jay, tell me that this isn't my destiny.

737
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,890
What you saw was one possibility of the future.

738
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,160
What may be, or what may not.

739
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,660
Okay, then I can stop this from happening.

740
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,840
- I can run back there-- - You can't go back there.

741
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,010
Not again, not ever.

742
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,990
All right, then I'll figure out exactly how it happened,

743
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,210
how we wind up on that street,

744
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,870
and I'll just make sure that we don't go there.

745
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,400
- And if we don't go there-- - Barry!

746
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,740
This is why speedsters don't travel to the future.

747
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,480
Nobody should know this much about their own.

748
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,770
Just as their are infinite Earths in the multiverse,

749
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,310
there are infinite possibilities to the future.

750
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,500
It's always bending, always changing.

751
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,400
Every decision you make creates another alternative.

752
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,070
I won't let Iris die.

753
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,850
The future isn't written yet.

754
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,340
And it might not even turn out to be what you saw.

755
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,180
You need to focus on the here and now.

756
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,080
You have to live your life.

757
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,100
- Hey, guys. - Hey.

758
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,440
Are you okay? You and Jay disappeared, and...

759
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,950
Naw, I'm okay.

760
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,700
- I'm just glad to see you. - So where's Jay?

761
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,640
Jay, uh, decided to go ahead and go back to Earth-3.

762
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,230
But he wanted to wish everybody a Merry Christmas.

763
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,060
So, it worked? The stone...

764
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,160
It's gone.

765
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,990
- It's lost in the Speed Force. - Good, good.

766
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know about you guys, but being mind-punked

767
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,320
by a speed god that we piss off in the future,

768
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,740
it's--it's enough to kill your Christmas spirit.

769
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,310
Guys, Christmastime is here.

770
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,020
We need a little Christmas.

771
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,120
Right this very minute. Who's with me?

772
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,770
- BA. - Well, he's right.

773
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,550
It's Christmas, we should be together.

774
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,490
Let's have it.

775
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,860
I'm still in if everybody else is.

776
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,990
- Yes! - Okay, we'll be there.

777
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,100
Yeah!

778
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,260
Julian...

779
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,350
Where's he going?

780
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,490
Hey, where ya going?

781
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,250
Do you have Christmas plans?

782
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,830
The West's are having a Christmas get-together.

783
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,880
After what you've been through, you shouldn't be alone.

784
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,660
I actually prefer to be alone at Christmas.

785
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,460
Rain on Christmas.

786
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,290
That's neither holy nor jolly.

787
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,450
Hey, listen, um...

788
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,920
about Dante.

789
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,310
Thank you for talking me off the ledge.

790
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,180
Of course, you'd do the same for me.

791
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,670
In fact, you did the same for me.

792
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,980
I was gonna say.

793
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,220
Caitlo--Caitlo, Ciscan...

794
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,300
okay--whoo-- you got to try the eggnog

795
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,190
a holiday concoction done by Joe

796
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,190
and his hot girlfriend...

797
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,260
Babe.

798
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,970
- What's up? - Nothing.

799
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,850
You seem a little weird. No?

800
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,130
You do know we won, right?

801
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,190
We defeated the bad guy.

802
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,560
- Yeah, I know. - Okay.

803
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,800
- Grandma Esther. - Grandma Millie.

804
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,260
Let's see.

805
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,780
Damn, that's strong.

806
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,610
So is that, my God!

807
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,010
Our grandmothers are alcoholics.

808
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,230
Yes.

809
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,070
You know, technically, we don't have to be standing

810
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,320
under the mistletoe to-- mm.

811
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,950
Finally.

812
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,880
No comments from the peanut gallery.

813
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,750
No, but really, it's about time.

814
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,460
Hold on.

815
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,350
And it's my daughter.

816
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,600
ah, just give me a quick minute,

817
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,840
and then we can--yeah.

818
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,290
- Hey, kiddo... - Joe.

819
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,110
I saw you kiss her, good job.

820
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,360
We're--oh, that's right, the thing.

821
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,330
BA, hey. Come on.

822
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,460
How many of those have you had?

823
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,240
- B--where'd you go? Here. - I'm right here.

824
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,160
Oh, I see ya.

825
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,720
Now that Cecile's away,

826
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,980
this is from all of us to you.

827
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,210
Merry Christmas, son.

828
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,110
- Are you serious? - Yeah, man, it's time.

829
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,610
You're ready, Wallace.

830
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,820
Welcome to the team.

831
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,340
Kid Flash.

832
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,890
Are we really calling me "Kid Flash"?

833
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah, I think we are.

834
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,280
Kid Flash!

835
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,420
- Police! - I got it.

836
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,230
It's not the police. We're the police.

837
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,810
You're the police!

838
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,310
Calm down.

839
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,720
Hey, Julian.

840
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,900
- Come on in. Here, let me get that. - Thanks.

841
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,850
after everything that happened,

842
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,430
being alone felt a bit lonely, so...

843
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,570
This is for you.

844
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,150
What's this?

845
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,140
I spoke to Captain Singh, and he hadn't put through

846
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,780
your resignation paperwork yet, so...

847
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,000
well, if you'd, uh, you know, like your old lab back,

848
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,750
or you'd like to share it again.

849
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,310
Thanks, Julian.

850
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,160
Merry Christmas, man.

851
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,450
- Cheers, mate. - Yeah, thank you.

852
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,600
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

853
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,910
- Can I offer you some eggnog? - I'd love some, yeah.

854
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,590
Happy Christmas, everyone

855
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm glad you came.

856
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,070
Thank you, yeah.

857
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,410
- Do you hear that? - It's outside.

858
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,470
Carolers.

859
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,660
Caroling in the rain.

860
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,730
That sucks.

861
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,870
- What're you doing? - It's okay, I got this.

862
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,650
We may not be able to have a perfect Christmas,

863
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,190
but we can have a white one.

864
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,380
So.

865
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,060
When are we gonna exchange presents?

866
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,440
How 'bout right now?

867
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,300
- Okay. - Follow me.

868
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,010
- Okay. - Let's get out of here.

869
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,430
Okay, going through a door, be careful.

870
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,220
Okay, right here.

871
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,890
- Okay, are you ready? - Yeah.

872
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,720
All right.

873
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,600
Open your eyes...

874
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,010
now.

875
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,220
I--I don't understand, where are we?

876
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,790
Home.

877
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,950
What?

878
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,860
I couldn't sleep on Cisco's couch anymore,and

879
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,050
your place is sort of small for two,

880
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,670
so I signed a lease

881
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,330
and I put both of our names on it.

882
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,120
I got you a wallet.

883
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,520
I'm sure I'll love it.

884
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,540
Barry, this is a big step.

885
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,020
Not for me.

886
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,570
I don't know what's gonna happen in the future.

887
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,190
All I know is, right here, right now,

888
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,610
I want to spend every moment I can with you.

889
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,840
You're the first thing I want to see when I wake up.

890
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,940
And the last thing--

891
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,590
I love you, Barry Allen.

892
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,930
I love you, Iris West.
