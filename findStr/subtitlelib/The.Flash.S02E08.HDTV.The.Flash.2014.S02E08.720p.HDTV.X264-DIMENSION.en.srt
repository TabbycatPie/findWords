12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,300

Previously on "The Flash" And "Arrow"...

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,170
The person who broke into my facility last night

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,410
was Harrison Wells.

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,520
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,540
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,790
I came here to help you, Barry.

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,230
He may not be Harrison Wells from your earth.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,260
He has just as many secrets as the one you knew.

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,180
I get these feelings sometimes, these vibes.

21
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,290
I'm not sure what triggers it. Sometimes it just happens.

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,060
You can always talk to me.

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,850
- Partners? - Partners.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,340
This is a million dollars.

25
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,800
That money is yours once you tell Oliver that you've lost the baby.

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,450
I've been running a lot lately,

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,760
trying to go faster than I've ever gone before.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,260
Because there's someone out there

29
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,440
who's better, faster, and stronger than I am,

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
and I need to be ready.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,210
But no matter how much I try or how hard I push myself,

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,880
I keep running into the same problem.

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,810
He just hit 1,375.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,170
What's the fastest Barry's run?

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,820
Little over Mach two, when he ran back in time.

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,230
That's not good.

37
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,340
That's good, Barry.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,960
We have our work cut out for us.

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,550
I'm not getting faster, am I?

40
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,490
No, you're not.

41
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,710
All right, well, let's fix this, right?

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,410
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

43
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,940
It felt like I was standing still next to him.

44
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,180
That's because you practically were.

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,500
Zoom is at least three, four times faster than you at this point.

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,220
How is he so much faster than Barry is and Jay was?

47
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,250
Physiology, form, strength, could be a number of things--

48
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,420
attitude, diet.

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,590
Okay, all right, well, there's got to be something we can do about it,

50
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,800
so let's just figure it out...

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,430
Fast, okay?

52
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,650
All right, I got to go. I'm meeting Patty.

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,450
I'll see you. Thank you.

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,200
So how are we going to help Barry?

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm out of ideas,

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,340
and we've tried everything you've suggested.

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,270
Well, not everything.

58
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,230
Welcome home.

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,440
- Any trouble? - Nah.

60
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,020
But believe it or not, we got ourselves a stowaway.

61
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,750
- He give you his name? - Didn't say.

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,740
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

63
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,430
He was all decked out in this when we found him.

64
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,920
- Jeez, how many are there? - 32.

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,630
And I'll polish them all in blood before long.

66
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,510
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

67
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,810
and you have brought me very close to my prey.

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Mister, you're not going to do any hunting in those handcuffs.

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,500
Oh, but, Captain, you're wearing the cuffs.

70
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,640
Who taught you that-- Houdini?

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,650
Actually, I taught him.

72
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,370
Soon another sacrifice will be made.

73
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,800
I feel you out there.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,390
Man, this was a bloodbath.

75
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,140
Done by one person.

76
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,720
One person did all this?

77
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,470
Oh, yeah, you can see from the blood pattern.

78
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,760
This guy was shot first, then the police chief,

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,690
then these three were stabbed before finishing off the captain.

80
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,740
Do you think a meta-human did it?

81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,560
I don't know, but I found this

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,360
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,340
It's some type of cryptocrystalline-- flint, most likely--

84
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,740
probably broke off the blade during the fight.

85
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,190
I'll run it to make sure.

86
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,610
Let's see what stores sell those kind of flint knives.

87
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,020
Will do.

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,660
And, uh, I'll call you later.

89
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,600
- Okay. - Okay.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,850
So cute.

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,660
You guys are trying not to be affectionate in front of me.

92
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,730
Oh, no, we're just showing some professionalism.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,970
Yeah.

94
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,280
Advantages of a trusting manager.

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,240
Oh, a lot's gone down in this place.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,230
Nice.

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,450
So what's up?

98
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,830
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,640
Whoa.

100
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,370
What's going on here?

101
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,310
I couldn't decide which restaurant to go to,

102
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,390
so I thought we would create our own.

103
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,350
Voila.

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,380
Short rib, Yukon gold puree, and asparagus.

105
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,520
Got to have a vegetable.

106
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,830
This is nice.

107
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,950
I like to cook.

108
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't know if you like red or white, so...

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
I got you both.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,250
Ooh, two bottles.

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,660
That's kind dangerous, don't you think?

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,040
You're not gonna run away all of a sudden, are you?

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,130
Trust me, I'm staying by your side as long as possible.

114
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,240
Good.

115
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,720
You know, it's been really great

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,230
hanging out these last few weeks.

117
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,810
And it's helped make the move a lot easier, so...

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,710
thanks.

119
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,920
You're very welcome.

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,810
Sorry. How did you get in here?

121
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,430
Hey, man, this place is closed.

122
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,350
You are just as beautiful in this life as any other,

123
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,980
Priestess Chay-Ara.

124
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,030
Priestess?

125
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,020
You're going to have to go, dude.

126
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,270
Oh, not without her...

127
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,100
dude.

128
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,030
Oh, my God. Cisco.

129
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,910
I don't understand. What do you want?

130
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,760
I believe I was clear.

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,160
Kendra's not going anywhere with you, Highlander.

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,750
Oh, is that your name now?

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,930
Kendra-- quite boring.

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,980
I believe it allowed you to blend in for a while.

135
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,210
Now, give her to me, and I'll make your death fast.

136
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,660
It ain't gonna happen.

137
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,060
You are done here, pal.

138
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,400
So is he!

139
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,290
Thank God, Barry.

140
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,770
Dude, come on.

141
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,720
I can't believe you're The Flash.

142
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,800
And that you work with The Flash.

143
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah, let's keep that on the DL.

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,890
This is the same knife that was used to kill the men at the docks.

145
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,270
Residue is a perfect match.

146
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,640
- So it is the same guy. - Definitely.

147
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,260
But the thing is, these blades are old,

148
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,800
centuries old.

149
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Do you have any idea why this guy would be after you?

150
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,810
No, I've never seen him before in my life.

151
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,680
Well, he was certainly acting like he knew you.

152
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,990
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

153
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,190
That's Coptic.

154
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,140
- You mean Egyptian? - That's right.

155
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,450
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin,

156
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,350
and I've never even left the States, so...

157
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,110
This guy, he's clearly incredibly dangerous,

158
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,710
so I need you to at least let us try to protect you.

159
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,680
I can put a detail on her.

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,980
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

161
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,790
No offense, but I don't think a cop is going to be able to protect her.

162
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,410
No, but we do have a few friends who could lend a hand.

163
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,200
But we're going to need to leave Central City.

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,870
And go where?

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
You really want to go to Star City?

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,650
Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.

167
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,010
Yeah, I think we do, man.

168
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,380
Man, you've fought meta-humans

169
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,660
with abilities a lot worse than knife-throwing.

170
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,140
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

171
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,420
There's something different about him,

172
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,990
something, ah, mystical.

173
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,970
Mystical, really?

174
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,530
We stop meta-humans because we're scientists.

175
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,030
We can figure out what their weaknesses are,

176
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,940
but we don't have any experience when it comes to guys like this,

177
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,220
with magic. They do.

178
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,380
This wouldn't have anything to do with Zoom, would it?

179
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,360
No.

180
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,030
I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

181
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,280
This is the best way to do that.

182
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,030
Right. Okay, I'm with you.

183
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,220
But how do we even know Oliver and them

184
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,990
even have time to help us?

185
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,860
How busy can they be?

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh, gosh, that's fun.

187
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,380
I really could do this all day.

188
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,570
Open it up.

189
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,050
They could've at least tried to hide this chemical bomb.

190
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,100
Serves them right, it getting stolen and used against them.

191
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.

192
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,010
What guns?

193
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,720
Oh, that was actually pretty clever.

194
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,950
Kill them.

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,240
"Felicity, the magnetic-arrow gag will never work."

196
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,420
Yes, it will, my love,

197
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,460
because I am really smart.

198
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,830
And guess what, Oliver. It did work.

199
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,860
Felicity, honey, it's a little hard to fight

200
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,980
with you doing that in my ear.

201
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,450
Oh, I totally forgot that this was an open line.

202
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,170
Keep doing what you're doing. Make smart decisions.

203
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,980
Ooh! You know, I got to be honest.

204
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,200
I really thought we'd be doing this dance a lot longer.

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,860
Night-night.

206
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,950
What was that?

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,880
Damn it.

208
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,290
Every time.

209
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,010
It's The Flash.

210
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,260
Did I know we knew The Flash?

211
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,420
We know The Flash. Okay.

212
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,910
- I didn't know we knew The Flash. - Thank you.

213
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,420
But I don't think you ran all the way here to protect us.

214
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,310
No, not to protect you.

215
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,630
I need to protect a friend.

216
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,290
Nice new digs.

217
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,360
Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.

218
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,860
Don't you get cold?

219
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,500
I spent the better part of five years on an island

220
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,810
in the North China Sea.

221
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,270
I don't get cold, Barry.

222
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,240
Barry, it's so good to see you.

223
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,210
Felicity.

224
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,940
Good to see you, Felicity.

225
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,810
How come you didn't tell me Zoom broke your back?

226
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,010
- I... - Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

227
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,490
So this is what it's like dating her?

228
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,610
More bruises from her than from Deathstroke.

229
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is impressive, but this is...

230
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,120
This is completely wrong!

231
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,860
Did you guys even look at the specs I sent over?

232
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,330
This is a tragedy.

233
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm mourning for the death of engineering.

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Copper wiring to handle the processing speed

235
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,490
from the Palmer Satellite,

236
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,830
or else your system is gonna overload.

237
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,860
Yeah, but that hasn't happened.

238
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,900
I mean, it hasn't happened since last week.

239
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
I mean, it didn't-It happened yesterday.

240
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,210
I'm Felicity.

241
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

242
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,750
She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend

243
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,210
who kisses me occasionally.

244
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,900
Right. Um, I'm Thea.

245
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,260
This is John Diggle and my brother.

246
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,600
Oliver Queen.

247
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,600
Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash

248
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,740
and now the Green Arrow.

249
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,640
Do you have any other surprises for me?

250
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Please, no more surprises.

251
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,000
Barry said that you need our help.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,870
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

253
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

254
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,610
What does this guy even look like?

255
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,840
Hold on.

256
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,680
Okay, this is him.

257
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah, see, that's something I would never think of.

258
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,410
Hey, kind of rocking that Dothraki look--hot.

259
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,550
Let's see if facial recognition can find a match.

260
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,290
- That's him. - Yeah, strange.

261
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,620
This picture's from 1975.

262
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,650
Which would make him about 80 years old right now.

263
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,360
Okay, what else can you tell us?

264
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,920
He said we've known each other for ages,

265
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,830
but I've never met the man before.

266
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,550
There has to be some kind of connection.

267
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,400
Not one I can think of.

268
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,900
I just moved to Central City six months ago.

269
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,300
Why'd you move there?

270
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,230
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

271
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,380
Kendra, there is a reason this guy's after you.

272
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,970
Think.

273
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,070
Look, man, we just came out here to hide out for a bit

274
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,760
until we figure things out, so you can just take it down...

275
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,080
You came here because you need our help.

276
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,400
This is what my help looks like.

277
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,020
Oliver, I just saved you guys

278
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,180
from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls was about to do.

279
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,890
The least you can do is--

280
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,180
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

281
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,390
You brought Kendra into our world

282
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,790
without knowing who she is

283
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,270
or what this dude that is after her is looking for.

284
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,340
You made all of us unsafe.

285
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,660
So maybe you ask the questions.

286
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,600
We're all friends here, right?

287
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,630
Why don't we go back to our place

288
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,310
and have some drinks, and we can talk?

289
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,780
Cool.

290
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,390
What you working on?

291
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,610
This is a formula

292
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,640
meant to increase a speedster's velocity

293
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,630
that I've been developing since Zoom showed up on my earth.

294
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,940
Ironically, this was meant to help out Jay Garrick.

295
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,320
You want to give Barry a drug to make him run faster?

296
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,090
Temporarily enhance the Speed Force in his system, yes.

297
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,600
So you're trying to make nitrous oxide for speedsters.

298
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,850
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

299
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,790
Five times I tried. Five times I failed.

300
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,910
That's what you get when your background is technology

301
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,910
and not biochemistry.

302
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,050
Well, then you are lucky I am here.

303
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,870
What does that mean?

304
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,890
You've been thinking of this

305
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,870
as a mechanical problem, not a biomechanical one.

306
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,770
And what does that mean?

307
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,710
When a speedster runs, they consume an extraordinary amount of oxygen,

308
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,530
so we just need something

309
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,110
to give an extra boost of oxygen during that time.

310
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,480
Like an oxygen generator.

311
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,530
Exactly.

312
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,570
So we just need a chemical

313
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,480
that's rich in oxygen that would release it

314
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,490
as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes--

315
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,610
something like...

316
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,880
- Sodium chlorate. - Sodium chlorate.

317
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,760
Then all we'd need is heat to release the oxygen.

318
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,130
Which a speedster generates naturally in the form of lightning.

319
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,390
I think something like this just might work.

320
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,640
You think you can help me figure it out?

321
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,070
I can certainly try.

322
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,970
I'm not changing my nickname.

323
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,900
I like Speedy.

324
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,530
Are you familiar with my body of work?

325
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,770
If you are, then you know I can come up with something

326
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,090
so much better than Speedy.

327
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,820
Why don't you get a haircut?

328
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,180
And then maybe we can talk about it.

329
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,340
I think you're just mad because my conditioner game is on point.

330
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,140
So the CEO of Palmer Technologies

331
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,940
is living with Oliver Queen.

332
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,390
It's insane how much life can change in six months?

333
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,040
Which you would know better than anyone,

334
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,050
considering that there's another Flash,

335
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,560
another Dr. Wells, from another... earth.

336
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,480
I mean...

337
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,660
Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately.

338
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,850
I wonder what Oliver's doppelganger would look like.

339
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,580
Bald, pot-bellied...

340
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,870
agreeable.

341
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,930
You seeing anyone?

342
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,990
- I am, actually. - Good.

343
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,600
Patty is her name.

344
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,370
She's amazing.

345
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,070
You deserve someone amazing.

346
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,190
Thanks.

347
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,220
My pigs in a blanket!

348
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,420
Hey, Ollie...

349
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,780
look, I'm sorry that I laid all of this on you.

350
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,580
- I know that it wasn't fair. - It's okay.

351
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,370
I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...

352
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,810
Snippy?

353
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,470
I have been called worse.

354
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,850
No, but I'm glad that you're here.

355
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,850
I'm glad you reached out.

356
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,800
It shows a real maturity, and I would know that

357
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,690
because I've never been that mature.

358
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,690
I'm always here for you.

359
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,980
Thank you.

360
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,050
I got to say, this isn't the same

361
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,570
Arrow team I'm used to seeing

362
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,230
or the same Oliver Queen.

363
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,960
- You seem really... - Happy?

364
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,170
- Happy, yeah. - I am happy.

365
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,150
I finally have everything that I've ever wanted.

366
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,830
Being with Felicity has given me a real sense of peace,

367
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,660
something that I haven't had in a long time.

368
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,700
Didn't you tell me that guys like us don't get the girl?

369
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,820
Yep.

370
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
I was wrong.

371
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,020
I would like to propose a toast.

372
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,220
I wish it wasn't just the dark times bringing us together.

373
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,950
But it is friends like you

374
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,550
that make those dark times worth having.

375
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,920
What a guy.

376
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,350
Steals my drinks, steals my words.

377
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,460
As I was saying, it's good to see everyone.

378
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,360
- Yes. - Cheers.

379
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,170
Cheers.

380
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,640
- Cheers. - Cheers.

381
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,840
Look, don't worry, all right?

382
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,730
We're gonna keep her safe.

383
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,830
- I promise. - Yeah, I know.

384
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,230
Look, there's something I never told you.

385
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,250
The first time I kissed Kendra, I got a vibe.

386
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,880
No, not like that kind of vibe.

387
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,920
Like, I vibed vibed.

388
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,290
Remember the man with wings?

389
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,790
It wasn't a man.

390
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,400
It was Kendra.

391
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
She was, like, a bird.

392
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,410
You think that she's a meta-human?

393
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,660
Wait. Why didn't you say anything about this sooner?

394
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,880
Well, I didn't think it was related,

395
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,910
but I guess now it has to be.

396
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,590
Look, I don't want her to know about my powers.

397
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,300
I have this great thing going with her.

398
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,790
She laughs at my jokes, and she loves movies, and...

399
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,410
I just-- I've never felt like this before,

400
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,120
and I don't want to sabotage it.

401
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,950
I get the feeling.

402
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,820
Look!

403
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,990
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

404
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,440
- Don't move. - Then how will I kill you all?

405
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,610
Yeah, I can do that too.

406
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
Thea, no!

407
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,680
What did you do?

408
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,700
I ended it.

409
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,160
This is why we ask questions.

410
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,190
Wait. W-where did he go?

411
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,550
Oh, boy.

412
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,820
Okay.

413
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,900
Thanks.

414
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,680
All right, Lance is gonna call if he gets any information on...

415
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,960
whoever that is.

416
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,820
I know where we can get some info.

417
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,290
Kendra, I have powers.

418
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,170
I get these vibes from people.

419
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,570
They're visions of meta-humans,

420
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,220
and I had one of you.

421
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,960
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,560
and, B, she's a meta-human?

423
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,960
I don't know.

424
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,780
In these visions, you could fly.

425
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,560
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

426
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,900
- A bird? - Yeah.

427
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,180
What else did you see?

428
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,570
That's it-- just you with wings.

429
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,700
Oh, I did not see that one coming.

430
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,010
Oh, I think there's a lot you didn't see coming.

431
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,910
Great. More surprises. Who the hell is this?

432
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,720
It's my dad.

433
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,540
I think I did it.

434
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,590
What do you know, Snow?

435
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,010
I think you did do it.

436
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,170
Velocity-6?

437
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,710
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

438
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,430
You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug?

439
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,790
That's right.

440
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,150
- You knew about this. - Of course she did.

441
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,320
She figured it out.

442
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,320
I thought this was to help Barry.

443
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,120
It is to help Barry,

444
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,210
which is why we need to do test runs on subjects

445
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,640
who once had the Speed Force in their system.

446
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,350
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.

447
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,900
It's not something you can create in a lab.

448
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,960
How do you think you became The Flash, Garrick?

449
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,750
By me and a lab.

450
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,750
Science is what did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom,

451
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,230
and science is what we need to stop Zoom,

452
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,860
and this is our only option.

453
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,780
Find another one.

454
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,650
The Speed Force can't be replicated or enhanced.

455
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,700
It's a living thing.

456
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,550
It's a gift that was given to me.

457
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,980
That drug-- you have no idea what it's gonna do.

458
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,420
I'm not going to let another one of your experiments

459
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,320
mess with me again, Harrison.

460
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,910
You find someone else to be your guinea pig.

461
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,810
Jay.

462
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,930
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

463
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,530
Where are you going?

464
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,440
To pick up what we need.

465
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,910
Wait. Jay just said we shouldn't give it to Barry.

466
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,070
We're gonna do what we need.

467
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,020
The man you're looking for is Vandal Savage.

468
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,570
Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.

469
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,510
Well, who is he?

470
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,720
Some say he was the most trusted adviser to Genghis Khan.

471
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,370
Others say he guided Julius Caesar through the Gallic Wars.

472
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,190
But one thing the League knows for sure--

473
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,970
he was there for all of it.

474
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,070
So what are you saying?

475
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,740
He's like a vampire or something?

476
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,250
Not a vampire, an Immortal.

477
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,570
Okay, we've officially stepped into crazy town.

478
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,660
Immortality?

479
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,140
Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense.

480
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,980
This explains why he looks the same as he did in 1975.

481
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,010
This can't be possible.

482
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,460
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

483
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,930
Kendra, do not listen to him.

484
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,310
I-I just need some air.

485
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,500
We're gonna do whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe,

486
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,260
whether you think we can or not.

487
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,740
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

488
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,040
I just interviewed a weapons

489
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,390
expert about the flint knife our attacker used.

490
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,900
Found out something pretty interesting,

491
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,200
uh, so call me back.

492
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,530
Harrison Wells?

493
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,540
Kendra!

494
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,710
You going to be all right?

495
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,550
It's just a lot to take in right now.

496
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,690
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about me before.

497
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,750
I didn't want things to be different between us.

498
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,290
It's not that, Cisco.

499
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,260
If what everyone's saying is true--

500
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,240
and it's beginning to seem like it is--

501
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,220
my whole life just changed,

502
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,830
and I am so not ready for that.

503
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,180
I hear what you're saying. I do.

504
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,210
When I first learned about my powers,

505
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,850
I remember feeling that exact same feeling,

506
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,750
and sometimes I still feel that way,

507
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,350
and all I can say is...

508
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,880
every day gets a little bit more normal.

509
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,570
I promise you.

510
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,270
Thank you.

511
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,900
You're so welcome.

512
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,170
Kendra!

513
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,200
Help!

514
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,510
Guys, did you find anything?

515
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,930
I'm on it!

516
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,740
This is my house.

517
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,300
Don't worry. We're going to find her.

518
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,420
You look as beautiful as ever.

519
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,850
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

520
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,650
Do you remember?

521
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,090
Look at me.

522
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,590
You need to wake up.

523
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,230
What are you talking about?

524
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,350
I don't know who you are.

525
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,110
You will once you emerge.

526
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,620
Until then, you need to stay by my side

527
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,950
so that I can protect you.

528
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,840
Protect me? From what?

529
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,540
The man who's hunting you, Vandal Savage.

530
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,160
I got them! 57th Street tower.

531
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,460
I'm right near there.

532
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,640
Always a pleasure watching you work, Smoak.

533
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,310
That was pitiful.

534
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,650
I know this is a lot to take in,

535
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,680
but you sort of just kind of have to trust me on this. I...

536
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,430
Just one second. Stay right there.

537
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,410
I got eyes on him.

538
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,810
Give me the girl.

539
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,340
Not gonna do that, Robinhood.

540
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,570
You're making a big mistake.

541
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,060
I'll take my chances.

542
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,250
Barry, change of venue.

543
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,200
Birdman and Oliver are at 54th and Motor now--hurry!

544
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,320
On my way!

545
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,880
We need to expose his wings.

546
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,270
I'm open to suggestions.

547
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,410
Now you're listening to me?

548
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,970
It's your city, Oliver.

549
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,870
All right.

550
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,530
That's new.

551
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,650
Yep, comes in handy.

552
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,050
We can't use that serum on Barry.

553
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,020
That's up to him, isn't it?

554
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,970
If Barry wants to stop Zoom, this is what he needs.

555
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,250
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

556
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,660
Well, Jay's a coward.

557
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,490
Jay's a scientist who knows a lot about speedsters.

558
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,280
You're a scientist, Snow. You've been watching Barry.

559
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,890
You know he's nowhere near as fast as he needs to be.

560
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,280
This other mentor, this other Harrison Wells,

561
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,970
did not want him to reach his full potential--I do.

562
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,280
You know, you're really starting to sound a lot like him.

563
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,610
Put your hands in the air.

564
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,250
- Who are you? - You're under arrest.

565
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,610
Doctor McGee was right.

566
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,770
- She did see you. - Christina McGee?

567
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,330
At Mercury Labs.

568
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,260
You're Harrison Wells.

569
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,430
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.

570
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,230
I'm not the Harrison--

571
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,980
Stop! You move closer, and I'll shoot.

572
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,790
Give me that--

573
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,950
Oh, my God, what have you done?

574
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,270
Harrison?

575
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,460
Harrison, stay with me.

576
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,950
Harrison, Harrison, stay with me.

577
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,500
Stay with me, Harrison, come on.

578
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,530
Why did you shoot him?

579
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,410
I thought that was a gun. I'm sorry. I'll call 911.

580
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,290
No, don't!

581
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,930
- Why? - Because this--

582
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,160
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

583
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,830
- No. - Just call Joe.

584
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,690
Okay.

585
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,270
Where is she?

586
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,180
What's your name?

587
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,870
You're putting her in danger,

588
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,090
and I'm the only one capable of saving her.

589
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,770
You have a very interesting perspective

590
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,760
on what the word "saving" means.

591
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,280
She's the love of my lifetime, sweetheart.

592
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,950
I was not gonna hurt her.

593
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,560
You need to let me go.

594
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,660
Chay-Ara.

595
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,780
My name is Kendra Saunders.

596
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,970
In this life.

597
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,390
And I am--was Carter Hall,

598
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,590
but that is not who we are.

599
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,730
What does that mean?

600
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,950
You're Priestess Chay-Ara. I'm Prince Khufu.

601
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,400
And we're lovers.

602
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,780
Soul mates.

603
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,380
We've been partners for 4,000 years.

604
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,400
We're drawn to each other in each life, and after we die,

605
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,520
we reincarnate to find each other again and again and again.

606
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,510
And now that I've found you,

607
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,960
we should really get out of here.

608
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?

609
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,620
These people cannot protect you from Savage any longer.

610
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,770
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

611
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,810
In every lifetime, he hunts us down and kills us.

612
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,270
He's done it 206 times,

613
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,120
and I'm not planning to make it 207.

614
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,460
Why does he kill you?

615
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,870
His life force is tethered to ours.

616
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,820
Every time he kills us, he becomes more powerful.

617
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,800
You do the math.

618
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,470
You're 0 for 206,

619
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,910
and you still think you're her best bet, hmm?

620
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,200
Okay, so what we need to do is just find Savage

621
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,220
and get rid of him.

622
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,840
Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend.

623
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,080
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

624
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,940
It might be harder than you think.

625
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,320
Is that the only way this guy knows how to enter a room?

626
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,420
My associates tell me

627
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,730
Savage left Star City a few hours ago.

628
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,480
- For where? - We're not quite sure.

629
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,120
But I assume after his run-in with you,

630
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,100
he realized he needed something more powerful

631
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,610
to complete his mission.

632
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,070
We think he's trying to locate the Staff of Horus.

633
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,860
Sorry, what is that?

634
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,660
It's a relic from our past--

635
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,690
an ancient and powerful weapon.

636
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,670
If Savage gets his hands on it,

637
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,900
it's going to be nearly impossible to stop him.

638
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,810
Since when did our lives

639
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,140
suddenly become an "Indiana Jones" movie?

640
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,400
- Felicity? - Yeah?

641
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,140
Think you can find it?

642
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,900
Yeah. It's probably at some museum somewhere.

643
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,040
I'll, uh, work my magic, see what I can find.

644
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,340
We're running out of time.

645
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,100
You need to emerge now.

646
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,260
Come on, what is it gonna take for you to believe me?

647
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,640
You saw my wings.

648
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,020
I know you know this is true.

649
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,360
Please, just let me show you how.

650
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,040
- How's he doing? - He's losing oxygen.

651
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,680
- I need you to leave. - Joe, I--

652
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,180
Patty, go.

653
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,660
There's a bullet in a branch of his pulmonary artery

654
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,480
that's blocking off most of the blood flow from the left lung.

655
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,830
Are we able to get the bullet out?

656
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,860
Not without causing too much damage.

657
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,100
I need Jay's help.

658
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,380
So...

659
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,520
you just want me to jump.

660
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,020
Fall, jump, swan dive, whatever suits you.

661
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,040
Just, uh, do it.

662
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,090
Okay, this isn't the X Games.

663
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,080
And this is how she emerges--

664
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,470
she just falls towards her death?

665
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,270
Yep. 4,000 years of experience says that's exactly how.

666
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
Just watch and learn.

667
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,120
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?

668
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,580
Why are we listening to this guy?

669
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,520
Come on, Oliver,

670
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,760
you're supposed to be the one who asks questions.

671
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,050
Okay, but after what we saw, after what Cisco said,

672
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,560
I cannot believe I'm going to say this, but it...

673
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,960
kind of makes sense.

674
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,570
I need to try.

675
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,740
Are you serious?

676
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,860
Yes, she is.

677
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,260
Barry!

678
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,530
What the hell was that?

679
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,980
Saving her life.

680
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,860
You should have emerged.

681
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,630
Something is blocking you.

682
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,190
Well, we should just try again and see what's...

683
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,770
- No! - Yeah, no, no, no, no.

684
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,770
We're not doing that again.

685
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,120
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

686
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,160
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

687
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,520
Barry. Barry!

688
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,570
What?

689
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Talk to you for a second?

690
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,010
Okay.

691
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,350
Keep an eye on him.

692
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,170
What is going on with you?

693
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm trying to keep her alive.

694
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,890
Then I think we let her jump.

695
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,840
Are you kidding?

696
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,680
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help

697
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,870
and you want to be the hero

698
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,240
and you want to save her yourself,

699
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,490
but I think she has to have a part in it too.

700
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,840
What?

701
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,370
It's just--the rules keep changing.

702
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,230
One day I have to run through time,

703
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,620
the next I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla,

704
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,970
and now we're what?

705
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,610
We're chasing down an immortal madman on a rampage

706
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,680
against down a reincarnated warrior priestess?

707
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,400
I just never thought I'd have superpowers

708
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
and feel more powerless than I ever have in my entire life.

709
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,370
That part I understand.

710
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,810
But you have already helped Kendra.

711
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,470
You have kept her alive.

712
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,390
So now let's help her get her wings,

713
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,930
and then she can give you a lift back to Central City.

714
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,190
Central City.

715
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,200
- What? - You need to check Central City for the staff.

716
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,740
Kendra, you said you were drawn there.

717
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,070
- Yeah. - I think you're drawn to things that destroy you

718
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,850
the same way you two are drawn to each other.

719
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,920
That's why it wasn't in any museum or private collection,

720
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,670
because it was consecrated eight months ago

721
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,700
at St. Mark's in Central City.

722
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,640
We've got to get it before Savage does.

723
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,790
Carter, stay here.

724
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,150
I'm not going anywhere.

725
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,880
Call Thea and Digg,

726
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,040
and we'll have them hold down the fort

727
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,130
in case Savage shows up.

728
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,870
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

729
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,250
The only way I could get them back

730
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,890
is if I just forgot about everything happening around me

731
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,640
and focused on who I was.

732
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,120
Just believe in yourself, and your true self will emerge.

733
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,170
Thanks.

734
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,430
Hey, are you sure that you want to do this?

735
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,420
If this guy's immortal

736
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,820
and Merlyn's right about how powerful this staff is...

737
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,220
We'll be fine.

738
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,830
Kiss her.

739
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
We'll be fine.

740
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,340
- Careful. - Let's go.

741
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,230
Now what?

742
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,790
His systolic pressure's dropping.

743
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,880
He's gonna code.

744
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,200
How bad is it?

745
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,200
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

746
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,340
Can you close the wound if I get it?

747
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,290
Yes.

748
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,810
How are you going to do that?

749
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,850
What is that?

750
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,160
It's a serum called Velocity-6.

751
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,480
It could give Jay temporary speed.

752
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,070
He can phase through Doctor Wells' chest

753
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,130
and remove the bullet.

754
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,680
Yeah, but I told you,

755
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,600
I have no idea what's gonna happen if I use that.

756
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,660
It's our only option.

757
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,060
If you don't do this, Dr. Wells will die.

758
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,380
It's working.

759
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,140
BP and oxygenation is rising.

760
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,120
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

761
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,260
Thank you.

762
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,730
I was just thinking...

763
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,470
all the moments of my life when I felt different,

764
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,000
like something was wrong with me.

765
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,550
Now I know why.

766
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,990
It's gonna be all right.

767
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,100
Okay?

768
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,160
Look, I-I know what it's like to have your life

769
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,230
suddenly change like this.

770
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,040
I-I can help you get through this.

771
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,090
I don't know if you can.

772
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,030
Cisco, there's a whole other life inside me,

773
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,380
hundreds of lives, that I need to know about.

774
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,740
I think I need to do it by myself.

775
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,890
I have to...

776
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,670
embrace my destiny.

777
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,020
I have to believe.

778
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,850
You don't have to do this.

779
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,270
What's going on?

780
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,800
Nothing. I just like to speed into rooms, usually.

781
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,270
Where do you think we find this thing?

782
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,900
I haven't been in one of these places in a while.

783
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,680
We're too late.

784
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,630
Something you're not used to saying very often,

785
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,090
I'd imagine.

786
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,500
You tried those arrows once before, remember?

787
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,290
They didn't quite finish the job, now, did they?

788
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,180
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

789
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,570
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

790
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,950
I can't do that.

791
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,900
While my destiny is to live forever,

792
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,140
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

793
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,030
- Any ideas? - Oh, now you'll listen to me?

794
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,500
It's your city.

795
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,630
All right, let's just try to get the staff.

796
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,170
All right, on my mark.

797
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,050
All right.

798
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,580
Carter was right.

799
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,200
Something's holding me back.

800
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,240
Maybe it's Central City or you

801
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,740
or what I thought my life was gonna be,

802
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,850
but I'm never gonna become who I really am unless I let go.

803
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,730
I have to do this.

804
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,640
In all my countless years,

805
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,210
I've never encountered anybody with your capabilities.

806
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,350
Astonishing!

807
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,170
No!

808
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,170
Chay-Ara.

809
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,900
Oh, my God!

810
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,660
I used to enjoy slow deaths.

811
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,900
Now I just find them boring.

812
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,620
Thanks.

813
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,420
Any chance he blew himself up in there?

814
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,600
Not likely.

815
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,230
So that's, like, a tie, right?

816
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,300
- I guess. - I will take it.

817
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,570
You okay?

818
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,890
I'm gonna have to learn how to use these things.

819
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,680
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

820
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,830
Dr. Wells?

821
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,240
You're gonna be okay.

822
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,580
That's good news.

823
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,890
You will probably be very sore for a little while, though.

824
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,920
Sore is better than dead.

825
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,910
Yes, it is.

826
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,430
How are you doing, Garrick?

827
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,820
Your serum's out of my system,

828
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,420
and I will never take it again.

829
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,760
Jay...

830
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,410
thank you.

831
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,980
You can thank me by keeping that Velocity-6 away from Barry.

832
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,810
That was Oliver.

833
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,320
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

834
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,150
He wants us all in Central City as soon as possible.

835
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,270
Okay, well, Laurel's already there visiting her mom,

836
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,590
so I'll call her and let her know we're coming by.

837
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,010
If Savage is in Central City,

838
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,910
then why are we going back there?

839
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,260
So we can end this.

840
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,920
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,

841
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,140
it's going to be Barry and Oliver.

842
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,740
Plus, you've emerged.

843
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,220
It's going to be much harder for him now.

844
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,230
And together, all of us,

845
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,990
we can take him down once and for all.

846
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay, so how are we gonna get there?

847
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,670
Did I mention I'm the CEO

848
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,490
of a big company with a private jet?

849
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,080
Since when is that a thing?

850
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,000
About eight months.

851
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,740
Maybe if you save Star City, you might get one too.

852
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,600
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

853
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,540
We'll get him.

854
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,310
Watch yourself, buddy.

855
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,130
You don't want to lose this guy.


856
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,010
- Thanks, mister. 
- Yeah.
