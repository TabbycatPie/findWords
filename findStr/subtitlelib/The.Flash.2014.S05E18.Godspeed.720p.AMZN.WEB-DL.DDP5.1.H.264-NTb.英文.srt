17
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,250
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive.

18
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,650
To the outside world I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

19
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,310
But secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs

20
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,200
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

21
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,520
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

22
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,140
she changed the present.

23
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,630
And now our world is more dangerous than ever.

24
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,150
And I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

25
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,610
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,970
Previously on "The Flash"...

27
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,540
Follow my instructions and we'll defeat Cicada.

28
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,030
Destroy his dagger and save your father.

29
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,410
That is a new timeline struggling to break through.

30
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,430
Thawne, another Cicada showed up.

31
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,800
I used to think that keeping secrets from people

32
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,050
would protect them, but you can't really

33
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,560
know someone with walls between you.

34
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,800
Eobard Thawne, the Reverse Flash.

35
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,890
Your partner. Your secret.

36
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,500
Dad, I'm sorry I lied to you!

37
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,510
So am I.

38
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,050
Dad, please. I wanted to tell you.

39
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,030
Dad! I tried to tell you.

40
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,350
I'm sorry I lied to you!

41
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,100
It's Nora, our daughter.

42
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,530
She lied to us, Iris.

43
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,010
Since the first day she got here,

44
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,450
about Thawne!

45
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,620
She knows what he did to us. To me.

46
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,360
To my mother.

47
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,270
I can't believe a word she says.

48
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,780
- We don't know that. - Yes, we do!

49
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,740
We don't even know why she's working with him.

50
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,870
Now the pressing question is not

51
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,690
why Nora is workingwith the Reverse Flash.

52
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,660
Maybe I can talk to her and shed some light on the matter.

53
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,210
I think you've shed enough light.

54
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,050
Why, are you upset at me? What I should do?

55
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,320
I should just--I should not have told you?

56
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,820
How long has it been since you suspected her?

57
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,400
Since I arrived.

58
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,620
So you've been following this trail all this time

59
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,500
and you didn't think to tell us about it until now?

60
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,450
I don't know where this trail leads.

61
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,240
- Are you kidding me? - I'm not kidding you.

62
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,890
You don't come to a conclusion without facts.

63
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,160
All the facts.

64
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,050
Shirley, I think, uh, maybe you should just

65
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,470
give us all a minute here.

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,070
What, you're mad at me

67
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,380
for doing what a master detective does.

68
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,980
Figure out something that you cannot.

69
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,330
I give you that translation.

70
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,500
Your anger is misplaced.

71
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,470
Look, whatever reason Nora didn't tell us,

72
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,370
I don't think she did it maliciously.

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,490
Guys, even from here, I can feel how upset she is.

74
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,090
All right, babe, you've been around Nora

75
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,290
for months.

76
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,450
You never felt that she was hiding something before.

77
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,130
No, never. Never.

78
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,980
Well, Thawne lied. He was a master at it.

79
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,020
It stands to reason he must have taught Nora

80
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,110
some of his same tricks.

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,410
Maybe. Maybe not.

82
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,230
There's gotta be some way to figure it out.

83
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,600
There is.

84
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,740
I'm guessing this has everything

85
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,370
from the day she arrived.

86
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,930
Maybe before.

87
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,210
Read it.

88
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,210
From the beginning.

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
Please stand back from the perimeter.

94
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,020
Excuse me. Sorry.

95
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,920
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, pardon me.

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,320
- Incoming call from Mom. - Mom, come on.

97
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,270
I'm so sorry.

98
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,150
I just--I'm really late.

99
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,010
I'm--I'm really late for an important date.

100
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,570
Not a date, date.

101
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,240
Not that I don't date, date. I date, date.

102
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,350
It's just, I have a meeting.

103
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,710
I'm making myself later. Sorry.

104
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,900
Anyone seen CSI?

105
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,110
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

106
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,450
Where is West-Allen?

107
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,440
Ah, I'm so sorry, Detective Curtis.

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,270
I didn't mean to be late.

109
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,440
I tried to hail a hover-taxi but they kept passing me by

110
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
and then I had to run all the way from--

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
I really don't care what

112
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,840
your reason is this time, West-Allen.

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,250
I just wanna find what meta did this.

114
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,580
Of course.

115
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,830
Chemical transport truck on its way to Dayton Labs.

116
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,010
It was attacked earlier this morning.

117
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
But that makes two labs

118
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,780
and another two transports this week.

119
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,360
And like the others, no one saw anyone.

120
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,250
God, there's residue everywhere.

122
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,190
- Benzene Methanol. - That's what they stole.

123
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,480
What's that used for?

125
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,650
Anything from nanotech to treating lice.

126
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,250
- Halothane. - Halothane?

128
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,620
- Wait a second. - What?

129
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,390
This truck has an Affinity 4,000 security camera.

130
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,370
God, Lia's gonna be so jealous.

131
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,470
Whenever the 4,000's tampered with,

132
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,890
its failsafe releases a incapacitating agent.

133
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,240
Halothane.

134
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,680
So you're saying whoever did this picked the lock,

135
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,730
disabled the camera,

136
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,240
and stole, might be lice medicine?

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,160
All before this incapacitating agent could do its job?

138
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,610
And no one saw them.

139
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,810
How is that possible?

140
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,830
A speedster?

141
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,040
Nora, labmate, friend of mine,

142
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,660
You didn't happen to pitch your speedster theory

143
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,490
to Detective Curtis, did you?

144
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,170
It is not a theory, Lia. It is the only explanation.

145
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,170
You know I'm equally a fan

146
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,150
of our fleet-footed super friends.

147
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,440
I mean, honestly, if I could have ever

148
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,550
met Jesse Quick, it's like, hello, new best friend.

149
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,780
- No offense, um-- - Some taken.

150
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,870
Okay, but there hasn't been a speedster

151
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,320
in Central City since that crisis piece

152
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,350
your mom wrote about, like, decades ago.

153
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,280
I mean, Flash, Kid Flash, Jay Garrick,

154
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,300
that-- that weird purple speedster that just showed up one day.

155
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,870
They're all gone.

156
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,500
So what you're suggesting, highly unlikely.

157
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,400
Then we need to start believing in the highly unlikely.

158
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,210
Alternatively, um, you could--

159
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,010
dial back your obsessiveness.

160
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,370
I'm not obsessive.

161
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,630
You never got to know your dad.

162
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,090
So you became a CSI just like him,

163
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,590
and it's why you keep investigating the one case

164
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,550
Barry Allen never solved.

166
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,810
Cicada.

167
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,700
You call that obsessive. I call that a hobby.

168
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,150
Right, your, um-- your classic everyday...

169
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,700
murder hobby.

170
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,630
It's like your mom says.

171
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,100
You're, uh-- you're excessive.

172
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,090
Do not quote my mother.

173
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,220
God, I wish CCPD would spring for one of these Affinity cameras.

174
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,170
I mean, trillion FPS, captures light in motion.

175
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,060
W-T-Shrap?

176
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,480
- That's lightning. - The canister's gone.

177
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,930
White lightning. A speedster.

178
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,980
- Okay, maybe. - No, not maybe.

179
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,450
It is! I knew it!

180
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,220
Okay, fine, you're right. But...

181
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,560
But what is a speedster doing stealing chemicals?

182
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,640
And Eobard Thawne, aka the Reverse-Flash,

184
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,910
was finally defeated and incarcerated

185
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,230
and will remain in Iron Heights Prison for the rest of his days.

187
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,480
I know.

188
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,310
Incoming call from Mom.

190
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,240
See? I knew it.

196
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,190
There was never a speedster with white lightning.

197
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,540
- All yours. - Thanks.

198
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,710
Thank you for visiting the Flash Museum today.

200
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,680
The building will be closing in five minutes.

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,600
All guests should make their way to the exit now.

202
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,330
And Nora West-Allen, your mother called.

204
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,190
Please, for your sake and mine,

205
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,950
call her back.

207
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,220
So embarrassing.

208
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,160
Mom, why are you calling Mr. Myles?

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,120
I tried you at your lab. You weren't answering.

210
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,170
I left three messages.

211
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,580
You never returned any of them.

212
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,800
What else was I supposed to do?

213
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Wait for me to call you back?

214
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,770
Why isn't your holo on?

215
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,140
Uh, it doesn't work in the Flash Museum.

216
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,040
For the life of me,

217
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,950
I've never understood your obsession with that place.

218
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,290
What are you even doing there? Are you there alone?

219
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,800
It's fine, Mom. I'm researching a case.

220
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,160
- What kind of case? - One that I can't talk about.

221
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,490
I'm your mother, Nora.

222
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,650
And I'm an employee of CCPD

223
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,990
who can't talk about open cases.

224
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,640
Mom, how many times do I have to tell you this?

225
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,490
You were married to a CSI.

226
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
Yes, I was.

227
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,100
I'm sorry.

228
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,640
What were you calling about?

229
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,020
I thought my daughter might want to know

230
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,650
how I'm doing in Coast City.

231
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,990
I almost finished my story.

232
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,950
I should be home in a few days.

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Great.

234
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,610
Uh, Mom, I gotta go. It's work.

235
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,320
- Love you. - Love you.

236
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,630
Hey, meet me at Ollins Laboratory.

237
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,110
I sent the list of stolen chemicals to an old teacher of mine

238
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,650
and I think he found something.

240
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,410
Appreciate the help, Dr. Bonwit,

241
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,880
- especially at this hour. - Not a problem.

242
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,390
Ollins never lets me leave this place anyway.

243
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,380
So Lia was telling me you might know

244
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,030
how these chemicals can be used together.

245
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,900
Yes and no.

247
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,210
Took me a bit to see it,

248
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,100
but the only way they seem to work together is

249
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,540
if they're built on a structure.

251
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,010
Like an extracellular matrix.

252
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,820
But there are thousands of extracellular matrices.

253
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,380
So until we know all the chemicals,

254
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,090
we won't know the end results.

255
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,690
Sorry I can't help more.

256
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,900
That's okay. Thanks, Dr. Bonwit.

257
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,780
Now what?

258
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,410
We can't just wait for another lab to get hit.

259
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,840
Holy shrap!

260
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,850
Dr. Bonwit!

261
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,170
Oh, my God!

262
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,470
Yes, I am a god.

263
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,790
The god of speed.

264
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,900
Go, go, go, go, go!

265
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,830
Nora!

266
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,760
Nora!

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,570
Somebody help, please! Someone help!

268
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,960
Nora?

269
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,850
Nora?

270
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,530
Oh, I knew an oldie would wake you up.

271
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,980
Okay, don't freak. Uh, we're in a hospital.

272
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,810
Me for this burn and you for a whole lot more.

273
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,720
- Dr. Bonwit? - Uh, ICU.

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,960
But he's gonna pull through.

275
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,710
Um, but the speedster did get away with a crazy amount of carbon disulfide.

276
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,500
Don't worry about that right now.

277
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,670
How are you feeling?

278
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,120
I--I feel fine, actually.

279
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,770
My fingers are a little tingly but other than that,

280
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,740
I--I feel really good. It's weird, right?

281
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm just so glad you're okay.

282
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,930
Your doctor said you got hit with five billion joules

283
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,510
of electricity. Which means, um, I, uh--

284
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,390
I, uh, kind of called your mom. Um, and she, uh--

285
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,780
She freaked more than normal. Um, I had to.

286
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,370
- You could have died. - Lia, is she here?

287
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,880
She's on her way from Coast City.

288
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,040
Uh, and she is wearing her aggro pants.

289
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,220
I mean, she has called me, like, 47 times.

290
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,140
You should have ignored her.

291
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,710
Just, I don't want her to worry.

292
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,800
I did.

293
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,980
Uh, which is why she doesn't know about this.

294
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,210
The paramedics said that you went into cardiac arrest

295
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,350
when you got here and so they had to use the defib nodes

296
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,500
to restart your heart, and when they did,

297
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,970
they found this.

298
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,620
It was buried underneath the scar under your right shoulder.

299
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,120
What is it?

300
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,990
They say it's a metal scrap from the shelf

301
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,160
you got thrown into, but I don't know.

302
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
It looks kind of old and--and pretty fried.

303
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,830
Okay, wait, but now that we both know you're okay,

304
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,630
can we please talk about the fact that you got struck

305
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,230
by lightning from a speedster?

306
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,400
So schway, right?

307
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,990
The only thing is no one's gonna believe us.

308
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,370
We both saw it. They're gonna have to.

309
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,850
Stay calm.

310
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,460
There has been an incident. System check in progress.

311
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,220
What the hell?

312
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,030
Catch this.

313
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm okay!

314
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,250
You sure?

315
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,150
Yeah, dude. I'm a speedster.

316
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,320
All of my nerves are tingling and my synapses must be going crazy

317
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,720
because my reaction times are way off the charts.

318
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,430
What am I gonna do about my mom?

319
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,130
She freaks out any time someone even says the word meta.

320
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,410
Okay, well, that's understandable.

321
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,800
I mean, her non-meta husband died because of metas.

322
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,950
Yeah, but writing about the Flash--the meta-human--

323
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,530
- made her career. - So we can't tell her?

324
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,240
No, we can't tell anybody.

325
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,610
Not until we figure out how I got these powers.

326
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,870
And I don't think it's a coincidence that this happened

327
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,140
after my little run-in with the god of speed guy.

328
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,620
You mean when Godspeed hit you with his lightning.

329
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,460
Which, according to the Flash Museum,

330
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,270
is exactly what happened to--

331
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,610
The Flash.

332
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,900
10-90 in progress.

333
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,140
Bank heist.

334
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,270
No, no. You can't do that.

335
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,190
That is a bad idea.

336
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,860
That is like cut your own bangs bad.

337
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm just gonna do a little run-by.

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,290
You are a CSI, not a superhero.

339
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,560
Our jobs are the same as the cops.

340
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,110
We get the bad guys.

341
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,460
All right. Go get 'em, Flash Woman.

342
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,080
Lady Flash.

343
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,500
Hot Flash.

344
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Not that one.

345
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,760
Okay, we're gonna workshop that later.

346
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,100
Until then, I have to guard Central City.

347
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,550
Stop or I'll fire!

348
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,210
Keep your hands where I can see them!

349
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,650
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

350
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,920
Freeze!

351
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,220
What in the world?

352
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,160
Bug and Byte, you're under arrest!

353
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,220
- Go, go, go! - Take them down!

354
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,080
You fried your gauntlet and half the fleet.

355
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,880
It was only three cruisers.

356
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
Now Captain Frye's gonna be on his warpath

357
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,240
which is gonna make everybody's life miserable.

358
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm sorry, Nora.

359
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,190
I know today didn't exactly go so great.

360
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,550
Both robbers got away because of me.

361
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,150
Cut yourself a slice of slack pie.

362
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,180
It was your first day. No one got hurt.

363
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,160
And plus they found Bug and Byte hunched over

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,180
with runner's cramps, like, ten minutes later.

365
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,410
But I still feel so bad.

366
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,070
You're looking at this all wrong.

367
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,000
Today was not Nora's big failure.

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,160
Today was the Femme-Flash's big debut.

369
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,540
Naming superheroes is not easy.

370
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,620
Lia, you are the best friend a shrappy speedster

371
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,250
could ever ask for.

372
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,790
But I think we both know that CCPD isn't equipped

373
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,130
to stop this guy.

374
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,610
The only way we're gonna catch him before

375
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,820
anyone else gets hurt is if I start thinking

376
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,120
like a villainous speedster.

377
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,190
And how are you gonna do that?

378
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,710
I'm gonna go see one.

379
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,080
Reverse-Flash, huh?

380
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,470
Well, officer, you're, like, the second person in 15 years

381
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,530
who's come to visit this psychopath.

382
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,460
Not even a call.

383
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,920
Are you sure you want to interview him by yourself?

384
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,360
I've been alone with criminals before.

385
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,360
You have five minutes.

386
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,140
Eobard Thawne?

387
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,960
My name is Nora West-Allen, and I'm a CSI tech

388
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,390
with the CCPD.

389
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,930
I wanted to ask you a few questions, if I could.

390
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,650
Come closer.

391
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,670
Nora West-Allen.

392
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,630
Don't be afraid.

393
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,690
The dampening capabilities of this cell can negate

394
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,210
the powers of 1,000 meta-humans.

395
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,930
The glass, the walls, the ceiling, the floors

396
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,660
are all connected to a power energizer that will zap

397
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,570
this place with 400 kilojoules instantly

398
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,080
should the dampeners fail.

399
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,640
Making the cell phase-proof.

400
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,910
I couldn't hurt you, Nora West-Allen.

401
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,830
Even if I wanted to.

402
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,270
What are your questions?

403
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,730
How did you end up in here?

404
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,950
Was there nobody at CCPD that could answer

405
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,590
that question for you?

406
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,730
All the files pertaining to the Reverse-Flash

407
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,220
have been cyber locked.

408
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,470
And there's almost nothing about you in the Flash Museum.

409
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,560
Except for the date of your imprisonment.

410
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,820
Really?

411
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,540
That's all there is in the Flash Museum?

412
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,840
That's interesting.

413
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,000
Will you tell me how you were defeated?

414
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,740
Why do you want to know that?

415
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,180
It'll help us with an investigation.

416
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,770
You need to work on your lying.

417
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,640
Nora.

418
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,070
Your shoes are new.

419
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,080
But your soles are worn.

420
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,920
You have singe marks on your sleeves

421
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,670
and singe marks on your pant legs,

422
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,980
but most of all,

423
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,720
your cheeks are flushed with windburn.

424
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,420
Oh, I know that windburn.

425
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,820
I can still feel it.

426
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,910
You're a speedster.

427
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,210
Time's up.

428
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,700
Please, I need your help.

429
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,850
Come on. Let's go.

430
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,980
Time to repent, professor.

431
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,580
Thawne figured out I had powers,

432
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,930
but he wouldn't tell me anything about them.

433
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,690
What?

434
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,630
And don't tell me it's nothing

435
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,680
'cause your whole face says it's something.

436
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,090
You know this metal fragment they found

437
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,740
- underneath your shoulder? - Yeah.

438
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,220
Well, something about it was bugging me,

439
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,080
so I did some digging.

440
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,870
It turns out it's not from that shelf you got thrown into.

441
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,700
It's, uh--It's tech.

442
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,950
A chip made by S.T.A.R. Labs 25 years ago.

443
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,520
Like a chip you would use to find a lost animal?

444
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,500
- It's to dampen your speed. - What?

445
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,960
You didn't get your powers when Godspeed hit you

446
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,420
with his lightning.

447
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,350
It looks like you always had them.

448
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,340
I--I've always had powers?

449
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,040
Why do--Who would put a power dampening chip inside of--

451
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,510
Your mom lied to you your whole life.

452
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,800
I mean, that's next-level aggro.

453
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,790
How could she keep something like that from me?

454
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,990
I mean, what else has she lied to me about?

455
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,910
I think you're gonna have to ask her.

456
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,780
Oh, just the idea of that makes my blood boil.

457
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,210
That could be the macchiato.

458
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,420
It's possible I might have made that a triple.

459
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,830
At least I have one person in my life I can still trust.

460
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,420
- A triple. - That's been established.

461
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,450
No, no, no, not the coffee. I mean, yes, the coffee.

462
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,480
But the chemicals that Godspeed stole.

463
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,270
Benzene Methanol is unstable,

464
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,100
and if you add the Carbon Disulfide that he stole from Ollins lab--

465
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,860
Kablooey.

466
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,680
I remember that from 9th grade Analytical Chem.

467
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,870
And the only way to combine all those chemicals together

468
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,060
is if you add some kind of binding property.

469
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,930
Right, you'd need a plus-one oxidation state,

470
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,860
like a--a Dioxygen Difluoride.

471
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,520
Yes, and somewhere that's able to store that

472
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,210
and the only place in Central City that can

473
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,140
is Stagg Industries.

475
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,530
I cannot believe my first time at Stagg Industries

476
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,020
is as a burglar.

477
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,430
Or are we vigilantes?

478
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,980
Lia, I found it.

479
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,930
Unless your super speed came with super biceps,

480
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,800
we are not getting this out of here.

481
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,060
That's mine.

482
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,690
Uh, okay. Try and get this open.

483
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,250
It'll evaporate in seconds.

484
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,880
If you want it, you're gonna have to come through me to get it.

485
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,600
Ah, you're a speedster like me.

486
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,800
So you need it too.

487
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,320
Sorry.

488
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,440
No!

489
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,030
Lia! Lia!

490
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,990
Lia!

491
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,720
Lia!

492
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,260
The one person in the world she thought she could trust

493
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,190
died in her arms.

494
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,270
Nora must have felt completely alone.

495
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,520
- But she wasn't. - Yes, she was.

496
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,880
Because I wasn't honest with her.

497
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
Iris--

498
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,450
After all I did, she gave me a second chance.

499
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,170
It's the least we can do for her.

500
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,700
Mom?

501
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,660
Don't make me regret this.

502
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,800
What are you doing?

503
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,830
I'm giving our daughter the chance to explain this for herself.

504
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,980
Nora.

505
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,650
I heard about... Lia.

506
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,260
Honey, I'm so sorry.

507
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,540
I know how it is to lose someone you love.

508
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,420
If you don't wanna talk about it right now,

509
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,740
that's okay.

510
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,230
Or maybe you just don't wanna talk about it with me.

511
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,770
Nora, can I just make sure that you're okay?

512
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,620
Nora, I went to the hospital and they said that you left.

513
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,240
I guess lightning doesn't hurt as much

514
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,350
when you already have it coursing through your veins.

515
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,320
Does this look familiar?

516
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,990
How about now?

517
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,520
- Nora-- - Lia found it before she died.

518
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,220
You put this inside of me, Mom.

519
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,460
To dampen my powers?

520
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,230
You lied to me my whole life.

521
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,280
I know.

522
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,100
Who else knows?

523
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,940
Who else?

524
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,180
Everyone.

525
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,810
Everybody?

526
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,280
Everyone that I love has been keeping this from me?

527
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,680
- Why? - Because I told them to.

528
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,860
Why would you do that?

529
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,390
Nora, I was trying to protect you.

530
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,540
- From what? - From this city.

531
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,560
From--from meta-humans. From--from yourself.

532
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,740
- Nora, you don't understand. - No, I don't understand.

533
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,130
How did I get my powers?

534
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,630
What do you have against speedsters?

535
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,660
Nora, I have already lost so much.

536
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,850
I can't risk losing you too.

537
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,910
Well, you just did.

538
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,510
I'm gonna miss Lia too.

539
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,820
West-Allen, we all know how close you two were.

540
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,000
If you need some time off, I'm sure Captain Frye--

541
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,940
We need to get the guy who did this.

542
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,780
Whatever it takes.

543
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,810
We ran the evidence from the crime scene.

544
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,140
Turns out there was foreign DNA in Lia's exit wound.

545
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,970
But we've used it to positively ID this guy.

546
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,660
August Hart. Bio-hacker.

547
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,120
Mercury Labs intern, and then grad school.

548
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,900
All yours.

549
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,870
Says he was kicked out for testing

550
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,370
tachyon stimulants on coma patients.

551
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,180
What the hell's a tachyon?

552
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,320
A particle that moves faster than light.

553
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,180
Well, an arrest warrant's on its way now.

554
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,010
I promise you this guy's gonna get what he deserves.

555
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,190
Yes, he will.

556
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,480
Did you know not all villains had meta-human powers?

557
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,480
Some u--

558
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,100
- Make sure you get this. - Everybody move!

559
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,720
Godspeed's lightning...

560
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,940
It turned blue, just like Zoom's.

561
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,510
Hey, wait a sec.

564
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,590
Although her body disintegrated,

565
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,830
authorities uncovered evidence at Mercury Labs

566
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,200
of the illegal speed-enhancement drug, velocity-9.

567
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,690
This volatile stimulant gave Trajectory incredible speed,

568
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,550
but at a deadly price.

569
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,540
That's it.

570
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,480
Benzene Methanol, Carbon Disulfide,

571
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,430
Dioxygen Difluoride.

572
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,840
The base for the extracellular matrix for Velocity-9.

573
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,060
Only he's trying to make one that will last forever.

574
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,560
How do I stop a speedster?

575
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,570
- You can't. - Not alone.

576
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,160
But with you, I can.

577
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,310
No.

578
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,250
That plinth, it takes incoming calls

579
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,640
and from what I hear, you have a few left.

580
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,930
You could walk me through it via comms.

581
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,950
No.

582
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,720
He has stolen enough chemicals to make

583
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,990
an extracellular matrix that replicates speed powers.

584
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,000
I told you to leave.

585
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,470
The only thing that is stopping him from

586
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,710
becoming a speedster permanently is a stabilizing agent.

587
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,940
Once he gets that, he will be unstoppable.

588
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,740
I told you to leave! Guard!

589
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,790
Please.

590
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,030
He killed my best friend in front of me.

591
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,720
She's gone because of him, and you are the only person

592
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,330
that can stop it.

593
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,810
What the hell? You need to leave now.

594
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,110
Nora.

597
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,740
Okay, I'm at the innovation lab at CCU. Are you there?

598
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,850
Yes, I'm here.

599
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,140
Okay, are you sure this is gonna short out the scanner circuits?

600
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,790
Yes, I'm sure.

601
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,720
Vibrate your hands together. Build an electric shock.

602
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,610
Okay.

603
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,450
Schway.

604
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,460
It worked.

605
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,930
Now look for the brightest room.

606
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,580
The converter needs constant fluorescent light.

607
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,430
Now locate the biometric converter.

608
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,500
It will be a kidney-shaped object.

609
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,680
I think I found it.

610
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,730
No way for Godspeed to stabilize his Velocity-9 now.

611
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,490
You don't learn, do you?

612
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,790
That's mine.

613
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,190
Come and get it.

614
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,690
It worked!

615
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,350
No. He's got more V-9.

616
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,390
Nora, you need to get out of there now.

617
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,600
Right now!

618
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,130
I can't lose him!

619
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,030
Thawne!

620
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,600
Did you hear me? I said I can't lose him!

621
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,480
All right, Nora, do you see any walls

622
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,640
near where you are, preferably concrete?

623
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,630
Why?

624
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,700
Because I want you to run into one.

625
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,010
Or rather, through one.

626
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,870
I can't run through a concrete wall!

627
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
Yes, you can.

628
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,440
If you vibrate at the natural frequency of air,

629
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,110
your body--your cells will be in such a state

630
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,560
that they will phase right through that wall.

631
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,180
I can't do this!

632
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,410
Nora, listen to me.

633
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,660
Listen to my voice.

634
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,600
Breathe.

635
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,540
Breathe.

636
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,370
Feel the wind on your face.

637
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,950
The ground beneath your feet.

638
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,550
And the lightning.

639
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,280
Its electricity surging through your veins.

640
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,560
To your nerve endings from the crown of your head

641
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,300
to the tips of your toes like an electric shock

642
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,250
you never want to end.

643
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,150
You're part of something greater now, Nora.

644
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,420
You are part of the Speed Force and its power,

645
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,800
it's power is yours to use. Now do it.

646
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,850
I can't.

647
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,370
I can't do it.

648
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,940
Then good-bye, Little Runner.

649
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,050
No, no. Uh, I'm sorry.

650
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,680
I trust you. Uh, what now?

651
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,380
Nora, you can't run forever.

652
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,260
You're gonna have to stop him.

653
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,130
Tell me what you see around you.

654
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,550
I'm on 5th and Park.

655
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,740
I see Choi Enterprises, Peercoin Bank,

656
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,920
and CC Citizen Media.

657
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,250
Media, the satellites.

658
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,940
Nora, we're gonna use the satellites' electromagnetic radiation

659
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,400
to break the V-9 bonds.

660
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,350
Flood Godspeed with anti-endorphins.

661
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,290
Neutralizing the V-9 instantly.

662
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,480
Exactly, but here's the thing.

663
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,460
Those satellites recalibrate on the hour

664
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,690
emitting very short bursts of microwave energy.

665
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,900
You're only gonna have a few seconds to get Godspeed

666
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,960
in front of those bursts. Do you understand?

667
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,210
So I just need him to follow me into the building.

668
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,670
Not into the building. Up the building.

669
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,520
Uh, okay. I can do that.

670
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,820
Um, how fast do I have to go to run up a building?

671
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,850
As fast as you can.

672
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,170
- Here he comes. - Then run, Nora.

673
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,460
Run.

674
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,160
Wait for it, Nora. Wait.

675
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,200
And now!

676
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,710
Nora. Nora!

677
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,210
We did it! We did it.

678
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,890
Yes, we did.

679
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,460
Well, we don't have to worry about Godspeed anymore.

680
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,640
August Hart is in the custody of CCPD.

681
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,970
Bravo, Little Runner.

682
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,710
I still have a lot to learn, you know.

683
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,010
- You could train me. - I can't train you, Nora.

684
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,890
There's just not enough time.

685
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,690
What--what are you talking about?

686
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,950
- You're-- - Nora.

687
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,180
My time on this earth is coming to an end.

688
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,590
There's so much I wanted to ask you.

689
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,940
So much that I still don't know.

690
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,750
So much that my mom has lied to me about.

691
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,210
You have no idea.

692
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,810
What do you know?

693
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,650
Thawne, please, you may be the only person left

694
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,660
in my life who won't lie to me.

695
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,120
Nora,

696
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,990
how much do you really know about the Flash?

697
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,410
Five, six, seven.

698
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,710
Holy shrap.

699
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,140
Good evening, Nora West-Allen.

700
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,370
Hi.

701
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,700
You know who I am?

702
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,760
Of course. Nora West-Allen.

703
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,110
Daughter of Iris West and Barry Allen,

704
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,610
also known as the Flash.

705
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,440
S--Did you--

706
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Did you just say my father, Barry Allen,

707
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,530
was the Flash?

708
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,420
Would you like me to play your video message,

709
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,910
Nora West-Allen?

710
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,620
My--My message?

711
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,500
Yes, from your father, Barry Allen.

712
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,300
Uh, y--yes.

713
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,550
Nora,

714
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,500
I don't have much time.

715
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,190
If you're watching this, it means you're like me.

716
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,160
You have powers.

717
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,770
It also means I wasn't there to help you learn how to use them.

718
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,270
I wasn't there for a lot of things.

719
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,570
Remember, my sweet Nora,

720
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,760
always remember, I love you.

721
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,970
I always will.

722
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,050
I just wanted to see you, Dad.

723
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
Thawne...

724
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,810
showed me how.

725
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,110
And Cicada?

726
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,880
The one case we both couldn't solve.

727
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,500
It was my idea to come here and make it right.

728
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,020
Okay.

729
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,950
Can I have a minute alone with Nora?

730
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,760
Of course.

731
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,920
How many times did you go back to Thawne?

732
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,770
How many times?

733
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,490
After the night of the Enlightenment.

734
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,380
Five, uh, maybe six.

735
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,290
Even knowing he killed my mother?

736
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,630
- Dad-- - I understand...

737
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,120
coming back to meet me...

738
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,550
and the team.

739
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,750
I do.

740
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,460
I even understand going to Thawne...

741
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,360
to learn how to do it, but...

742
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,670
you kept going back.

743
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,430
Even after you knew what he did.

744
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,510
Even after he wasn't your only option anymore.

745
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,000
And the worst part is, you lied to us every time.

746
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,570
D-Dad, I--

747
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,690
I don't trust you, Nora.

748
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,890
I can't have anybody here with us

749
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,990
that I don't trust anymore.

750
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,550
W-what are you saying?

751
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,230
It's time for you to go home.

752
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,260
Dad, please don't do this!

753
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,510
I promise I will never see Thawne again!

754
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,560
Dad, don't do this!

755
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,900
Nora, if you try to run back in time again,

756
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,230
I will feel it in the Speed Force.

757
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,520
I'll know.

758
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,450
Good-bye, Nora.

759
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,070
So she finally came clean.

760
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,420
Or did you figure it out all by yourself?

761
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,900
One wasn't enough?

762
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,620
You had to try to take my daughter from me too?

763
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,630
My daughter!

764
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,390
I knew you'd react like this.

765
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,910
You're always so emotional,

766
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,010
which is why I had her keep all of this from you.

767
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,310
You can't blame the Little Runner, Barry.

768
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,310
She just wanted to spend some time with her dad.

769
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,720
Don't hold that against her.

770
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,300
Consider it a condemned man's last request.

771
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,020
You always thought you were so much smarter than us, Thawne.

772
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,050
But you lost.

773
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,220
And now you're finally gonna get what you deserve.
