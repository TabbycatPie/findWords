1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,039
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,120
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,298
by something impossible.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,375
My father went to prison for her murder.

5
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:20,582
Then an accident made me the impossible.

6
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:24,867
To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,212
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:29,816
and find others like me.

9
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:32,263
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,701
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,782
That day is today.

What? No Big Belly Burger?

14
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,830
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

15
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,499
We're out of cows where I come from.

16
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,442
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

17
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:54,384
Not sure where to start... Thawne.

18
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,656
That is your real name... Eobard Thawne.

19
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,394
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

20
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:01,135
136 years from now.

21
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:04,946
That's not what you want to know.

22
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,122
Go ahead, Barry.

23
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,393
Ask it.

24
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:13,269
Why did you kill my mother?

25
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,372
Because I hate you.

26
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,541
Not you now. You years from now.

27
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:20,713
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

28
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,583
We're enemies, rivals, opposites,

29
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:23,851
reverses of one another.

30
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:25,688
Why? Wh-why were we enemies?

31
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,128
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,999
It doesn't... matter anymore.

33
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,871
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

34
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,842
to defeat the other.

35
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:38,514
Until I learned your secret.

36
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,188
I learned your name.

37
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,991
Barry Allen.

38
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:47,830
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

39
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:51,705
Travel back in time, kill you as a child.

40
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:54,545
Wipe you from the face of the earth.

41
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,556
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

42
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:00,526
and we fought.

43
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:04,465
We both landed some pretty solid shots.

44
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:09,209
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

45
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,082
I was so mad.

46
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,755
But then I thought...

47
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:20,363
what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

48
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:24,235
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

49
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,739
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

50
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,178
Then you would not become The Flash.

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,515
And so I stabbed your mother in the heart,

52
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:34,217
and I was free.

53
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,057
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

54
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:42,229
only to realize that in traveling back

55
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:45,033
I'd lost my way home.

56
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:48,236
Lost my ability to harness the speed force.

57
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:51,774
And without it, I was stuck here.

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,846
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

59
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,380
And the only way back was The Flash.

60
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:02,980
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

61
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,180
Why train me?

62
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:12,913
Why help me save so many people?

63
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:16,581
Because I needed you to get fast.

64
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:21,180
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

65
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:23,116
and create a stable wormhole

66
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:26,052
through which I could return home.

67
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,653
Why would I ever do that?

68
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,219
Because...

69
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:34,561
Barry Allen, if you give me what I want,

70
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,764
I'm gonna give you what you want.

71
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:42,100
You can go back and save your mother.

72
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:45,073
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

73
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:49,108
You can reunite the Allen family.

74
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,716
No.

75
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:56,152
No, I don't believe you.

76
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,688
I want to kill you right now.

77
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,458
I know that rage.

78
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,927
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

79
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,962
And now, somehow,

80
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:14,063
I know what Joe and Henry feel

81
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:17,102
when they look on you with pride.

82
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,337
With love.

83
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,570
No. No.

84
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:22,504
Don't you ever say that to me!

85
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:24,274
I know you're upset,

86
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:27,675
but I'm giving you a chance.

87
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:33,511
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

88
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,780
Don't you want that chance?

89
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:53,995
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

90
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,199
and save your mother's life...

91
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:00,232
quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

92
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,137
The chance to be with someone you love?

93
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,141
Seems pretty cut and dry to me.

94
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:07,808
(Stein) At first blush,
Dr. Snow, it would appear so,

95
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,014
but this gift has unparalleled risk.

96
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,083
Barry, the night your mother died,

97
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,121
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

98
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:21,827
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

99
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,164
and changed the course of history.

100
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,633
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

101
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,770
Just like when I time traveled before.

102
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,273
But he... he only changed one day that time.

103
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:38,146
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

104
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,280
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

105
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:42,583
impacts everything that follows.

106
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,555
Moments upon moments, choices upon choices.

107
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:50,195
No relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

108
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:51,664
and you'd never know the difference

109
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,765
because you'd never remember any of it.

110
00:05:57,034 --> 00:06:01,770
So if I go back and save my mom,

111
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:05,410
my dad doesn't go to prison.

112
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:08,841
I never live with Joe and Iris.

113
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:14,182
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

114
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:18,218
Truth is, there's no real way

115
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,752
of knowing what your life will be.

116
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,627
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

117
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,998
You gotta change the past.

118
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:40,773
Joe?

119
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,646
So what... what, that's it?

120
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:47,352
You think I should just do it?

121
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:52,254
Yeah, I do.

122
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:55,756
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

123
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,092
you're okay with that?

124
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:01,765
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

125
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,899
You don't have to grow up without a mother.

126
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,433
What about growing up without a father?

127
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:10,306
You will have a father... your real father.

128
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:14,309
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

129
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:17,181
This is why you became The Flash, Barry.

130
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,352
To put things right.

131
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:24,492
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

132
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,195
Now it's time to save yours.

133
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:50,123
(Barry) Dad, look. I
know this sounds crazy.

134
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,656
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

135
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:56,992
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

136
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:59,161
No, I wouldn't be turning time back.

137
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:02,999
I would be... going back

138
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,535
to that night to save her.

139
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:09,069
And what does Joe think about all this?

140
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,504
[chuckles]

141
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,339
He thinks I should do it.

142
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,442
No.

143
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,011
You can't.

144
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:22,084
Dad...

145
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:27,526
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

146
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:28,828
We'll be a family again.

147
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,396
We are a family.

148
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:33,332
Not like this. Not without Mom.

149
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:38,334
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

150
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,003
Things happen the way they do.

151
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:42,138
We may not know why at the time,

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,340
but there must always be a reason.

153
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:47,644
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

154
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:52,316
I... I can save Mom.

155
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:54,851
At what cost?

156
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:57,319
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

157
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,655
- I don't care.
- I do.

158
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:05,430
I am in awe

159
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:09,903
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

160
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,273
all the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

161
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,641
but you, Barry.

162
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:17,410
Your honesty. Your heart.

163
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,745
You were always a hero.

164
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,414
And your mom would be just as proud.

165
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,552
And if she had a say in this,

166
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:29,787
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

167
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:32,523
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

168
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,762
she would never want that.

169
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:37,566
[crying]

170
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:41,537
Barry, what I hope for you,

171
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,973
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

172
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:50,448
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

173
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,620
And then you will know...

174
00:09:55,956 --> 00:10:00,292
How much I truly love you.

175
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:05,632
[thermometer beeps]

176
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,367
(Caitlin) 98.6. Normal.

177
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,235
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

178
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,004
Me neither.

179
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,305
I know Barry really appreciates you

180
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,003
coming back to help him stop Wells.

181
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,506
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

182
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,373
I'm here now. For good.

183
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,039
But I thought...

184
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,706
I thought too... I thought too much

185
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,607
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

186
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,910
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

187
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:32,114
If we hurt you.

188
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:38,282
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

189
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,787
I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

190
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,925
I love you, Cait.

191
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,798
- Are you sure?
- I am.

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,636
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

193
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:54,603
you agreed to marry me.

194
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,436
Yes, I did.

195
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,805
What do you say we do that?

196
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,514
Thought I might find you here.

197
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,351
I needed to get out of the lab.

198
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:18,355
[sighs]

199
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,454
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

200
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:21,991
Oh, it is. Trust me.

201
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:26,096
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

202
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,732
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings

203
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,234
with the mysterious "streak."

204
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,935
[both chuckle]

205
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

206
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,944
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

207
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:39,778
[both laugh]

208
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,213
- No.
- Uh-uh.

209
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:48,021
[gentle music]

210
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,458
So are you gonna do it?

211
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:56,966
It's just so... huge.

212
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,701
It's the biggest decision of my life,

213
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:02,701
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

214
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,572
Why would you want to?

215
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:10,407
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

216
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,378
have a great career,

217
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,210
even get married.

218
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:20,446
Iris West-Allen, huh?

219
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,147
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

220
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,383
Must be a 2024 thing. [chuckles]

221
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:30,553
We don't know that that's gonna happen.

222
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:35,759
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

223
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,995
that's why things are different there?

224
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:40,997
Growing up together and...

225
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,175
knowing so much about each other...

226
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:50,410
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

227
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,553
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

228
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,693
But living with you and Joe...

229
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:08,231
I've had a great life, Iris.

230
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,036
Come here, Barry.

231
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:21,875
What do you think I should do?

232
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,944
I need someone to tell me.

233
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:31,214
I think...

234
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:34,745
that for once in your life, Barry Allen,

235
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,414
you should stop thinking
about other people.

236
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,686
I think you should do what's in your heart.

237
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,287
Do what you need to do for yourself.

238
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:53,494
(Wells) Ah!

239
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,566
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

240
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,068
it took you a whole hour longer to decide

241
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,037
than I thought it would.

242
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,773
So how does this work?

243
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,443
Your grand plan?

244
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,749
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

245
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,417
In fact, it's rather simple.

246
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,919
We use the Particle Accelerator.

247
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,521
[laughs] The Particle Accelerator.

248
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:15,393
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

249
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:16,993
that hurt a lot of people.

250
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:20,298
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

251
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,067
the way it was designed to.

252
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:26,540
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

253
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,608
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

254
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,145
we're only going to inject one particle

255
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,148
into the accelerator.

256
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,283
And I'm what it collides with.

257
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,618
And if you can go fast enough, Barry,

258
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,255
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

259
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,556
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

260
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:49,491
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

261
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:52,161
to infinite times.

262
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:53,762
A wormhole.

263
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:57,335
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

264
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:01,340
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

265
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,977
my time.

266
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:07,381
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

267
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:09,084
What happens if I don't?

268
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:12,656
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry,

269
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,091
you'll die.

270
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,776
According to Wells' calculations,

271
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:24,413
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

272
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,117
Once Barry reaches optimum speed,

273
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:30,754
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

274
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:34,257
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

275
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,593
opening a gateway into time itself.

276
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,829
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

277
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,729
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

278
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:46,031
I'm uncommitted.

279
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,499
What do you think?

280
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,532
[sighs] I mean, on the one hand,

281
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,600
it does make a kind of sense.

282
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,301
On the other hand,

283
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:56,636
why?

284
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:59,407
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

285
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,140
You know why.

286
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:03,841
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

287
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:07,914
By my estimates, Mach Two at a minimum.

288
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,948
You've never gone that fast.

289
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,851
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

290
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:15,320
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

291
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,421
How far off am I?

292
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,489
Not very far, I'm afraid.

293
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:23,128
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

294
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,329
We're gonna need something else too.

295
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,364
Really? And what's that?

296
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,231
'Cause I don't know about you guys,

297
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:32,064
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

298
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,299
I need you to build a time machine.

299
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,902
Go on.

300
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:39,740
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

301
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,744
what's he need a time machine for?

302
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:44,413
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

303
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:47,148
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

304
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,350
He can't fully control it.

305
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:49,653
So I was right about the wheelchair.

306
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,455
He was using it to charge himself.

307
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:53,523
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

308
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,095
to travel back to the future.

309
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:57,900
He's been squirreling away the parts.

310
00:16:57,902 --> 00:16:59,700
Now we just need to put it together.

311
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,938
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

312
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,675
not a bookcase from IKEA.

313
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,409
We got a problem.

314
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,077
These tiles... they're made of tungsten.

315
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,310
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

316
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:10,712
of any other element.

317
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,916
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

318
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:14,552
The pressure exerted from the wormhole...

319
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:16,055
Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,994
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

321
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,365
It could explode.

322
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,137
Any ideas?

323
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,740
Let me ask Dr. Evil. [chuckles]

324
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,642
Which used to be a name that made me smile.

325
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,383
(Wells) Something on your mind, Cisco?

326
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:38,621
No.

327
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,890
Yes.

328
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,626
How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit

329
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,060
into that little ring?

330
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,260
Is it some sort of compressed micro tech?

331
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:49,692
Or actually, forget it. I don't care.

332
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,461
Maybe a little.

333
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,961
Ronnie's right.

334
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:56,929
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

335
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,266
Glad we're still good for something.

336
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:03,167
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

337
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,434
Or Ronnie's.

338
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,134
Matter of fact,

339
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:09,769
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

340
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:11,102
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

341
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,169
It would have been a lot more fun.

342
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:13,335
Yeah?

343
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:15,037
Well, doesn't change the fact

344
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,740
that your nifty little Time Sphere...

345
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,239
Is that what you're calling it?

346
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,837
Whatever it's called. It's gonna blow.

347
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,104
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

348
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:26,506
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

349
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,643
Okay. Fine. We'll try that.

350
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,011
(Wells) That's it? That's all?

351
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:32,111
Well, what do you want me to say?

352
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,943
I don't know, Cisco.

353
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,343
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

354
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,376
of my predicament.

355
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,679
I don't belong here.

356
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,916
These barbaric times.

357
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,517
It's like living amongst the dead.

358
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,221
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

359
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:52,456
What?

360
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,991
What did you say?

361
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:58,465
It was an alternate timeline.

362
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,633
One that Barry reset.

363
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:02,334
But I never forgot it.

364
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:06,170
It just kept coming back to me.

365
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:09,207
And I can still picture

366
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,705
the way you looked at me

367
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:14,440
when you called me a son

368
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:19,378
and you crushed my heart with your fist.

369
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,546
Cisco...

370
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:23,711
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,711
Yeah. It sucked.

372
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:28,646
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

373
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,548
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

374
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,249
of another timeline.

375
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,350
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

376
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,750
It means...

377
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:40,485
I wasn't sure until just now.

378
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:41,753
Sure of what?

379
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:47,691
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

380
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,998
You were affected too.

381
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:58,034
What are you talking about?

382
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,073
No.

383
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,008
I wasn't.

384
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,745
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

385
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:13,385
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

386
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:18,729
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

387
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,564
that you remember who gave you that life.

388
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,273
And that it was given out of love.

389
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:30,177
[ominous music]

390
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,134
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

391
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,470
with enough power
to run these calculations.

392
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,437
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

393
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,005
Say no more.

394
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,673
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

395
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:52,973
but it seems I'm only in the way.

396
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:56,976
Everyone has a contribution to make.

397
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:59,279
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

398
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,112
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

399
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,412
about the future.

400
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,147
I don't matter.

401
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:05,416
As far as history's concerned,

402
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:08,286
I don't save the day or get the girl.

403
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:10,822
And you believed him?

404
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:14,325
He had a newspaper from the year 2024.

405
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,658
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

406
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,462
I doubt my teaching assistant would testify

407
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:23,967
to its authenticity.

408
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:29,909
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

409
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:34,283
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

410
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:35,817
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

411
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:37,785
Me?

412
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:40,958
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

413
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,196
and get stuck in the exact same city

414
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:46,268
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

415
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,741
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

416
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,815
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

417
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:57,020
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

418
00:21:57,022 --> 00:22:02,726
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

419
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,930
Which is?

420
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:07,197
Coincidence.

421
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:12,167
There is no science to coincidence.

422
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,502
You, sir, are an anomaly.

423
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:19,304
A wild card, as it were.

424
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:22,172
You are the only person in this whole story

425
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,941
who gets to choose his own future.

426
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:28,940
At least, that's my opinion.

427
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:30,807
[computer blips]

428
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,076
Wait, that can't be right.

429
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:35,612
Oh, dear.

430
00:22:35,614 --> 00:22:37,776
- We have a problem.
- What?

431
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,980
(Stein) The calculations.
There is a danger.

432
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:42,448
I know. I'm ready to take the risk.

433
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,449
No, not just to you but to everyone.

434
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,016
Wells didn't tell us everything.

435
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:50,519
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

436
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:52,489
colliding with the hydrogen particle,

437
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:57,594
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

438
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,595
What's a singularity?

439
00:22:58,597 --> 00:22:59,630
It's a black hole.

440
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:01,532
We could destroy Central City.

441
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,199
For starters.

442
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:08,139
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

443
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:12,313
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

444
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:16,484
So long and thanks for all the fish.

445
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,715
(Wells) Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

446
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:24,317
(Stein) I would hardly
refer to possibly causing

447
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,015
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

448
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:28,786
(West) Yeah, and your accelerator's

449
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:31,457
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

450
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:32,458
[chuckles]

451
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,458
Let me ask you a question.

452
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,030
How many meta-humans...

453
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:38,266
how many dangers...

454
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:41,740
have we faced this year together?

455
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:44,176
Or did you forget that was me

456
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,511
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

457
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:49,013
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

458
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:50,647
It will work.

459
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:52,481
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

460
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:53,951
in the middle of Central City?

461
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:56,550
So, once the wormhole stabilizes,

462
00:23:56,552 --> 00:24:00,519
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

463
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:02,321
and return to this time.

464
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:03,921
If and when he does that,

465
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,121
you can close the wormhole,

466
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:07,922
and we can all live happily ever after.

467
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,323
Almost two minutes.

468
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,525
More than enough time to save Nora.

469
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:14,760
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

470
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,962
Everything's a choice.

471
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,231
And what if I'm late?

472
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:21,735
You won't be. I believe in you, Barry.

473
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:22,737
Always have.

474
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,507
So I guess the question is,

475
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:27,210
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

476
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,963
[sighs]

477
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,902
[laughs]

478
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:51,241
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

479
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:53,679
then I'm dust, and if I do run fast enough

480
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,381
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

481
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:58,015
swallow up the city and possibly the world.

482
00:24:59,985 --> 00:25:01,253
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

483
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,455
this is for the best?

484
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,621
I'd be lying if I told you I did.

485
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:09,826
[laughs]

486
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:12,728
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

487
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,963
I thought you were the sure one.

488
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:16,099
I...

489
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,799
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

490
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,500
the first time.

491
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,539
I was faking it.

492
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,774
Sometimes parents do that.

493
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:26,942
Most of the time, parents do that.

494
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:32,050
Look, of course I'm scared.

495
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:36,420
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

496
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:38,056
because you were worried about me.

497
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:40,495
Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe,

498
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,830
just like you'll always worry about me.

499
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,399
Sorry, but you can't stop that.

500
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,335
[sighs]

501
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,708
Do you think I can do this?

502
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,974
You think I can save my mom?

503
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:58,644
I mean, do you think I'm fast enough?

504
00:25:58,646 --> 00:25:59,878
Yes.

505
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,913
I know you are.

506
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:11,225
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

507
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,690
saving her,

508
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:17,159
freeing my dad, and...

509
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,429
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

510
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:20,763
Barry...

511
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:24,197
Joe, it's true. It's true.

512
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,668
I've always been so focused on everything

513
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,074
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

514
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:36,711
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

515
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:38,545
another.

516
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:43,184
And I don't think I can lose you.

517
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,854
You won't ever lose me.

518
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,856
Ever, you hear me?

519
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,757
Ever.

520
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,435
Wow, slow news day?

521
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:06,110
If they only knew, right?

522
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,547
I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs.

523
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,082
I was.

524
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,085
Then I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chows.

525
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:16,521
For dim sum? Your favorite.

526
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:18,723
And to remind myself of something.

527
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:19,957
What?

528
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:28,703
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

529
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:32,475
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

530
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:36,277
Katie Rogers. She was a dancer.

531
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,612
We had plans to meet at Mama Chows,

532
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:40,014
but she texted me.

533
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:41,414
She pulled a hamstring and had to cancel.

534
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,081

721
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,766
Three, two, one.

722
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:30,935
Ronnie, are you okay?

723
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,336
[grunts] Did you do it?

724
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:33,938
Yes, I turned them all off.

725
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,781
They did it. They cut the generator.

726
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:41,084
[grunting]

727
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:45,420
Just so we're clear,

728
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,755
after I kill you,

729
00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:48,524
I'm going to kill them.

730
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:50,628
And then I'm going to kill your father.

731
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,797
I always win, Flash.

732
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,132
[gunshot]

733
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,108
[screams] Eddie! Oh, my...

734
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:05,576
(West) Eddie!

735
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:07,281
What did you do?

736
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:13,550
What did you do? What did you do?

737
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:16,422
No such thing as a coincidence.

738
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:20,690
What's happening?

739
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,491
Cisco, help me.

740
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:25,127
Eddie's his ancestor.

741
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,695
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born, and...

742
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,099
He's being erased from existence.

743
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:37,370
No! No! Eddie.

744
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:38,835
Eddie, no, no.

745
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,970
Stay with me, okay? Stay.

746
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,036
[crying]

747
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,771
He was wrong, it turns out.

748
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,373
I'm a hero after all.

749
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,509
You are, Eddie. You are my hero.

750
00:40:50,511 --> 00:40:53,745
That's all I ever wanted to be.

751
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:55,380
Your hero.

752
00:40:57,452 --> 00:40:58,985
[gasps]

753
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,190
No!

754
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:09,996
[Iris cries]

755
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:12,599
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

756
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:15,703
How will you get along without me?

757
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,776
[screams]

758
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,168
Guys, that's not good.

759
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,902
Professor, I shut down the wormhole.

760
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,972
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

761
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:50,506
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

762
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,974
We got to go.

763
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,508
You okay?

764
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,878
Iris, we have to go.

765
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,618
I'm not leaving him.

766
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,019
We have to go now, honey. I'm sorry.

767
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,338
So that's what we didn't want to happen.

768
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,207
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

769
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:25,379
The singularity won't stop, not
even after the Earth is gone.

770
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:28,613
- [tires screech]
- [people screaming]

771
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,101
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

772
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,102
What?

773
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:50,702
Diffuse material

774
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:52,370
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

775
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:53,404
What does that mean?

776
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,473
We have to disrupt the motion.

777
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:58,546
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

778
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:00,049
And bigger.

779
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,815
And scarier.

780
00:43:01,817 --> 00:43:03,616
Barry, that event has an energy level

781
00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:06,121
of at least 6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

782
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:07,623
It cannot be stopped.

783
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,698
I have to try.

784
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,601
[dramatic choral music]

785
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,246
Oh, God.

786
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,317
Barry.

787
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,254
[heroic music]

788
