1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,616
So, graduated
magna cum laude from Loyola,

2
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,922
played varsity soccer
in high school,

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,926
sang karaoke with Mike Ditka
at Franky's Tavern.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,886
You Don't Send Me Flowers.
Barbra Streisand. Neil Diamond.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,279
Go.
- Okay.

6
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,150
Ditka don't do karaoke
so that's the lie.

7
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:21,934
No, definitely not.
It's soccer.

8
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:23,719
The woman hates moving.
- Yeah, there's no way

9
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,503
you played varsity soccer
in high school.

10
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,331
Well, they didn't even have
girls' soccer back then, so.

11
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,206
Up high.
- Who was your coach?

12
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,862
What is it?

13
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,342
It's the Loyola thing.

14
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,735
I dropped out after two years

15
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,519
so I could move to LA
with my boyfriend.

16
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,652
I played keyboards in
a heavy metal rock band

17
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,655
called Black Ice.
What could possibly go wrong?

18
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,700
25 years, I think
that's pretty amazing.

19
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,702
Yeah, well,
it's actually insane

20
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,965
and by the way,
it feels more like 50

21
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,532
so get out while you can.

22
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,795
Hey, guys, sorry
to break up the party.

23
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,145
I got a call from the CI.

24
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,060
Drug mule just
showed up at his motel.

25
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,887
We gotta roll.

26
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,717
Girl got here an hour ago.

27
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,371
She's been seeing two guys
that were here before.

28
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,460
Any photos?
Names?

29
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,202
No.
One was young, like, 20.

30
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,335
The other is 35, maybe 40.

31
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,119
Both Hispanic.
- They still here?

32
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,903
Not sure.

33
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,384
They checked in room 204.

34
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,821
All right,
thanks, Greg.

35
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,086
Room 204.

36
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,217
Copy that.

37
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,186
Sir, can you stop
right there, please.

38
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,231
Sir.

39
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,103
Chicago Police.
I need you to stop right there.

40
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,150
Get behind me.
Don't move, stop.

41
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,021
Don't move.
Stay down.

42
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,633
Offender jumped downstairs.

43
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,984
Chicago PD.

44
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,855
Drop the weapon.

45
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,772
Call it in.

46
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,296
Get back.
Clear this floor.

47
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,297
Go.

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,618
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,319
What kind of animal
does something like that?

50
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:29,975
Kind who doesn't
lose his drugs.

51
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,204
Got an ID on the female DOA.

52
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:45,730
Name is Gloria Sanchez, 19.

53
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:49,299
For now, the male DOA
is a John Doe.

54
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:51,736
So John Doe takes
the trip with the mule,

55
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,912
delivers her to the buyer,
make sure nothing goes wrong.

56
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,610
Sounds right to me.

57
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,394
Poor kid had enough cocaine
in her system to kill a horse.

58
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,396
Stomach acid ate
through the latex.

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,093
Was she alive when
they cut her open?

60
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,878
Looks that way.

61
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:08,536
I did find something else
you might be interested in.

62
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,844
All right, this was found
on the back of Gloria's hand.

63
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:15,630
Guessing it's one of those
invisible nightclub stamps.

64
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,284
Okay, but why would a girl
with a kilo worth of blow

65
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,720
inside of her
walk into that nightclub?

66
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,591
Manifest came in
from Customs, guys.

67
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,158
I got the name
of the John Doe.

68
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,856
It's Miguel Lopez, age 29.
Lists his recent place

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,293
of employment as
the Scorpion Club.

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,859
Occupation: bartender.

71
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,732
Anything on this girl
he gutted, Gloria Sanchez?

72
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,256
Yeah, also Scorpion Club.
Occupation: dancer.

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,432
Yeah, that's the place
on 6th and Steward, right?

74
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:36,651
Yeah, that's the one.

75
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,392
The logo matches
the hand stamp.

76
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,002
All right, so run the
owner and every employee.

77
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,569
Look, this is a homicide now.

78
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,179
We bust the guy
moving the drugs,

79
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,095
we can nail him
for murder too.

80
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,053
Bartender's name is
Larry Wozniak.

81
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,359
He's got one prior
for possession

82
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,969
with intent to distribute.
My CI heard,

83
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,667
he was the one moving
coke at the Scorpion.

84
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,364
Larry, got it.
- Yeah, he's tall.

85
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,974
Black hair.
- Got it.

86
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,889
This guy got busted
for a half ounce,

87
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,543
like, two years ago.
You sure he's

88
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,415
a shot caller now?
This guy?

89
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,243
He's running
drug mules from Mexico?

90
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,548
We gotta start
somewhere, right?

91
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,290
Right now,
somewhere is Larry.

92
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:28,093
So how long you been
dancing, Riley?

93
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,226
Me, dancing?

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,056
Yeah, that's not
really my thing.

95
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,145
I just like to party.

96
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,929
Enjoy the beautiful scenery.

97
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,757
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

98
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:45,981
I got a question for you.

99
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:51,116
My girl said that you're the
guy to come to for some...

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,335
party products.

101
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,381
Yeah, and who's your girl?

102
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:58,123
Katie, stage name August.
She used to work here.

103
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:03,085
You remember her.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,783
Yeah, she said there was a
hot bartender at the Scorpion

105
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,221
who has top-notch blow and
I just assumed it was you.

106
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,401
Cover for me.
- Okay.

107
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,098
Come with me.

108
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,842
Price is 250 an eight-ball.

109
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:24,759
250? That's pretty steep.
- That's what it costs.

110
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,456
Unless, of course,
you're willing to trade it

111
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,197
for something else of value.

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,981
No, thank you.

113
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,375
Come on, Riley.

114
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,682
This powder's pure as snow.

115
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,468
Sex on this stuff
will blow your mind.

116
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,866
This guy's pushing his luck.
- It's all right.

117
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,129
She knows how to handle
idiots like that.

118
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,872
If she needs backup,
she'll use the safe word.

119
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,355
This is very tempting
but...

120
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,400
Come on, Riley.
You're killing me.

121
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,402
I'm seeing somebody

122
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,274
so you should step back...

123
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,667
Now.

124
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,022
But I'll still
give you the 250.

125
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,111
Fine.

126
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,200
I like cash too.

127
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,941
Thanks.

128
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,554
Look, I don't know
if you're interested

129
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:23,034
but the guy I'm seeing.

130
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,297
He's looking to do some deals.
Some big deals.

131
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,690
I'm good.

132
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,301
He'd be a good customer.
- Why's that?

133
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,434
Because he's rich.

134
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,044
Our third date,
he gave me this.

135
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,872
Costs ten grand.

136
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,534
We're up.

137
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:55,371
What's up, Riley?
- Larry.

138
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,677
This is Jake.

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,113
Larry.
- Good to meet you.

140
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,158
Tell me, how does
a bartender get his hand

141
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,986
on 95% pure coke?

142
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,727
Well, I got friends...

143
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,121
and they got friends...
in Juarez.

144
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:08,732
Okay, I'd like to get
my hands on some.

145
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,951
You think you could
help me with that?

146
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,561
Sure.
How much you looking for?

147
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,650
Three kilos.

148
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:16,566
Three kilos?

149
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,350
That's a lot of weight.
I can maybe hook you up

150
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,440
with a few ounces,
maybe a quarter key.

151
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,920
Quarter key.

152
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,444
I'm sorry, Riley made
it sound like

153
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,836
you were more connected
than that.

154
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,360
I think we've had
a misunderstanding.

155
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,624
Oh, no.
Hold on.

156
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,279
If you want...

157
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,629
I can hook you up
with my source.

158
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,935
His name is Spiro.
He runs the Scorpion Club.

159
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,589
He can get his hands
on all kinds of weight.

160
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,112
That sounds good.

161
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,202
But I want 10% commission
on every purchase you make.

162
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:45,769
All right.

163
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,815
If the product is as good
as what I sampled, Larry,

164
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,512
you have yourself a deal.

165
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,645
All right.

166
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,213
I'll be in touch.

167
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,825
Spiro Dalon.
Grew up in Greek Town.

168
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,001
He's got a clean record.
He owns the Scorpion Club

169
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,611
and he does pretty well
for himself.

170
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,786
Suspiciously well.

171
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,135
I had Asset Forfeiture
run the financials

172
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:05,920
for his club
and the numbers don't add up.

173
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,313
He's in the hole until
six months ago and then

174
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,793
there's this huge surge
in profits.

175
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,534
I mean, there's no way
that's legit business.

176
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,188
They'd need, like, a revolving
door for all those customers.

177
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,059
Right, so I checked
with Immigration.

178
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,801
Along with Gloria Sanchez,
I got a dozen other temporary

179
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,151
work visas for exotic dancers
from Juarez this year.

180
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,067
They all list Scorpion Club
as their place of employment.

181
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,766
Frequent border crossings.
Multiple trips, it's a pattern.

182
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,942
Okay, so Spiro uses
his own girls as mules

183
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,596
to smuggle the coke
in his own club

184
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,206
to launder the money.
Smart hustle.

185
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,382
Well, now it's your turn
to hustle.

186
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,818
Once you get in with this guy,

187
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:39,170
get him to trust you
and make a deal.

188
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,012
Spiro...

189
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,972
this is guy I was
telling you about, Jake.

190
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,495
Yeah.

191
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,497
The kid with the Aston Martin.

192
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,676
And who's this?
- I'm Riley.

193
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,243
Nice to meet you, Riley.

194
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,028
Thank you, Larry.

195
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:17,208
Have a seat.

196
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,732
This is a nice place
you have here, Spiro.

197
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,211
This is a nice place.

198
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,562
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

199
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,304
Yeah, I put a lot of time
and money into this place.

200
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,263
So...

201
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:29,743
You know...

202
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,614
Larry tells me that you're

203
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,442
interested in doing
some business.

204
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,357
I am.
Very much so.

205
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,142
Where you selling now?

206
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:41,058
Up and down the North Shore.
Evanston, Winnetka.

207
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:46,803
All my clients are white
upper-class professionals.

208
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,284
So premium price,
premium product.

209
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,070
So what do you need me for?

210
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,898
Seems like you got
it all figured out.

211
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,902
 I did...
But, my supplier

212
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,035
He got into a little
disagreement with his friends

213
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,950
down south and he split town
in a hurry,

214
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,996
leaving me with a lot of
very unhappy customers.

215
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,519
You know what I mean?

216
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,569
And this

217
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,311
Supplier...
does he have a name?

218
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,619
I don't give out names.
No disrespect.

219
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,099
I'm sure you can
appreciate that.

220
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,362
Fair enough.

221
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,453
Let me see your
driver's license.

222
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:41,684
Okay.

223
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:45,383
Well, you know, Jake,

224
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,429
you seem cool.

225
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,300
You know.
So...

226
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:52,652
let me do
my due diligence and...

227
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,305
see if we can
work something out.

228
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:55,959
All right.

229
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,309
All right.
- Boss.

230
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,704
Rita's downstairs.
- Good.

231
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,498
What happened?
We just lost audio.

232
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,679
Tell her I'll be down
in a sec.

233
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,171
Something wrong?

234
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,347
No.

235
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,742
I get jumpy around cops.

236
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,962
Relax, He's with me.

237
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,311
He's my security guy.

238
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,270
You know it doesn't hurt
to have a cop

239
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,968
around every once in a while.
- Sure.

240
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,710
I'm gonna keep that in mind.
Thank you for your time.

241
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:54,235
My pleasure.
We'll talk soon.

242
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,115
Everything okay?
We lost signal

243
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,726
for a few minutes toward
the end of the conversation.

244
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,249
Yeah.
My battery died.

245
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,817
We're good.
- All right.

246
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,386
What the hell
just happened in there?

247
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,522
Do you know that cop in there?

248
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,306
Yeah.

249
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,221
Who is he?

250
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,748
That's my dad.

251
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,234
My dad's a cop.
Did I ever tell you that?

252
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,846
No.
- Yeah, so I guess...

253
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,239
he must be moonlighting here.

254
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,763
He just never told me about it.

255
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,416
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

256
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,246
Your dad, who's a cop, works
security at the Scorpion Club.

257
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,293
I think he works for Spiro.
- What?

258
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,599
Spiro said he's with me
so I assume

259
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,602
he works for Spiro.
I don't know.

260
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,300
Adam,

261
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,389
is there a chance
your dad's dirty?

262
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,980
Dad?

263
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,554
Dad.

264
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,907
What are you doing, old man?

265
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,560
You know you can
hire people for that.

266
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:46,477
Yeah, and they cost
100 bucks an hour.

267
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,436
That was a hell of
a surprise last night.

268
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,655
A little bit, yeah.
Made me a little nervous.

269
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,179
You didn't give me up, did you?

270
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:54,616
No, you think I'm an idiot?
No, I didn't give you up.

271
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,009
I mean, I figured
you were undercover.

272
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,228
Why else would you be
dressed like such a jackass.

273
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,885
So.

274
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,237
This case you're working on got
anything to do with the owner?

275
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,717
Spiro?
- Why would you say that?

276
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,284
 I'm just asking,
that's all.

277
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:13,504
I can't talk about the case,
Pops, you know that.

278
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,332
I'm your father.

279
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,769
I can't talk about the case.

280
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,554
I would like to know
what the hell you're doing

281
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,338
working for the owner
of a strip club, though.

282
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,645
What am I doing?
I'm getting paid.

283
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,908
Getting paid to do what?

284
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,692
Work security.

285
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,739
Right, well, there's nothing
else I need to know about?

286
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,830
You asking me if I'm dirty?
- I'm asking if there's

287
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,877
anything else I need
to know about, that's all.

288
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:43,578
No.
- Okay, good. Good.

289
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,928
And I assume my name
isn't going to appear

290
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,974
on some police report.
I mean, I know it's not

291
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,932
a big deal, but technically
it is a violation

292
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,934
to work for some guy who owns
an establishment like that.

293
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,631
No, you're good.

294
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:57,200
What do you do for him,
exactly, day to day?

295
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,028
Hang out.
Run errands.

296
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,944
Sometimes I take a girl
to a bachelor party

297
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,251
make sure no one acts like
an idiot, that kinda thing.

298
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,643
Speaking of girls,
who's that Rita

299
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,384
you guys were talking about?

300
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,733
Rita Moore.

301
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,953
That's Spiro's lady friend.

302
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,346
His lady friend.

303
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,788
This is Rita Moore.
Spiro's current girlfriend.

304
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,398
Found these pictures
on her Instagram feed.

305
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:25,185
This was posted two days ago,
right here, 4:00 p.m.

306
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,709
This is Spiro, of course, Rita,
and back here...

307
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,058
Gloria Sanchez.

308
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,104
Less than an hour
before her murder.

309
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,323
Looks like Rita just became
our number-one eyewitness.

310
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,499
What do we know about her?
- She's an exotic dancer,

311
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,762
single mother,
two drug priors,

312
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,069
and she's got a pending case
for a DUI.

313
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:43,072
Good work.
Hailey, bring her in.

314
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,468
You got a DUI trial
comin' up, Rita.

315
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,818
It's your third offense.

316
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,734
I know I messed up but
my lawyer says if I plea out,

317
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,650
I might get probation.
- No.

318
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,565
Your baby was in the back seat.

319
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,262
You're looking at two,
maybe three years.

320
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:01,482
Which means time away
from your daughter.

321
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,834
What the hell
are you talking about?

322
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,792
My lawyer said I'd be fine.

323
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,794
Your lawyer is wrong.
- Now, look,

324
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:14,103
the good news is,
we can help.

325
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,149
But you gotta help us first.

326
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,543
Help you how?

327
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:22,329
We need information...

328
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,721
about Spiro.

329
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,897
No.

330
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,639
No way.
Spiro is a good guy.

331
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,206
Sure about that?

332
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,691
You know this girl?

333
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,694
Yeah, her name is Gloria.

334
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,609
Haven't seen her around
in a couple months,

335
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,219
and she came by the club
the other day.

336
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,049
So what?

337
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:53,490
Oh, my God.

338
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,145
Turns out, he's not
such a good guy.

339
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,540
All right, come on, Rita,

340
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,716
tell us what happened
that night.

341
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,505
Come on, what'd you see?
What'd you hear?

342
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,902
Gloria showed up...

343
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,904
said that she needed
to see Spiro right away,

344
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,472
that she wasn't feeling well.

345
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,517
Spiro came over,

346
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,693
started talking to her...

347
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,307
Then he called someone.

348
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,656
Did he use his cell phone?

349
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,050
Yeah, but...
not his normal one.

350
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,573
It was a different color,
I think.

351
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,531
All right,
then what happened?

352
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,407
Spiro and Gloria left.
I don't know where they went.

353
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,191
Yeah, well, I do.

354
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,585
They went somewhere where
Spiro did that to Gloria

355
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,328
so he didn't lose his precious
cocaine stuffed inside her.

356
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,203
Yes or no, Rita?

357
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:01,123
Okay.

358
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,560
I'll help you.

359
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,565
Tell me what you need me to do.

360
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,779
Rita just walked
into the VIP room

361
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:49,954
with Spiro and another male,

362
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,957
30s, Latino, average build.

363
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,961
Bro,
I gotta ask, man.

364
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,312
Why you lying about
the COH thing?

365
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,445
What do you mean?
- I checked it.

366
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:05,274
Your battery wasn't dead.

367
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,971
That's my bad.

368
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,278
I made a mistake.

369
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,237
Really?

370
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,674
Like that?
What kinda mistake is that?

371
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:20,028
I can't talk about it, bro.
Sorry.

372
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,378
No, I hear you. I hear what
you're saying, man.

373
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:23,771
Vodka soda, thanks.

374
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,207
Hey, baby.
Can I borrow your phone?

375
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,078
Hang on.
- I took some photos on it

376
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,428
the other day and I wanna
send them to myself.

377
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,994
Okay, you know what?

378
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,387
Go get yourself another drink.
- No.

379
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:32,867
I got some business
to take care of.

380
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,303
Rita's pushing
too damn hard now.

381
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,739
Damn.

382
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,915
All right, Hailey.

383
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,049
Pull Rita.
Now.

384
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,801
We're calling it.
It's not gonna happen tonight.

385
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,498
What? Spiro doesn't
suspect a thing.

386
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,674
We'll try again tomorrow.

387
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,459
Go back in there, act normal.

388
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,157
Don't bring up the damn phone.
- What about our deal?

389
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,115
Deal's still good.
We'll talk tomorrow morning

390
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,291
and we'll figure
something else out

391
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,031
Okay?
- Okay.

392
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,250
Okay.

393
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,868
Any news from your dad?

394
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,696
Any news from my dad?
What do you mean?

395
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,045
You talk
to him yesterday?

396
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,699
No.
I'm trying to keep

397
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,572
as much distance as possible
until we're done with the case.

398
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,835
Why, was he at the club?
- Yeah.

399
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,576
What was he doing?
- I don't know.

400
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,578
But I gotta be honest.
He's making me nervous.

401
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,927
All right, fair enough.

402
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,451
Adam.

403
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:36,452
Son of a bitch.

404
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,763
Clear.

405
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,288
Clear.

406
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,379
Clear.

407
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,570
Okay, okay.

408
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:11,922
5021 Ida.
We got a DOA at our location.

409
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,272
Notify Forensics.

410
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,753
Okay.

411
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,585
Damn it.

412
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,900
Someone slit her throat.
- Not someone, Spiro.

413
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,728
DCFS is looking
after the baby,

414
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:36,686
and I got three patrol guys
outside knocking on doors

415
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,123
and looking for witnesses
but so far, nothing.

416
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,603
So there's no sign
of forced entry,

417
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,736
no sign of struggle, so...

418
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,086
it seems like she let
her killer in the door.

419
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,827
Or he had a key.

420
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,873
I'll get an emergency
ping on Spiro's phone.

421
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,966
We did everything
we could, Hailey.

422
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,013
We pulled her out.
- No, we pulled her in.

423
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:03,278
We used her kid as leverage and
forced her to push too hard.

424
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,280
Look, I hope I'm wrong
about your dad.

425
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,934
Don't go there
with me right now.

426
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:10,285
Last night, your dad saw me.
He saw me nod to Rita.

427
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,419
Okay.
He looked right at me...

428
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,421
and now Rita's dead.
- Okay, so what?

429
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,684
So my dad, who's a cop,

430
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,295
what, he outs you as a cop,
he outs Rita as a snitch,

431
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,818
he goes and tells Spiro?

432
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,559
You don't know how off base
you are, right now.

433
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,605
We have to look
at the facts, Adam.

434
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,608
You like it or not, your dad
is working for this prick.

435
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,873
You need to talk to Voight.

436
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,440
I already told you.
- Today.

437
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,485
I'll take care of it.
- Or I will.

438
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,707
You being serious right now?

439
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,710
Seriously?

440
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:44,624
It's me.

441
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,929
Don't do that.
- Do what?

442
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,453
Don't try and play me.
- Play you?

443
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,715
I don't care if
we're sleeping together

444
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,369
that doesn't change
how I do my job.

445
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,558
You should've told me sooner.
- I know.

446
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,430
I know.
I wanted to, but, just...

447
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:11,477
Didn't wanna jam your father
up for working at a strip club.

448
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,177
I get it.

449
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,006
Boss, we're good.

450
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,964
I mean, he's just working
security, he doesn't know about

451
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,488
the drugs, he doesn't know
about the murders.

452
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,490
He thinks that Spiro
is an idiot party boy.

453
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,101
You know what I mean?
That's all.

454
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,538
I assume you didn't
tell him who we're after...

455
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:31,453
or what we're after.
- No, I never talked

456
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,803
about the investigation.
I never would.

457
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,850
He should be all right then.

458
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:40,506
We are gonna play
this one out, though, Adam.

459
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,724
And we're gonna follow
the facts,

460
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,204
no matter where they lead...

461
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:47,687
or who they point to so...

462
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,124
If you have any doubts.
- No.

463
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:59,002
Spiro was at
the Scorpion Club all night.

464
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,395
He left around 4:15 a.m.

465
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,353
We even have the surveillance
footage to back it up.

466
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,660
Right, and according to
the ME, Rita died at 2:00 a.m.

467
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,228
which takes Spiro off the hook
for the murder, at least.

468
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,577
I got something.

469
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,492
This is from a resident's

470
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,929
home security camera
near Rita's apartment.

471
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:16,237
A man in a baseball cap
enters at 1:50 a.m.

472
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,760
exits again nine minutes later.

473
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,414
Can you get any closer
to his face?

474
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,677
No, and I have been trying.
But working backwards

475
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,723
from PODS and footage
from other buildings,

476
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,551
I was able to piece
together his path

477
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,509
and pulled
a plate from his car

478
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:30,338
which is registered
to a Juan Morales.

479
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,731
Who the hell is Juan Morales?

480
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,384
Male, 37, Hispanic.

481
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:36,039
He's get quite a rap sheet.
Two narcotics related charges,

482
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,912
and one aggravated battery
with a deadly weapon.

483
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:42,829
I saw this guy
at the club with Spiro.

484
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,308
This guy.

485
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:47,834
Well, looks to me like
Juan Morales is our alpha dog.

486
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:50,445
Hold on, I mean...
The only problem is,

487
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,317
other than his car being near
Rita's apartment, we don't have

488
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,537
any real evidence tying him
to either of these murders.

489
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,017
All right, so...

490
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,933
We lay off Morales for now.
We focus on Spiro.

491
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,413
And you have gotta do,
whatever you gotta do

492
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:04,720
to make a drug deal
with this guy.

493
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,417
Listen, we catch Spiro dirty,

494
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,377
maybe we can get him to give up
Morales on the murders.

495
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,945
Right.

496
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:18,081
So I'm gonna ask
one more time.

497
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,649
You sure your old man
is just holding doors?

498
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,481
'Cause that's your dad
with the killer.

499
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,022
Who the hell is he?
- Nice to see you too.

500
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,633
Dad, I need you
to answer the question.

501
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,157
Watch the tone.
- Dad, stop.

502
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,507
Who the hell is this?

503
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,857
It's a friend of Spiro's.

504
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:57,164
His name is Juan.
Why? What's this about?

505
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,340
You're done.

506
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,776
No more Spiro.
No more security.

507
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,778
It's over.
- What are you saying?

508
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:05,607
We're looking at these guys
for multiple felonies.

509
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,217
So you're done.
- Like what?

510
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:10,177
It doesn't matter what.
These guys are bad,Pops.

511
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,615
Like, reallybad so you're
getting out, all right.

512
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,575
Get out.

513
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,489
I love you.

514
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,679
Spiro.

515
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,987
Listen, I was hoping
for a moment of your time.

516
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,250
I actually got to go audition
this new chick right now.

517
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,818
It won't take a minute.

518
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,515
Come on, check it out.

519
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,606
Ladies, give me
the room, please.

520
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:55,222
You sure you wanna talk with

521
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,224
the young lady in the room?

522
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,921
She's Ukrainian.
She don't speak English.

523
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,185
All right.

524
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,580
I was hoping
that we continue talking

525
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,713
about that thing
that we discussed.

526
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,236
Yeah...

527
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,891
You know, I've been
thinking about that.

528
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,590
I want you to be able
to come here

529
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,638
and enjoy the club,
enjoy the ladies,

530
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,075
but I don't think
we can do business together.

531
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,600
Can I ask why not?

532
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,471
I don't wanna do business
with preppy rich kids

533
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,038
from the North Shore.
Makes me nervous.

534
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,432
Preppy rich kids from...
All right, honey, thank you.

535
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:33,608
Thank you.

536
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,219
Preppy rich kids from
the North Shore? No.

537
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,439
You got the wrong guy.
- Do I?

538
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:41,442
I grew up in Cicero,
I grew up with nothing.

539
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,837
I did three years in Stateville
for aggravated battery.

540
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,534
I mean...

541
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,797
It was your girlfriend who told
Larry that you were a rich kid.

542
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,278
Yeah, well, I was trying
to impress her, wasn't I?

543
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,323
Come on, man.

544
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:56,022
Seemed like a much better angle
to play than ex-con.

545
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,763
You know how dumb that girl is?

546
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:01,854
She thinks that I got this
with my frat brothers...

547
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,943
in grad school.

548
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:07,555
Certainly didn't tell her
got it while I was on G-block.

549
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:10,645
You got me all wrong, man.

550
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:14,170
Or you had me fooled.

551
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,435
You're actually very convincing
as the rich douchebag.

552
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,742
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

553
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,574
All right, I'm glad
we got this cleared up.

554
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:28,315
All right.

555
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,925
I'll call you later
with the details.

556
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,579
No. Sit down.

557
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,279
Make sure you tip the girl.

558
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:53,470
We're in position
eyes to the front.

559
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:56,735
We got the back.

560
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,084
There's a vehicle
approaching.

561
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,912
Silver SUV.

562
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:06,309
It's Spiro.

563
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,792
He's got a driver with him.

564
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,886
Adam, it's your dad.

565
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,454
No, are you sure?
- Positive.

566
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,804
No.

567
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,284
No.

568
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,814
I told him, Boss.
I'm sorry.

569
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,424
I don't know how you
wanna play this but I told him.

570
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:35,512
I told him he had to quit.

571
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,558
I told him.

572
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,865
We don't do this deal
today,

573
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,737
these guys aren't coming back
to the table, no way.

574
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,218
You understand?

575
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:48,351
But you think your father
might be dirty,

576
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:51,920
that he could compromise you
or Atwater,

577
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:55,054
I'm not letting you go in.
- No, there's no way, no.

578
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:57,883
He's a good cop, he's my dad,
there's no way he's...

579
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,449
He can't be dirty.

580
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,582
Nice neighborhood.
What are you doing here?

581
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,628
- You know, just a little
real estate deal.

582
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,544
Like they say,
"Buy low, sell high," right?

583
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,025
I'm telling you, this is
the next big neighborhood.

584
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,245
Stay with the car, Bob.

585
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,078
Kevin.

586
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,258
I'm with Adam.

587
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,871
If he says he's good,
I'm good.

588
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,919
All right.
Go in there and do your thing.

589
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,974
Who's your boy, Jake?

590
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,498
Well, I got a lot of
money on me, Spiro.

591
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,501
He's my protection.
Where's the... product?

592
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:40,333
My partner's bringing it.
He'll be here in a minute.

593
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:41,856
All right.

594
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,034
Morales just pulled up

595
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:49,820
with two, three
unknowns with him.

596
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:53,563
All right, get ready.
We go in on my signal.

597
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,551
Nice ride.

598
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,074
Thank you.

599
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:29,077
We do enough business together,
I'll buy you one.

600
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,687
Let's see the cash.

601
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,168
I wanna test the product.

602
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,604
Where's the love, Jake?

603
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,389
Business is business,
that's all.

604
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,260
Okay.
I like careful more

605
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,393
than I like stupid.
Test away.

606
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:41,916
Okay.

607
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,563
What is he doing?

608
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,652
What is he doing?

609
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,393
We got a problem.

610
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,221
Bob's going into the building.

611
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:28,615
Everybody hold.

612
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,669
See, I told you.
These are good guys.

613
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,410
You know, he's a quiet...

614
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,456
Get your hands off me.

615
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,675
Come on.
I wasn't doing nothing.

616
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,070
Caught him creeping around.

617
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,072
Slow your roll.
This is my guy.

618
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,422
It's my driver.
- Everybody just take it easy,

619
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,598
all right, I'm just looking
for a place to take a leak.

620
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,774
It's all good.

621
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,776
It's all good.

622
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,431
Bob, it's a big warehouse,

623
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,085
you know, find somewhere
else to take a leak.

624
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,087
I got it.

625
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,448
Now, you didn't see
anything right, Bob?

626
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,539
Right, Bob?

627
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:29,110
No.
I didn't see anything.

628
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,807
Sorry, I apologize.

629
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:33,114
You know, it's hard to find
good help these days.

630
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,554
Spiro.

631
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,295
Kiss my ass.

632
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,254
What the...
- Guys,

633
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,733
are we gonna get this done?
Are we gonna do this deal?

634
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,866
Get him out of here
so we can get this done.

635
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,303
This is too much drama.
- Give me a second, all right.

636
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,131
What the hell
is happening here?

637
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,828
Shoot him.
- Freeze.

638
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,877
Go.

639
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,537
Hands in the air.
Turn around.

640
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,322
Go.
- Kevin.

641
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,846
I got him.
Put your hands up.

642
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,152
10-1, officer down.

643
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:12,588
Shots fired by offender
and police.

644
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:14,808
Roll an ambulance
to 2322 West Lincoln.

645
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,331
Where the hell is Morales?

646
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,333
I got Morales taking off
on foot rear west exit.

647
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,728
We're on it.

648
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,168
Stop.
Police.

649
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:35,872
I'm gonna go around the side.
- Yeah, go.

650
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,875
Stop.
Police.

651
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:59,374
Chicago PD.
Drop your weapon.

652
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,943
Drop your weapon, now.

653
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,771
Put it down.

654
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:09,906
Get on your knees.

655
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:29,012
Bullet went right through me.

656
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,711
Doc says I'll be out tomorrow.

657
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,583
Yeah, I heard.

658
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:37,282
Dad...

659
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,762
What the hell happened?
What happened?

660
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:42,635
I told you to get out.
Why didn't you quit?

661
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:50,947
I'm broke, okay.

662
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:54,299
What?
- I'm busted.

663
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:57,954
I'm few weeks away
from losing the house.

664
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:01,436
You. What?

665
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,133
What are you talking about?

666
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:07,573
How could that even happen?
- I made some bad investments.

667
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:11,316
And next thing you know, I'm

668
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,666
maxed out credit cards.

669
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:17,800
I just needed to stay...
a few more weeks.

670
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,455
I needed a few more of
those envelopes from Spiro.

671
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:26,244
I didn't realize you were
so close to busting him.

672
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,637
Adam, I'm sorry
I screwed things up.

673
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,726
No, you didn't, Dad.
- I saw the cars.

674
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,945
I saw the people.

675
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:35,905
I know he was doing
something illegal.

676
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:42,303
And I got nervous.

677
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:46,002
Look, son,
I knew that you were...

678
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:48,701
That I were probably in there
and I wanted to help.

679
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:53,836
You know, give you
some backup,

680
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,012
in case things went south.

681
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:02,018
If something ever
happened to you,

682
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,977
I couldn't live with myself.

683
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,773
Why didn't you come to me?

684
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:21,037
Why didn't you ask me for help?
I would've helped.

685
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:26,260
What kind of man takes
money from his own kid?

686
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,105
How's your dad doing?

687
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:47,368
Yeah, he's okay.

688
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,415
He's gonna be good.
Bullet went right through, so.

689
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:54,332
That's good.
How you doing?

690
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,160
You okay?

691
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,206
Nah.

692
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:08,084
Thanks for coming, Hailey.
I really appreciate it.

693
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,313
What are you
still doing here?

694
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:24,100
Catching up on some work.
- Catch up tomorrow.

695
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,276
It's late.

696
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,844
Boss...

697
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,412
I need to tell you I'm sorry.

698
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:34,372
I feel awful.

699
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,201
I need you to know that
my father, you know,

700
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:41,291
he's not perfect
but he's not dirty.

701
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:42,771
I know.

702
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,427
What do you mean?

703
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,821
Spiro told us everything.

704
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:53,956
Gave up Morales
on the two murders.

705
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,177
But he also told us your old
man didn't know a damn thing

706
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,441
about the drugs,
murders, none of it.

707
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,488
All right, well,
that's good to hear.

708
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,838
I mean, it's not gonna help
with Internal Affairs

709
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:06,621
but it's something.

710
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,450
Yeah, he'll be fine.

711
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:12,758
I mean, he was working
undercover with us, right?

712
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:16,370
Helped us crack
a vicious drug ring.

713
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,293
You'd do that?

714
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,077
Already did.

715
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:34,083
Backdated the paperwork.

716
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:42,875
He's your father.

717
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,229
Means he's family.
