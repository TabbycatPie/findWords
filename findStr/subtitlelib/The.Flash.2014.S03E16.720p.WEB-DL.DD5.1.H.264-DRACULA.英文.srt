19
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,140
My name is Barry Allen,

20
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,260
and I am the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,970
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

22
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,520
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

23
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,270
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

24
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,610
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

25
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,040
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

26
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,230
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

27
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,020
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,070
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,

29
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,770
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

30
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,840
I am The Flash.

31
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,260
Previously, on "The Flash"...

32
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,120
The night that Savitar kills you,

33
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,920
you didn't have a ring on your finger.

34
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,140
We weren't engaged yet.

35
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,000
So you thought that if we were...

36
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,580
That it might change the future.

37
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,280
Now there's always gonna be a part of us that's tainted.

38
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,940
Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?

39
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,300
That's where the future you trapped him.

40
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,810
That's right.

41
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,710
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.

42
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,440
Not everything. We still have a piece of that stone.

43
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,960
It's gone?

44
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,470
If Savitar gets ahold of the stone...

45
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,280
He'll escape for sure.

46
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,060
You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace.

47
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,270
You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force

48
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,360
by yourself.

49
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,150
Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.

50
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,080
We have to bring him back. We have to save him.

51
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,170
My fear is the reason for all of this.

52
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,130
Savitar was right. This is all because of me,

53
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,100
because of my weakness.

54
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,970
Flashpoint.

55
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,860
And because of it, everyone's lives have changed.

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,510
Everyone I love is suffering.

57
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,630
This has to stop.

58
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,940
I can't let anyone hurt anymore because of me.

59
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,320
No one else should have to pay for my sins.

60
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,100
And they won't.

61
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,940
Ever again.

62
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,250
Cisco.

63
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,040
Get the Breach Room ready.

64
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,700
Okay, for what?

65
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,790
I'm gonna save Wally.

66
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,490
How exactly are you going to do that?

67
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm going back into the Speed Force.

70
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,350
I'm just trying to wrap my mind around

71
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,220
you going into the Speed Force again.

72
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,380
The Savitar said he was there for years.

73
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,090
You said it was like being in space.

74
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,110
- I know. - So what are you gonna do?

75
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,170
You gonna run in there and run around till you find him?

76
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,980
- It's endless. - I know.

77
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,870
And this is the only way to save Wally.

78
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,270
Yeah, yeah, I just-- we need a plan.

79
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,280
I--I...

80
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,940
I don't wanna lose both my sons.

81
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,440
Look, gang, I don't understand the Speed Force,

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,700
but there are plenty of people in this room who do.

83
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,800
Am I correct in assuming there's a point coming?

84
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,820
My point is why can't you use your knowledge to fashion

85
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,640
some kind of safety precaution for young BA right here so that,

86
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,560
while he's in the Speed Force, he doesn't get lost.

87
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,370
Oh, so you're saying I can just whip up

88
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,800
some kind of inter-dimensional tether

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,680
to just anchor him to the Universe?

90
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,220
Yeah.

91
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,180
- That's exactly what I can do. - Yeah!

92
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,730
Now we're cooking with helium.

93
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,790
Yes, and I can-- I can add a biological component

94
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,900
that will measure his vitals when he's in the Speed Force.

95
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,940
- That's a great idea. - Thank you, Caitlin.

96
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,310
Because if we can monitor Barry's vitals,

97
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,440
we'll know if they fluctuate,

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
and we can pull him out.

99
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,140
You mean "Pull us out."

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah, if you're going in there to save Wally, so am I.

101
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,350
Jesse, you're gonna stay here.

102
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,310
Because if your father finds out

103
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,680
you're lost in some negative world,

104
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,390
the first person to get a broken schnoz is me.

105
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,530
There's a negative world?

106
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,620
Yeah, negative world.

107
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,530
Really? They have Super Mario on Earth-29?

108
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,810
Yeah, challenge me.

109
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,470
Barry, you need my help. Your shoulder is still broken.

110
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,230
It's okay. It's almost healed.

111
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,630
No, look, I can do this.

112
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,090
I know, but I need you to stay here.

113
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,820
Keep the city safe while I'm gone.

114
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,470
And this is something I have to do alone, okay?

115
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,000
Fine.

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Thank you.

117
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay, let's go to work.

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,210
Can I talk to you?

119
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,040
Yeah.

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,180
I'm gonna find Wally.

121
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,730
Whatever's holding him,

122
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,430
whatever's keeping him trapped in there,

123
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm gonna get him back.

124
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,400
- Okay. - Okay.

125
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,210
Iris...

126
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,140
Did I lose you?

127
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,300
Bar.

128
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,280
What's going on?

129
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,000
Nothing, nothing, I'm just trying to make her

130
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,140
not worry so much.

131
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,030
About Wally or you?

132
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,470
Joe, now's not the time, all right?

133
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,420
Look, you are about to risk your life  to save her brother.

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,070
I think now is the perfect time.

135
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,410
She's having doubts about us.

136
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,140
About marrying me.

137
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,380
Did she call off the engagement?

138
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,510
Guess I changed the future one too many times.

139
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,260
I think that's gonna do it.

140
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,720
We should be able to use this to keep track of Barry's vitals.

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,670
He'll play astronaut, and we'll play Houston.

142
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,000
Right, but how exactly are you gonna track his location

143
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,210
when he's in the Speed Force?

144
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,110
Well, this is just a simple modification

145
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,860
from what we used to get Barry out last time,

146
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,760
so the electrode halo?

147
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,820
- Julian wasn't part of the team last time. - Not yet.

148
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,910
Right. You know that thing we used to talk to Savitar?

149
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,720
- Yes. - Meet the electrode halo.

150
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,310
So basically these two are linked electromagnetically

151
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,320
via Goldtooth.

152
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,750
Goldtooth?

153
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,150
Yeah, it's kind of the Cisco Ramon

154
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,210
interdimensional equivalent of Bluetooth.

155
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Kind of proud of it.

156
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,500
Anyway, it gives us all the relevant locus information

157
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,670
no matter what corner of the multiverse Barry's stuck in.

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,770
And, if Barry needs our help,

159
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,610
it'll stimulate Cisco's prefrontal cortex.

160
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,810
And I'll open a breach and... send him back in.

161
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,620
Good Lord, multiverses, breaches, halos,

162
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,320
easy bloody peasy.

163
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,610
By George, I think he's got it.

164
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,670
Cisco, you about ready?

165
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,910
Born ready.

166
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,770
Okay. Here's winging it.

167
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,160
Winging it? Wait, what do you mean?

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,670
Well, I mean, I don't really have a map of the Speed Force,

169
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,200
so when I vibe Barry into it...

170
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
You have no idea where I'm gonna land.

171
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,130
But the good news is, if he gets stuck

172
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,590
on the wrong side of the tracks, now we can fish him out.

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,170
Find my boy.

174
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

175
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,550
Thank you.

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
I love you, Iris.

177
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,120
I love you too.

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,720
Are we ready?

179
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,000
Good to go.

180
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,230
To infinity and beyond.

181
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,310
Okay, once I let go, you're on your own.

182
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,950
Do it.

183
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,920
Good luck.

184
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,850
Wally?

185
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,300
Wally?

186
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,220
Hello?

187
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,250
Hey, Bar.

189
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,060
Why are you here?

190
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,340
Why did you come back to this place?

191
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm here to save Wally West.

192
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,300
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

193
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,880
It's my fault that he's trapped here.

194
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,200
Is it?

195
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,830
Where is Wally West?

196
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,190
He's not exactly here, per se.

197
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,680
He's in the prison you created.

198
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,940
Well, your future self, that is.

199
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,780
How do I get him out?

200
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,110
How do I get him out?

201
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,350
I think you'll find we're not gonna be

202
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,180
as accommodating as we were the last time you visited us.

203
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,900
What the hell does that mean?

204
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,850
It means things have changed.

205
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,290
We gave you your speed back because you said you'd

206
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,420
come to terms with your mother's death,

207
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,820
but you lied to us.

208
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,610
- I-- - You went back in time

209
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,100
and saved her.

210
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,730
And, in doing so, you created Flashpoint.

211
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,790
Zoom had just killed my father.

212
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,850
We know, and we understand,

213
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,420
which is why we allowed you to do that,

214
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,900
but choices have consequences.

215
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,810
And I'm afraid we can't let you make any more choices like that.

216
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,060
Wally is just a kid.

217
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,220
He's a Flash.

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,010
He made his choice.

219
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,020
Now he has to live with it, just like you do.

220
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,010
I'm not going anywhere until Wally's free.

221
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,170
Then be prepared to spend an eternity in here.

222
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,730
Why would you order a single espresso?

223
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,990
It's gotta be at least a double espresso.

224
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,070
I can go triple.

225
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,040
- Doesn't affect me at all. - Frightening.

226
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,940
I can have a quadruple, a sextuple.

227
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,180
There you are. I'm gonna get us all coffees

228
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,950
'cause we got a lot of work to do, you know?

229
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,210
A lot of-- A lot of stuff to do.

230
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,040
It doesn't affect me though. It doesn't affect me at all!

231
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,950
Okay.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,610
He scares me.

233
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,930
I was wondering, do you think you could use this

234
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,660
to track Savitar's location?

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,540
That's not a bad idea.

236
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,240
You know, I couldn't before because he was

237
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,270
in the Speed Force, but, now that he's out of it,

238
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,860
feeling footloose and fancy-free, I'm sure--

239
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,910
I'm sorry, you know what? That was insensitive of me.

240
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,670
It's fine.

241
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,300
Okay, so let's say I find Savitar, right now.

242
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,150
What are you gonna do about it?

243
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,070
I'm gonna go after him.

244
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,920
Jesse, are you out of your mind?

245
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,450
No, okay? I can't just sit here waiting.

246
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,940
You can, and you will.

247
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,400
We all will. And, soon enough, Barry's

248
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,050
gonna get Wally out of the Speed Force.

249
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,070
You don't know that, okay?

250
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,270
We don't know anything.

251
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,510
The only thing we actually know is that Savitar is out there,

252
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,400
and, if we can, we have to find him

253
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,740
and send him right back where he came from.

254
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,040
You're staying here.

255
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,640
Iris.

257
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,570
I wrote that article.

259
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,460
That used to be my byline, but not anymore.

260
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,690
Well, 2024 is a long ways away.

261
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,840
Things could still change.

262
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,190
What if it's too late?

263
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,590
What if some things can't be undone?

264
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,750
You having second thoughts?

265
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,760
I guess I'm just worried that I made the wrong decision.

266
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,430
And what?

267
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,190
You think that calling things off sent Barry

268
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,050
running into the Speed Force?

269
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,620
Please, we both know that he was gonna

270
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,010
go save Wally no matter what.

271
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,050
Yeah, that's just the kind of hero he is.

272
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,710
Sweetheart, I know-- I know how you're feeling.

273
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,300
You can't figure out which way's up right now, can you?

274
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,490
Do yourself a favor.

275
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,360
Look deep inside that big, beautiful heart of yours.

276
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,190
You'll find the answer you're looking for.

277
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,140
Eddie Thawne's life was almost so different.

278
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Iris was about to be his wife.

279
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,480
Joe was about to be his father-in-law.

280
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,880
But things didn't turn out that way, did they, Barry?

281
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,460
Instead of that life being his legacy...

282
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,350
This is.

283
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,320
So the only reason you came back is to save Wally.

284
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,470
Yes.

285
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,980
There's no other reason?

286
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,780
No.

287
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,850
All right then, Bar.

288
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,730
If you want Wally, all you need to do is go through those doors.

289
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,250
But you're gonna have to outrun that thing first.

290
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,310
Time Wraith.

291
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,980
*Hush, little baby, don't say a word*

292
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,230
*Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird*

293
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,450
Caitlin.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,990
*And if that mockingbird don't sing*

295
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,490
*Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring*

296
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,710
That baby...

297
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,660
Is she...

298
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,400
Beautiful.

299
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,310
Just like her mother.

300
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,560
Ronnie.

301
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,570
Hello, Barry.

302
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,810
We need to talk.

303
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,350
Perhaps some sort of new metal akin to a Luttinger liquid?

304
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,750
What do you think?

305
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Man, I don't know what this is.

306
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,190
All I know, it just came off the armor of some hindu speed god, so...

307
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,980
It's like the box the philosopher's stone came in.

308
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,520
It simultaneously exists and doesn't exist.

309
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,280
Like Schroeder's cat. Remember Schroeder?

310
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,900
Guy with the cat in the box

311
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,690
both dead and alive at the same time, dun, dun, dun, which, by the way,

312
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,340
seems like cruelty for animals half the time.

313
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,370
Okay, I think you're thinking of Schrodinger, maybe?

314
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,300
Schroding--no.

315
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,850
Yeah, 'cause Schroeder's the guys from "Peanuts."

316
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,420
- I don't think so. - Yeah, the one with the piano.

317
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,530
The-- Charlie Brown has the piano on my Earth.

318
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,520
That's the whole gag 'cause he can't play the piano.

319
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,560
- He's terrible. - No.

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,310
Oh, my God, who cares about cats or pianos

321
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,320
or the freaking "Peanuts"?

322
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,650
It's not "The Peanuts."

323
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,230
It's just "Peanuts."

324
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,410
You have been studying this thing for hours.

325
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,680
Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?

326
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,700
Okay, all right, wind it in.

327
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,080
As far as we can tell, the shard is made

328
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,320
of near-frictionless material

329
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,190
that's in a constant state of flux.

330
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,170
So while it's utterly motionless on the outside --

331
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,760
It's constantly moving on the inside.

332
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,860
Yes, it's as if it's being

333
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,390
affected by some sort of external source,

334
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,250
much like the tides are affected by the phases of the moon.

335
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,520
Okay, okay, then it has to be Savitar.

336
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,370
I mean, this was part of his armor.

337
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,920
Maybe it's trying to reconnect with its other pieces.

338
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,110
That's it.

339
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,020
It's just like "The Iron Giant."

340
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,980
If this is true, then this shard could lead us right to him.

341
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,320
That's an idea.

342
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Okay, all right, so what are we waiting for?

343
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Let's--

344
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,440
Hold your roll, Jesse Quick.

345
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,590
This hesitation that you feel, on behalf of the group,

346
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,710
is our realization that this "Go for broke" attitude

347
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,770
is the very attitude that got Wallace in his predicament

348
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,120
in the first place. Am I right?

349
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,550
I can't believe I'm uttering the words,

350
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,600
- but I actually agree with H.R. - Ditto.

351
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,410
- Thanks, boys. - A lone speedster...

352
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,870
It's just no match for Savitar.

353
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,560
- Yeah, but-- - Jesse, we're gonna find him.

354
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,610
When?

355
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,360
When the real Flash gets back.

356
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,080
That came out wrong, um...

357
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,260
Put my foot in it.

358
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,870
Jesse, Jesse!

359
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,690
Oh, Jesse, hey, Jesse, quick question:

360
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,340
Merlot or Cabernet?

361
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,150
What?

362
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,910
What wine do you think would go best with a big, old

363
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,730
men's size 11 shoe stuffed in his mouth?

364
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,050
- H.R.? - Yeah?

365
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,570
- Just leave me alone. - I get it, I get it.

366
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,970
I get-- Savitar--

367
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,530
Savitar hurt the one you love, now you wanna hurt Savitar.

368
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,910
Yeah, bet your ass, I do.

369
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,530
No, I get it. I--I love it.

370
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,130
I respect it. I'm a little worried though

371
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,640
that, in your zeal for payback, you might be the one

372
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,110
who ends up getting hurt.

373
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,600
- On my Earth... - Yeah.

374
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,720
- I am the real Flash. - I know.

375
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,800
That's why I--

376
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,510
I should've said what I said.

377
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,190
No, no, you shouldn't have, okay?

378
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,510
'Cause I've fought plenty of monsters before.

379
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, absolutely.

380
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,370
Like Savitar, though?

381
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,430
'Cause, look, here's the thing.

382
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,920
If your father were here, he would--

383
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,730
Do everything in his power to stop Savitar.

384
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,630
And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

385
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,400
Okay, okay.

386
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,790
I mean, hats off to you. You really are Hard-Hat Harry's

387
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,330
- little girl, aren't you? - Yeah, I am,

388
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,530
and you're not him.

389
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,390
So just do us both a favor and stop trying to be.

390
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,230
This troubles you.

391
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,440
Another life that could've been and never was.

392
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,500
Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.

393
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,270
A family, a future.

394
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,670
The future doesn't always turn out as we want it to.

395
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,550
I see what you're doing.

396
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,970
First Eddie, now Ronnie, showing me all of the people

397
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,140
who sacrificed themselves for the greater good.

398
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,820
No, Barry, their sacrifices were for you,

399
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,640
as was Wally's when he attempted to stop Savitar.

400
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,400
No, Savitar tricked Wally.

401
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,070
And now he's trapped.

402
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,890
Wally doesn't belong in the Speed Force.

403
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,720
You have to let me take his place.

404
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,770
And that's why I'm here.

405
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,550
Or the other reason, Barry.

406
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,190
I wanna sacrifice myself for Wally.

407
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,440
- We can't allow that. - Why not?

408
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,350
Because where Wally's gone is a hell all his own.

409
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,240
Savitar said, "One will suffer a fate far worse than death."

410
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,950
And it's not for you.

411
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,050
Leave, Barry, while you still can.

412
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,450
No.

413
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,460
Whatever hell Wally's trapped in,

414
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,860
I'm gonna set him free,

415
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,250
and I'm not leaving here until I do.

416
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,870
Very well, but you were warned.

417
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,540
Hunter Zolomon.

418
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,840
Come on, come on.

419
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,700
- Is it Barry? - Did something happen to him?

420
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,790
We don't know. One second, the telemetry

421
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,860
was perfectly normal, and--

422
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,940
Then his vitals, they just started crashing.

423
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,240
We warned you.

424
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,210
Why are you doing this?

425
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,590
You speak of sacrifice, yet you still let others

426
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,710
bear the burdens that should be on your shoulders.

427
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,880
Okay, okay, you're right.

428
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,930
You're right.

429
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,710
I never should've asked Wally to save Iris.

430
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,180
It should've been me.

431
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,990
Please, let me save him.

432
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,600
There's only one way to free Wally West

433
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,320
from his eternal torment.

434
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,650
You must free yourself first.

435
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
I love you, Iris.

436
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,360
No.

437
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,270
- Cisco, is he-- - I don't know, I don't know.

438
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,520
Find out!

439
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,810
I can't.

440
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,100
- The tether's gone. - What?

441
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,460
That was him and Wally's lifeline out of the Speed Force.

442
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,090
How are we gonna get them back?

443
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,910
I don't know that we can.

444
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,760
Hello?

445
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,410
Wally?

446
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,450
Wally?

447
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,690
Wally, Wally!

448
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

449
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,670
Just hang on.

450
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,010
Visiting hours are over, Flash.

451
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,990
So...

452
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,810
That's not yours.

453
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,280
- Get out of my way. - I can't do that.

454
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,250
Not if you're planning on using that to fight Savitar.

455
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,380
I can't.

456
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,090
You're not gonna talk me out of this, okay?

457
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,200
- I already told you you're not-- - Not your dad.

458
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,110
That message was received loud and clear.

459
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,390
Now hear mine.

460
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,990
Taking on Savitar all alone

461
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,520
is not gonna bring Wallace back, Jesse.

462
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,010
It's just gonna get you killed, and that,

463
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,150
my friend, that is not happening.

464
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,230
Not on my watch.

465
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,650
You done?

466
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,920
Yeah, said my piece.

467
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,110
And guess what?

468
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm still not--

469
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,200
Moving...

470
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,320
That was oddly satisfying.

471
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,080
What's happening to him?

472
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,010
Wally West is caught in an endless temporal loop,

473
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,880
just like Savitar after you imprisoned him here in the future.

474
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,660
No wonder he hates you.

475
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,470
What's he seeing?

476
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,850
He's reliving the single most painful moment of his life

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,770
over and over again.

478
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,420
His mother's death.

479
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,710
Wally.

480
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,430
He doesn't deserve this.

481
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,690
Let me guess. You do?

482
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,350
I know what my hell is.

483
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,370
I've already seen it in the future.

484
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,160
You don't like the future, Flash?

485
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,800
- Change it. - I can't.

486
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,970
Don't you get it? I can't!

487
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,890
I'm not fast enough. He is.

488
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,600
That's why you have to let me take his place.

489
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Wally can save Iris.

490
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,650
Not learning your lesson, Barry.

491
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,810
You keep telling us one thing and then doing another.

492
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,600
You wanna know what inspired Leonard Snart

493
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,220
to sacrifice himself?

494
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,320
It was you, Barry Allen.

495
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,010
You inspired him to be better.

496
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,480
You inspired him to be selfless, to sacrifice himself for others,

497
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,740
to be a hero, just like you.

498
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,460
I'm no hero. Not lately.

499
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,100
So what?

500
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,350
You've had enough, Scarlet Speedster?

501
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,970
Time to hang up the cowl and give it all up?

502
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,870
Well, if you're out...

503
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,100
you're out.

504
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,970
I'm done fighting.

505
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,790
We know, and that's exactly the problem.

506
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,990
You think seeing Iris' death is hell?

507
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,370
You ain't seen nothing yet.

508
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,730
Let's get you out of here.

509
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,410
All right, you stupid piece of metal,

510
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,570
take me to your leader.

511
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,920
Gotcha.

512
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,830
Jesse Quick.

513
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,920
I knew you would come for me.

514
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,550
How'd you know I was coming here?

515
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,530
Because I know everything that happens.

516
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,120
I've already lived it.

517
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm not afraid of you.

518
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,850
You should be.

519
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,170
Jesse.

520
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,810
HR
H.R.?

521
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,130
It's a little late to talk me out of this, okay?

522
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,670
I'm not gonna try and talk you out of anything.

523
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,530
I learned that lesson.

524
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,080
You have something that belongs to me.

525
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,410
I need a little help here, H.R.

526
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,340
Bum, bum, thinking.

527
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,580
Think faster.

528
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,770
What do we got? We're fighting Savitar.

529
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,050
Savitar is a speed god. He's omnipotent.

530
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,340
He's invulnerable.

531
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,750
Then why does he need a suit of armor?

532
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,810
Jesse, he's vulnerable

533
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,750
somewhere under the suit. Find a gap, find an opening,

534
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,040
and go for it.

535
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,320
I have such plans for you in the future, Jesse Quick.

536
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,920
And I have plans for you too.

537
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,040
This is for Wally.

538
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,400
Jay.

539
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,390
Yeah?

540
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,230
Is this really you, or is this

541
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,810
just another Speed Force test?

542
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,140
Yeah, kid, it's really me.

543
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,670
How?

544
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,460
As soon as the team lost contact with you,

545
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,130
Cisco came to my Earth and told me what was happening.

546
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,590
I came here to help.

547
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,430
Let's get Wally.

548
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,910
'Fraid I can't let you do that.

549
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,190
Getting a little slow in your golden age there, Garrick.

550
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,940
Stop.

551
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,230
Can't do that either.

552
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,430
Enough!

553
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,140
I'm taking Wally.

554
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,040
We can't let you do that, Barry.

555
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,110
Yeah? Try and stop me.

556
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Wally?

557
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,630
Wally.

558
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,570
Barry, Jay.

559
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,710
I saw my mom.

560
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,390
- I know, I know. - My mom.

561
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,180
I know. Look at me now, okay?

562
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,940
It's over.

563
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,520
You're free now,

564
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,450
okay? We're going home, all right?

565
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,420
It's okay. We're going home.

566
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,030
Jay, let's go.

567
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,450
Sorry, kid, this is where I stay for a while.

568
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,910
What? What are you talking about?

569
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,470
We both know that a speedster needs to take Wally's place.

570
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,730
That's why I'm here.

571
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,030
No, no, Jay, you already lived your hell

572
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,210
when you were Zoom's prisoner.

573
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,820
And you set me free, and I owe you for that.

574
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,060
- Jay-- - I've run a hell of a race,

575
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,840
but every marathon has a finish line.

576
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,730
Time's finally come for me to cross it, but you--

577
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,220
you, Barry, need to put an end to this once and for all

578
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,680
and stop Savitar.

579
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,380
How?

580
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,970
Do what you do best.

581
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,490
Be The Flash.

582
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,060
Cisco said that he could use this to track you

583
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,660
and bring you home.

584
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm gonna get this back to you again

585
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,930
when I break you out of here.

586
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,660
See you soon, Flash.

587
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,350
What's happening?

588
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,970
Do you think you can reel them in?

589
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,300
I don't know. I've never felt this much

590
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,280
harmonic feedback.

591
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,790
It feels like the Speed Force is about to--

592
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,960
- Wally! - Barry!

593
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,240
Oh, my God.

594
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,360
Are you okay?

595
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
We will be.

596
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,530
Hold on a second.

597
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,060
Three speedsters go in, and only two come out.

598
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,060
Jay...

599
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,930
Jay stayed back

600
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,730
to save Wally.

601
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,540
Come on, Wally, let's get you checked out.

602
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,020
I thought I lost both my boys.

603
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,470
Thanks for bringing him back.

604
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,480
You're welcome.

605
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,280
Thank you.

606
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,800
I thought I'd lost you too.

607
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,410
I'm right here.

608
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,460
The Speed Force.

609
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,290
And it just appeared to you in the form of Eddie Thawne?

610
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,530
- And Ronnie? - And Snart.

611
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,480
All to teach me another lesson.

612
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,710
Which was what?

613
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,670
Saving Iris is my responsibility

614
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,780
and mine alone.

615
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,580
It's why the Speed Force didn't let me take Wally's place,

616
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,150
why Jay sacrificed himself to do it.

617
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,640
So I could finish this.

618
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,550
Jay, hero among heroes.

619
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,970
Yeah.

620
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,180
We can't just leave him in there.

621
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,220
We won't.

622
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,520
I'll beat Savitar. We'll get him out.

623
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,740
Good, 'cause it seems to me the Speed Force

624
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,220
is a little bit of a crazy place.

625
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,630
Just ask Wallace.

626
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,130
Yeah, yeah, what-- what Wally saw--

627
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,260
it's gonna haunt him for a while.

628
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,050
So until he can get past it, and he's really ready

629
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,290
to go back out there, Kid Flash is

630
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,360
gonna need to take a break for a while.

631
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,680
You okay?

632
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,420
Are you?

633
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,880
Right, you should see the other guy.

634
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,700
Caitlin said I'll be fine.

635
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,780
Jesse, I can't believe you went after Savitar by yourself.

636
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,410
What were you thinking?

637
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,430
I mean, the same thing you were when you did it.

638
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,620
Yeah, that was a mistake.

639
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,990
One that I will never make again.

640
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,840
Yeah, yeah, me either.

641
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,090
Not on this Earth, anyway.

642
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,150
Wait, what? You're going back

643
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,800
to Earth-2 already?

644
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,540
- Earth-3, actually. - But you just got here, Jesse.

645
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,280
I know, I know, and I want to be with you.

646
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,910
It's just Savitar said he had plans for me in the future.

647
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,790
And I can't let that happen.

648
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,730
Besides, until Barry can get Jay out of the Speed Force,

649
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,310
Earth-3 needs a Flash to protect it.

650
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,000
I love you, Jesse.

651
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,290
I love you too.

652
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,420
You show those villains on Earth-3.

653
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,070
Nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.

654
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,500
That's right. You give them hell.

655
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,550
You know I will.

656
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,170
We're here if you need us, all right?

657
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,530
- Safe travels. - Thanks.

658
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,950
Sorry for the, uh...

659
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah, yeah, me too. Good left-hook.

660
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,620
Thanks.

661
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,840
I shouldn't be surprised. Us Wellses--

662
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,580
We are forces to be reckoned with.

663
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,790
That we are.

664
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,250
Thank you, H.R.

665
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,010
For what?

666
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,970
Just being a friend.

667
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,440
Thank you.

668
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,480
You ready?

669
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,470
Yeah.

670
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,430
This isn't good-bye.

671
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,500
No, it's more like "See you later."

672
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,080
I can't wait.

673
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,840
So,

674
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,460
fun fact uncovered by our intrepid Jesse Quick,

675
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,300
in her latest dust-up with the so-called "God of Speed,"

676
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,300
guess who feels pain.

677
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,820
What--what exactly are you saying?

678
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,380
Are you saying that underneath the suit of armor that's he's--

679
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,840
Yes, James. He's not a God.

680
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,650
He's just a man, baby.

681
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,660
- A man? - Yeah.

682
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,320
Thank you for saving Wally.

683
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,040
Of course.

684
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,050
So, I just--

685
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,150
Look, you told me that you only wanted to marry someone

686
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,910
because they love you and not because

687
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,680
they were trying to save you, and I get that.

688
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,760
I just...

689
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,020
You know, I've lived with a lot of death,

690
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,340
tragedy in my life,and

691
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,700
seeing you die...

692
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,230
It's impossible not to be consumed by that.

693
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,380
Yeah, no, I get that. I do.

694
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,010
It just...

695
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,670
it made me question if you were asking me

696
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,660
for the right reasons, you know?

697
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,820
If it was out of love or

698
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,850
responsibility.

699
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,780
But, hey, look, while you were gone,

700
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,160
I realized something.

701
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,910
I don't have to doubt why you wanna marry me.

702
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,100
It's the same reason that I wanna marry you.

703
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,150
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

704
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,970
I love you.

705
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,270
But...

706
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,850
you were right.

707
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,860
I proposed

708
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,290
because I thought it would save you.

709
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,450
I thought Wally would save you.

710
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,230
I--I was wrong.

711
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,320
I alone have to save you in the future, and I'm going to,

712
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,080
but not by changing it.

713
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,420
By embracing it.

714
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,430
Okay...

715
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,610
what--what does that mean?

716
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,040
It means that I--

717
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,800
I think we need some space

718
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,920
for a while.

719
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,260
I'm sorry,

720
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,250
but--I--I don't-- I don't know how we can

721
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,950
move forward like this, with--

722
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,920
Okay.

723
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,790
I guess I'll go to my dad's.

724
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,850
No, you stay here.

725
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,550
I'll--I'll stay with Cisco.
