18
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,830
Who is your accomplice, Nora West-Allen?

19
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,200
There's always a Wells.

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,670
He knows I'm working with someone.

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,300
But he doesn't know with whom you're working. Not yet.

22
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,190
How can you be sure?

23
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,010
Because if he did,

24
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,880
your father would be here right now in a flash,

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,290
threatening to put his hand right through my heart.

26
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,120
Eobard, if my father finds out

27
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,670
you've been helping me try to catch Cicada behind his back,

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,120
he'll hate me,

29
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,370
and--

30
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,520
This can all be fixed.

31
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,410
I can fix this.

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,830
How?

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,750
A man...does not wear another man's face

34
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,900
unless he understands his mind.

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,470
Not just through time

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,080
but across infinite Earths.

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,910
This Sherloque, yes, he's brilliant,

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,250
but to redirect his gaze,

39
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,580
one only has to nudge him toward his weakness:

40
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,880
love.

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,980
Tell me what to do.

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
Well, what do you think?

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,010
Looks great.

46
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,820
I mean, I can move the couch against the wall,

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,000
if that'll help.

48
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Iris, it's just couch in the corner or against the wall

49
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,160
is pretty much the extent of my interior design knowledge.

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm sorry, babe.

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,460
It's--it's just, it's been a week

52
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,110
since I launched the Central City Citizen,

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,860
and I am still struggling to gain readers,

54
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,710
and I think I just figured out why.

55
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,890
"Iris West-Allen's first published articles

56
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,750
as an aspiring online news maven

57
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,960
bring one word to mind:

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,040
'boring.'

59
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,080
Her stories lack the edgy content made popular

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,250
by sites such as Spencer Young's

61
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,910
Game-changing Spyn Zone.

62
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,280
In short, Iris West-Allen plays it safe."

63
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,070
Iris, come on.

64
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,470
You can't listen to this.

65
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,210
You're a real journalist.

66
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,810
You don't want to write like Spencer Young.

67
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,090
She didn't care about facts.

68
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah, but at least she wrote about things

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,860
that people cared about,

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,960
like I did when I was writing about DeVoe.

71
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,160
You wanna write about Cicada.

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,080
Fine.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,160
Call me if you need me.

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,280
- I'll be at S.T.A.R. Labs. - Yes, of course.

75
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,630
I've got a lot of digging to do,

76
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,340
and I think I have a hunch where to start.

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
All right.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,390
So you really think this might be it?

79
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,620
Cisco sent me this sample

80
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,880
to corroborate his findings,

81
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,280
and it all checks out.

82
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm sending it back to him for final processing,

83
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,720
but I think we may have found a way

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,850
to suppress the meta genome.

85
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,470
Great.

86
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,270
Then we can use it to de-power Cicada, stop him for good.

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,800
So what's the plan?

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,750
Put this thing in a tranq gun

89
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,590
and go all "American Sniper" on him?

90
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,220
It's not that simple.

91
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,460
So Cisco's breakthrough came from analyzing identical twins

92
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,770
who were hit by the particle accelerator dark matter,

93
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,460
cases where one developed powers

94
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,260
and the other didn't.

95
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,190
The key difference in both cases...

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,430
- The pituitary gland? - Exactly.

97
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
In some cases,

98
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,720
the pituitary gland metabolizes dark matter,

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,070
thus manifesting in meta powers.

100
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,930
So to turn a meta-human into a human-human...

101
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,180
We neutralize the dark matter in the pituitary gland.

102
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,070
Except there's one problem.

103
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,600
The cure isn't instant.

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,990
We would have to immobilize Cicada for long enough

106
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,170
for the cure to take effect.

107
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,510
- How long will that take? - Best guess, a minute.

108
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,310
It's gonna be damn near impossible to hold him still

109
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,400
for one second, much less 60.

110
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay, but we're so close.

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,940
I mean, there's-- there's gotta be something we can do,

112
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,920
even if we have to think outside the box.

113
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,600
I do have one more idea.

114
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,150
Van Horn Industries created a peaceful anti-riot device

116
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,090
called a Neuro-Stasis Field Generator.

117
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,640
It's basically a bio-EMP

118
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,530
that can immobilize any living organism within a confined radius.

119
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,590
Of course, the few devices they had built were stolen.

121
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,870
I wouldn't even know where to begin looking for them.

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,270
I do.

123
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,190
Can you at least try not to look so surprised?

124
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,040
Look, if we need this, uh, Neo-Matrix whatever it is,

125
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,230
if it's stolen tech, I think I know where to look.

126
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,850
Earl Cox, Ralph says you've got some information

127
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,880
that could help us.

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,860
Well, turns out, that device you're looking for

129
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,930
has been circulating in the underground black market.

130
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,580
Sounds like Amunet Black's territory.

131
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,440
Eh, Amunet's still MIA.

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,150
But believe it or not, her ex-boyfriend is filling the void.

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
You ever heard of Goldface?

134
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,200
Yeah, he's stolen more weaponized tech

135
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,740
than any criminal in the city.

136
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,370
CCPD's been looking for his black market for years.

137
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,260
Oh, aye, and they'll keep on coming up empty.

138
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,390
You pay at the market, and then poof,

139
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,650
your goods turn up a day later in an abandoned warehouse.

140
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,620
So by the time we get what we want--

141
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,220
Goldface will be long gone.

142
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,520
Well, listen, uh, thanks, Earl.

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,660
And, you know, try to eat some fruit or something.

144
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,880
Oh, will do.

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,790
Right, then, gents. See you around.

146
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,310
Hopefully.

147
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,450
Just tell them Big Raf sent you.

148
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,910
Thanks for the tip, Earl.

149
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,650
I know what you're thinking.

150
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,920
We're supposed to pay Goldface

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
and then just let him get away?

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,230
Come on, you said we needed to think outside the box.

153
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,840
This is making a deal with the devil.

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
No, this is stopping Cicada.

155
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,480
Look, I don't like this any more than you do,

156
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,910
but in some cases, the ends justify the means.

157
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,740
And stopping a psychotic meta-killer who we are

158
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,440
literally powerless against,  that's one of those cases.

159
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,580
All right.

160
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,750
What we are doing here?

161
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,360
So Jitters has imported a brand-new oolong tea,

162
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,140
and it's super rare and I really want you to try it.

163
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay, look, I'm busy right now.

164
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,600
I'm working, all right? I don't have time for this.

165
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,100
Well, what are you-what are you working on?

166
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,910
Well, I'm working on a mystery,

167
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,510
if you must know, nosy Parker.

168
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,980
Well, what kind of mystery?

169
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,270
One that maybe I will tell you before too long,

170
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,660
Nora West-Allen.

171
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,240
Great, so, um, let's grab a tea, then.

172
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,300
All right, we'll have one cup of tea.

173
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,660
To go.

174
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,500
Tell me what to do.

175
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,340
It's amazing how malleable the timeline is.

176
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,960
Even the tiniest refinement can birth a whole new reality,

178
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,090
an object above placed below.

179
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,940
One path blocked leads to a whole new one.

180
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,730
And if your timing is right,

181
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,440
everything falls into place.

182
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,690
Keep the change.

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,100
That would have been an embarrassing way to go.

184
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,780
My gosh. Death by decaf.

185
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,400
Flattened by flat white.

186
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,070
This woman is special.

187
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,830
Help him win her love,

188
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,470
and his attention moves from you right onto her.

189
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,520
- Ren¨¦e Adler. - Ah, Miss Adler. Sherloque Wells.

190
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,190
Can I buy you a scone or something to repay you for saving my life?

191
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,860
Scone? Yes, all night. I mean yes.

192
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,220
- Great. - Thank you very much.

193
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,950
What we shall talk about while we eat our scones, I wonder?

194
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,200
Maybe about, given your grace and your posture,

195
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,490
your years of ballet training?

196
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,380
Since I was four.

197
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,740
Wow, you're really perceptive.

198
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,170
Well, it's a modest talent, I suppose.

199
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,170
Notice anything else about me?

200
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,010
Challenge accepted.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,390
Um, well, East Coast girl?

202
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,970
Yes.

203
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,830
From a small village, maybe, um, by a bay?

204
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,300
Work with books? A librarian?

205
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,570
At a university?

206
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,060
Live by a train station, small split-level pad?

207
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,250
You, um, have a dog. Older dog.

208
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,060
Corgi. Anyway, about that scone--

209
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,510
- Okay, stay away from me. - What?

210
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,640
I don't know how long you've been watching me, but it ends now.

211
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,160
No, no, no.

212
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,480
Or I'm calling CCPD, stalker.

213
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,280
No, uh, Miss Adler. I...

214
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,990
- Sherlock! - Sherloque.

215
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,550
Why did you say all that stuff to her?

216
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,480
You know, skip the small talk, no?

217
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,950
- No. - I have work to do.

218
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,090
No, no, no, um, I just--I'm not really a romance expert,

219
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,910
but I just feel like you were really into her.

220
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,440
Well, yes, maybe a little into her.

221
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,270
Okay, so don't give up so fast, you know?

222
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,890
Maybe you could, um, try to find a way to say I'm sorry

223
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,090
and I could help you with that.

224
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,820
How could one say no to that?

225
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,030
All right, we're approaching the position.

226
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,630
Copy.

227
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,190
These are the coordinates of the black market.

228
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,810
Team Snow and Frost are standing by for backup.

229
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,940
Okay. What do we do now?

230
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,540
I guess we say the magic words.

231
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,340
The streets are paved with gold.

232
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,740
Maybe you didn't say it loud enou--

234
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,660
Barry? Ralph?

235
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,880
Meta cuffs?

236
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,120
That's right, power-dampening cuffs

237
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,080
fitted with an explosive charge

238
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,810
in case you're both metas.

239
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,460
So tell me, who sent you?

240
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,220
That's really sweet. Look how threatening they're trying to be.

241
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,550
Boys, uh...

242
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,130
We really appreciate all this, but you can relax.

243
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,950
Big Raf sent us.

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,230
Big Raf, huh?

245
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,580
All right, then.

246
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,790
Gentlemen, welcome to the market.

247
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,880
So nobody, including us, knows where we are right now.

248
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,190
And we are totally powerless.

249
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,810
Dude, if we make the wrong move in here,

250
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,950
these cuffs are gonna be the least of our worries.

251
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,740
New game plan.

252
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,180
The antihero of our dynamic duo will find the Field Generator.

253
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,370
And you're just gonna stay here and try not to look like a cop.

254
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,660
- Or a superhero. - Okay.

255
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,300
Or really anything you actually are.

256
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,650
Just go. I'm fine.

257
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,690
You look like a discerning consumer.

258
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,690
Might I interest you in a little firepower?

259
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,460
No, I'm good.

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,740
Come to a weapons market and you don't want any weapons?

261
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,150
I said I'm good. I'm here for something special.

262
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,880
What's more special than a CCPD killer?

263
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,820
What do you mean?

264
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,230
That's what's great about these babies.

265
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,780
Burn through police-issued body armor.

266
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,050
I call them toastmasters. Try it for yourself.

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,510
Can't wait to see cops' faces when these hit the streets.

268
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,130
Or what's left of their faces.

269
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,520
- How much for all of them? - Uh, all of them?

270
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,130
There's a limit per customer.

271
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,560
I guess I could ask Goldface for approval.

272
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
No, why don't we just work this out between us?

273
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,180
How much will it cost to take all these off your hands?

274
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,670
Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Osmack.

275
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,980
Oh, call me Brent. And it's no problem.

276
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,460
Any interview about union reform is time well spent.

277
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,640
What about workers' opinions?

278
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,150
I imagine, as a manager, you must get them all the time.

279
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,780
Yeah, I know most of my guys better than their wives.

280
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,910
So I guess it must be difficult when one of them surprises you.

281
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,760
Like that, um--that killer that

282
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,800
everyone's talking about, Orlin Dwyer.

283
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,480
Did he ever say anything that indicated how he was feeling

284
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,260
or what he was up to?

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,650
No comment.

286
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,440
Okay, well, did he give you any kind of clue about

287
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,510
where he might be now?

288
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,860
I said no comment.

289
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,360
Did he threaten you?

290
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,150
Look, I know you're scared.

291
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,480
A lot of people were scared when DeVoe attacked last year.

292
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,480
But the Flash defeated him,

293
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,630
partially because I wrote these articles

294
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,400
that encouraged people to come forward with information.

295
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,810
We can stop Dwyer.

296
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,060
Okay, his paychecks went to a P.O. Box.

297
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,220
But there was a problem once,

298
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,070
and I had to forward to his cousin's house.

299
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,440
Uh, his name was, uh, Robbie something.

300
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,880
Robbie-- Robbie Byrne.

301
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,650
That's great.

302
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,450
I'm telling you, man, I don't have the authority

303
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,180
- to okay a purchase that large. - Uh, listen--

304
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,490
Excuse me, um, Bartholomew, a word?

305
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,220
Just a word, yeah.

306
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,570
What the hell are you doing?

307
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,680
Okay, this guy has got crates of cop-killing guns.

308
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,390
Would you prefer he sells them to criminals?

309
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,150
I would prefer that you not blow our cover,

310
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,880
and you're going to blow our cover.

311
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,910
Come on, man, I asked you to turn off

312
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,120
hero mode for, like, ten minutes.

313
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,020
Okay, all right, whatever.

314
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,170
Let's not argue about this here, all right?

315
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,870
Did you find the Field Generator?

316
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,900
Of course I did.

317
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,470
But you're not gonna like who has it.

318
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,860
What up? What up? And welcome.

319
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,380
I hear something special in my collection's caught your attention.

320
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,150
You heard right. The Neuro-Stasis--

321
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,760
Neuro-Stasis Field Generator?

322
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,500
It's a nasty bit of business, if used properly.

323
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,660
There's nothing proper about the way we're gonna use it.

324
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,990
My kind of people.

325
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,340
Okay. Let's chop it up.

326
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,590
Let's make a deal.

327
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,030
Look, we gonna do a deal or what?

328
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,180
Shut your mouth.

329
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,950
Unless you wanna be one-handed.

330
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,880
Thought not.

331
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,730
See, here's the thing.

332
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,530
Scum recognizes scum.

333
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm scum.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,330
And I've survived this long by recognizing the same.

335
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,420
Like you. You're scum.

336
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,250
I sniffed you coming a mile away.

337
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,580
Thanks?

338
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,020
But your partner, I don't sniff nothing on him.

339
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,030
And that worries me.

340
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,720
So the question is...

341
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,890
Who are you?

342
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,470
Well, I can vouch for him. He's just--

343
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,080
I said shut your mouth!

344
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,250
I wanna hear it from him.

345
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,050
I'm only gonna ask once moe.

346
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,830
Who are you?

347
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,040
I'm nobody.

348
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,710
No arrests.

349
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,570
No convictions.

350
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,740
Not for the Star City Museum heist

351
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,170
where atomized Lorazepam knocked the guards out

352
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,670
or the acid bomb that blew open

353
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,090
the Federal Reserve vault last month.

354
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,630
That was you?

355
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,440
Not according to police reports.

356
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,090
Because the only evidence I leave behind are red herrings

357
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,030
for idiot cops to chase down.

358
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,590
You wanna know who I am?

359
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,520
You can call me the Chemist.

360
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,730
But I really don't care what you call me.

361
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,430
Just stop wasting my time.

362
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,240
You should let him do the talking.

363
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,340
Yeah, I get that a lot. Uh, so we back in business?

364
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,060
With a twist.

365
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,190
Got a big job tonight.

366
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,170
Could use a guy like the Chemist

367
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,510
to cover our tracks.

368
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,060
You help me get what I want,

369
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,590
I'll give you what you want.

370
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,390
And what exactly do you want?

371
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,430
Ivo Labs has this cutting-edge 3-D printer.

372
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,060
Sold it to some hospital.

373
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,990
What's so special about a 3-D printer?

374
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,480
This one prints artificial organs.

375
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,950
If I've got it, I can sell life

376
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,860
to the highest bidder.

377
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,640
You want us to rob a hospital?

378
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,210
Of course not. I'm not a monster.

379
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,950
I want you to rob the lab before it ever gets

380
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,050
to the hospital.

381
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,080
Smile, boys.

382
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,750
Tonight you're working for Goldface.

383
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,050
Best birthday present ever, Ralph.

385
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,680
- All?! - Oh, good, you're here.

386
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,710
So since you let me agree to help you with your love life...

387
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,360
- Right. - I came up with an unusual idea.

388
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,500
- Spectacular. - Mm-hmm.

389
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,050
I have asked your ex-wives for help.

390
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,050
Great. What?

391
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,350
Five women married you for a reason.

392
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,380
So who better to ask

393
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,780
why they fell in love with you than them?

394
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,400
Okay, except--

395
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,060
I didn't think any of them would agree,

396
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,880
but four of them actually jumped at the chance.

397
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,870
- Of course they did. - Mm-hmm.

398
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,640
Because I owe them money.

399
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm behind on all the alimony payments,

400
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,140
and they don't know what Earth I'm on, until now.

401
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,580
- What? - That's right.

402
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,800
Hello, Detective.

403
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,960
Hello, ch¨¦rie.

404
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,590
You married the same woman seven times?

405
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,700
Well, she's the one for me.

406
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
Darling, you can't run forever.

407
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,070
We'll always find you.

408
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
You're in violation of alimony order 1152.

409
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,390
Time to pay up!

410
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,420
Ladies.

411
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,450
We know you had Superman

412
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,510
deliver your alimony to your ex on Earth-38.

413
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,970
- What? - You think we don't all talk?

414
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,540
I was hoping they don't all talk.

415
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,550
- Oh, no, we talk. - We have to talk.

416
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,430
- We get together all the time. - Oh, we do.

417
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Except I can never get you on the phone.

418
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,390
I text.

419
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,100
Look, I understand. You want your money, right?

420
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,180
So maybe we can--maybe we can come to an agreement, hmm?

421
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,180
We had an agreement, one that you're currently in breach of.

422
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,940
Uh, ladies.

423
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,880
Ladies, just a big misunderstanding here.

424
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,980
Big misunderstanding.

425
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,690
I thought you were all coming here

426
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,980
to help Sherloque.

427
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,840
Sherloque.

428
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,780
Help him?

429
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,020
You can't help a man who thinks he knows everything.

430
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,190
Yeah, like the time clues led him to believe it'd be romantic

431
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,200
to release fruit bats at our wedding.

432
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,190
It's because she support the endangered species,

433
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,250
so I say fruit bat.

434
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,330
I do. I was being thoughtful.

435
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,980
Oh, for our anniversary, he bought me a puppy dog.

436
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,010
That's--that's not really-- That's kind of nice.

437
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,650
Thank you.

438
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,490
I am deathly allergic to puppy dogs.

439
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,490
The dander makes my throat just...

440
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,860
It's true, but studies show that more exposure to the allergens,

441
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,180
it builds up your immune system,

442
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,440
so I'm trying to give you a healthy life.

443
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,080
Again, thoughtful on my part.

444
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,980
Well, at least he didn't deduce that

445
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,480
the nicest way to break up with you was to fake his own death.

446
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,560
Not so thoughtful.

447
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,700
Twice!

448
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,950
Oh, that last one really was on you, dear.

449
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,960
Yeah, seriously.

450
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,750
Look, there's gonna be a real death here

451
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,330
if you don't pay us our money back next month

452
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,980
with interest.

453
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,480
We know where you are now.

454
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,810
Plus, we got a great alimony recovery agent

455
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,430
by the name of Breacher.

456
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,110
Breacher?

457
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,790
Ticktock, Sherlock.

458
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,150
Sherloque. Where you're going?

459
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,670
- Sherloque. - Oh, I like how you say it.

460
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,510
I don't mean to sound heartless,

461
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,930
but, darling,

462
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,310
not everyone is meant for a relationship.

463
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,840
Some people are just destined to be alone.

464
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,770
Sherloque, I...

465
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,750
We roll out in five.

466
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,440
Look, uh, I don't have to ask you

467
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,790
how you feel about this.

468
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,400
Stealing from a hospital, that's...

469
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,230
That's way more than we bargained for.

470
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,250
So if you don't want to do this, I'm--

471
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,260
I'll do it.

472
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,410
You will?

473
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,350
Yeah, what choice do I have?

474
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,090
You warned me to get my head on straight for this job,

475
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,120
and I didn't.

476
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,830
You had Goldface ready to give us what we needed,

477
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,160
and I blew it trying to get those guns off the street,

478
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,210
and here we are.

479
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,320
Barry, this is not your fault.

480
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Yeah, it is.

481
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,490
And you were right.

482
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,920
If I wanna stop Cicada, I can't be so precious

483
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,020
about getting the Flash's hands dirty.

484
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,500
Sometimes the ends justify the means.

485
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,770
I get that now.

486
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,540
Let's just get this over with.

487
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,880
Who the hell are you?

488
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,470
Sorry, um, the door was unlocked.

489
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,190
I'm a reporter. I'm--

490
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,470
Uh, I'm looking for the owner, Robbie Byrne.

491
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,730
I'm Robbie.

492
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,980
So...

493
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,580
what kind of story you writing?

494
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,380
It's an investigative report about

495
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,370
lead leaking into the water pipes

496
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,930
in this neighborhood.

497
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,850
Is that so?

498
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah. Um, yeah.

499
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,900
And it would be, um, very helpful if you could answer

500
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,490
a few questions for me.

501
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,380
All right.

502
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,120
But I haven't noticed anything strange in the water.

503
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,430
That's the scary thing about lead.

504
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,590
I mean, the first sign would probably be a trip

505
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,810
to the hospital.

506
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,860
Young children are especially susceptible.

507
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,030
Do you have a daughter?

508
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
I used to.

509
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,390
I'm sorry to hear that.

510
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,750
And what about you?

511
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,600
Me?

512
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,510
I'm feeling better than ever.

513
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,320
Well, lead poisoning can present itself

514
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,820
in a variety of ways.

515
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,310
Look, it's late.

516
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,620
And I've got to get to bed soon, so...

517
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,460
Of course, Mr. Byrne. I understand.

518
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,470
Um, I still have a few more questions.

519
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,220
I mean, I could always come to your office tomorrow,

520
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,240
if you like.

521
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,780
Would you prefer I see you tomorrow, then?

522
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,890
No.

523
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,650
Let's finish this now.

524
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,630
Making tea?

525
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,670
No, making an espresso

526
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,840
because the mind needs more caffeine.

527
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,230
Um, that's just hot water.

528
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,910
No, no, it--

529
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,720
Nom de Dieu.

530
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,680
Sherloque, you know that stuff your ex-wife said

531
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,150
isn't true, right?

532
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,510
No, I'm destined to be alone.

533
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,470
- No, you're not. - Yes, I am.

534
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,320
Listen.

535
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,870
You treat love like it's a mystery that can be solved.

536
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,890
But you can't deduce your way to a happy ending.

537
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,260
You just have to let it come one step at a time

538
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,170
and enjoy whatever step you're in.

539
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,810
Okay, listen up.

540
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,080
Get in, get out.

541
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,440
Our guy on the inside said the place is empty,

542
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,190
and you all have the code and the pass cards.

543
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,140
Switch your weapons from stun

544
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,480
to meet your maker.

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,330
Let's go.

546
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,570
Go.

547
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,860
Barry, let me check your rifle.

548
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,140
I think it needs a new clip.

549
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,910
What?

550
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,000
Left my phone in there.

551
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,470
Can you check for me?

552
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,350
We gotta--

553
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,650
- Clear. - Move, move, move.

554
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,740
Ralph, there's no phone, man. There's--

555
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,610
What are you doing?

556
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,600
What are you--Ralph!

557
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,840
You're right, Barry.

558
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,890
- Flash doesn't have to do this. - What?

559
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,850
But I can.

560
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,820
Ralph.

561
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,640
Ralph, let me out!

562
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,080
I can back you up, man!

563
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,400
Don't go alone!

565
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,710
Ralph!

566
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,290
Ralph.

567
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,040
I can have your back, man! Don't go alone!

568
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,880
Where's the Chemist?

569
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,090
He said something about us leaving an orgy of evidence

570
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,280
in the truck. He's handling it.

571
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,550
All right, fan out and search.

572
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,670
Signal back when you find it.

573
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,340
Hey, anonymous criminal colleague,

574
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,270
this is it.

576
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,640
Kind of overkill with the packaging.

578
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,260
Yo, this ain't a library, man.

579
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,610
You wanna give me a hand?

580
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,230
Yeah, how about two?

581
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,420
Sorry, not sorry, pal.

582
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,350
This baby's going to a hospital.

583
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,570
Honestly, I never liked you.

584
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,600
Take this trash out to the truck for disposal.

585
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,440
And his friend too.

586
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,160
Come on, come on.

587
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,230
All right, let's pack it up.

588
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,250
Chop-chop.

589
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,250
Brick!

590
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,870
Ralph!

591
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,710
Well, thank you, but for the record,

592
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,100
I meant throw the brick to me.

593
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,860
I was trying to throw it to you.

594
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,470
I see you couldn't go through with it either.

595
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,440
Not after I saw those little kids.

596
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,750
Carver's in there with the printer.

597
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,920
There's a lot of guns. We don't have any powers.

598
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,380
But these do have a stun setting.

599
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,270
Come on.

600
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,790
All in a day's work, people.

601
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,710
- Cover me! - Break, break, break!

602
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,550
- Go! Watch it! - Go, go, go, go!

603
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,180
- Where'd that come from? - I tripped.

604
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,420
Let's get that printer.

605
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,840
Barry!

606
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,450
Don't move!

607
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,180
I knew all that "Red Dead" would pay off.

608
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,880
Good help's so hard to find.

609
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,130
Both of you, loading dock. Now.

610
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,820
Go.

612
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,610
Good boys.

613
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,170
I was hoping you wouldn't make Daddy use his belt.

614
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,950
Since you obeyed me,

615
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,130
I'm not gonna blow your arms off.

616
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,350
I'm gonna kill you

617
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,440
in a more traditional way.

618
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,510
And I prom--

619
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,790
He really should have frisked us first.

620
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,280
See, that's the thing-- my gold...

621
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,800
It don't just make me look pretty.

622
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,290
All right, Goldie Hawn. Let's do this.

623
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,890
Since I'm going into the organ donor business,

624
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,310
you'll be happy to know that your corpse is going to good cost

625
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,920
making me rich.

626
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,210
Hey! Why you so mad at him?

627
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,420
He's not the one that made you fall for a fake backstory.

628
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,680
Goldface, huh? More like Fool's Gold.

629
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,300
Good thing he didn't know this wasn't loaded.

630
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,080
He's alive.

631
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,020
Yeah, and so are we.

632
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,500
Thanks to you.

633
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,740
The Chemist?

634
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,330
Well, I, um-- I should get going.

635
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,010
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

636
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,180
You didn't have that bag when you came in here.

637
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,830
We're gonna beat you.

638
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,120
Well, you got pretty banged up,

639
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,600
but your powers are already working their magic.

640
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,420
No signs of permanent damage.

641
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,770
Guess the only real loss today was our mission.

642
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,740
Yeah.

643
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,790
No, we'll find another way to get the Field Generator.

644
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,560
And besides, we did have another win today.

645
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,670
We took down a powerful meta-human without our powers.

646
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,770
That's a good reminder that even when Cicada dampens us,

647
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,270
we have other ways to fight.

649
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,120
Hello?

650
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,550
Iris?

651
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,530
Dwyer's gone.

652
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,670
I'll get Iris.

653
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,150
- I got nothing in here. - Ditto upstairs.

654
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,090
Yeah, there's no evidence here

655
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,290
that points to where he went.

656
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,460
Did you find that device you needed?

657
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,940
Maybe we don't need it.

658
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,950
I know how to give the cure to Cicada.

659
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,220
I know his weakness.

660
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,600
Uh, pardon.

661
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,530
- May I offer you a refill? - Oh, God.

662
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,620
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

663
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,480
I need to tell you something. Don't be alarmed.

664
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,090
I am not a stalker. I'm a detective.

665
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,610
This is how I knew all these facts about you.

666
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,310
I deduced them.

667
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,040
It's immodest to say, but I happen to be quite good at it.

668
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,120
- Prove it. - Pardon?

669
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,720
Show me. Do, um...

670
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,480
Do that guy.

671
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,330
- Challenge accepted. - Great.

672
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,900
So if you look at the size of his drink,

673
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,380
small relative to his body mass.

674
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,560
And the hesitation but also the enjoyment with which

675
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,100
he consumes his beverage, it's elementary.

676
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,170
This is a man who has a dairy allergy

677
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,130
but still prefers to drink milk lattes,

678
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,580
but not without consequence.

679
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,890
Oh, wait for it. And...

680
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,270
- Oh. - Et voil¨¤.

681
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,040
Oh, my gosh.

682
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,640
- You are really good at this. - What can I say?

683
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,380
It is a modest talent. But I must apologize for--

684
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,570
how do they say-- creeping you out.

685
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,680
But if perhaps you would allow yourself to forgive me,

686
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,420
then I could buy you a tea to make it up to you.

687
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,560
Well, I have to go to work now.

688
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,010
- Ah, all right, no. - But--but I--

689
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,300
- Yes, of course. - You can call me sometime.

690
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,560
Really?

691
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,980
Ah, merci.

692
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,290
I look forward to, um, sometime.

693
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,300
- Me too. - Mm. So...

694
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,170
Thanks.

695
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,450
- Oh, you all right? - Oh, gosh.

696
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,930
I guess I should have started ballet

697
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,210
when I was three, right?

698
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,770
Of course, yes.

699
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,750
- Okay, bye. - Au revoir, Miss Adler.

700
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,360
Ah, you're amazing.

701
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,590
You're a meta.

704
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,400
Computer on.

706
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,780
Close Nora West-Allen file.

707
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,650
Open Cicada casework.

708
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,880
All right.

709
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,140
He will not harm you.

710
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,330
If your mission is successful,

711
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,310
your secret is safe.

712
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,130
And you and I are free to continue what we started.
