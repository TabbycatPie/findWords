Where do you want this?

42
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,500
Thanks, Mom. Uh, put it by my bag.

43
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,080
I'll have the hospital lab run it.

44
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,320
Nausea and severe abdominal pain after eating.

45
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,510
This patient could need a lap chole.

46
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,110
That would be an ideal first surgery.

47
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,170
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

48
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,020
She may just need an antacid.

49
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
Hi, Michelle.

50
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,960
I understand your mother is on her way in.

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm Dr. Browne.

52
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,400
And I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

53
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,500
You need to fix my sister.

54
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,990
What's your name?

55
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,790
- Tisha. - Hi, Tisha.

56
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,480
Well, that is exactly why we're here...

57
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,590
to help your sister.

58
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,000
Foster sister.

59
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,250
When did the pain start?

60
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,510
About an hour ago.

61
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,860
It was on the bus.

62
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,010
My sister rides with me every day to school and back.

63
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,140
My brother and I used to live on a bus.

64
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,970
Cool.

65
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,380
Have you felt like this before?

66
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,810
A few times.

67
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,750
She has extreme upper-right quadrant tenderness.

68
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,620
That's consistent with cholecystitis.

69
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,510
As is her fever and elevated white count.

70
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,690
Your gallbladder probably needs to be removed.

71
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,850
You must be excited, Claire.

72
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,310
This is going to be your first surgery.

73
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,600
Has your urine changed color?

74
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,200
Gotten darker?

75
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,770
I hear Dr. Browne might have landed her first lap chole.

76
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,940
It's not exactly a straightforward case.

77
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,080
The duct is massively dilated,

78
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,690
the wall's inflamed, this scarring...

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,290
it's gonna limit visibility.

80
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,920
Well, the thickness of the gallbladder wall does pose a challenge.

81
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,030
What do you think?

82
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,030
It's not her decision.

83
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,630
It's mine, as the attending.

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,990
Doesn't mean she shouldn't offer her opinion.

85
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,540
I think that, um, Dr. Melendez is right.

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,240
With the limited visibility, I shouldn't be...

87
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,580
Only with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

88
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,790
Which I don't think we should do.

89
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,010
An open procedure would provide a clearer view

90
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,910
of the gallbladder and the surrounding anatomy

91
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,330
despite the inflammation.

92
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,380
Carly and I went on another date last night.

93
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,610
What did you do?

94
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,610
Dinner, movie...

95
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,080
We walked 12 minutes to a deli

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,110
and had some food and talked.

97
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,800
Where are we going?

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,850
Andrews is starting an open chole.

99
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,590
Sounds like it's going well with you and Carly.

100
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, yes.

101
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,900
She answered all of my questions.

102
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,590
How many did you ask?

103
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,170
83, although some had multiple parts.

104
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,090
"Do you want to have children?

105
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,970
If yes, how many and when?"

106
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,720
"Where do you plan to raise them?

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,540
In what religious tradition?"

108
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,270
Those are pretty intense.

109
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,760
They're good questions, Claire, about important topics.

110
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,700
Early on, people usually stick with lighter stuff,

111
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,220
favorite movies, bands, hometowns.

112
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,300
Small talk.

113
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,520
Put some LAPs in the upper-right quadrant.

114
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,660
Here's the Bovie, Dr. Andrews.

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,720
Isn't the point of dating

116
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,950
to gather information to determine compatibility?

117
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,270
Retract the omentum.

118
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,560
Sure.

119
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,750
Isn't that best achieved

120
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,720
by finding out what's important to the other person?

121
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,990
Hemostats.

122
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,980
It's a-it's a process, Shaun,

123
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,160
like peeling an onion.

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,660
People are more comfortable

125
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,090
revealing their layers gradually,

126
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,060
as opposed to getting sliced right down the middle.

127
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,050
I heard Dr. Lim selected you for the first lead.

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm guessing you drew a cholecystectomy.

129
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,670
Sponge on a stick.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,270
What's your approach to dissecting...

131
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,430
retrograde or antegrade?

132
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,430
Antegrade.

133
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,170
Once I've located the porta hepatis.

134
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,090
I think Carly was comfortable.

135
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,150
Why does it matter

136
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,430
what kind of questions are asked when?

137
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,330
Aren't the answers what's important?

138
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,990
- I'm sure you're right. - Yes.

139
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,580
What is the plan for the next date?

140
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,470
We didn't make another date.

141
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,820
Then I grasp gallbladder fundus

142
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,610
- and elevate it which way? - S-superiorly.

143
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,200
Is that significant?

144
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,620
No follow-up date?

145
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,930
Not necessarily.

146
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,310
How did the night end?

147
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,060
Good-night kiss?

148
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,520
I've exposed the triangle of Calot

149
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,140
and ligated the cystic duct and artery.

150
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,600
What is the risk at this juncture?

151
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,800
- Lacerating the liver during dissection. - Correct.

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,880
We didn't kiss.

153
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Ironically, a complication

154
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,140
which I've inadvertently just demonstrated.

155
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,320
Hold direct pressure.

156
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,460
I need better exposure.

157
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,120
I sliced instead of peeled.

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,570
You are familiar with the Pringle procedure,

159
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,390
Dr. Browne?

160
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, although I've never...

161
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,090
Clamp down the portal triad

162
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,960
with an atraumatic hemostat clamp,

163
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,830
then use a number 2 catgut suture.

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,480
Shaun, just go to her and explain.

165
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,000
If what I said made her uncomfortable,

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,780
then saying more could make her more uncomfortable.

167
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,090
I sliced instead of peeled.

168
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,240
After Michelle's surgery,

169
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,570
I will go and talk to Carly.

170
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,920
Good.

171
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,210
You can talk to her soon.

172
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,900
OR 2 had a cancellation.

173
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,350
Your surgery is in 45 minutes.

174
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,350
Hi, I'm Dr. Browne.

175
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,230
I will be performing Michelle's surgery.

176
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,710
I will be removing her gallbladder.

177
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,250
It is a simple procedure.

178
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,630
We're gonna make sure your daughter is well taken care of.

179
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,700
Sir, we need to decapitate it.

180
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,980
No, don't. I'm begging you.

181
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,920
Don't.

182
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Please.

183
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,420
I can't get an image.

184
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,230
How did that --

185
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,900
I-is that a swordfish?

186
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,970
With that dorsal fin?

187
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,790
It's a marlin.

188
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,260
I hooked him with a naked ballyhoo.

189
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,800
Battled me for over an hour.

190
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,100
Suddenly, he just leapt out of the water.

191
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,030
He came right at me.

192
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,490
Save the story for the bar, Quint.

193
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,400
Right now, we need to cut the damn thing in half.

194
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,140
No.

195
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,090
40-plus years

196
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,620
I've been chasing a fish like this.

197
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,820
You can't just behead him!

198
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,580
Can't leave his nose in your leg, either.

199
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,870
His bill.

200
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,800
Can't you just pull him out gently?

201
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,850
I'll sign a waiver.

202
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,180
The pull-out method never works.

203
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,850
If any of your blood vessels are damaged, it gets messy.

204
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,080
Congrats. I hear your surgery is on the schedule.

205
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,260
How's his distal pulse?

206
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,450
A little thready, but still there.

207
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,640
We need to get him to an MRI.

208
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,580
I'm not going anywhere without Franklin.

209
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,230
I named him after my father.

210
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,160
You and Franklin both won't fit.

211
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,740
How? You said he was dead!

212
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,420
I didn't take a pulse.

213
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,680
Go get something to kill it.

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,580
- No, it's dead! - It's moving!

215
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,330
It's a postmortem response.

216
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,950
You guys are doctors. Don't people do this?

217
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,070
- No! - No!

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
I'll help you review at lunch.

219
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,230
Surgery's in 20 minutes.

220
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,540
- Good luck. - You, too.

221
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,870
I want to...

222
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,720
No, no, I haven't looked.

223
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,150
I want to be...

224
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,570
- Great. ...great... - Okay.

225
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,720
- ...or nothing. - Nothing.

226
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,660
Got it.

227
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,660
I'll be back as soon as I can.

228
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,460
Hi. You must be Michelle's mother.

229
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm Dr. Browne. I'll be --

230
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,560
Yeah. How long will she have to stay in here?

231
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,350
Hospitals make me nervous.

232
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,450
Three days to a week, depending on --

233
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,700
Well, she's gonna miss a lot of school.

234
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,580
And she watches Tisha and her brothers in the afternoon.

235
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,990
Your daughter has a serious infection

236
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,870
in her gallbladder.

237
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,720
She's been experiencing symptoms

238
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,360
on and off for a while now.

239
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,270
She never told me that.

240
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,880
Why didn't you tell me that?

241
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,250
- Mama -- - My point is,

242
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,680
she's been ill for a while,

243
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,400
so her recovery may take...

244
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,450
Mom.

245
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,570
Mom?

246
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,030
P-please, my -- my chest hurts.

247
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,770
What's wrong?

248
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,090
Her oxygen levels are dropping. She's tachycardic.

249
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,780
I need a chest CT, stat.

250
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,850
You had a blood clot

251
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,420
in the artery that feeds your lungs.

252
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,240
It's called a pulmonary embolism.

253
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,700
This medicine broke it up.

254
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,030
How could that happen?

255
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,130
According to our scan,

256
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,900
it was part of a larger clot in your leg

257
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,330
that broke off and traveled there.

258
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,040
As for why the larger one formed,

259
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,750
when I asked you if you were taking birth control pills,

260
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,760
you said no.

261
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,520
Was that the truth?

262
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,390
You asked me in front of Tisha.

263
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm doing it with my boyfriend,

264
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,570
and I don't want babies,

265
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,220
so I'm taking birth control pills.

266
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,590
How long have you been taking them?

267
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,320
I don't know. A year?

268
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,660
I'm prescribing condoms for your boyfriend.

269
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,720
You need to go off the pill to prevent further clots.

270
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,310
Dr. Browne is gonna place an IVC filter

271
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,570
via your femoral vein,

272
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,390
in case other parts of the clot break off.

273
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,470
Your gallbladder surgery's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.

274
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,400
What are you doing?

275
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,750
This is where the catheter goes in.

276
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,440
How did you get these scars?

277
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,570
I cut myself climbing a fence.

278
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,330
Those scars...

279
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,320
they're straight, in a row,

280
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,610
all the same length.

281
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,630
I don't believe you got them from a fence.

282
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,980
I don't care what you believe.

283
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,490
Kids who cut,

284
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,260
most of them are really sad,

285
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,980
in a lot of pain,

286
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,070
and they say cutting makes them feel better.

287
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,340
Is that how it is with you?

288
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,550
I don't want to talk about it.

289
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,480
Okay.

290
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,400
My life sucks, okay?

291
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,220
Tell me how.

292
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,750
Why?

293
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,430
It won't change anything.

294
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,080
Talking might make you feel better,

295
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,810
and maybe I can help.

296
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,910
I live in a foster home,

297
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,870
but I'm not a foster kid.

298
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm a whole mother, but I've never had a baby.

299
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,480
My mom brought three kids in our home,

300
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,670
and now it's my job to take care of them --

301
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,270
make breakfast, get the kids dressed,

302
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,570
take them to school, go to school,

303
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,950
pick them up, dinner, homework, laundry.

304
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,890
Repeat.

305
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,250
I barely ever leave the house

306
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,930
without a kid attached to me.

307
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,690
Can you help me with that?

308
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,090
Michelle wouldn't hurt herself on purpose.

309
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,130
Michelle is unhappy.

310
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,510
She feels pressure

311
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,310
to look after her foster siblings,

312
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,260
help out at home --

313
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,870
Yeah, her home life is fine.

314
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,480
I'll talk to her.

315
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,970
It might be helpful to have her speak with a psychiatrist.

316
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,130
My daughter is not crazy.

317
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,840
We -- we don't do psychiatrists. You know that.

318
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,310
That needs to change.

319
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,770
When are you doing her surgery?

320
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,150
- Tomorrow. - Thank you.

321
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,070
I will speak to my daughter.

322
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,580
Don't.

323
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,090
It's your job to fix her gallbladder,

324
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,210
not her life.

325
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,460
It's your first surgery.

326
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,900
Don't get distracted.

328
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,990
Have you talked to Carly?

329
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,800
No.

330
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,200
Blood pressure is 62/31.

331
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,390
Your patient is in cardiac arrest.

332
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,240
I know.

333
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,520
You're practicing the Pringle maneuver

334
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,490
in the event of a liver bleed?

335
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,530
Yes.

337
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,600
- That was better. - Thanks.

338
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,630
Now you can talk to Carly.

339
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,010
I need to practice.

340
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,010
Dr. Lim says

341
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,880
getting away from things every now and again,

342
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,170
having balance in our lives

343
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,940
can be just as important to our performance as practice.

344
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,420
Maybe you should get some balance by talking to Carly.

345
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,490
I don't know.

346
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,290
I'm nervous about my surgery, Shaun.

347
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,070
Practice will make me less nervous.

348
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,830
That will improve my performance.

349
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,410
Okay.

350
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,290
Okay.

351
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,700
You should also practice not causing a liver bleed.

352
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,770
Planning on it.

353
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,050
Also, how you will recover if you cut the portal vein.

354
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,960
That's potentially fatal.

355
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,450
Or if you perforate the small bowel,

356
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,170
which could cause sepsis, leading to death.

357
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,330
Or if you cut the common bile duct,

358
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,920
- which would cause... - I'm gonna go talk to Carly.

359
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,230
- Right now? - Right now.

360
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,040
- Aren't you still nervous? - Nope, all better.

361
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,490
What blade for the Kocher?

362
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,580
What?

363
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,350
Incision for the chole -- what blade?

364
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,800
10.

365
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,160
No, they won't both fit in the MRI.

366
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,850
Fish Boy doesn't buy it.

367
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,990
Location of the incision.

368
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,730
Why are you trying to help me?

369
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
Lim picked you for the first surgery.

370
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,440
Everyone knows that makes you

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,370
the front-runner for Chief Resident.

372
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,790
This is me sucking up.

373
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,650
I've never been big on pretense --

374
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,720
Are you okay?

375
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,240
What the hell just happened?

376
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,500
The marlin must have had metal in his body --

377
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,470
lures and stuff.

378
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,280
I think a license plate flew by me.

379
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,580
Franklin!

380
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,570
Oh, no!

381
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,680
Franklin!

382
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,770
Oh, it's okay.

383
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,150
Franklin's okay.

384
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,390
It all came out one side.

385
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,220
It won't show when I mount him.

386
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,470
Well, thank goodness for small miracles.

387
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,860
I've got his femoral.

388
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,440
Call the OR. We're coming.

389
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,770
Hang on, Dr. Browne.

390
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,290
Just need to make an incision

391
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,180
above and below the arterial injury site.

392
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,580
We need to clamp the femoral proximal to the bleed

393
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,880
without clipping the femoral nerve.

394
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,510
Got it. I feel the nerve right above my index finger.

395
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,480
One down.

396
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,130
My hand is starting to cramp.

397
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,300
Lean over this way a little bit. Rotate your wrist.

398
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,990
Just a little bit more.

399
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,110
Let's see if that holds.

400
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,500
Go get cleaned up. We'll take it from here.

401
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,930
I wanted to check the patient's bloodwork.

402
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,130
He's negative for HIV, Hep B and C.

403
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,770
You don't need prophylactic meds.

404
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm nervous about my surgery.

405
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,730
You'll be fine.

406
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,280
And don't ever say that again.

407
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,160
Why?

408
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,480
Weren't you nervous before your first lead?

409
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,370
If I was,

410
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,640
I didn't volunteer that to the Chief of Surgery...

411
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,240
or anyone.

412
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,380
We're women, we're not white,

413
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,600
and we're surgeons.

414
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,210
Unicorns consider us a fabled species.

415
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,290
We don't get the luxury of public insecurity.

416
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,520
I will aspire to repressed stoicism in the future.

417
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,310
We don't need to be insecure,

418
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,540
because every step of the way,

419
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,140
we've had to be twice as good as everybody else.

420
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,970
Suck it up.

421
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,820
You got this.

422
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,570
Don't forget we have our session with Dr. Donovan today.

423
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,340
I won't.

424
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,590
Your patient.

425
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,230
What are they like?

426
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,680
Man, woman, young, old?

427
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,900
Woman.

428
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,850
Girl, actually.

429
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,410
She's tough, smart... really sad.

430
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,190
Her mom has her taking care of three foster kids.

431
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,970
At least you were only stuck looking after me.

432
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,570
How old?

433
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,930
14.

434
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,940
Although she acts a lot older.

435
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,040
She's been having sex for almost a year.

436
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,890
Well, you were about that age when you were with Wayne.

437
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,150
- I didn't have sex with Wayne. - What?

438
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,040
He was in love with you,

439
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,190
always sniffing around our place.

440
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,910
Maybe. He didn't get any.

441
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,020
So, who?

442
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,810
Junior prom guy -- Derek.

443
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,050
Der-- No.

444
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,070
I didn't lose my virginity

445
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,880
until sophomore year of college.

446
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,920
What were you hoping for, a proposal?

447
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,860
No.

448
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,250
I wanted it to be special.

449
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,380
Oh, good for you.

450
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,240
I mean, I wouldn't have held out...

451
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,510
- No. - ...but good for you.

452
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,580
I thought for sure you and Wayne were doing it.

453
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,010
You were okay with that?

454
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,710
You were so serious.

455
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,430
So restrained.

456
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,110
We talked about birth control.

457
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,680
I figured, "Good for her.

458
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,570
She's finally relaxing, having some fun."

459
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,820
Well, I was so restrained and serious

460
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,840
'cause I never knew when you were gonna fall apart.

461
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,120
Got to get to work.

462
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,250
I'll be back before Michelle goes into surgery.

463
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,900
Have you had a chance to talk to her

464
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,520
about her cutting?

465
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,420
Oh, yeah, some fool friend of hers gave her the idea.

466
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,850
She's not unhappy. It's just peer pressure.

467
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,660
She sounded unhappy to me.

468
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,390
She's upset I didn't let her go hang out with her friends.

469
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,940
It's typical teen drama.

470
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
She promised me she's done cutting.

471
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,870
Self-harming behavior doesn't just stop.

472
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,570
- Michelle might need... - Dr. Browne.

473
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,340
My daughter needs to have surgery

474
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,740
and get out of this hospital.

475
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,590
You didn't tell your mom the truth about why you cut yourself,

476
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,050
about how unhappy you are.

477
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,300
I tried.

478
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,840
She didn't want to hear it,

479
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,280
just said that things aren't always gonna go my way

480
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,970
and I need to be more responsible.

481
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,810
Like I'm not already.

482
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,080
Growing up, I had to take care of my mom.

483
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,680
What was wrong with her?

484
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,910
She's mentally ill.

485
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Bipolar disorder

486
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,250
and a drinking problem, pills.

487
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,890
When things were bad,

488
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,440
she'd forget to buy groceries

489
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,110
or clean the trailer or pick me up.

490
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,470
Or she'd spend all our rent on something stupid.

491
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,470
And I thought

492
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,100
if I could make her life easy enough --

493
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,140
if I cooked and cleaned and got good grades --

494
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,730
then she'd get better.

495
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,230
But she never did.

496
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,690
And for the longest time,

497
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,320
I thought it was my fault she was sick.

498
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,570
And I probably still would

499
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,700
if a psychiatrist hadn't refused to believe me

500
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,500
when I said I was fine.

501
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,000
You've been to a psychiatrist?

502
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,920
But you're, like, a fancy surgeon.

503
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,140
I could have a therapist come by and see you before your surgery.

504
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,190
Okay.

505
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
He should be getting better.

506
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,050
It's got to be an infection from the marlin.

507
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,220
Aeromonas or mycobacterium marinum.

508
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,860
Would've responded to the antibiotics.

509
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,100
Guys, I'm trying to focus.

510
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,180
What if he has an underlying autoimmune disorder?

511
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,080
It could've been triggered by the surgery

512
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
or even the initial fish stabbing.

513
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,410
It would explain why the leg ulcerations are progressing

514
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,920
despite good arterial flow.

515
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,860
We could see if he responds to steroids.

516
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,400
Which could kill him if it is an infection.

517
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,580
But we could run an ANA, see if he's positive.

518
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,890
What about a parasite?

519
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,210
Rhinosporidium seeberi or a gill worm.

520
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,830
Have you talked to Carly?

521
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,630
Sorry. I got sidetracked by a marlin.

522
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,310
Come in.

523
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,940
You wanted to see me?

524
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,920
Ms. Reynolds tells me that you went against her wishes

525
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,360
and had her daughter speak with a psychiatrist.

526
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,260
Michelle asked to see a therapist.

527
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,200
Only after you talked her into it.

528
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,890
I'm gonna report you to the medical board.

529
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,850
You had no right --

530
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,810
Dr. Browne, were you concerned

531
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,830
that Michelle might be a serious danger to herself?

532
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,480
Yes.

533
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,750
In that case, the consult was required.

534
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,900
That said,

535
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,760
Dr. Browne's failure to inform you was inappropriate.

536
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,930
You're off the case.

537
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,220
Dr. Melendez will perform the surgery.

538
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,730
How are you doing?

539
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,150
Claire?

540
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,210
I understand today's a big day for you.

541
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,280
Your first surgery.

542
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,660
We don't need to talk about that.

543
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,240
I think we do.

544
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,800
You've been taking care of your mother for a long time.

545
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,790
That's a pattern you both need to break out of.

546
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,850
I know I haven't always been there for you,

547
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,880
and I just -- I --

548
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm trying to change that.

549
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,920
I know, Mom.

550
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,590
I'm good. Everything is fine.

551
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,270
And your first surgery?

552
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,630
Is that this afternoon?

553
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,800
It's...

554
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,310
Actually, it's not.

555
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,610
I arranged a psych consult

556
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,480
without the mother's permission,

557
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,400
so I got thrown off the case.

558
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,000
How could the hospital allow that?

559
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What is wrong with them?

560
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,460
After how hard you've worked, I just --

561
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,400
It's okay, Mom. They kind of had to.

562
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,410
- That must be a big disappointment -- - It is.

563
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,620
Anything else, Claire?

564
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,170
I'm upset, humiliated,

565
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,770
so, so mad at my patient's mother

566
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,420
for not taking care of her daughter.

567
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,690
And I -- I'm relieved.

568
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,320
I'm so, so relieved to have that weight off of me,

569
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,070
and that makes me feel like a fraud.

570
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,370
Don't you say that.

571
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,660
How can I be so scared

572
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,190
to do something I've wanted for so long?

573
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,860
Because things that matter are scary.

574
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,990
That's how I feel about coming here,

575
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,070
talking about my life and our relationship.

576
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,620
What if I can't fix it?

577
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,680
What if I can't make up

578
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,960
for all the times I've let you down?

579
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,880
And then I think...

580
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,170
"Just be like Claire."

581
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,180
Because nothing stops you -- ever.

582
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,660
You see what you want,

583
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,970
and you go after it with everything you've got.

584
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,850
You are an inspiration.

585
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,690
You're my inspiration.

586
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,250
Carly?

587
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,720
Do you have a second?

588
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,680
OR 2 is waiting to learn the patient's mass

589
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,390
wasn't cancerous so they can close.

590
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,300
I can come back after.

591
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,590
I'll be at the cafe?

592
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,350
Okay.

593
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,520
Anesthesiology, line 271.

594
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,720
Anesthesiology, call line 271.

595
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,560
Cancer.

596
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,450
The marlin guy has cancer.

597
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,750
CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no masses.

598
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,120
It's in his leg.

599
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,830
It explains progressive ulcerations

600
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,540
despite good arterial flow.

601
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,400
And why the antibiotics aren't working.

602
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,200
We'll send a tissue sample from the ulcerated area.

603
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,580
And when I'm Chief Resident, I'll remember this.

604
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,680
There's a problem with Michelle.

605
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm not doing it!

606
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,180
You need to calm down.

607
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,850
You don't get to tell me what to do!

608
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,060
I want Dr. Browne!

609
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,800
Michelle? What's going on?

610
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,570
I want you to do my surgery.

611
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,360
I want her, Mama, not somebody else.

612
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,530
Dr. Melendez is gonna do your surgery.

613
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,780
He is a great doctor.

614
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
He's not you.

615
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,070
Y-you care about me.

616
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,200
Everybody here cares about you, Michelle.

617
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,240
Now, please sit down. You could rupture your gallbladder.

618
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,100
I-I-I don't want to get better.

619
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,250
- Don't say that. - It's the truth!

620
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,500
Michelle, you need this surgery.

621
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,030
That is all that matters -- not whether I do it.

622
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,740
I'm gonna be there.

623
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,580
I will be watching from the gallery the whole time.

624
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,210
You just -- You need -- you need to sit down.

625
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,220
The kid okay?

626
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,490
I had to pull you off.

627
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,910
If you made even the tiniest misstep during surgery,

628
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,150
that mom would go from threat to lawsuit.

629
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,380
Is Patricia okay with me watching from the gallery?

630
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,150
No.

631
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,070
You can't remove her gallbladder from the gallery.

632
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,160
What?

633
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,870
You're doing Michelle's surgery.

634
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,140
How'd you get the mom to change her mind?

635
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,180
I explained that,

636
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,620
given Dr. Browne's commitment to her daughter,

637
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,770
she's the perfect choice to lead the surgery.

638
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,920
Especially with me over her shoulder the whole time.

639
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,550
Thank you for fighting for me.

640
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,050
That's what bosses do.

641
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,180
Let's go.

642
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,900
You stood me up.

643
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Sorry about that.

644
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,820
What's up?

645
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,840
Shaun's a little worried he may have freaked you out

646
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,460
with his...questionnaire the other night.

647
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,990
Oh, I thought it was cool.

648
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,080
Small talk bores the hell out of me.

649
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,200
Well, then, great. I'll tell him.

650
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,010
Shaun got worried about that all on his own?

651
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,460
That doesn't seem like him.

652
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,680
I may have mentioned

653
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,810
that people don't usually ask deeply personal questions

654
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,130
on an early date.

655
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,430
Claire, I like you,

656
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,600
but we don't really know each other.

657
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,570
And yet you decided how I was going to react to Shaun's questions,

658
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,390
which isn't your business.

659
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,350
And you were wrong --

660
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,610
totally, totally wrong.

661
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,460
Shaun and I don't need you or anyone else

662
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,030
to run interference on our relationship.

663
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,400
Butt out.

666
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,050
Is everybody ready for a Time Out?

667
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,680
Dr. Claire Browne, lead surgeon.

668
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,610
Dr. Neil Melendez, attending surgeon.

669
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,680
Dr. Shaun Murphy, assisting.

670
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,480
Dr. Jan Lancaster, anesthesia.

671
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,770
Donna Petringa, scrub nurse.

672
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,320
Shani Walden, circulating nurse.

673
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,420
Patient is Michelle Reynolds.

674
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,900
We will be performing an open cholecystectomy.

675
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,840
All tools I need are confirmed to be present.

676
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,050
Estimated blood loss, 100 cc.

677
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,640
Patient will go to the ICU after surgery.

678
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,160
Is everybody in agreement?

679
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,000
Dr. Murphy, have you ChloraPrepped the site?

680
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,420
I have.

681
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,800
10 blade.

682
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,040
Sponge.

683
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,850
Top layer of abdominal muscle is exposed.

684
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,420
I'll need a Bovie to cut through.

685
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,070
Nice work, Dr. Browne.

686
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,110
Bookwalter Retractor.

687
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,390
I see the liver,

688
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,140
and I need to better expose the inferior surface.

689
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,340
Retract the duodenum inferiorly, please.

690
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,800
Gallbladder exposed.

691
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,850
Dr. Browne?

692
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,770
There is more scarring than the imaging suggested.

693
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,570
True.

694
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,200
Talk through your approach.

695
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,040
I...grasp the gallbladder fundus forward

696
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,600
and use a right-angle clamp in my suction

697
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,960
to develop a plane around the gallbladder.

698
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,940
Kelly clamp,

699
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,630
a right-angle clamp, and suction.

700
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,950
That was elegant use of the Kelly clamp.

701
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,300
I see the cystic duct

702
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,930
and, behind it, the cystic artery.

703
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,930
I need my first assist to confirm

704
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,980
that I have identified the common bile duct

705
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,350
and it is out of the way.

706
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,310
Yes.

707
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,020
Cutting the duct would be --

708
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,720
Very, very bad.

709
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,890
Move the gallbladder cranially a little bit.

710
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,470
Titanium clip applier.

711
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,780
You sure you have a clear view?

712
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,040
Making the cut.

713
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,900
She's hemorrhaging.

714
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,570
I can't see the source of the bleeding.

715
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,620
MAP is 45 and dropping.

716
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,880
What do you think is happening?

717
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,030
Most likely,

718
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,740
my scissors' tip nicked the right hepatic artery.

719
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,060
It happens. It's happened to me.

720
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,040
I need to clamp the common hepatic artery,

721
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,540
repair the arterial wall

722
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,290
with running 6-0 Prolene sutures.

723
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,530
That's what I would do.

724
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,390
Slow down. Slow down.

725
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,210
No running. No running.

726
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,640
Dr. Browne, how's my daughter?

727
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,190
The surgery was a success,

728
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,000
and we expect a full recovery.

729
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,760
I wanna see her!

731
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,840
Is that okay?

732
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,010
Okay.

733
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,640
Michelle says she wants to be a doctor.

734
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,070
She would be a great one.

735
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,650
That therapist Michelle talked to...

736
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,620
...could I get her card?

737
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,420
Hi, baby.

738
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,970
Okay.

739
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,810
Three, two, one.

740
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:17,870
You were right.

741
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,990
He had angiosarcoma of the leg.

742
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,610
Had to amputate, but the margins were clean.

743
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,450
- What happened to the -- - Franklin!

744
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,210
Franklin, you amazing fish!

745
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,550
You saved my life.

746
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,600
Come on, bring him --- bring him here.

747
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,800
Bring him -- bring him in.

748
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,770
Thank you, guys.

749
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,350
Group hug.

750
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,790
Do you prefer to work in a team

751
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,000
or do you prefer to lead or follow command?

752
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,950
Team -- and to lead.

753
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,510
What machine or appliance in your house

755
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,370
aggravates you the most?

756
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,300
The dishwasher.

758
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,340
Hey, I'm just leaving.
