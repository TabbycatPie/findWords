186

on our insurance policy.

359
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,665
Jonah had to take another job.

360
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
It was tough.

361
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,587
That took him away.

362
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,384
It's not his fault.
You know, we had to pay the bills somehow.

363
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,930
At the end of the day,
it was really just...

364
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,807
me and her.

365
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,521
And that's why I brought her here.

366
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,732
[sobbing] You know, I just...

367
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,821
It just... I...

368
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,656
I need her to live.

369
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,369
[sniffling]

370
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,086
[mournful pop music plays
through earphones]

372
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,625
[Felix whispering]

373
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,382
...for you, I will pray...

374
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,176
[whispering]

375
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,599
[sighs]

376
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,367
[sighs]

377
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,667
[woman] Don't forget
to use the hand sanitizer...

378
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,549
[sighs]

379
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,984
[dog whining]

380
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,617
[scrabbling]

381
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,494
[howling]

382
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,872
[scrabbling and howling continue]

383
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,463
[distant howling]

384
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,705
[Mullah Umar, in Arabic] <i>Listen...</i>

385
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,933
This man that has led us here...

386
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,936
he is not the prophet Jesus returned.

387
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,941
- He took advantage of us.
- He turned away Daesh, we all saw it...

388
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,068
[Mullah Umer] We saw the sandstorm...

389
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,653
turn away Daesh.

390
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,699
He has led us to the gate of our enemies.

391
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,370
Tonight, we will leave for Jordan...

392
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,665
for true refuge...

393
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,503
where our Muslim brothers wait
with open arms.

394
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,216
I know how you must be feelin'.

395
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,971
And I know, too,
how many questions you have.

396
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,765
Why did this happen?

397
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,851
What's gonna happen now?

398
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,779
I felt I've had to sit
with these questions.

399
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,281
Same questions you all have.

400
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,159
Why did this happen?

401
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,620
What now?

402
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,331
<i>What do we all expect?</i>

403
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,667
[howling]

404
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,930
[howling continues]

405
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,848
[whimpering]

406
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,225
Hey, hey...

407
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
[howling]

408
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,064
- Hey.
- Samson?

409
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,107
[scrabbling and whining]

410
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,568
Samson?

411
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,780
I want to tell you a story about me.

412
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,033
I've never told this to anyone.

413
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,830
One day, I was lookin' out
over the valley I lived in...

414
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,249
I could see a storm on the horizon.

415
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,751
<i>And I could smell the rain in the air.</i>

416
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,214
<i>Storm felt so close I could smell it.</i>

417
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,301
And I imagined that...

418
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,638
this may be what God's like.

419
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,559
<i>Somethin' that's so close</i>

420
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,061
<i>and far away at the same time.</i>

421
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,147
I decided that was God.

422
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,025
That feelin'.

423
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,863
[snarling]

424
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,782
He's hurt. Careful, son.

425
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,579
- Be careful, Dad.
- I'm gonna get this off you, okay?

426
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,498
[panicked whining]

427
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,208
[howling]

428
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,212
And so, as long as
I could remember that feelin',

429
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,795
I decided that God was with me.

430
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,467
<i>And he could be with me
through everything.</i>

431
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,927
Even death.

432
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,892
Oh, shit.

433
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,452
[Felix] <i>I decided that.</i>

434
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,622
<i>I chose God.</i>

435
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,587
But what happens when God chooses you?

436
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,634
<i>Then you have no control.</i>

437
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,639
<i>Then he's not a part of your story.</i>

438
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,142
<i>You're a part of his.</i>

439
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,022
We didn't decide all this.

440
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,233
God did.

441
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,654
Only he knows what happens next.

442
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,740
He's come out of his tent.

443
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,533
- What?
- He's heading out of town.

444
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,744
- [woman] He's left his tent!
- [murmuring]

445
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,081
[woman 2] Where is he?

446
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,346
[dad] It's time to say goodbye, okay?

447
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,890
- [whimpering]
- He's really hurt.

448
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,101
We tried, son.

449
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,942
[boy] Samson.

450
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,404
- It's okay, boy.
- [whines]

451
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,079
[Samson howling]

452
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,167
[boy] He's hurt bad.

453
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,215
Please, help him.

454
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,427
I know you can.

455
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,554
[howling]

456
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,105
- [gunshot]
- [all gasp]

457
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,940
[gasps]

458
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,068
[boy] No! Samson!

459
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,863
You were supposed to save him.

460
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,244
No, I wasn't.

461
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,248
He's not suffering now.

462
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,797
[sobbing]

463
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,384
Hey! What just happened?

464
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,012
What are you doing here?

465
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,182
I said, what the hell are you doing here?

466
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,226
Answer me.

467
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,104
- None of your business.
- The hell it isn't.

468
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,605
Talk to me.

469
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,872
You know, the last time I looked, Shin Bet
doesn't have jurisdiction in the USA.

470
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,457
Neither does the CIA.

471
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,045
Having trouble letting go of him?

472
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,131
Clearly not as much as you.

473
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,475
I came here to kill him.

474
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,897
You were sent to assassinate him.

475
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,196
They have no clue you're here.

476
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,662
He got under your skin, didn't he?

477
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,749
That's why you erased the tape.

478
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,794
Don't judge me till you face him yourself.

479
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,129
I have.

480
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,490
[in Arabic]
Wanting to live is not a crime.

481
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,635
I promised my father
his name would live on.

482
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,559
[Jibril] Read to me.

483
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,111
[Samer] "'Were they not satisfied
where they were?'"

484
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,367

487
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,261
[footsteps approaching]

488
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,402
What are you doin' here?

489
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,115
I came for you.

490
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,880
[Samer, in Arabic]
"'All men have the stars..."

491
