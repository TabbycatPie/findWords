1
00:00:00,663 --> 00:00:02,480
孩子们 在2011年的秋天
Kids, in the fall of 2011

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:04,532
我的所有朋友都在谈恋爱
all of my friends were in relationships.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,738
所以当巴尼的哥哥詹姆士来看我们的时候
So when Barney's brother James came to visit

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,274
就有一个小小的空间问题
it created a slight logistical problem

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,228
我们真得要一个更大的卡座
We're gonna need a bigger booth.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,080
我要去洗手间了
I'm gonna go to the loo

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,281
我不是真的要去
I don't actually have to go

8
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,283
我只是想要个我自己的座儿
I just want a seat all to myself.

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,922
嗯 你们有人想问
So, would anyone care to ask me where

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,624
诺拉和我晚上去哪儿吗
Nora and I are going tonight?

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,092
别问他 那是个陷阱
Don't ask him. It's a trap

12
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,595
-你们上哪儿 -老天 问啥问啊
- Where you going? -Come on, man, for God's sake!

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,964
去温柔乡 凯文
Bootytown, Kevin!

14
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,748
我们终于要去温柔乡了（我们终于要看对方光屁股了）
We are finally going to Bootytown.

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,934
这就是为什么我们不问他
And that's why we don't ask him.

16
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,971
我觉得我要在美长腿高速路上欢蹦乱跳一下
I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on the Long Thighland Expressway,

17
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,857
在美胸港口停下吃点东西
stop off for a nibble in Breastport,

18
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,809
然后 如果运气好的话
and then, with any luck,

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,245
我要在午夜时分停留在她的港口
I'll be pulling into the Pork Authority by midnight.

20
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,615
等等 你们终于要去温柔乡了
Wait. You're finally going to Bootytown?

21
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,366
你看 我们就是不想猴急 好吗
Look, we just don't want to rush anything, okay?

22
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,536
所以我们要等到她决定的时候再决定
So we decided to wait until she decides

23
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,238
去滚床单
to let me have sex with her.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,273
就是今晚啦
And that's gonna be tonight!


25
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,958
你怎么那么确定
How do you know for sure?

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,994
哈 她之前说过了
Ah, something she said earlier.

27
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,630
你猜 宝贝
Guess what, my sweet boy,

28
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,949
我今晚给你准备了特殊的款待哟
I've got a special treat for you tonight.

29
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,620
哦耶 你要去温柔乡了
Oh, yeah, you're going to Bootytown.

30
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:13,889
哈喽 亲们
Hello again, my darlings.

31
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,475
巴尼 我希望你为今晚准备好了
Barney, I hope you're ready for tonight.

32
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,126
因为你要用你那些
Because you're gonna have to use muscles

33
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:19,344
好几年都没用过的肌肉
you haven't used in years.

34
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,762
是吗
I am?

35
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,397
没错
Yes.

36
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,483
而且我希望你家里准备些阿司匹林
And I hope you have some aspirin at home

37
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,485
因为你的屁股明天要疼翻天
because your arse is gonna be killing you tomorrow.

38
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,020
真的
It is?

39
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,854
没错
Indeed.


40
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:29,905
因为今晚
Because tonight...

41
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,974
我要穿上这个
I'm strapping on this.


42
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,409
我们去滑冰
We're going skating!


43
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,361
她的港口现在关门了
The Pork Authority's closed.


44
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,979
现在来看
Looks like it's Hand Central Station


45
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,147
你得靠双手去中央车站了 小盆友
for you, little buddy.

46
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,834
这么说那是你的特殊款待
So that's your special treat?

47
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,202
滑冰
Ice skating?


48
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,871
当然了
Of course.


49
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,823
在那之后我们要去滚床单
And after that, we're gonna shag.


50
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,208
我们要去滑冰了 各位
We're going ice skating, everybody!

51

52
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:57,993


53
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,460
问我对诺拉的看法
Ask me what I think of Nora.


54
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,929
你觉得诺拉怎么样
What do you think of Nora?


55
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,096
可爱的女孩子
Lovely girl.


56
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,015
问我对诺拉真实的想法
Ask me what I really think of her.


57
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,333
你觉得诺拉真的怎么样
What do you really think of her?


58
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,135
朋友们 她很棒 真的
Guys, she's great, seriously.


59
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:16,770
别说了
Just drop it.


60
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,054
再问我一次
Ask me one more time.


61
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,556
你到底认为诺拉怎么样
What do you really think?


62
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,191
好吧 如果你们实在想知道的话
Fine! If you really must know,

63
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,276
我不喜欢巴尼跟她在一起
I do not like Barney with that woman!

64
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,195
高兴了吧
Happy?


65
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,864
你怎么能不喜欢诺拉呢
What could you possibly not like about Nora?


66
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,950
她的头发 她跟老鼠一样的小小鼻子
Her hair? Her mousy little nose?

67
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:32,202
她所有的一切都那么完美
The way she does everything perfectly?

68
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:34,154
我的意思是 她有哪儿不招人喜欢的
I mean, what's not to like?

69
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,908
不是我不喜欢她 是因为
It's not that I don't like her.It's just...

70
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,376
她是我们的老妈
She's our mom.

71
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,194
她是你们的老妈 你什么意思
What do you mean,she's your mom?

72
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,798
她的一切都跟我们老妈有点像
Everything about her is vaguely our mom-like.

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,799
英国口音
The British accent...

74
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,334
哈喽 亲们
Hello again, my darlings.

75
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,219
我老妈超爱朱莉·安德鲁
<i>Mom's obsessed with Julie Andrews,</i>

76
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,670
所以在我们还小的时候
<i>so when we were growing up...</i>

77
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,423
哈喽 亲们
Hello again, my darlings.

78
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,424
-过来嘛你 -嘿
- Come here, you. -Hey.

79
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,559
她拥抱他的那种方式
<i>And the way she hugs him.</i>

80
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,561
左手搂在脖颈上
<i>Left hand on the nape of the neck,</i>

81
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,763
右手在背上轻拍三次
<i>three gentle strokes on the back with the right?</i>

82
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:01,314
过来嘛你
Come here, you.

83
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,433
这是洛埃塔·斯丁森的招牌动作
<i>Trademark Loretta Stinson.</i>

84
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,901
关键在这儿
<i>But here's the clincher...</i>

85
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,186
猜猜 我的宝贝
Guess what, my sweet boy.

86
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,071
猜猜 我的宝贝们
Guess what my sweet boy.

87
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,890
今晚有给你的特别款待哟
I've got a special treat for you tonight.

88
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:14,411
今晚有给你们的特别款待哟
I've got a special treat for you tonight.

89
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:15,612
冰淇林
Ice cream!

90
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,116
他们来了 安静
They're coming.Be cool.

91
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,901
忘了我的大衣
Forgot my raincoat.

92
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,087
我倒是没忘（暗指TT）
That makes one of us.

93
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,591
好了 咱们走吗
Well, shall we?

94
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,009
走啊
We shall.

95
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,350
噢 别把你那舌头磨坏了 巴尼
Ooh, don't wear out that tongue, Barney.

96
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,186
别等我了
Don't wait up.

97
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,442
我的意思是 当然 巴尼睡过了
I mean, sure, Barney has slept

98
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,111
很多人的老妈
with plenty of other people's mothers.

99
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,197
可现在他要睡我们自己的老妈
But now he's gonna sleep with ours?

100
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,566
从心理学的角度考虑 和像你们父母的人厮守终生
Psychologically speaking,it's perfectly normal

101
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,752
是非常正常的
to wind up with someone like your parents.

102
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:59,105
托我老妈的福 我可能会和一个
Thanks to my mom, I'll probably wind up with someone

103
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:01,174
更爱我弟弟的人厮守终生
who loves my brother more than me.

104
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,442
呃 从心理学的角度上讲
Well, psychologically speaking,

105
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:03,860
我现在要吐了
I'm gonna go throw up now.

106
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,962
恶...
Oh...

107
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:07,780
呃 这孩子搞得
Ugh! This baby is making it

108
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,966
我都没法系裤子扣了
so I can't button my pants anymore.

109
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,085
呵 我觉得我爸爸在55年中
Big whoop.In 55 years,

110
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,471
一次都没系上裤子扣
I don't think my dad buttoned his pants even once.

111
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,089
不知怎么 即便是甜言蜜语
And somehow, despite sweet talk like that,

112
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,425
我都不觉得性感了
I don't feel sexy anymore.

113
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,959
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

114
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,479
我意思是 我觉得即便你肚子在发福
I mean, you're-you're even sexier now

115
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,314
你却越发性感了
that you're rounding out.

116
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:27,901
我是说 你更性感了仅仅是因为
I mean, you're even more sexy simply

117
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,653
你‘包容’了很多
because there's so much more of you.

118
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:32,906
只要你那跟小象一样大的
I'm never gonna get in the mood while

119
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,158
小埃里克森还在我肚子里冲啊顶啊
your mammoth Eriksen seed is muffin-topping

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,694
我就不会“性致盎然”
the bodiddly out of me.

121
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:40,030
你是说在孩子出来之前
Are you saying,"No erky-erky

122
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,665
我们都不做
until this baby pops out"?

123
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,034
好了 够了
Okay, that's it.

124
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,619
让你觉得“性致盎然” 现在就是我的使命了
I-I am making it my mission to help you feel sexy again.

125
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,705
我不在乎你会变得多胖
I don't care how much more bloated you get.

126
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,290
下一轮酒我去买
I'll get the next round!

127
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,208
凯文 耶 凯文 谢谢你
Kevin! Yay, Kevin, thank you!

128
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,659
这么说 泰德
So, Ted, you're cool

129
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,678
你跟凯文相处不错 是吧
with Kevin, right?

130
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,596
我知道最近他一直过来玩
I know he's been over a lot lately.

131
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:59,665
喔 是啊是啊 凯文棒极了
Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great.

132
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,603
我的意思是 像不久前有一件事儿 还是挺怪的
I mean, there was, like,one weird thing the other day...

133
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,592
他就穿着平角短裤站在那儿
He was just standing there in his boxers?

134
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:10,593
是啊
Yeah.

135
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:12,195
我跟他谈谈去
I'll talk to him.

136
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:15,031
泰德
Ted...

137
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,284
说实话
be honest.

138
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,953
你愿意上莉莉 对吧
You'd bang Lily, right?

139
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,489
这样 晚些时候
<i>So, later that night,</i>

140
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,457
巴尼和诺拉去滑冰了
<i>Barney and Nora went skating.</i>

141
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,826
嘿 孩子 你知道你妈妈
Hey, kid, you know how your mom won't

142
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,045
为什么不让你在晚饭前吃冰淇林吗
let you have ice cream till after dinner?

143
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:32,332
就是因为这样 漫长的等待让冰淇林更好吃了 对不
But then the waiting kind of makes it taste better?

144
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,384
哥都等那碗冰淇林
Well, I've been waiting two months

145
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,836
等了两个月了
for that bowl of ice cream.

146
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:40,206
今晚 我就要和它滚床单
And tonight,I'm gonna have sex with it.

147
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,180
看啊 巴尼 单腿滑
Look, Barney, one foot!

148
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,714
喔
Oh!

149
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,683
孩子们 对于大多数人
<i>Now, kids, for most guys,</i>

150
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,903
这就代表约会结束了
<i>this would have meant the end of the date.</i>

151 
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,574
但你们的巴尼叔叔可不是一般的人类
<i>But your Uncle Barney is not most guys.</i>

152
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,559
哥可以hold住
I can turn this around.

153
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,109
哇 这真让我印象深刻
Well, I'm impressed that you know

154
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,243
你居然认识一个24小时工作的牙医
a 24-hour dentist.

155
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,661
哦 是啊
Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,246
他还可以给你纹个身
He can also give you tattoos,

157
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,331
或者帮你报税改西装什么的
do your taxes and alter a suit.

158
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,667
不过我可不信任他去给我改西装 因为 
But I wouldn't trust him with a suit 'cause...

159
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,171
说道喝一杯 你想去么
Speaking of drinking,you want to...?

160
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,423
算了 巴尼
No, Barney.

161
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,907
今晚我真是一个悲剧
Tonight's been a disaster.

162
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,176
我觉得我们该就此道别了
I think we should just call it a night.

163
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,878
别 别这样么诺拉
No! Come on, Nora,

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,432
你的牙也没怎么样啊 让我瞧瞧
your tooth can't be that bad.Let me see.

165
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:36,104
哪个是假的来着
W-Which is the fake one again?

166
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:38,589
你看上美极了
You look beautiful.

167
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,591
嗯
Mmm.

168
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,728
好吧 我可以再去喝一杯
All right, maybe I could go for one more drink.

169
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,263
棒极了
Great.

170
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,817
真是有意思
It's funny.

171
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,620
有时候那些最浪漫的时刻
Sometimes the most romantic moments

172
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,371
就这样从天上掉下来
can just creep up on you...

173
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,133
哥可以hold住
I can turn this around.

174
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,751
嘿 嗯
Hey, um,

175
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,421
我们应该之前就说清楚的
should've mentioned this before,but, um, Ted and I prefer

176
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,122
如果在公共区域的话 泰德和我希望房间里的人
that our guests remain fully clothed in

177
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:13,458
应该穿的衣冠楚楚一点
the public areas of the apartment.

178
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,792
听到了一下抱怨哦 亲
Been some complaints.

179
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,761
是泰德说了什么么
Did Ted say something?

180
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,063
哦 就是有点小小的抱怨啦
Oh, th-there's been some complaints.

181
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,464
不是在背后说什么坏话
Not pointing any fingers or anything,

182
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,933
就是希望你能把裤子穿好而已 
but let's just keep those pants on, okay? Good talk.

183
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,801
这样 如果是泰德这么说的话
Well, if Ted said that,

184
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:27,305
我也要抱怨下 泰德的蛋蛋(Nuts也有呆瓜的意思）
I've got something to complain about, too: Ted's nuts.

185
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:30,525
是哒 泰德是有点神经兮兮的 但我不会说他就是
Okay, yes, Ted is a little neurotic, but I wouldn't say...

186
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,862
不不不 我说的是泰德的蛋蛋
No, no, no, I mean Ted's <i>nuts.</i>

187
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,865
嗨
Hi.

188
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,701
嘿
Hey.

189
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,682
那又怎么样 这是他的公寓
So what? It's his apartment.

190
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,884
你怎么站在他那边了
You're taking his side?

191
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,635
等下 这不会就是那种典型的
Wait, this isn't one of those classic

192
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:59,337
你还是对那个即使分手仍然还是你室友
"You still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend,

193
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,939
的前男友有感觉
"who's oddly also your roommate,

194
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,140
顺便说一下现在为止我都很冷静
"which for the record I'm totally cool with,

195
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,841
即使所有人都告诉我我
"even though everybody tells me I've walked

196
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,443
我已经陷入了这个复杂的关系圈 是么
into a bear trap" things, is it?

197
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,729
不 我就是 感觉不好
No, I just, I feel bad.

198
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,014
泰德最近不太顺利
Ted's going through some stuff right now.

199
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:13,401
你看到的那一幕就是他这几个月来
You eyeballing his deal is the most action

200
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:14,786
最喜欢做的事
he's gotten in months.

201
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,072
我会对他好一点的
I'll be nice to him.

202
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,408
所以 我极力去想
So, I was trying to think of how

203
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,378
怎么才能最好的表达你在我心中有多性感
to best express how sexy you are to me.

204
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,996
一首歌还是一首诗
A song? A poem?

205
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:27,832
然后猛然间有一股灵感涌过 桌游
And then it hit me:a board game!

206
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,634
你就是不能懂女人
You just <i>get</i> women.

207
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,035
不不不 你会爱上这个的
No, no, no, you'll like this.

208
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,556
我们问一些色色的问题再接受一点挑逗的挑战
We answer risqué questions and perform spicy dares

209
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,258
来慢慢的让你打开你的美腿
to slowly move up your shapely legs.

210
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,511
我把它叫做百合花的幽径（lily也有百合花之意）
I call it Chutes and Lilies.

211
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,513
我感觉应该叫独占莉莉
I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.

212
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,064
耶 这感觉更好
Yeah, that would've been better.

213
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,048
好的 我们开始吧
Okay, game play.

214
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,217
掷骰子来看看谁先开始
Roll the dice to see who goes first,

215
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:49,237
放弃一次要罚一轮 适合二到六个玩家
forfeit a turn on a pass--intended for two-to-six players.

216
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,056
就在马修解释百合花的幽径怎么玩的时候
As Marshall explained the many rules of Chutes and Lilies,</i>

217
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,909
莉莉想起了早些时候凯文在酒吧说起的话
<i>Lily thought back to what Kevin said in the bar.</i>

218
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,829
和像你们父母的人厮守终生是非常正常的
It's perfectly normal to wind up with someone like your parents.

219
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,448
于是莉莉想起了唯一一个她知道的
<i>And then she thought of</i> <i>the only other man she knew</i>

220
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,317
如此热爱桌游的人
<i>who loved board games that much.</i>

221
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,002
我带了疾病这款游戏（lily的老爹自己发明的）
I brought Diseases!

222
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,286
马修版吹牛
Marshgammon.

223
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,871
小狗大战管理员
Dog Fight Promoter!

224
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,623
追逐莉莉
Lilial Pursuit.

225
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,429
这就是这款游戏的玩法儿
And that's how you play the game.

226
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,547
哦 等一下
Oh, wait.

227
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,465
对了 我忘了告诉你
I forgot to tell you what happens

228
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,634
如果我走到了胸部社区
if I land on "community chest."

229
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,935
捏一捏哦
Honk-honk.

230
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,423
我就想回家
I just want to go home,

231
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,592
然后洗洗睡了
take a long bath and go to bed.

232
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,610
不
No!

233
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:30,928
我是说 别这样啊
I mean, come on.

234
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,615
我住的地方近多了
My place is so much closer.

235
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,233
我可以让你去洗个澡
I'll-I'll draw you a bath,

236
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:38,769
给你倒点香槟 你会忘却所有的烦恼的
pour you some champagne,we can forget all about this.

237
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:42,073
好吧 听上去不错
All right,that sounds good.

238
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:47,712
这澡洗的真舒服
That bath was wonderful.

239
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,080
-谢谢你  -别客气
- Thank you. - Of course.

240
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,132
你觉得我们是不是该去阳台
What do you say we go out on the balcony,

241
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,167
呼吸点新鲜空气呢
get some fresh air?

242
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,135
哦 听上去棒极了
Ooh, that sounds lovely.

243
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,223
多美的风景啊
What a beautiful view.

244
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,142
必须的
I couldn't agree more.

245
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,731
永别了 残酷的世界
Good-bye, cruel world!

246
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,099
我的天呐
Oh, my God!

247
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,235
哥可以Hold住
I can turn this around.

248
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,152
嘘

249
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,071

哦 约会之夜

You know what? I'll just,just watch this in my room.

252
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,863
已经在那儿吃了晚饭了 干嘛不在那儿看一部电影呢
Already had dinner in there,why not a movie?

253
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,948

254
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,217
是啊 来吧
Yeah, join us.

255
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,536
不不不不 三个人就显得太拥挤了
No! No, no, no, no, no.Three's a crowd.

256
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,955
再说 你们也不会想看这部电影的
Besides, you guys wouldn't want to watch this anyway.

257
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,040

推荐了这部关于硬币收集的纪录片
produced this documentary about coin collecting.

262
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:45,637
现在 我知道我的这位娇小的性感的老婆
Now, I know my sexy little lady can't resist

263
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,223
不能抵挡泡泡浴的诱惑的
a bubble bath,especially one

264
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,141
尤其是撒了玫瑰花瓣的泡泡浴
with rose petals.

265
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,777
哦 是啊 亲
Oh, thanks, baby.

266
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,633
你感觉给你来个性感的搓背怎么样
How about a sensual backrub?

267
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,019
额啊
Mm.

268
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,288
-我去  -怎么了 莉莉派
- Oh. - What's the matter, Lilypad?

269
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,073
你喜欢我帮你搓背的
You love my backrubs.

270
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:08,409

Ah. I-I do... very much.

271
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,862
很好 因为我
Good, because I got you a brand-

272
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:13,581
给你买了一个全新的
new...

273
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,166
浴用丝瓜络
loofah!

274
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,973
哦
Oh, yeah!

275
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,475
用力 哦也
Rubs... oh, yeah!

276
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:27,729
看看电视里放的硬币收藏啊
Trying to watch the coin documentary over here.

277
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,382
嘿 泰德 找到陪你去演唱会的人了么
Hey,Ted,ever figure out who you're taking to that concert?

278
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:32,650
没
No.

279
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,235
-你想去么  -当然
- You want to go? - Sure.

280
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:35,703

281
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:36,938
就这么定了
It's a date!

282
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,407
现在 作为一个职业的心理学者的凯文
<i>Now, Kevin,</i><i>as a trained psychologist,</i>

283
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:42,043
知道应该用一种非常合适的方式来表达心中的不满
<i>knew the appropriate wayto voice his displeasure.</i>

284
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:44,445
我认为我们应该坐下来平心静气的探讨一下
I think we need to calmly discuss

285
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:47,115
关于我们之间关系的事情
the relationship dynamics at play here.

286
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,617
你们俩过去有一段就算了
I'm uncomfortable with how close you two are

287
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,121
当室友还搞的这么亲近 这让我十分不爽
as roommates, given your particular romantic history.

288
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,290
相反的 他采取了另外一个途径
<i>Instead, he took a different approach.</i>

289
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,074
我擦 绝对没门儿
Aw, hell no!

290
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,093
如果你和我女朋友出去约会
If you can go on a date with my girlfriend,

291
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,429
我就在你的公寓只穿裤衩
I don't have to wear pants in your apartment!

292
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,265
我都等不及这个孩子出世了
I can't wait till this baby comes out

293
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,351
那样我们就可以开始继续制造一个
so we can get started on another one.

294
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,136
又一个了
Then again,

295
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,470
-干嘛要等呢 -额 等下
-why wait? -Ew, wait...

296
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:10,921
放开我
Get off of me!

297
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:11,889
擦嘞
Damn it!

298
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,191
自从凯文说
Ever since Kevin said

299
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:15,326
和像你父母亲的人厮守终生是很正常的
it's normal to wind up with your parents,

300
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,062
我 我就总把你想象成我爸
I... I keep picturing yo as my dad.

301
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,265
莉莉 那理论太疯狂了
Lily, that theory is crazy-town.

302
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,200
你怎么知道呢
How do you know?

303
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,402
因为我妈妈是个一米九的巨人
Because my mother is six-foot-three,

304
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,454
所以她一般都在杂货店买她的衣服
she buys her clothes at the drugstore,

在你跳单高跷前叫醒我 （恶搞Green Day的wake me up when september end )
