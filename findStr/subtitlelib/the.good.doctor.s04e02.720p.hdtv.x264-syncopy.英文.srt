18
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,740
Previously on The Good Doctor...

19
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,910
You don't want me to do anything.

20
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,410
I spend every minute of every day with you.

21
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,790
Since you feel that our time together is something to be endured,

22
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,750
I decided to make that easier for you.

23
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,210
Your daughter's beautiful.

24
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,210
Needs you to get better so you can hold her.

25
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,630
I read about the CHILL study.

26
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,380
She's a good candidate. I'll take full responsibility for her.

27
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,550
Tell him he's going to be fine.

28
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,350
I can't.

29
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,180
The majority of COVID patients

30
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,270
who go on a ventilator never come off.

31
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,430
Put on a mask. Now.

32
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,770
It's covid. We've both been exposed.

33
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,400
My mother had a necklace.

34
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,610
See if I can find it.

35
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,650
Things will be okay.

36
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,290
Good morning.

37
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,630
Morning, Shaun.

38
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,920
I wish you were here.

39
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,760
Me, too.

43
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,390
Morning, Dalisay.

44
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,560
Woke up with a temp of 104.

45
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,940
I need heated, humidified oxygen on a high-flow cannula.

46
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,940
Mom, slow down. Just let her examine you.

47
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,690
Why, so she can find out exactly what I just told her?

48
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,280
Reznick. You're back.

49
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,370
Got sick, got better, got tested twice.

50
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,120
Always the overachiever.

51
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,910
Dr. Reznick, her pulse ox is 90.

52
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,710
We need to admit you.

53
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,290
Is my mom gonna be okay?

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,630
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine.

55
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,550
Just please water my tomato plants,

56
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,470
give Darcy a big hug, and tell her Nana loves her so much

57
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,930
and can't wait to play with her again real soon.

58
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,850
Okay, Mom.

59
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,860
Nice hesitation.

60
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,320
Why not just suggest he get my house appraised?

62
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,910
Sorry. It took a while to find it.

63
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,240
Thank you.

64
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,750
Being able to hold this and keep it with me...

65
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,330
It's a connection.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,710
Like she's still here with me.

71
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,160
It's stuff, Claire. It's meaningless now.

72
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,130
Each one of these tells an interrupted story,

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,090
a voicemail that'll never be heard,

74
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,090
a shopping list for a home-cooked meal that'll never be made.

75
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,260
Beautiful.

76
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,720
Cook spaghetti carbonara for a dead guy's family,

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,970
and the grief is gone.

78
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,390
Are you here to mock me or to help me?

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,810
Why are you here?

80
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,320
"Donald Sulkin."

81
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,990
We're reducing the pressure

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,290
of air going into his lungs

83
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,120
and watching his oxygen level.

84
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,880
So far, so good. O2 steady.

85
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,750
Okay.

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,930
Yes. But his end tidal CO2 is falling.

87
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,390
What does that mean?

88
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,260
It's not as bad as his O2 falling, but still not good.

89
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,770
Turn the pressure support back up.

90
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,730
End tidal CO2 is very low, not improving.

91
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,820
What's going on?

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,700
I think he has a blood clot in his lung,

93
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,870
interfering with his gas exchange.

94
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,030
Give him a bolus of heparin, start him on a drip.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,490
Let's get him to the cath lab.

96
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,410
- Let's go. - What's going on?

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
Where are you taking him?

98
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,590
Dr. Andrews?

99
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,090
Dr. Murphy?

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,630
Martin.

101
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,880
This is isotonic saline, salt water.

102
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,470
It's 4 degrees Celsius.

103
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,260
I'll run this into your bloodstream

104
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,850
until your body temperature drops to 34 degrees Celsius.

105
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,270
The paralytic I gave you will stop you from shivering

106
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,480
while the cold slows your heart, your brain,

107
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,700
all metabolic functions.

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
All the energy saved there

109
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,280
will go towards healing your lungs.

110
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Your baby's waiting for you.

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,090
Pete, follow him.

113
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,510
Pete! Follow him! He's got the axe.

114
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,140
I was getting shot at.

115
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,680
Well, stay low, reload, and head for the temple.

116
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,770
Stop messing around.

117
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,400
AG24, what's up with you? You okay?

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Yeah, yeah, I'm hunting for the legendary Tusk of Ganesh

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,990
at 3 in the morning because everything's just super.

120
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,700
Can't go out, I can't sleep, I can't go to work.

121
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,280
Welcome to COVID. Everything sucks.

122
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,870
Great. Good... good pep talk.

123
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
You all sleeping in an empty bed?

124
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,330
Yeah.

125
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,540
It's like I killed a puppy or something.

126
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,500
Hey, Pete. Pete, heads up.

127
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,800
The fortress is a perfect place for an...

128
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,300
Okay. Pete's dead.

129
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,220
You should apologize.

130
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,340
Just play the game.

131
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,720
Not saying you have to mean it.

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,430
Just saying you should apologize.

133
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,970
That's... that's great.

134
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,100
Be a hypocrite.

135
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,270
You married?

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm 15.

137
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,690
Oh, well, thank you for a lifetime of wisdom.

138
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,360
My girlfriend was pissed at me for something I didn't even do,

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,820
but I said sorry, and now we're back together.

140
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,780
Maybe I'm a hypocrite,

141
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,120
but at least I'm a hypocrite with a girlfriend.

142
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,220
Up and at 'em. We gotta be downtown by noon.

143
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,220
Oh, yeah, we're late for the protest.

144
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,220
Gotta get this state opened up...

145
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,850
Well, pulse ox is 82.

146
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,310
Everything else looks okay.

147
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,060
Sure, other than my steadily declining oxygen levels,

148
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,020
I am the picture of health.

149
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,730
Let's start making signs. Oh.

150
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm thinking...

151
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,620
"Don't tread on my right to kill you."

152
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,370
How about, "Give me liberty and give me death"?

153
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
I need to go.

154
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,550
Nothing.

155
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
We haven't had a patient named Sulkin in over 10 years.

156
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,390
Being dead doesn't change

157
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,770
because your loved one gets a memento back.

158
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,600
And fixating on dead people

159
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,690
it's not a life.

160
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,740
How can anyone not be answering their phone right now

161
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,780
if they're not an essential worker?

162
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,910
Well, what nonessential worker are you trying to reach?

163
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,830
Lea.

164
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,000
People don't go out anymore,

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,500
but they do still go to the bathroom.

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,170
This is the second time in an hour

167
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,920
she hasn't picked up, Claire.

168
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,250
We keep learning more things about this disease.

169
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,090
It's...

170
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,550
It's...

171
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,090
I don't know.

172
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,510
It's not right.

173
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,030
We love you, Grandma.

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,990
Mom, I'm so sorry.

175
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
I love you.

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,660
And I want you to know that we'll be okay.

177
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,950
We love you.

178
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,690
He's gone.

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,840
She's gone.

180
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,680
They're gone.

183
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,140
It's not always fun.

184
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,180
Whatever you're talking about, no, it isn't.

185
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,650
But what are you talking about?

186
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,480
Do you love Mia?

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,150
Of course I do.

188
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,110
What do you love about her?

189
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,700
I love that she loves our son.

190
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,580
I love how she talks to him,

191
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,330
how she knows what he's thinking, knows what he needs.

192
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,420
I thought so.

193
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,790
You thought what?

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,500
You love Kellan.

195
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,550
Hello. Are you okay?

196
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,180
I'm sorry I didn't pick up when you called.

197
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,430
I didn't wanna upset you.

198
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,470
- It didn't work. - I had a sore throat,

199
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,890
so I got tested for COVID, and I'm negative.

200
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,310
COVID tests have a high percentage of false negatives.

201
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,480
Shaun, I feel fine now.

202
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
That doesn't mean you don't have COVID.

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,730
I need to go to work.

204
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,210
How are you adjusting to your new specialty?

205
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,000
It's great. Love being an internist.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,380
Well, I'm convinced.

207
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,340
Dealing with conscious people isn't really your thing.

208
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,630
I'm fine.

209
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,050
You're rude, abrasive,

210
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,310
and now you've gotta hold people's hands and be nice.

211
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,770
It's a huge adjustment,

212
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,400
and I find it completely draining.

213
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,310
You happy?

214
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,200
There's a lot of different approaches to "nice."

215
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't have lasted 40 years as a nurse.

216
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,290
You'll find your own.

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,340
Or maybe you won't.

218
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,430
Overall, everything's looking up.

219
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,380
Fewer patients coming in.

220
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,430
When they do, we're getting better at...

221
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,060
Hey, buddy.

222
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,690
I'm sorry I keep missing your calls.

223
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,350
I've got this patient.

224
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,270
You know the mom of the baby I told you about?

225
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,900
I basically put her into suspended animation,

226
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,650
but it doesn't seem to be helping.

227
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,950
When are you coming to Phoenix?

228
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,160
I still don't know.

229
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,660
You're going to make my graduation party, though, right?

230
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
I don't think so.

231
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,580
- This patient needs... - You?

232
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
No one else can take care of her?

233
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,710
I kind of went out on a limb on this one.

234
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,380
Oh, well, if you made a commitment, then...

236
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,190
Your husband has blood in his NG tube.

237
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,860
He's developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

238
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,940
We need to stop the heparin.

239
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,700
But doesn't that put him at risk for another clot?

240
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
Yes, if he's not on the heparin,

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,030
he could have a stroke,

242
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,830
and if he's on it, he could have a fatal internal bleed,

243
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,040
and he still has an infection,

244
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,790
so we can't stop the antibiotics

245
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,410
or he'll get sepsis and die.

246
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,090
All you do is tell me new ways that my husband might die.

247
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,750
Every time I talk to you, there's another way.

248
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,550
I mean, do you even know what you're doing?

249
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,840
What is the point of you? You're useless.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,680
We understand your frustration.

251
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,850
COVID targets so many organs.

252
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,810
- Technically, this is your fault. - Shaun.

253
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,560
Martin never left the apartment,

254
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,100
but he still caught COVID.

255
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,770
You must have exposed him to it.

256
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,060
On the other hand, we are doing

257
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,980
- all that we can to... - That's enough. That's enough.

258
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,160
We're all going through crap,

259
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,450
but that woman's husband may be dying.

260
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,080
She's allowed to lash out.

261
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,620
You aren't.

262
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,830
Why?

264
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,420
What?

265
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,840
What are you sorry about?

266
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,920
Everything.

267
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,340
The fight and

268
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,600
you sleeping in the other room and you ignoring me...

269
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,020
So you're sorry because of the way I've been acting.

270
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,310
I'm apologizing.

271
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,690
I don't think you are.

272
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
I don't get it. Uh, you won.

273
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,360
I... I don't know what you want.

274
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,950
We... we can't have a difference of opinion?

275
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,200
No, not when we disagree

276
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,660
on whether you've been mean to me or not.

277
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,240
You've been mean to me.

279
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,390
Three tours.

280
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,140
Helicopter pilot.

281
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, he's got a medal in that one.

282
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,730
Hey, look at this, same guy again.

283
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,480
Funny. Almost as if they were in the same unit or something.

284
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,030
Greg Lavin...

286
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,410
...died here. Covid, one month ago.

287
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,830
Hello. Enid Lavin?

288
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,880
Hi. This is Dr. Claire Browne

289
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,750
from San Jose Saint Bonaventure.

290
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,590
I'm so sorry for your loss.

291
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,960
I just wanted you to know that

292
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,880
we have found something of your father's.

293
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,600
A memento of his service. Dog tags.

294
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,060
No, not his.

295
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,060
A man by the name of Donald Sulkin.

296
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,850
Donald Sulkin.

297
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,940
Thank you.

298
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,950
That's odd.

299
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,910
Yeah.

300
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,750
How does your father carry someone else's dog tags for 50 years,

301
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,830
and you have never even heard of him?

302
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,010
How are you feeling?

303
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,770
My son

304
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,770
plans to move to Montana.

305
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,610
Take my granddaughter 1,000 miles away.

306
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,820
The schools are better, air's cleaner.

307
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,530
So the upside of all this is...

308
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,040
I don't have to move to Montana.

309
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,750
Is that why you haven't okayed us

310
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,830
putting you on a ventilator if you need one?

311
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,260
I know what ventilators do to people.

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,720
Do you remember Dr. Pitcairn?

313
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,600
Pitstain.

314
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,810
Exactly.

315
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,560
Remember when I was a first-year resident?

316
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,650
One of two women, only woman of color.

317
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,990
I'd been warned he'd make my life hell.

318
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,160
And sure enough, second week,

319
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,780
Pitstain starts tearing into me

320
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,790
about the spacing of my sutures being inconsistent,

321
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,040
and I'm about to fall apart in front of everybody,

322
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,370
but then you stepped in.

323
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,590
Brought up some charting error he'd made.

324
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,460
A tiny blip of a mistake.

325
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,090
He never capitalized "STAT."

326
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,050
The whole point is for it stand out.

327
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,680
Well, you put him back on his heels in front of everybody.

328
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,520
You gave me time,

329
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,690
to regain my composure.

330
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,520
He never got to see me cry.

331
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,570
Please, if it comes to it,

332
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,410
give me a little time again.

333
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,950
To help you.

334
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,850
No, no, no!

335
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,150
I don't know what to do.

336
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,150
I love Lea, and I wanted her to love...

337
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,610
Okay, okay. I'll be... I'll be right down.

338
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,650
Okay?

339
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,700
I don't know what to do.

340
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,790
I... I love Lea,

341
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,380
and I wanted her to love me back,

342
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,210
and now she does, but we can't be together.

343
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,210
How can loving someone who loves you back make things worse?

344
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,840
Well, that's a...

345
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,300
That's a good question.

346
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,930
Let's start with what's making things worse.

347
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,480
I think...

348
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,190
I think I may be... cranky.

349
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,980
I've never been cranky before.

350
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,360
I don't like it.

351
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,070
I think I miss Lea.

352
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,450
I think I'm worried that she has COVID.

353
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,580
So you're going crazy because you can't see someone.

354
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,490
What am I supposed to do?

355
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,250
Should I not talk to Lea until the pandemic is over?

356
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, that's an option.

357
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,920
Is that what you want?

358
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,960
No, no, I don't... I don't want that at all.

359
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,800
But I don't want to feel like this, either.

360
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,760
I want this to be over.

361
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,520
Well, we all want it to be over, Shaun.

362
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,440
I mean, we're... we're sick of ourselves,

363
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,520
we're sick of each other,

364
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,860
or we're pining for someone we can't be with.

365
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,770
We're confused. We're uncomfortable.

366
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,940
And on top of everything else,

367
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,490
we're scared that the world will never be the same again.

368
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,030
I mean, I don't know, Shaun.

369
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,790
I don't have a map for this kind of thing.

370
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,960
Best I can say is...

371
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,420
be kind.

372
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,080
Be kind to yourself. Be kind

373
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,230
to everyone.

374
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,620
'Cause what else is there?

375
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:40,540

Good. I was being kind.

Martin hates it, too.

It was... It was the first conversation we had,

387
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,310
talking about how weird this song is.

388
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,600
Who is Bright Eyes, and why is it so important

400
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,910

He seems to have a posterior tibial artery thrombosis.

404
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,520
What... That... That sounds bad.

405
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,090
It is. It's a blockage in the artery,

406
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,700
causing ischemia to his lower extremity tissues due to lack of...

407
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,570
I want to be kind to you, I want to explain,

408
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,120
but it's a very long explanation,

409
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,290
and I don't have time for you to get mad and upset...

410
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,130
Just go help my husband.

411
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,550
Okay.

412
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,780
Your numbers are falling.

413
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,280
I know.

414
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,400
You need a ventilator.

415
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,460
I know.

416
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,670
There's a pocket in my purse.

417
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,450
Reach into it.

418
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,410
"Game 7, 2003, American League Championship."

419
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,160
Grady let Pedro go one inning too long.

420
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,200
The Sox handed the series to the damn Yankees.

421
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,800
My son and I cried in each other's arms.

422
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,470
I've kept them with me ever since.

423
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,010
It's like Jimmy's always with me.

424
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,130
You're not alone.

425
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,170
You're stuck with all of us.

426
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,420
Can you take your earbuds out, please?

427
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,470
I don't think that I've done anything wrong,

428
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,210
but I may be wrong about that. I suspect that I am.

429
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,660
I haven't been thinking straight lately.

430
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,150
What with everything going on at the hospital,

431
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,560
people are dying, and I'm... here.

432
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,970
And that makes me feel weak.

433
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,790
And then I feel scared, and that makes me feel

434
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,250
even more weak.

435
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,780
And then I feel relieved and safe

436
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,680
that I'm here,

437
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,880
and that makes me feel like a coward.

438
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,100
Thank you.

439
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,140
"Thank you"?

440
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,930
I just needed an honest moment.

441
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,120
Something

442
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,840
to let me know that you actually need me.

443
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,770
And...

444
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm sorry.

445
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,990
I'm sorry, too.

446
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,130
Hi, buddy.

447
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,170
Hey, Dad.

448
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,770
I shouldn't have gotten angry about you not coming to Phoenix.

450
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,070
It wasn't fair.

451
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,870
Thank you.

452
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,940
Did your mother put you up to this?

453
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,490
She was right.

454
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,910
I don't even really care about the party that much.

455
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,080
Then what was the issue?

456
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,580
We don't have to talk about that.

457
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,370
I wanna know what's bothering you.

458
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,920
I... I know your job is important,

459
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,570
but sometimes I just wanna know

460
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,750
you care about me more than you care about the job.

461
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,600
When your mom got pregnant,

462
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,720
I was so nervous.

463
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,490
Suddenly, everything was real.

464
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,810
Suddenly, I had a commitment.

465
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,300
And I wasn't sure I was ready.

466
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,310
And then you were born.

467
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,580
And in that moment, I mean, that moment,

468
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,330
everything changed.

469
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,620
I was instantly head-over-heels in love with you.

470
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,330
You were my best friend.

471
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,460
And, uh, I held you,

472
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,060
and the words just came out. I said, "Hi, buddy."

473
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I'd never called anyone "buddy" before in my life.

474
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,010
But

475
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,860
you were my buddy.

476
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,990
I may make mistakes over and over again,

477
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,320
but don't ever think

478
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,210
you're not the most important thing in my life.

479
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,800
So, basically, you're saying

480
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,870
your love for me is like chemical, right?

481
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,990
Yeah.

482
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,700
Thank you for your call.

483
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,030
Your husband is still unconscious. Bye.

484
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,000
How is he? How was the surgery?

485
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,480
Dr. Andrews will explain,

486
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,940
but I'd rather not say anything more.

487
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,780
The last two times I gave you bad news, you yelled at me.

488
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,000
Bad news? What... What is the bad news?

489
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,820
Okay.

490
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,560
We amputated Martin's foot and ankle.

491
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,060
We are now trying to reintroduce anticoagulation

492
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,410
so he won't have more clots,

493
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,440
but he will be at risk for more bleeding.

494
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,470
Thank you.

495
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,940
Are you sure you understand?

496
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,880
He's still on a ventilator, and he... he lost a foot.

497
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,530
You were very upset yesterday.

498
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,530
Yesterday, I thought he was dying.

499
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,730
But today he's alive.

500
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,460
So, thank you.

501
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,520
You're welcome.

502
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,340
Can I hang up now?

503
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,140
Yes. Yeah, thank...

504
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,970
I figured you're bored of just hearing my voice,

505
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,130
so I brought a mutual friend.

506
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,980
The risks are minimal, and whatever time you have,

507
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,020
some of it should be with your family.

508
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,030
Yes, I'm trying to track down a Donald Sulkin.

509
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,880
Nope, no one here by that name.

510
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,700
Okay, sorry to bother you.

511
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,400
Your plan is to call every D. Sulkin in North America,

512
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,680
all to return a set of dog tags?

513
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,480
You've reached Diana Sulkin, please...

514
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,520
You want a happy ending for this guy.

515
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,810
'Cause you and I didn't have one.

516
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,070
Because we'll never know how our story could've ended.

517
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,360
Hello?

518
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,500
Is Donald Sulkin there?

519
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,570
- Sorry... - This doesn't change anything.

520
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,200
This can't change anything.

521
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,570
You're wrong. It changes things.

522
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,320
It makes me feel something besides sad.

523
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,680
And I need that. I need to not feel sad.

524
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,060
'Cause everything sucks.

525
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,880
Everything hurts like hell.

526
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,260
People are sick with... with COVID,

527
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,870
with cancer, with grief,

528
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,400
and we can't help them.

529
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,610
People are dying, and we can't help them,

530
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,920
and what is worse, you're not there!

531
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,580
It has to hurt.

532
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,620
A lot.

533
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,690
For a while.

534
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,560
When your mom died, you did everything you could

535
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,690
to not feel anything. At all.

536
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,730
But this time, you're facing it.

537
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,670
You're grieving.

538
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,200
You're healing.

541
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,300
It's time.

542
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,960
No. Not today.

543
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,110
Today.

544
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,330
We love you, Mom.

545
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm sorry.

546
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,650
It's okay.

547
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,810
Mom...

548
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,180
I love you.

549
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,650
Good-bye.

574
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
She told me what you did in the earthquake,

575
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,980
the price you paid.

576
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,710
She said you can rest easy

577
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,340
if you've got that

578
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,300
"tough Reznick" in your corner.

579
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,760
I'm thinking she didn't exactly phrase it that way, did she?

580
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,260
No. She didn't.

581
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,860
Donald Sulkin?

582
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,610
How can I help you?

583
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,940
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

584
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,230
Greg Lavin died at my hospital last month.

585
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,020
Greg...

586
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,600
he had this with him when he passed.

587
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,790
I gave these to Greg at the end of the war.

588
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,550
We were...

589
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,810
friends.

590
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,190
Thank you.

591
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:06,920
Thank you.

592
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,290
That was beautiful.

593
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,560
That room is filled with stories that were cut short.

594
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,050
Like ours.

595
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,400
But you,

596
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,520
you have an amazing story ahead.

597
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,630
I can't wait to see it.

598
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,960
You can come home?

599
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,380
I can come home.

600
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,030
But...

601
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,330
But?

602
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,250
Do you love me?

603
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,000
Of course I love you.

604
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,110
What do you love about me?

605
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,650
I love that you love our son.

606
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,180
I love watching you two talk.

607
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,300
I love the way Kellan lights up when he's with you.

608
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,600
I love you, too.

609
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,290
For all the same reasons.

610
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,100
And we both wanna be there for Kellan.

611
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,450
And we are.

612
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,540
But...

613
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,130
You and I don't need to be together to do that.

614
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,540
Are you okay if...

615
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,070
Maybe it's time we stopped coming here.

616
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,070
You're ready to move on?

617
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,630
No.

618
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,040
But he'll still be with us, right?

619
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,400
Wherever we are.

620
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,440
He changed me.

621
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,200
That's not gonna go away.

622
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,320
I have everything I need to stay overnight,

623
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,180
including this... Negative for COVID.

624
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,770
I know negative tests are unreliable,

625
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,920
but it's my third in three days.
