00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,824
[in Arabic] Careful... put it down there.

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,064
Good boys. Did anyone follow you?

4
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,316
Stop! Hands up!

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,786
[Aviram] Stop!

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,522
Well...

00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,357
"baker boy"...

10
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,237
Everyone who meets me...

11
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,657
- talks.
- [glass breaks]

12
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,871
Do you know why?

13
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,415
I am...

14
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,587
prepared to go the extra mile.

15
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,048
[boy gulps]

16
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,425
The sensible ones...

17
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,302
they talk right away.

18
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,346
But the stupid ones...

19
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,308
they suffer...

20
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,811
for nothing.

21
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,313
Now...

22
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,816
[gasping]

23
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,943
are you going to be sensible...

24
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,778
- [whirring]
- or stupid?

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,698
[crying]

26
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,992
Please... please...

27
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,996
- I'm not the one you beg to.
- I'll talk!

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,999
[panicked breathing]

29

[yelps]

30
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,921
Relax, man! Relax...

31
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,134
Take it easy.

32
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,803

[footstep]

35
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,731
Well?

36
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,323
Spit it out.

37
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,742
[Alon sighs]

38
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,248
His name is Rashid Khalid Al Nuaimi.

39
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,420
His father is Nuaimi.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,384
Avi...

41
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,797
[in English] The guns are not necessary.

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
[Aviram, in English] I know.

43
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,052
You're welcome.

44
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,642
Yes, take a good last look.

45
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,355
You will be forgotten in a week.
They won't remember a thing about you.

46
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,899
America,

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,235
it's like a silly schoolgirl.

48
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,572
But you know that already, don't you?

49
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,549
[woman screams]

50
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,634

[baby crying]

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,636
[Felix] She's still seizing.
Anna, listen, just get in the cab.

55
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
- What hospital?
- [woman] Providence, on 12th.

56
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,015
Providence, on 12th.

57
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,482
[Eva] Switch to that lower camera.

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,410
Can you zoom in?

59
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,792
Fuck.

60
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,419
Get close on that number plate.

61
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,301
Fucking idiot.

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,313
[distant sirens wailing]

63
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
[Eva] <i>So why wasn't the FBI at the church?</i>

64
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,614
I told you. Order came
from the head office for us to stand down.

65
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,093
- We were taken off the detail.
- So you didn't think to check?

66
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,951
[scoffs]

67
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,829
We got a ping on that E-ZPass,
for the license plate.

68
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,246
Where?

69
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,959
Uh... I-95 turnpike, entering Delaware.

70
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,877
Delaware.

71
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
I need a map.

72
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,679
There's another ping.
Uh, Memorial Highway One, headed south.

73
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,723
What airfields are out here?

74
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,392
Uh, Dover, Georgetown,
Wilmington are all north.

75
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,519
- No, smaller.
- There's Chorman airfield,

76
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,896
but that's government.

77
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,272
When was that ping?

78
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,940
It's two hours ago.

79
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,820
Access the State Department server,
and get all flight clearances

80
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,781
for Chorman airfield this evening,
including diplomatic planes.

81
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,742
I want tail numbers and flight plans.

82
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,910
Okay, what's your thinking?

83
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,370
I don't have time to explain it,
just do it.

84
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,664
Do it.

85
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,501
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,004
[ringing tone]

87
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,842
[phone chiming]

88
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,689
Damn it.

89
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,321
There's only one flight out of Chorman.

90
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,489
Just took off.

91
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,573
Where's it headed?

92
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,160
Says its flight plan's classified...

93
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,453
So's the tail number.

94
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,330
Asshole.

95
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,253
- [agent] Where are you going?
- Flight's just gone international.

96
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,338
Need-to-know basis.

97
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
[bells jangling]

98
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,019
[bleating]

99
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,234
[speaking Arabic]

100
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,077
Go... Get in there...

101
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,329
Come on! You're making me late!

102
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,081
Get in! Go on!

103
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:10,735
[woman, in French] <i>Italy is just across
the Mediterranean from Algeria.</i>

104
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,946
<i>Malik, there you are.</i>

105
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,699
Yes. And I'm sorry I was late.

106
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,118
I was bringing the goats in
to be milked, and one got away.

107
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>That's okay.</i>

108
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,163
But that's not the worst part...

109
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,624
This goat, he was taken by a lion!

110
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,542
[laughter]

111
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,377
<i>A lion? Really?</i>

112
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,341
[in Arabic] There are no lions here.
Malik is always telling stories.

113
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,135
There was a lion,
the most ferocious one I've seen.

114
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,138
[in French] But don't worry, Mademoiselle,
I had my stick...

115
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,682
and chased him away,
and saved my goat.

116
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,312
[in Arabic] Last week, he saw a spaceship.

117
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,189
[laughter]

118
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,608

[Anna gasps]

120
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,623
Sweetheart.

121
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,042
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

122
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,462
You had us so worried.

123
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,838
Mom.

124
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,132
[Felix] Rebecca.

125
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,222
We need the nurse. Get the nurse.

126
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,598
[call bell rings]

127
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,854
- What do you... remember?
- Let her be a moment, Felix.

128
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,399
I was dreamin'.

129
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,069
It was terrible.

130
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,447
I was standin' in front of everyone.

131
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,283
- That wasn't a dream, honey.
- [Anna] It's okay, sweetheart.

132
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,704
- What made you go out there?
- This can wait.

133
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,497
He left.

134
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,833
[Felix] You saw him leave?

135
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,920
- Where'd he go?
- Is that all you can think about?

136
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,674
- I just need to know.
- Your daughter almost died, Felix.

137
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,426
Where's your goddamn perspective?

138
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,518
He's gone, Dad.

139
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,648
I don't know where,
but I don't think he's comin' back.

140
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,585
[speaking quietly]

141
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,909
Thank you.

142
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,290
It's only water,
but feel free to turn it into wine.

143
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm glad we're having
this time together, Aviram.

144
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,256
We'll have plenty of time together,
you and me.

145
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,843
When we land, they are going to put us
in a very deep, dark cell,

146
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,305
and throw away the key, and there will be
no guard to convince to let you out.

147
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,684
From now on, my job...

148
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,311
is you.

149
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,982
Yes.

150
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,026
It is.

151
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,597
[crowd cheering]

152
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,943
[man, in Arabic] Hey... Stay awake!

153
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,324
Stay awake. Stay awake.

154
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,523
[reporter speaking Arabic]

155
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,358
[Arabic commentary continues]

156
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,281
- [Eva] Is this stream live?
- [Bailey] Yes.

157
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,866
Who's claiming responsibility?

158
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,742
No one yet.

159
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,997
Qamar was there. Is he okay?

160
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,459
No word from him yet.

161
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,216
I should have been there.

162
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,344
Yes, you should have.

163
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,347
I've been telling you to stay on this.

164
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,850
- This should never have happened.
- You're right.

165
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,812
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,234
Where's Golshiri?

167
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,281
- Eva.
- We need to talk.

168
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,578
The car that took Golshiri, we traced it
to a government airfield in Delaware.

169
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,665
- Government?
- Details of the flight are classified,

170
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,750
but I'm guessing
you know nothing about this.

171
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,711
- Of course not.
- No prizes for guessing who does.

172
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,719
This goes to air in 20 minutes.
You need to cut your VO.

173
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,973
It's written,
I just need to read it. Relax.

174

00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,282
<i>...do not have any confirmations as yet
as to what caused the explosion.</i>

183
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,201
<i>But Palestinian authorities have been...</i>

184
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>...terrorist attack...</i>

185
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,374
<i>We will be crossing live
to our correspondents in Israel...</i>

186
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,376
- [sighs]
<i>- We are starting to get...</i>

187
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,439
[Bailey] <i>Your department
gave clearance for that plane to land.</i>

188
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,783
We need to know where it's going.

189
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,842
<i>What are you gonna do?
Arrest him when he lands?</i>

190
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,844
It's over. The deal is done.

191
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,013
We need to know where
in Israel it's landing.

192
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,856
We need the tail number
and the flight plans.

193
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,810
Do I need to wake the president, Danny?

194
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,361
It's approaching Spanish airspace.

195
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,656
- Keep a lock on that.
- Yes, ma'am.

196
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,327
- Why can't we force the plane to land?
- [Bailey] Diplomatic jet. It's sovereign.

197
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,787
He was taken against his will.

198
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,123
We're sending him back into that.

199
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,292
It's all connected.

200
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,711
It all goes back to him.

201
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,845
We wait till he lands.

202
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,013
And then what?

203
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,226
You create an opportunity.

204
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,565
I'll scramble a team.

205
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,075
The fuck you're looking at?

206
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,038
We never finished our conversation
about Megiddo.

207
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,709
Don't you want to get it off your chest?

208
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,214
Secrets are so heavy to carry around.

209
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,849
God knows your secrets.

210
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,227
And loves you anyway.

211
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
Sin.

212
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,151
Sin is just a failure
to choose goodness, that's all.

213
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,071
Goodness is a choice.

214
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,330
Every moment is an opportunity
to make a choice.

215
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,167
The choice to think a good thought,
to think a bad thought,

216
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,378
to act on it, to let it pass.

217
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,968
That is God's great blessing.

218
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,472
That in every moment,
we can create ourselves again.

219
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,474
Aviram.

220
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,602
Make a choice.

221
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,108
Isn't that convenient, huh?

222
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,904
We can all be forgiven
and start fresh again.

223
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,367
People have been hating and killing
since we came down from the trees.

224
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,911
If there's a God,
he should be ashamed of himself.

225
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,707
"Made in the likeness of Him."

226
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,921
[in Hebrew] You're unredeemable.
That's what you think.

227
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,343
So you project your shame onto God.

228
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,681
[in English]
Why don't you shut the fuck up now?

229
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,103
[in Hebrew] Our sins have a way
of punishing us when we ignore them.

230
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,357
That boy.

231
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,863
He'll be the last thing
you see before you die.

232
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,674
[Miriam] This better be worth it.

233
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,801
You'll need to be nicer than that.

234
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,097
Can we cut the bullshit?
It's late and I've got a story to update.

235
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,851
This is gonna blow your story
off the front page.

236
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,730
I don't work in print,
but I'll forgive the analogy.

237
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,608
Oh, you're gonna be thanking me,
not just forgiving me.

238
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,694
His real name is Payam Golshiri.

239
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,905
Whose real name?

240
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,949
Your messiah.

241
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
There's enough in there
to get you started.

242
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,539
You got a busy night ahead of you.

243
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,124
Why are you doing this?

244
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,628
I owe you.

245
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
What's the real reason?

246
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,136
Run with it. You'll see.

247
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,167
[beeping]

248
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,551
[PA] <i>Calling the flight deck. Emergency.
Fasten your seat belts.</i>

249
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,096
[alarms wailing]

250
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,412
[gasping]

251
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,665
[Rashid] Please!

252
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,670
Please.

253
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,672
Please. I'm sorry.

254
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,342
What are you sorry for?

255
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,427
For everything.

256
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,221
[Aviram] Everything?

257
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,723
You're sorry for everything?

258
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,477
You're sorry
for all the wrong in the world?

259
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,188
No... no.

260
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,439
I'm sorry for what I...

261
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,901
I don't care what you did.

262
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,742
I care who you are.

263
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,453
[Rashid] I told you my name.

264
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,705
[Aviram] Yes.

265
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,541
I know your father.

266
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,504
He's had a lot to do with my life.

267
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,464
He shaped me.

268
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,716
He gave me my conviction.

269
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,762
He's had more influence over me
than any other person.

270
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,598
He's killed many people...

271
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,684
and boasted about it.

272
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,938
Including...

273
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,232
my mother.

274
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,608
[Rashid gasping]

275
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,417
[Aviram] You weren't even born...

276
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,254
but you've inherited his sin.

277
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,217
[Rashid] No, no! Please!

278
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
<i>I'm only 14!</i>

279
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,721
My mother doesn't even know where I am.

280
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,807
Please! Her heart will be broken!

281
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,852
I bear witness that there is
no God but Allah...

282
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,271
<i>and Muhammad is his messenger!</i>

283
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,065
[Rashid continues praying]

284
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,778
[in Hebrew ]I'm sorry.

285
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,081
There's four passengers, one's Golshiri,
so we'll at least need a team of six.

286
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,000
- We've lost it.
- What?

287
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,083
The plane.

288
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,211
What do you mean?

289
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,840
Just dropped off. No signal. It was
right there and then it disappeared.

290
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,803
What are you saying?
They're flying under radar?

291
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,428
That type of plane can't fly
at those low altitudes.

292
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,224
So what, then?

293
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,406
[phone buzzing]

294
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,415
Yes.

295
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,838
Thank you.

296
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,969
[door closes]

297
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,306
[breathing heavily]

298
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,279
[sighs]

299
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,352
Sweetie?

300
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,730
Rae.

301
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,027
Raeah. Honey?

302
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
Raeah.

303
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,199
Jonah!

304
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,747
[Miriam] <i>It's being called
the hoax of the century,</i>

305
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,291
<i>or maybe the millennium.</i>

306
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,543
<i>The man they call the Messiah is mortal.</i>

307
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>He was born Payam Golshiri,
an Iranian national,</i>

308
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,718
<i>orphaned at an early age
during the Kuwaiti crisis of 1991.</i>

309
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,180
<i>He and his brother Adar were raised
by their uncle, a street performer,</i>

310
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,850
<i>who apparently taught them
the art of illusion.</i>

311
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:47,105
<i>It seems Golshiri also has suffered from
psychological issues throughout his life,</i>

312
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,567
<i>being committed to a mental institution
during his 20s.</i>

313
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,944
<i>This startling news
came to light this morning</i>

314
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,197
<i>from a document leaked
by undisclosed sources in the White House</i>

315
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:01,244
<i>that reveals Golshiri has been
under investigation by the CIA</i>

316
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,787
<i>for the past several weeks.</i>

317
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,541
<i>The exhaustive report also mentions
concerning links</i>

318
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,586
<i>to radical thinker
and dissident Oscar Wallace,</i>

319
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:15,050
<i>an outspoken opponent of capitalism
and proponent of civil disobedience,</i>

320
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,721
<i>who was apparently Golshiri's mentor
during the fall semester of 2008.</i>

321
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,183
<i>As of this morning,
Golshiri cannot be located.</i>

322
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,312
<i>He was residing in a Washington DC

- Excuse me.
- Reverend!

- [Felix] Excuse me, please.
- [woman] Reverend!

329
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,628
- Excuse me.
- [man] Will you go back to Texas?

330
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,991
- Excuse me.
- Tell us something!

331
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,506

Yes. We saw.

335
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,028

- An explanation.

Here's my explanation. I outrank you.

350
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,403
You don't have any jurisdiction over me.

351
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,365
- Really? I'll bury you in a second.
- You just burned a whole operation.

352
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,950
And I saved my president.

353
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,869
That information was classified.

354
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,079
Look.

00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,459
I know who you are.

357
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,586
I know who your father was.

358
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,172
That holds no currency here anymore.

359
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,633
- He has nothing to do with this.
- That's right.

360
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,345
Your job is
to give the administration information.

361
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,096
Our job is to do stuff with it.

362
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,140
You brought down a diplomatic plane.

363
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,353
That's a very serious accusation.

364
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,440
I'd watch what I was saying,
if I were you.

365
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,542
[door opens]

366
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,129
Go home, Eva.

367
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,138
[whooshing]

368
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,076
[groans]

369
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,507
[Malik, in Arabic] Here... drink.

370
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,596
How did he do it?

371
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,060
Who are you?

372
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,312
Malik.

373
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,315
You were dead.

374
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,196
What?

375
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,448
You were dead. He raised you.

376
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,699
The man...

377
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,659
...he is magic.

378
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,165
He put his hand on your heart
and you began to breathe.

379
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,000
What are you talking about?

380
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,419
You and that other man there...

381
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,464
[coughing]

382
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,719
You were both dead.

383
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,596
Your skin was gray.

384
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,724
You had flies crawling in your mouth...
and then he touched you

385
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,100
and you came back.
