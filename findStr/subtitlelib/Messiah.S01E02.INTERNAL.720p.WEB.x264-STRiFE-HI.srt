<i>This is the first intifada

362
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:24,648
<i>after president Ariel Sharon walked

363

364
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,570

[in Arabic]
These words cannot be tolerated.

374
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,220
But he's brought energy
to the cause, Imam.

375
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,389
Israel is under great pressure
because of him.

376
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,558
He gives a voice to our struggle...

377
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,311
He misquotes Muhammad.

378
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,148
This man is a heretic, not a prophet.

379
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,984
But he appeared in Damascus
in a yellow robe...

380
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,485
as the scriptures said.

381
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,238
Any man can wear a yellow robe.

382
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,247
If he has escaped...

383
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,666
why hasn't he come back to us?

384
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,880
If he really is Isa returned,

385
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,426
then he has greater things to worry about.

386
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,597
- He has left us.
- He wouldn't do that.

387
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,352
We must be faithful
and not act out of foolish despair.

388
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,604
He turned away Daesh,

389
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,815
and He will provide for us again...

400
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,131
So why did they tell you to tail me?

401
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,049
I'm not here under orders.

402
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,428
So you're here to intimidate me.

403
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,974
- What are you doing in Israel?
- My job.

404
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,737
Oh. Your job. And your job is
to interrogate me during a debriefing?

405
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,646
My job is to get this situation
under control.

406
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,564
You guys messed up,

407
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,000
- and now this city's about to hemorrhage.
- [distant gunfire]

408
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,276
It's not your city.

409
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,070
See, that's one of the problems
with you fucking Americans,

410
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,954
- you want your finger in every pie.
- You come to us when you need us.

411
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,783
- [siren wailing]
- We don't need you.

412
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,243
Right.

413
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,787
No. Looks like you've got it all
under control.

414
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,291
This might be your city...

415
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,294
but when Israel tips, we all tip.

416
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,296
When this region blows,
we all feel it.

417
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,214
And that makes it our problem.

418
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,259
Thank you very much
for this lesson in geopolitics.

419
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,012
What's on that file that you erased?

420
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,890
That's none of your fucking business.

421
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,601
Now, we know you didn't come
to have a drink with me.

422
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,852
So why don't you level?

423
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,608
I'd be careful if I were you.

424
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,944
- You don't know who I am.
- I don't care who you are.

425
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,904
I have a job to do.

426
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,366
Then I'll make you regret it.

427
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,203
You're charming.

428
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,705
Yes, so people tell me.

Whatever it is you're hiding...

430
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,627
I'll find it.

431
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,174
Is there a reason you don't drink?

432
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,303
We all have something to hide,

433
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,930
- haven't we?

434
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,022
[in Hebrew] What? What is it?

435
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,275
Want to tell me why you left our daughter
in the car today?

436
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610

498
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,266

It's not safe for people like you, okay?

499
