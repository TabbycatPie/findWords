She's been... cold.

181
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,061
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

182
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,404
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

183
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,662
You're not worried about that?

184
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm not worried about that.

185
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,232
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

186
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,468
- Hm.
- You haven't mentioned anything

187
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,903
about about Earth-2, have you?

188
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,105
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

189
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,508
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

190
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,675
for her to heal.

191
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,444
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

192
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,813
That shouldn't be a problem.

193
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,314
- Oh.
- Hey, Dig, Lyla.

194
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,582
What are you guys doing here?

195
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

196
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,853
About what?

197
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,289
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

198
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,923
goes by the name King Shark.

199
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,025
King Shark?

200
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,895
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

201
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,695
months ago. I thought he was dead.

202
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,165
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

203
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,999
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

204
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,835
this half-shark is very much alive,

205
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,904
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

206
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,338
That's kill you, Barry.

207
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,440
[scoffs]

208
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,743
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

209
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:13,946
[sighs]

210
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,343
So how do you know about King Shark?

211
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,303
Well, as the new director of A.R.G.U.S.,

212
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:27,039
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

213
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,108
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

214
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:30,710
And it appears under her directives,

215
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,712
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

216
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,946
for the past two years.

217
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:34,373
Why?

218
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:37,456
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

219
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:38,656
Weaponized.

220
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,660
How do you know that he's coming after me?

221
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,363
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

222
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,397
"Zoom wants The Flash dead".

223
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:50,301
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

224
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,936
the readings we did
receive show he that was

225
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,037
headed towards Central City.

226
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:54,138
Let him come.

227
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,674
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

228
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,942
We just came here to warn you, man.

229
00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,043
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

230
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:00,745
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

231
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,081
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

232
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,249
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

233
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
This is the last one.

234
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,886
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

235
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,054
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

236
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,059
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

237
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,894
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

238
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,198
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

239
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,368
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

240
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,737
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

241
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:28,172
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

242
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,340
I just followed.

243
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,776
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

244
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,277
Can you find King Shark too?

245
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:34,378
I can try.

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,780
All right.

247
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:41,449
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

248
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,221
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

249
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:45,623
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

250
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,658
[beeps]

251
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,059
I can take the waterfront.

252
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,360
Can you have your team handle the rest?

253
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,861
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

254
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,232
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

255
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,933
Maybe he could help us somehow.

256
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,901
Or not. Looks like he died

257
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,438
when the particle accelerator exploded.

258
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,206
What about next of kin?

259
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:04,275
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

260
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,511
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

261
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:09,412
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

262
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,417
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

263
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,218
anything in her research
that could help us.

264
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,319
Sure.

265
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,654
Great.

266
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,424
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

267
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:21,624
How's that helmet treating you?

268
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,294
Could use some improvements.

269
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:24,995
I'll get to work on it.

270
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,130
Hey, Joe, what's up?

271
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,631
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

272
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,865
he wants to meet up with you.

273
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,967
All right.

274
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,701
He's working on his engineering project

275
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:32,474
at our place tonight.

276
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,938
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

277
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,197
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

278
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,630
right now is kind of a crazy time.

279
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,166
What? What's going on?

280
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,901
Remember that meta-human shark

281
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,069
that Patty was after and attacked me?

282
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:45,339
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

283
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,575
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

284
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,744
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

285
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:51,846
I get it.

286
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,212
I'll tell Wally some other time.

287
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,083
Hey, you know what?

288
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,984
It's all good, I'll make it work.

289
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,218
Tell him tonight should be fine.

290
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:01,555
Are you sure?

291
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,323
- Yeah. <i>
- Thanks, Bar.</i>

292
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,525
Yeah, bye.

293
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,262
[sighs] Why?

294
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,003
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

295
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,071
Seems a little late to be asking questions

296
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,906
about my husband, doesn't it?

297
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:23,144
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

298
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,246
I suppose you could say that.

299
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:27,380
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

300
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,014
to grow uncontrollably.

301
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,776
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

302
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,454
not human.

303
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,357
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

304
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,058
There's a meta-human in Central City

305
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,559
whose body seems to be mutating

306
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,061
in the same way as your late husband,

307
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,265
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

308
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,134
My husband was no monster.

309
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,537
That's not what she was implying.

310
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,438
What does this have to do with me?

311
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,574
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

312
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,743
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

313
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,643
although still preliminary.

314
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:59,246
We need to see it.

315
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,680
I beg your pardon?

316
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,550
Your research, all of it.

317
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,384
What my colleague means to say is that

318
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,087
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

319
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,122
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

320
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:16,594
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

321
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,766
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

322
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,200
This could help save lives.

323
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,937
I'll email you what I have.

324
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,941
Thank you.

325
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,046
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

326
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:36,750
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

327
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,152
You've been acting differently toward me

328
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,720
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

329
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,654
What's your problem, Cisco?

330
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:44,758
Nothing.

331
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,759
Let's just go.

Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.

Hey, how's Felicity doing?

344
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,863
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

345
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:26,430
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

346
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,004
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

347

She has a lot going on right now.

348
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,374
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

349
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,942
when this is all over.

350
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,579
Just want to catch this thing, man,

351
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,915
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

352
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,548
so we can just move on with our lives.

carry the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.

356
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,628
Still nothing.

357
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,829

361
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,390
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

362
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,089
We don't find King Shark soon,

363
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,458
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

364
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,092
We'll find him, Lyla.

365
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,397
All right, I searched the whole area.

366
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,498
He's gone.

367
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,799
Couldn't have gotten far.

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,501
Still, he knows we're here now.

369
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,735
We lost the element of surprise.

370
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,795
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

371
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,249
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

372
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,800
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.

373
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,661
I got to go see Joe's son.

374
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:43,364
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

375
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,465

[chuckles] He's fast, John, get over it.

377
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:50,871
Never.

378
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,680
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

379
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:06,520
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

380
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:09,154
to get into CCU's engineering program.

381
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,060
Turbine supercars?

382
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,664
Turbines? Like jet engines?

383
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,899
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

384
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,267
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

385
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,551
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

386
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,173
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

387
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,808
the fuel economy issue here.

388
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,111
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

389
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,047
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

390
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:35,315
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

391
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,051
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

392
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,352
Gonna wake the neighbors...

393
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,653
[laughs] For sure.

394
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:41,655
Anything else?

395
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,225
Um...

396
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,962
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

397
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:49,997
I'm just trying to make
sure they don't have

398
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,498
any reason to say no.

399
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,867
Okay. [Laughs]

400
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:57,036
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...

401
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,572
it looks really good.

402
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:03,444
All right, let's start over, okay?

403
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:04,678
[laughs] Is it...

404
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:08,713
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?

405
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,250
Sounds good.

00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,618

00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,302
This is a complete waste of time.

409
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:33,240
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research

410
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,608
to tell us how to find King Shark.

411
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,444
Maybe I should take a look.

412
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:38,712
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor

413
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:40,347
with a specialty in bio-chem.

414
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,349
I'm just saying maybe you could use

415
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,650
another set of eyes, considering.

416
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,820
Considering what?

417
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,256
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

418

What does that mean?

You are not yourself, Caitlin,

420
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,262
and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have

421
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:59,096
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.

422
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
Over there?

423
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,202
You mean Earth-2?

424

No. Uh, no.

425
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:09,223

00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:14,626

430
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,708
Why not?

431
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,132
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

432
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,961
Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...

433
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:28,019
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

434
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:30,762
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,

435
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,462
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

436
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,396
There, great.

437
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,070
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

438
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:42,516
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

439
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:44,809
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

440
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,477
just like she did over there.

441
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,645
You're being shut off.
You're being detached.

442
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,181
You're being cold.

443
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,783
Because I have to be right now.

444
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,885
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

445
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:01,525
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

446
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,893
just when I was beginning to love.

447
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,298
So if I let myself feel,

448
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:12,506
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

449
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,171
it's never gonna stop,

450
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,907
and that's not gonna help me either,

451
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,009
so let's just get back to this research

452
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,643
and figure out how to find King Shark.

453
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,147
Okay.

454
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,327
Here you are.

455
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,697
Yup, just like back home, always working.

456
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,866
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

457
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,767
He's here? On this Earth?

458
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,936
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

459
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,370
brought him here to kill The Flash.

460
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,609
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

461
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,411
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

462
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,986
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

463
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,817
Probability distribution algorithm?

464
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,452
Partial matching strategies, yes.

465
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,299
Based on what?

466
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,651
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

467
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,269
What about mobility behaviors?

468
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,039
Jessie.

469
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,008
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

470
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,878
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

471
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,848
Just let me help, please.

472
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,417
Grab a marker.

474
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:28,424
Yeah.

475
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,247
Hardest part was amping the torque

476
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,581
without increasing drag.

477
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,116
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

478
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,918
but this streamlined
version should optimize

479
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,352
both the torque and the horsepower.

480
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:42,924
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

481
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,225
Here, let's do this...

482
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,560
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

483
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:47,862
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

484
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,965
reverse rotation and send more power

485
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,666
to the torque converter.

486
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:56,905
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.

487
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,807

work on this together.

Sharks are predators.

626

In order to track their prey, they use

Passive electrolocation?

629
