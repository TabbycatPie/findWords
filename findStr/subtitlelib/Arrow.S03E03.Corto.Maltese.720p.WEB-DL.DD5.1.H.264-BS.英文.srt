13
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,890
My name is Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,030
After five years in hell,

15
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,360
I have come home with only one goal--

16
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,560
to save my city.

17
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,680
Now others have joined my crusade.

18
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,780
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

19
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,040
But to the rest of Starling City,

20
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,360
I am someone else.

21
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,710
I am something else.

22
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,780
Previously, on "Arrow"...

23
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,370
What are you doing here?

24
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,380
Whoever did this, I'm going to find them.

25
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,200
Apparently there's another bidder for the company.

26
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
- Who? - Ray Palmer.

27
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,190
Yes, I am your boss now.

28
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,450
No!

29
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,210
Roy, I don't trust you, or anyone.

30
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,720
Don't try to find me. I am never coming back.

31
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,360
Now I've got to go get Thea.

32
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,290
It's long past time she came home.

33
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,320
Well done.

34
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,410
Thanks, dad.

36
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,240
So, where are we going?

37
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,110
Wherever you want.

38
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,950
- It's up to me? - Why not?

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,370
I'm a well-traveled man.

40
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,240
I've been every place in the world there is.

41
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,940
But you want to get out of here.

42
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,450
Because if the police know you're alive,

43
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,550
they come after you.

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,220
The Arrow, too.

45
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,910
You're very perceptive, Thea.

46
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,770
Knowing when people are hiding something behind their smiles.

47
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,230
Your mother had that talent.

48
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,900
Yes.

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,410
If someone knew where I was,

50
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,910
it would be unfortunate--

51
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,910
for both of us.

52
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,780
So why did you reach out to me?

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,280
- You reached first. - Still.

54
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,740
I don't want to feel this pain again.

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,380
I don't want to hurt or get hurt

56
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,600
ever again.

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,720
And you seem like someone who can teach me how not to.

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,190
I didn't do it!

59
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,940
A woman was killed on a rooftop last week.

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,290
Black leather, blonde hair, wore a mask!

61
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,710
- I didn't kill her. - You were there!

62
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't know anything about it!

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Your fingerprints are on this.

64
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,100
From a fifth I drank up there, but I--

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,220
- What did you see? - Nothing!

66
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
I was up on the roof with some buddies.

67
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,340
This lady, she showed up

68
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,700
she told us to go!

69
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,480
Looked like she could handle herself, you know?

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,810
Whoever it is you're looking for,

71
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,220
I wouldn't want to be him.

72
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,410
Another dead end.

73
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,770
It took me a week to get a hit off that print.

74
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,200
I had to reconstruct the partial

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,260
using a predictive indexing algorithm.

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,740
Appropriate, since it was his index finger...

77
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,320
Not particularly relevant now.

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,190
Don't worry, Oliver, we'll find him.

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,970
He's out there somewhere.

80
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,200
No, he's not.

81
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,710
Trail's gone cold.

82
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,420
I hate to do this, but I have to head off to work.

83
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,140
Tech village is open this early?

84
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,450
Not exactly.

85
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,380
Have you figured out where in Italy Thea's staying?

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,570
- Yeah, about that-- she's not in Italy. - Hmm?

87
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,990
Or Europe. Or, well, she's--

88
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,110
Where is she?

89
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,940
I had to ping her cell phone to find out

90
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,790
where in Italy she was texting from.

91
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,490
Turns out, came back Corto Maltese.

92
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,150
Corto's an island off of South America.

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,740
What's up with your family and islands?

94
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,480
Wait, Oliver.

95
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,630
Thea's letter said not to come find her.

96
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,870
That letter was addressed to you, not to me.

97
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,050
I'm watching Laurel go through losing Sara.

98
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,490
It's time for my sister to come home.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
What are you doing?

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,230
Thea's gone because of me.

101
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,070
Because the lies that I told her.

102
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,910
So I owe this to both of you to make things right.

103
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,140
No. What are you...doing?

104
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,550
You can't travel with that.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,390
I've actually never been on a plane before.

106
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,010
I know. You're not doing anything

107
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,230
and I could literally watch you forever.

108
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,700
Oh, yeah?

109
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,150
What about once she discovers boys?

110
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,900
Well, that's what my glock is for, right, baby?

111
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,590
Right. It's my glock.

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm going to enjoy some

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,850
quality time with her for the next few days.

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm even looking forward to changing a few diapers.

115
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,990
And I'm looking forward to believing that when I see it.

116
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,000
Why the time off?

117
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,300
You quit the team again?

118
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,960
No, Oliver's going to Corto Maltese

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,260
for a couple of days.

120
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,150
Could you go with him?

121
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,310
Like I don't already spend enough time with Oliver as it is?

122
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,420
Team arrow may have Starling City purring like a kitten,

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,990
but the rest of the world is still a very dangerous place.

124
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,740
Including Corto Maltese.

125
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,620
Lyla, I already don't like where this is headed.

126
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,700
We have a field operative down there who's gone dark.

127
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,340
All right, so send an agent. Send a task force.

128
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,110
He's not in any kind of trouble.

129
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,970
He hasn't touched his panic button.

130
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,780
He's probably just drunk in some Belleza's Villa.

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,610
Mark shaw's been known to miss a few days from time to time.

132
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,700
Will you just do me a favor...

133
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,780
And see if he's ok?

134
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,740
Tell him to check in.

135
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,880
Two more days and I'm going to have to call in the cavalry.

136
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,990
And I don't want to get him into trouble with Waller.

137
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,580
Mark's an old friend.

138
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,540
She better not do anything interesting while I'm gone.

139
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,700
Next time, keep your hands up.

140
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,700
Ted Grant?

141
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,110
Well, I guess that badge means you're not here

142
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,370
for a self defense class.

143
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,980
No, I've already had my fair share.

144
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,070
I'm here about one of your students, Tom Bronson.

145
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,680
A witness places him at the scene

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,060
of a break-in last night.

147
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,150
Well, that's not possible. See,

148
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,900
because Tom and I were sparring last night.

149
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,920
Mr. Grant, do you know that lying

150
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,030
to the District Attorney is against the law?

151
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,360
If by that, you mean am I willing to lie

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,620
in order to keep a good kid

153
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,350
who just happened to make a stupid mistake

154
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,090
out of this system? I think you know my answer.

155
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,530
Are you admitting to perjury, Mr. Grant?

156
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,930
Now that's a big word.

157
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm just a dumb fighter.

158
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,780
Right?

159
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,050
Look, Tom was here with me last night.

160
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,940
We worked on his uppercut combinations.

161
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,430
Like I said, in this city, there's a lot of good people

162
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,960
who get dealt bad hands.

163
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,040
They lose someone, they lose themselves, which is why they

164
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,110
come in here to work off that rage.

165
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,290
I've gotten good at picking out the types.

166
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,890
Types just like you.

167
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,640
If I'm angry, it's because I'm dealing

168
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,120
with someone who's willing to lie to a D.A.

169
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,570
to protect a punk kid.

170
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,980
I don't think that's the case.

171
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
Either way,

172
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,780
If you do have something you want to work off...

174
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,690
So what's the play with Thea?

175
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,650
Do you mind if I talk to her alone first?

176
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,710
It's been a while.

177
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,420
Felicity able to pin her down?

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,270
She gave me an address.

179
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,810
Thea!

180
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,670
Senor.

181
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,460
Como puedo ayudarlo?

182
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,210
Estoy buscando a mi hermana.

183
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,600
You must be Mia's brother.

184
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,450
I see the resemblance.

185
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,120
Is "Mia" around?

186
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,480
She works. At the cafe.

187
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,600
Where's the cafe?

188
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,140
- I'll show you. - Thank you.

189
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,450
I didn't come all the way to South America

190
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,180
to have you poison me, did I?

191
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,380
It's a meditative tea.

192
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,350
It will activate your mind and body.

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,600
I think I'm going to need a little bit more than tea

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,340
to learn how to use one of those.

195
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,860
The Sohei Buddhist warriors believed that

196
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,230
first you fight with the mind...

197
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,530
then your sword.

198
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,550
I remember when I was training to be a warrior.

199
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,450
I began just like you--

200
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,490
devastated by my wife's death.

201
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,890
I was...angry,

202
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,260
and hurt.

203
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,890
The pain was unbearable.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Like this.

205
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,640
You're out of your mind! Put your hand in here!

206
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,020
Every warrior must learn the simple truth--

207
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,920
that pain is inevitable,

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,260
and suffering is optional.

209
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,750
Please, don't--

210
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,630
Don't do what I think you're going to do!

211
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,950
You asked me to teach you.

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,940
No.

213
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,070
Aqu tienes.

214
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,230
Thea.

215
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,780
Good to see you.

216
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,580
You, too.

217
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,510
How--how did you--

218
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,140
Well, it's not exactly the Amalfi Coast.

219
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,650
Voy a cerrar, Earnesto.

220
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,280
Didn't you flunk Spanish?

221
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,840
More like skipped it altogether.

222
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,770
Well, you look good.

223
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,890
I like your hair cut.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,720
Thank you. Yeah, wanted it short, you know.

225
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,970
It gets hot down here.

226
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,300
I'm sorry I lied to you about Italy, Ollie.

227
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
I just needed some space.

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,960
It's ok. You've had five months of it.

229
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,040
This isn't just a visit.

230
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,500
Got one for you, too.

231
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,460
After mom,

232
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,690
I understood why you left Starling.

233
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,110
But Thea, I miss you.

234
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
And I would really like it if you came home.

235
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,970
I miss you, too.

236
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,950
And I love you...so much.

237
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,660
But I'm never coming back to Starling city.

238
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,590
I can't. Sorry.

239
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,700
There is strength in you, Thea.

240
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,320
I see it, even if you can't see it yourself.

241
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,290
I'm sorry, this--

242
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,740
This just isn't me. I'm not like you.

243
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,930
I can't do this!

244
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,050
It's all right.

245
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,300
It's not your fault.

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,460
It's mine.

247
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,430
Q.C. stock up 10 bucks at the open.

248
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,110
That is love, ha!

249
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,350
Ah, Miss Smoak, good morning--

250
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,480
I think. I've been here all night.

251
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,620
My predecessor left things a little, um,

252
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,880
what's the polite way to say this? Little wonky.

253
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,980
Sorry if I'm rambling.

254
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm a little over-caffeinated.

255
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,390
I just had three espressos.

256
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,380
- Speaking of coffee-- - Let me stop you right there!

257
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,260
I told myself that I would stand firm

258
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,730
on a few points. No late night emails, no personal errands,

259
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,390
and definitely no coffee.

260
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,710
There'll be no espressos brought to you by me.

261
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,300
I stand very firm on that last point.

262
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,910
And I admire your conviction.

263
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,620
This is Jerry Conway, your executive assistant.

264
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,620
And I wanted to know if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

265
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,990
Or are you just anti-latte in general?

266
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,430
Um...Executive assistant?

267
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,100
I think that's a yes on the latte.

268
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,980
Thank you, Jerry.

269
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,090
Thank you, Jerry.

270
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,970
Should we get to work? Excellent.

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
Applied sciences.

272
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,690
Q.C.'s bleeding edge research division,

273
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,290
till some wacko blew it up last year.

274
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm sure they had their reasons.

275
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,580
The point is, it's the cornerstone for my plan

276
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,250
to rebuild Queen Consolidated

277
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,660
and thus the city. I've had my people

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,620
working day and night salvaging what they can,

279
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,650
Including this-- a file server

280
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,790
containing applied science's design work.

281
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,320
It's not working, unfortunately,

282
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,630
on account of being caught in a massive explosion.

283
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,120
You want me to access the data.

284
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,070
A brilliant mind at work already.

285
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,250
Speaking of, I got to get back to work.

286
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,040
Then why are you leaving your office?

287
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,500
Oh, I'm not. I'm leaving yours.

288
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,450
This is Lyla's busy work, man, you didn't have to tag along.

289
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,070
Well, I don't know how to vacation like a normal person, Diggle.

290
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,450
What's the plan?

291
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,270
This spot's his usual dead drop.

292
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,300
Lyla sent me over this file photo.

293
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,190
Just make sure he's all right.

294
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,590
- Got him. - I got you.

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,690
He's a friendly, Oliver.

296
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,470
Shaw.

297
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,650
Listen! I'm with Lyla Michaels.

298
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,750
Have you seen any capuchins today?

299
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,750
If that's a challenge code,

300
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,160
I got to tell you, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.

301
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm just Lyla's baby daddy.

302
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,190
Now, you didn't check in, Shaw. She was worried,

303
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,660
so she sent me to find you.

304
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,820
If you're lying, you'll be picking your intestines up

305
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,170
off this sidewalk.

306
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,360
That's fair enough.

307
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,670
Lyla gave me a security transcoder in my right jacket pocket.

309
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,550
Pretty jumpy, Shaw.

310
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,190
Better jumpy than dead.

311
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Copy that. What's going on?

312
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,710
Not here.

313
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,180
Sorry, I had--

314
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,770
I had eyes on me all week,

315
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,900
a whole follow team.

316
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,630
Wait, Shaw. What makes you so important?

317
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,990
I have hard intel.

318
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,880
Someone from Corto Maltese hacked into the server

319
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,590
and acquired the A.R.G.U.S. Actual.

320
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,580
They want to sell it.

321
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,230
Did I mention I don't work for A.R.G.U.S.?

322
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,510
The Actual is an encrypted data omnibus.

323
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,500
It's a complete record of agent covers,

324
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,170
personal details, affiliated soft targets.

325
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, soft targets, as in family members?

326
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
Yeah, as in women and children.

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,050
You get why this is so important?

328
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,230
Hi, my name is Laurel, I'm an alcoholic.

329
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,590
Hi, Laurel.

330
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,280
A week ago, I...

331
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,460
something happened.

332
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,310
Something that I can't share with anyone

333
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,990
for several complicated reasons.

334
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,180
I thought that I was going to want to drink,

335
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,450
but I didn't.

336
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,170
Not even tempted, really.

337
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,020
But what I am is,

338
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,250
is I'm angry.

339
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,790
And I don't know what to do with it

340
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,010
or--or where to put it. I just...

341
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,060
thank you for letting me share.

342
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,820
Are there any other burning desires?

343
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,510
Erica. Alcoholic.

344
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,840
Hi, Erica.

345
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,150
My boyfriend and me

346
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,860
got into another fight last night.

347
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,660
Some of you know, he still drinks, a lot.

348
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,620
And I said something.

349
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,500
I know I should have just kept my mouth shut.

350
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,110
I know I should just leave him, but...I can't.

351
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,880
Maybe there's a meeting

352
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,510
I should be going to for that.

353
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,440
Once a month, Erica gives a share like that

354
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,310
- and it's getting worse. - Yeah.

355
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,510
Do you know the boyfriend has

356
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,070
eight assault charges against him?

357
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,170
And not just in Starling.

358
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,360
He's got warrants out on him

359
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,430
as far off as coast city.

360
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,110
And it takes everything in me not to go after

361
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,830
a dirtbag like that, but the day the cops

362
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,980
start bringing their badges into AA meetings,

363
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,220
that's the day that the drunks stop coming.

364
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,460
I'm in position.

365
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,000
The sale of the Actual is going down here.

366
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,450
Only two of us. You sure you don’t want to call for back up?

367
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,410
That's the only insurance policy you're going to need.

368
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,520
They're here.

369
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,220
You're not worried about them seeing our ride?

370
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,100
How did you know the buy was happening?

371
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,470
I've been a station agent in Corto Maltese for three years now.

372
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,590
I got this third-world garbage dump wired.

373
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,480
What's wrong?

374
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,870
There's no buy, is there, Shaw?

375
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,550
Sorry for lyin' to you, John. Well, partially lyin'.

376
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,830
There is a buy going down,

377
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,260
just not till tomorrow.

378
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,250
I needed to get this first.

379
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,120
Thanks for helping me decode the Actual.

380
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,630
Diggle!

382
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,170
Should have got the heavy duty ones.

383
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,810
I like your hair.

384
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,240
What? Are you and my brother like travel buddies now?

385
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,310
No, we're just worried about you.

386
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,620
Oliver said you weren't going to come back, so...

387
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,630
I figured I'd come here and try to convince you to.

388
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,730
Well, you can't.

389
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,260
Look, I get it, you're hurt.

390
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,410
I lied to you,I lied right to your face.

391
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,020
But I-I need you to know that

392
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,950
when I said I wanted to leave Starling with you,

393
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,410
that wasn't a lie.

394
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,220
I didn't just leave because of you, Roy.

395
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,080
My mother lied to me, my brother.

396
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,770
I had to get away from Starling City and all the secrets.

397
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
And I found myself here.

398
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,980
Isn't it lonely here?

399
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,900
That's kind of what I like about it.

400
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,520
There's no one here who knows me

401
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,230
or thinks of me as Thea Queen

402
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,020
or Thea Merlyn.

403
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,940
No one who lies to me, or...

404
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,930
tries to protect me with secrets.

405
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,520
All I ever wanted was for you to be happy, Thea.

406
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm sorry I got in the way of that.

407
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,810
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

408
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,060
If being here instead of home makes you happy, then--

409
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,940
then you should stay.

410
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,360
Roy?

411
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,190
Are you OK?

412
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,400
You look a little tired.

413
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,590
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

414
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,590
You take care.

415
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,940
What do you mean?

416
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,940
It's not your fault, it's mine.

417
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,430
I thought I could do this differently,

418
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,690
but I can't.

419
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,390
I need to train you as I was trained.

420
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,260
Treat you as my student,

421
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,490
not my daughter.

422
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,600
What are you doing?!

423
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,920
The only way to forge steel is to temper it with fire.

424
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,710
Stay away from me, you sick son of a bitch!

425
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,230
Now we can begin.

426
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,590
Why didn't you call me sooner?

427
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,610
I could have helped.

428
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,590
I didn't want you to worry, Lyla.

429
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,060
Besides, I thought we could handle it.

430
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,390
Well, we've hacked his email traffic.

431
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,340
He's got a buyer en route to Corto Maltese.

432
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,980
Who?

433
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,990
The tech boys are still working on that.

434
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,350
But Waller's dispatched a wet team to your position.

435
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,050
They're not going to get here in time.

436
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,800
They might. Keep your powder dry.

437
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,130
Copy that.

438
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,700
We're not going to keep our powder dry.

439
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,780
Hell no.

440
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,540
Any luck raising our digital Lazarus from the dead?

441
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,100
The hard drive is toast.

442
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,650
And the power supply.

443
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,540
And the actuator.

444
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm sensing a pattern.

445
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,770
Sorry, one second.

446
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,400
- Hello? - Hey, Felicity, this is John.

447
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,150
Where are you?

448
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,360
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

449
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,010
- Are you near a computer? - Kind of.

450
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm looking for somebody in Corto Maltese.

451
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,350
I'm actually a little bit in the middle of a...

452
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,320
I need to know where he is.

453
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,020
I've emailed you everything I have on him.

454
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,990
meeting right now.

455
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,490
I am so sorry. It's a friend.

456
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,380
Well, a few friends...

457
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,880
Actually. You know what, it's a long story.

458
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,590
Why am I under the impression that

459
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,930
you have a lot of stories,

460
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,240
All of which are long?

461
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,200
You want me to come back later?

462
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,740
What? Sorry.

463
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,650
Hello?

464
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,440
Felicity, I need a favor.

465
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,790
Are we favor friends now?

466
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,960
- Are we friends? - What?

467
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,110
Never mind, sorry.

468
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,830
Oh, dear god. One second.

469
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,000
One more second.

470
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,880
Hello?

471
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,090
We got cut off.

472
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,110
According to the file you sent me,

473
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,790
this guy is somewhat of a hacker.

474
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,770
Let me guess--long story?

475
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,090
Yeah, the guy I'm looking for broke into A.R.G.U.S's system.

476
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,980
And he left a trail. It's faint--hacking-wise--

477
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,270
But with a little bit of luck, I will find him,

478
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,540
or his laptop.

479
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,300
I will email you when I have something.

480
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,390
I'm having a bit of a day.

481
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,440
I need you to help me find someone

482
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,120
by googling his phone or something.

483
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,910
Pinging his gps.

484
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,930
Can I call you back?

485
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,890
Is this what a typical day looks like for you?

486
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,260
Believe it or not, this is better than most.

487
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,730
When Felicity has Shaw's location,

488
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,820
I want you to text me and I'll be there.

489
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,700
- With Thea? - Yeah.

490
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,320
Oliver, I don't think she's going to change her mind on this.

491
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,780
She doesn't want to hear from anyone, and I don't blame her.

492
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,280
I mean, we both lied to her.

493
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,790
A lot.

494
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,550
I know, it's why it's time to tell her the truth.

495
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,280
Oliver, when you say "the truth"...

496
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,910
What happened the five years I was away,

497
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,080
everything we've done since I've been back,

498
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,580
all of it.

499
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,240
Well, you might want to think about that for a second.

500
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,640
Lies are what drove Thea away from Starling city In the first place.

501
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,470
The truth is the only thing that's going to bring her back.

502
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,780
Except you won't be telling her the truth, will you?

503
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,590
You'll be telling her that

504
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,380
her brother has been lying to her to her face,

505
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,050
with almost pathological sincerity for the past two years.

506
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,830
She won't believe another word you say.

507
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,010
And you will lose her, Oliver, forever.

508
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,290
Well, look around.

509
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,170
I've already lost her.

510
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,170
I don't have any other choice.

511
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,660
I hear you like to hit women.

512
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,950
How about one who likes to hit back?

513
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,140
You're right. It's better when they hit back.

514
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,810
Baby, baby, are you ok?

515
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm so sorry.

516
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm too relieved to be mad at you, I really am.

517
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,780
But, sweetheart...

518
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,540
This is crazy.

519
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,630
What the hell were you thinking after that girl's boyfriend?

520
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,800
There's just something I needed to work out.

521
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,710
I know that the world isn't fair.

522
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,670
I know that it's a terrible place where...

523
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,060
where people deserve to get punished...

524
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,810
and they don't.

525
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,470
I just...

526
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,890
for one night,

527
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,910
I needed the world to be different.

528
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,740
Ok, Laurel, Laurel...

529
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,960
What's going on with you, huh?

530
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,870
You're not being yourself lately.

531
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,020
And now you're running around, you're tuning this guy up.

532
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,250
What are you doin'?!

533
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
Baby, you can talk to me about anything.

534
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,350
You know that, right? You know that.

535
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,500
I know.

536
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,920
Talk to me, then.

537
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,050
Laurel, you're not the Arrow.

538
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,580
Or your sister.

539
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,260
You promise me you'll never do anything like this again, ever!

540
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,300
I promise.

541
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
It was a mistake; I wasn't thinking.

542
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,190
If you want to stay in Corto Maltese, it's fine,

543
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,280
but there's not much here in the way of sightseeing.

544
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,460
I need to talk to you.

545
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,400
Look, between you and your new best friend Roy,

546
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,580
I'm pretty sure you guys have said everything.

547
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,720
I haven't.

548
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,330
Not yet, anyway.

549
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,260
Roy showed me the note you left him.

550
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,630
And you were right about everything.

551
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,470
I have lied, I have kept secrets.

552
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,810
The truth is that

553
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,150
if I tell you...

554
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,960
all the things that you don't know about me,

555
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,110
that I might lose you forever.

556
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,630
I spent five years in the worst kind of hell,

557
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,010
and there were things that happened,

558
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,660
there were things that I did...

559
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,290
that if--

560
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,510
if you knew,

561
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,160
you would see me differently.

562
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,020
No, I'll always see you as my big brother.

563
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,770
I mean, no matter what happened to you on that island,

564
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,370
or who you became,

565
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,010
It's the secrets you kept about my own life.

566
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,790
I mean, you lied to me

567
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,580
about who my father was.

568
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,450
Malcolm may have been your blood.

569
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,400
Robert was your father.

570
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,140
I lied to you about him, too.

571
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,640
Dad wasn't the man we thought he was.

572
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,630
He was better.

573
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,110
And I've kept something from you because I just...

574
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,320
never wanted you to know.

575
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,730
Dad made it off "The Gambit" with me.

576
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,130
You told me he drowned.

577
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,940
We made it to a life boat together.

578
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,020
There wasn't enough food and water for both of us...

579
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,190
so he killed himself.

580
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,690
And that is one secret that I'm telling you now

581
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,990
because I need you to realize...

582
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,970
mom and dad,

583
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,240
they sacrificed themselves

584
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,970
so that we could live.

585
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,930
But if we're not together, then...

586
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,680
we're not even really alive.

587
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,670
You're my family.

588
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,400
And even if you don't need me...

589
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,770
I need you.

590
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,240
Please just consider what I'm saying.

591
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,910
He's here.

592
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,260
So's his buyer.

593
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,380
I was expecting Armitage.

594
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,460
This country's soil is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.

595
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,770
Do you have the item?

596
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,710
Where's the money?

597
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,940
And the transcoder?

599
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,140
We better go.

600
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,140
Where'd you get this?

601
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,640
Our hotel room.

602
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,740
Who are they?

603
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,890
Could be A.R.G.U.S.

604
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,410
That's not A.R.G.U.S.

605
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,650
Suelten sus armas!

606
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,870
Let's go.

607
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,450
Go!

608
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,300
A.R.G.U.S., they know we're here.

609
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,910
Which is why I got a bunch of renta-soldiers to secure the perimeter.

610
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,940
It's amazing how cheap you can buy an army for in this country.

611
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,580
- Diggle! - Behind you!

612
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,300
I never said I didn't know how to use a gun.

613
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,430
Lyla was your friend!

614
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,480
And you endangered her and her daughter for what,

615
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,720
for a lousy payday!

616
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,690
Not a payday. It's my ticket out.

617
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,810
- Of what? - A.R.G.U.S.!

618
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,780
You don't know the things Waller's made me do.

619
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,870
You don't know the things or person she turns you into.

620
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,800
That still gives you no right to put a bulls-eye on my family's back!

621
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,440
I had no choice.

622
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,540
But you do, John.

623
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,230
Tell Waller I died.

624
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Tell her you put a bullet in me.

625
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,750
If only.

626
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,390
I've been thinking.

627
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,870
I want to go home. To my brother.

628
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,160
And all his lies and secrets?

629
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,510
Maybe you haven't come as far as I thought.

630
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,270
Let me prove it to you.

631
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,250
Impressive.

632
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,980
I had a good teacher.

633
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,640
Looks like you're going home.

634
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,730
You let me win, didn't you?

635
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,040
I'll be seeing you soon.

636
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,220
Safe flight.

637
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,030
Thank you.

638
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,320
Thanks.

639
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,390
You OK?

640
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,700
She's not coming.

641
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,620
I'm sorry, Oliver.

642
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,360
You did everything you could, man.

643
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,080
Oliver...

644
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,790
I'm glad you changed your mind.

645
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,260
Still not sure about flying commercial, though.

646
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,990
I'm so sorry.

647
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,130
Thea, are you OK?

648
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,080
Yeah. I'm fine.

649
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,590
Laurel?

650
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,270
I didn't know the Arrow took vacations.

651
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,780
Hey! What happened?

652
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,810
I'm fine. Please.

653
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,980
What happened?

654
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,900
I tried to do good.

655
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,960
- It didn't work out. - Oh, Laurel.

656
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,690
I know that it probably sounds insane.

657
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,790
It probably is, but...

658
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,940
Sara.

659
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,810
She gave me this.

660
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,880
And when I wear it,

661
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,130
it makes me want to help people like she did.

662
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,160
Like she's alive again.

663
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,220
I get it.

664
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,180
Sara had training.

665
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,420
She had years--

666
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,710
Oliver, I know.

667
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,520
Which is why I need to start,

668
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,960
and I need your help.

669
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,270
No.

670
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,910
- Oliver! - No!

671
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,070
No.

672
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,920
I...

673
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,380
I want you to consider

674
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,990
what would happen to your father

675
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,150
if something happened to you.

676
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,830
Oliver, ever sense it happened,

677
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,030
I have had this fire inside of me

678
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,210
that I can't get rid of with booze or pills.

679
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,980
I need another way!

680
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,630
And the other night, even though it went wrong

681
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,740
it was the first time since Sara died

682
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,730
where I haven't felt that fire.

683
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm sorry, but I can't.

684
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,800
And even if I could,

685
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,670
Sara would never forgive me.

686
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,170
There we go.

687
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,510
Yeah, there we go.

688
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,510
I love you. I love you both.

689
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,440
The two of you were all I could think about.

690
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,780
I'm just trying to put her down.

691
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,370
That's OK, I just want to look at her for a while.

692
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,810
OK.

693
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,100
I have to head into the office.

694
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,300
So late?

695
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,810
I do whatever Amanda Waller asks, remember?

696
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,540
You OK?

697
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,070
Yeah. Just hurry back.

698
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,290
What's with this guy?

699
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,580
Outstanding warrants for assault and battery in Coast City.

700
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,050
Got an anonymous tip he was in Starling.

701
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,640
Anonymous tip, huh?

702
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,280
That's a bad break, buddy.

703
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,620
All right. When can I start?

704
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,950
Do you know how many of QC's techs

705
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,960
said this data was unrecoverable?

706
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,220
Only all of them.

707
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,630
Seems like this would be a good time to ask for a few days off, then.

708
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,180
You just started.

709
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,190
I know. But...

710
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,120
My friend was struck by lightning and is in a coma.

711
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,190
Well, was.

712
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,720
I don't know. Um, it's--

713
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,020
A long story.

714
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,590
See ya.

715
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Thanks.

716
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,840
You did good over there.

717
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,090
I had a good teacher.

718
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,690
A judgmental, occasionally temperamental one,

719
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,750
but...

720
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,250
Those are the best kind.

721
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,980
Did Thea seem... different to you?

722
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,520
Her hair's a lot shorter.

723
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,630
But that's not what you mean.

724
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
What do you mean?

725
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,660
I don't know.

726
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,530
She say anything? She may be...

727
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,870
seeing somebody in Corto Maltese, or...

728
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,620
If Thea was with anybody else,

729
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,550
I've... got a feeling I'd be the last one to know.

730
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,860
Where is she?

731
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,870
Where is Sara?
