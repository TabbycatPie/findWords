23
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,100
No mail. Again.

25
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,910
Hey, Portal, call Dad.

26

27

29
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,630
George, please!

30
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,750
Why are they still crying?

31
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,570
Do you think they know they're chubby?

32
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,970
It took us a while,

33
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,790
but we finally named our babies.

34
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,690
This is Poppy,

35
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,560
because that's my favorite flower.

36
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,700
And this is George,

37
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,710
because he came out looking curious.

38
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,310
You know, like Boy George.

40
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,390
Oh, hey, Portal, answer.

41
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,950
Hi, Alex!

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,730
How's my little ice queen?

43
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,220
Didn't love being called that in high school,

44
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,230
don't love it now.

45
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,360
Hey, honey. Um, people keep asking --

46
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,530
tell me again what you're doing?

47
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,190
Detecting the presence of neutrinos beneath the South Pole.

48
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,300
Yeah, you -- you can stop. I'm just gonna keep telling them

49
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,940
you're searching for the snow monster.

50
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,820
Seriously, Alex?

51
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,710
You can't come downstairs to talk to us?

52
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,250
I've been gone for a month.

53
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,420
Wait. So, that's my hair in the drain?

54
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,970
Honey, is everything okay?

55
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,480
You look a little sad.

56
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,350
Oh, no, no.

57
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,560
I was sad earlier, and my face froze that way.

58
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,780
But no regrets about

59
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,890
turning down that cushy tech job in L.A.

60
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,530
I mean, yeah, I miss Bill

61
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,100
and the safety of other women around,

62
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,400
but Grandpa was right.

63
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,990
This is the time of life to have an adventure.

64
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,980
Is this a bad time?

65
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,650
Oh, no. No, this is our new normal.

66
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,270
- Yeah. ‭ - We never sleep.

67
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,060
Well, I know all about sleep deprivation.

68
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,200
The sun never sets here,

69
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,970
- so I've been up for days. - Yeah, that's fun.

70
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,830
- Really nice, honey. - I dream awake now.

71
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,020
Hang on a second. Haley.

72
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,200
Haley, I know that you are committed to breastfeeding

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,500
and the book,

74
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,830
but I think it's time that you considered formula.

75
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,610
It will help the babies sleep,

76
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,060
and the pediatrician said it is perfectly healthy.

77
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,790
I'm living proof. I was a formula baby --

78
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,750
- had a full set of teeth at six months. - Yeah.

79
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,870
But the book says --

80
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,160
Uch, the book.

81
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,140
What do you have against my book?

82
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,780
It is called "Your Parents Did Everything Wrong."

83
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,900
Dr. Goode is a celebrated pediatric life coach.

84
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,780
And can you tone down the negativity?

85
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,330
Chapter six says that it can cause an allergy to peanuts.

86
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, man, no kid should grow up without Snoopy.

88
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,570
Sounds like a crazy morning.

89
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,650
I miss those.

90
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,870
My research partner, Yngvar, doesn't speak English.

91
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,230
Is me who did that?

92
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,750
Except for what he learned from reruns of "Family Matters."

93
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,660
Guys!

94
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,610
So that can be a little annoying

95
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,530
having a research partner not speak your language,

96
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,200
but I could also try and learn his language,

97
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,980
which I have.

98
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,760
Wake them, and I kill you.

99
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,560
‭More Spanish.

100
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,980
If this is role-playing,

101
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,410
I'd like to play the part of disgusted son.

102
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,430
I'm making a promo video for my dog-bed company.

103
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,170
And Stella's the star, of course.

104
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,260
Today we're recording her voice.

105
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,470
And I am doing the Spanish version.

106
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,540
Who's directing it?

107
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,770
I don't know. Me, I guess.

108
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,510
Wow, that's a punch in the gut.

109
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,420
Why, Manny? Do you want to direct it?

110
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,190
Why not?

111
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,670
Some of our best artists started out making commercials.

112
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,610
Am I better than Spike Jonze or Guillermo del Toro?

113
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,680
Nope.

114
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,290
Listen, normally I would just

115
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,600
cook up some fake reason why you couldn't direct it,

116
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,720
but in this case, I have a real excuse.

117
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,780
Your old girlfriend, Sherry,

118
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,580
is the voice of Stella.

119
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,170
Jay, how could you?

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,560
After she broke his heart when she got repulsed

121
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,530
by the idea of getting married to him?

122
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,140
More overwhelmed than repulsed,

123
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,100
as I remember it.

124
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
She's already on our website

125
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,550
as Stella's voice.

126
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,830
Changing that now

127
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,690
could be jarring for our fans.

128
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,320
Like when they made

129
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,080
my GPS lady British.

130
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,220
I'd rather be lost

131
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,190
than talked down to by a snob!

132
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,070
Please, Jay.

133
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,300
I need to prove to myself that I'm over her,

134
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,340
that I can rise above it and be professional.

135
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,480
Fine, but if your emotions

136
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,890
get in the way of this production,

137
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,980
you will never work in dog-bed commercials again.

138
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,890
Don't worry.

139
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,780
My only passion

140
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,310
is helping you realize your creative vision.

141
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,260
By day's end, Sherry will be mine.

142
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,250
Oh, no, which icon's birthday

143
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,470
are we celebrating today?

144
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,470
Uh, Lauren Bacall's.

145
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,190
We're dropping tulips by her grave later,

146
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,310
but that's not what this is.

147
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,390
No, I'm having some at-risk students over.

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,540
- Why, you ask? - ‭I'm good.

149
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,170
Well, 'cause I want to bond with these kids.

150
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,820
I want them to know that even though

151
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,980
the rest of the world's given up on them,

152
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,700
I haven't.

153
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,650
I don't want to just be their Vice Principal.

154
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,420
I want to be their nice principal.

155
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,750
I can't believe you let this happen.

156
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,050
I didn't know there'd be wordplay.

157
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,940
Cam asked me to speak to his students as an Assistant DA,

158
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,620
give them the perspective of law enforcement.

159
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,710
Truth is, I have been looking for an opportunity

160
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,320
to show off my new badge.

161
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,810
Even the most hardened criminals

162
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,350
shudder when they get a gander at --

163
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,660
Please don't be scratched!

164
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,600
♪ With a banjo on my knee ♪

165
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,030
I don't care what these kids did.

166
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,430
- This is cruel. ‭- I know.

167
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,000
A vice principal that plays rock 'n' roll.

168
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,230
Am I a little different? Yes, I am.

169
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm not like the other adults in your life

170
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,860
that are just waiting for you to mess up

171
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,260
so they can point the finger at you.

172
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't want to finger a bunch of kids.

173
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,300
That's not how I get my jollies.

174
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,270
Cam. Cam.

175
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,180
I know what it's like.

176
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,800
I had issues in school,

177
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,620
and I was fingered left and right.

178
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,930
And let me tell you, it did not feel good.

179
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,790
Oh, Mitchell, should we be recording this?

180
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,750
Oh, yes, no one's gonna believe me.

181
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,380
How long is this gonna take, Mr. Tucker?

182
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh, now, Mr. Tucker's the cool vice principal at school.

183
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,680
Here at my house

184
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,240
call me Cam.

185
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,150
Okay?

186
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,290
And this is Mitchell.

187
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,680
He's an Assistant District Attorney,

188
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,650
and he is our guest speaker.

189
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,110
He's so white he's see-through.

190
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,220
Thank you.

191
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,440
We live in a society bound by laws.

192
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay?

193
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,730
They're all that stand between order and chaos.

194
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,290
And those who violate those laws

195
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,440
wind up staring at the business end of --

196
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,860
It's gone!

197
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,310
What, the spotlight on you?

198
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,010
No, my porcelain clown figurine.

199
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,090
It's supposed to be on this table.

200
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,270
It's always on this table.

201
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,910
One of you stole it!

202
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,690
And on Lauren Bacall's birthday?

203
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,920
Cam. Cam. R-Relax.

204
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,420
Uh, isn't the whole point of today not to prejudge them?

205
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,900
Oh, please, Mitchell. They're trash.

206
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,610
I know it. They know it.

207
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,340

Still crying.

220
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,690
You didn't make eye contact, did you?

221
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,180
That can't be a thing, Phil.

222
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,440
And I'm getting a little sick

223
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,130
of Haley insinuating that we don't know how to raise kids.

224
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,410
She can't be saying that about me.

225
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,410
I spent half my 30s in blanket forts with those kids.

226
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,300
You know what?

227
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,400
You need to get her to go to sleep

228
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,250
so I can put those babies down the right way.

229
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,170
Our way.

230
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,420
She's crazed right now. How am I supposed to get her to sleep?

231
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,370
I don't know. How did you do it when she was a kid?

232
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,040
Dad, isn't the drugstore that way?

233
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,770
It is, but there's construction,

234
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,490
so I got to -- got to go around.

235
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,240
Is it warm in here?

236
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,300
I feel fine.

237
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,730
You know, uh, I just discovered this new station

238
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,170
called "Winds of the World."

239
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,970
Ooh, this is -- this is a good one.

240
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,520
If you close your eyes,

241
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,260
it feels like you're right there in, um...

242
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,370
"Open Prairie."

243
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,930
Try it. You should get some rest back there.

244
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm not sleepy.

245
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,760
Well, you don't have to sleep.

246
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,180
Just, uh -- Just rest your eyes.

247
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,670
Uch. I don't wanna.

248
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,080
You are just grumpy 'cause you're overtired.

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,820
Stop saying I'm tired!

250
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,080
Okay.

251
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,840
I know.

252
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,590
Let's make a list

253
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,780
of all the things we want to do tomorrow.

254
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,460
I am, uh -- I'm gonna have some waffles,

255
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,900
uh, go outside,

256
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,330
uh, make a list of all my friends' names.

257
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,620
There's, uh, the mailman...

258
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,540
the lady with the ice cream...house...

259
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,530
Cuando te acuestas en una cama de perro por Stella,

260
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,000
sabes que eres amado.

261
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,360
It's perfect, honey. We got it.

262
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,990
She's never gonna get there.

263
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,780
I'll ask one of the nannies in the park to do it

264
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,910
next time I take Joe.

265
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,910
They love me.

266
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,630
I can never get out of there without a bag of tamales.

267
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,280
Well, there's our star!

268
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,430
Hey, Jay. Love the script, so fun!

269
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,510
Manny.

270
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,950
I didn't know you'd be here.

271
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,130
I'm your director.

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,610
No reason it has to be awkward.

273
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,810
As long as you do everything I say

274
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,200
between "Action" and "Cut."

275
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Speaking of which,

276
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,640
I've been getting quite a bit of action.

277
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,040
And cut. Look, I'm renting this joint by the hour.

278
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,260
Can we just do this?

279
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,740
Hi, Gloria.

280
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,940
Hi, Sherry. Break your legs.

281
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,150
Okay, Sherry, whenever you're ready.

282
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,500
Boy, am I tired after a day of playing fetch, digging,

283
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,600
and sniffing other dogs at the park.

284
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,880
If only there were an American-made bed...

285
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,780
Ugh, I'm so sorry. That was terrible.

286
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,310
Manny, can we start over?

287
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,690
I never stopped..

288
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,220
You mean the commercial. Yes.

289
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,040
Although, that was exquisite.

290
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,490
I believed that you're a dog.

291
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,990
It's Gloria.

292
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,970
And you, you're embarrassing yourself.

293
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,060
- What are you talking about? - ‭You're trying to win her back.

294
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,290
The unbuttoned shirt, the cologne,

295
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,140
the praising of her pedestrian performance.

296
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,930
- It's not gonna work, Manny. ‭- Why not?

297
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,670
Because if you want someone to like you,

298
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,910
you need to make them want your approval.

299
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,570
Mom, that's a tired, old way of thinking

300
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,510
that doesn't work.

301
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,550
Here you go.

302
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,950
What do you think is wrong with this?

303
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,640
Damn it, the lemon! I'm sorry, baby.

304
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,730
L-Let's start from the top.

305
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,500
And this time, not so slow.

306
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,430
Stronger.

307
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,200
Assert yourself, Manuel.

308
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,050
And I couldn't understand a word you were saying.

309
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,140
Try to get the marbles out of your mouth.

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
Oh, sorry.

311
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,990
Yeah, whatever you need.

312
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,650
Wow, maybe this could work.

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,350
While you're up, my shoulders are a little tight.

314
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,470
You mind getting in there?

315
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,780
I don't think you want my hands that close to your neck.

316
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,360
I invite you into my home,

317
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,150
and this is how you repay me?

318
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,820
Oh, I know what you were thinking.

319
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,510
"He'll never miss it. He lives like a king."

320
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,580
We didn't take your stupid clown!

321
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,360
Interesting you know it's a clown, Suzie!

322
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,530
You said it three times, Cameron.

323
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,860
It's Vice Principal Tucker!

324
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,260
Show some respect. I'm not your mom's pimp.

325
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,130
Okay, Cam.

326
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,930
Cam, I-I know you like your tchotchkes,

327
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,080
but aren't these kids here so you can bond?

328
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,450
Hey, Alex. Everything okay?

329
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,250
Yeah, yeah. I-I'm probably overreacting.

330
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,440
It's just I tried to make friends with one of the scientists,

331
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
but there's a language gap.

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,020
He misunderstood and kissed me.

333
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,070
So it's a little awkward now.

334
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,830
Uh-huh, that sounds fun.

335
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,580
What?! It's not.

336
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,890
I kind of want to come home,

337
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,430
but Grandpa was so excited about me doing this,

338
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,470
and I don't want to disappoint him.

339
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,490
Hey, you've disappointed him a lot.

340
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,340
What was that like?

341
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,570
Ohh, Alex, I struggled with this for years,

342
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,020
but I-I finally learned

343
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,430
that the most important thing is --

344
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,820
Hey, Alex! Say "Hi" to Santa Claus.

345
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,050
- Bye! - ‭I'm at the South Po-

346
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,920
Okay. Alright, I've decided what I'm gonna do.

347
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,130
I'm gonna turn the heat up on one of the kids.

348
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,000
If they did it, they'll confess.

349
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,570
If not, the actual criminal...

350
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,140
will feel guilty and step forward.

351
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,880
So, this is gonna be our whole Saturday?

352
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,620
Okay.

353
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,380
Why-Why did we even buy bikes?

354
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,050
You took his stupid, little clown, didn't you?

355
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,640
I find it sad that your generation

356
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,550
is so damaged and cynical.

357
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,020
It happened a few days ago.

358
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,920
I hated that thing.

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,860
It had to go.

360
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,540
I mean, that's how collections start.

361
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,940
I wasn't crazy about the cat cozy, either.

362
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,300
But I never intended

363
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,200
for Cam to blame it on one of those poor kids.

364
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,470
I mean, I was just gonna pin it on the cleaning lady.

365
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,810
Where's it at, Wonderbread?!

366
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,680
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about,

367
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,870
Mr. Tucker. I-I swear.

368
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,900
Okay. Okay.

369
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,730
Let's just, uh -- Let's all take a breath

370
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,870
and just remember some of the basics of the law, okay?

371
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,130
We're all innocent until proven guilty.

372
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,890
Take it from someone who is packing one of --

373
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,770
oh, dang it. Ooh, I left it in the kitchen.

374
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,010
Okay, stay right there.

375
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,080
- This is lame. Let's bounce. - Okay, no.

376
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,060
No one is bouncing until I get my figurine.

377
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,430
But I have to get home soon.

378
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,320
I've read your file, Belinda.

379
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,460
No one knows or cares where you are.

380
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,580
And...

381
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,160
done!

382
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,170
Oh, why?! Why?!

383
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,880
What is going on?

384
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,360
How are they still awake?

385
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,530
I tried the vacuum. I tried formula.

386
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,730
I tried everything.

387
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,620
Not quite.

388
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,950
It is time to break out...

389
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,040
the big guns.

390
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,170
I know Haley banned pacifiers,

391
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,800
but I bought these

392
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,730
when I thought she was gonna be a fun mom.

393
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,920
Let's do it.

394
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,650
Look at that.

395
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,000
It's working already.

396
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,650
Old-school parenting for the win.

397
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,750
They'll be asleep in no time,

398
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,970
unless they see each other.

399
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,230
- Then they won't be able to stop laughing. ‭- Yes.

400
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,670
What the hell?

401
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,790
Formula? Pacifiers?

402
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,090
Are you kidding me?!

403
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,800
This is a very weird way of saying, "Thank you, Mother,

404
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,570
for settling down my babies.

405
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,580
I have a lot to learn from you."

406
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,860
You ignored everything I asked of you!

407
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,910
Haley, don't be so hard on your mom.

408
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,770
Ohh, you!

409
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,550
Those pacifiers have you written all over them.

410
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,290
Babies aren't supposed to smoke!

411
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,890
How could you sneak behind my back like that?

412
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,380
Honey, we were just trying to help.

413
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,240
Well, you didn't.

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,460
The book says 85% of pacifier users

415
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,070
grow up to be cat people.

416
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,150
I can't believe I'm saying this, but you need to stop reading.

417
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,180
And do what?

418
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,410
Do what? Rely on my instincts?

419
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,640
I don't have any. That is the problem!

420
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,220
Honey, everybody has instincts.

421
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,080
Oh, do I?

422
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,820
Because I keep waiting for them to kick in,

423
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,660
and they haven't.

424
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,360
And I don't think that they ever will.

425
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,400
I just -- Maybe I'm just not meant to be a mom.

426
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,490
Sweetie, of course you're meant to be a mom.

427
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,470
Listen, it is normal to feel overwhelmed. Really.

428
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,670
It -- The best parents are the ones who worry

429
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,710
they're doing it wrong.

430
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,410
Same goes for lovers.

431
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,340
Wait, are the babies still on the couch?

432
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,950
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.

433
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,400
It's locked. Babies start rolling over at this age.

434
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,140
Oh. ‭Do you have a key?

435
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,770
Uh, it's inside, but I hid one out here years ago.

436
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,490
It's in, um...

437
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,770
It's in a fake rock.

438
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,980
Can't -- Can't find it.

439
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,170
It's -- It's too realistic.

440
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,490
Why did I spring for the good one?

441
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,690
I have to get in there.

442
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,760
Haley! Haley, what are you doing?!

443
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,110
Honey. Honey, be careful.

444
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,860
It's impossible not to fall off of that roof!

445
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,150
Poppy! George! Mommy's coming!

446
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,820
Those sure look like mom instincts to me!

447
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,180
You're a natural!

448
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,780
Now we know how she used to sneak in after curfew.

449
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,150
And who's hanging the Christmas lights this year.

450
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
- Yeah. ‭- Babies are up.

451
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,230
Somebody gonna take care of that?

452
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,700
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

453
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
you know you're loved.

454
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,020
Was that any better?

455
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,540
Where to begin, where to begin...

456
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,770
You've met a dog, right?

457
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,850
Yes.

458
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,280
And I know you've felt loved before.

459
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,110
So let's link those two ideas and try to get it this time.

460
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,660
Can I get some water first?

461
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,690
I suppose.

462
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,470
You should make her drink it out of a dog bowl.

463
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,820
That seems over-the-line, but you were right.

464
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,900
This is working.

465
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,180
Hey, Alex. Kinda in the middle of something.

466
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,260
Okay. It's just that things are spiraling

467
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,310
a little bit down here.

468
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,140
This guy, Yngvar, keeps trying to woo me

469
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,340
with things he's killed.

470
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,430
Another fish. Thanks.

471
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,790
I'll...put it with the others.

472
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,980
We're still at this? Meter's running.

473
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,350
And...action.

474
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,220
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

475
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,740
you know you're loved.

476
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,230
Wow.

477
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,030
You have her right where you want her.

478
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,610
Now, go in there, give her a little praise,

479
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,820
and then reel her in.

480
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,040
It won't be hard.

481
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,340
This is her best performance

482
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,540
since that improv audience suggested "Jackee O."

483
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,980
Yngvar does seem sweet.

484
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,500
I read the suicide rate here has plateaued.

485
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,370
Okay, that's enough. Wrap it up, kid.

486
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,170
Time to go home.

487
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,670
Oh. Thank you.

488
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,250
This has not been working out.

489
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,210
I mean, I just needed your permission to admit it

490
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,570
because part of me came down here to impress you.

491
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,530
See you soon, Grandpa. Love you.

492
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,430
So?

493
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,660
That was really good.

494
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,830
Oh, thank God.

495
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,390
I mean, it's all you.

496
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,610
I've never had a director with such a sure hand.

497
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,840
It's so electric.

498
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,480
It is, isn't it?

499
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,500
What do you say we get a drink, Brown Eyes?

500
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,730
It was all happening.

501
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,530
I was on the brink of a directorial masterpiece.

502
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,010
This was the kind of thing that could launch me

503
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,990
straight into an unpaid internship.

504
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,520
Let's put a pin in that drink.

505
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,140
I wanna go again.

506
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,930
It took 63 more takes, but I got it.

507
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,600
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

508
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,320
you know you're loved.

509
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,890
You're a purebred. Stop acting like a mutt.

510
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,750
Again!

511
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,680
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

512
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,460
you know you're loved.

513
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,130
There's pain behind this.

514
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,090
They spayed you without your permission!

515
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,960
It's your body! Who decided?! Again!

516
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,660
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

517
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,360
you know you're loved.

518
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,510
- Again! ‭- When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

519
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,140
you know you're loved.

520
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,800
And cut! We're good in here.

521
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,130
Anything you wanna try?

522
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,610
Not with you!

523
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,240
Garbage. That's what I'm looking at here.

524
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,800
Human garbage.

525
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, you're right.

526
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,480
It's just like my mom says -- I'm nothin'.

527
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,300
I'm gonna join a gang, get a face tattoo.

528
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm gonna sell my hair for nose drugs.

529
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,030
No, okay, stop! I-I can't take it anymore.

530
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm sorry. I threw away the statue.

531
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,680
It was -- It was just so tacky.

532
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,560
You guys, please don't give up on yourselves, okay?

533
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,870
You have very bright futures.

534
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
Yeah, you're right.

535
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,690
They sure do... in theater.

536
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,720
Because this is the theater group from school,

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,150
The Emotivations!

538
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
Bravo! Brava!

539
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,190
I found this in the trash the other day.

540
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,750
I knew you put it there and wouldn't admit it.

541
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,390
So I brought some very talented young thespians over

542
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,830
to portray at-risk youth.

543
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,560
He got you, girl!

544
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,760
You know, I said I wanted to bond with these kids,

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,860
and I sure did.

546
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,650
We had some hard-core bondage.

547
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,180
You're gonna get fired.

548
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,310
This bed feels good on my weary bones.

549
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,480
Mmm!

550
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,270
Bones.

551
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,820
- I'm gonna need money for reshoots. - Not gonna happen.

552
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,680
Sometimes in life, you've got to know when to call it quits.

553
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,330
It's not always easy.

554
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,810
It takes a lot of courage to admit your mistakes.

555
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,430
The only thing you can do is try to learn from them

556
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,170
and keep moving forward.

557
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,460
Anyways, the helicopter will be here soon.

558
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,160
So, I guess this is goodbye.

561
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,160
I'll miss you, too.

562
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,630
Do you hear that?

563
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,910
There is no sound better than babies not crying.

564
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,210
‭Mm, we're gonna get so much sleep.

565
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,700
Or...

566
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,450
Again?

567
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,130
I just feel like I could do better.

568
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,470
Oh, you were fine.

569
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,510
Really? 

570
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,590
Yes!

571
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,960
Mm. Good night.

572
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,950
Good night.

573
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,300
What?! What is that?! What is it?!

574
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,900
Haley! What are you doing?!

575
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,260
I locked myself out again.

576
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,490
Great. Thanks for screaming.

577
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,990
Well... as long as we're both awake...
