<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:07,040
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:10,811
<i>but secretly, with the help of my friends</i>

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime</i>

7

<i>and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,484
<i>I hunted down the man who killed my mother,</i>

9
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>but in doing so, I opened up our world</i>

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,155
<i>to new threats,</i>

11
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:24,324
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

12
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,332
There is, indeed, a hole in our universe

15
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,069
which leads to his Earth.

16
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,089
Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

17
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think we've reached
the good-night kiss stage?

18
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:47,080
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,850
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

20
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,685
through the breaches to fight me.

21
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,554
Her name is Doctor Light.

22
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:54,588
Hello, gorgeous.

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,756
What do you want from me?

24
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,393
- Your life.
- [both grunt]

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,777
I saw myself.

26
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,947
Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

27
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,700
Where are you? [grunts]

28
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,702
I'm right here.

29
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,937
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

30
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,708
I'm here to kill you, Flash,
so get ready to fry.

31
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,410
[grunts]

32
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,461
Bring it on.

33
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,247
Hmm. [chuckles]

34
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,549
[both grunting]

35
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:40,067
Told you.

36
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,769
Zoom always wins.

_

39
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,200
Zoom sent me here to kill you,

40
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,369
but I didn't want to.

41
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,488
But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,958
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,710
Leave her body for Zoom to find,

44
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,846
he'd think I was dead, and I'd be free.

45
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,633
How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

46
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,135
Just let me go.

47
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,638
Let me disappear.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,889
You would spend the rest of your life

49
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,973
looking over your shoulder,

50
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,675
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

51
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:26,063
Okay. And what's your great idea?

52
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,481
How were you supposed to contact him

53
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,615
after you killed me?

54
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,017
I was supposed to get something...

55
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,203
something I could only get
if you were dead...

56
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,372
and then throw it
through the breach as proof.

57
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,074
- And then what?
- Then he'd come for me.

58
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,409
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

59
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,662
- Why do you want to know?
- Because I want to find him.

60
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,879
You really don't.

61
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,881
He's gonna keep coming for me.

62
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,667
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you,

63
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,919
forcing them to do what he wants.

64
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,222
I have to stop him before more people die.

65
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,891
- You can't stop Zoom.
- Yes, I can.

66
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,345
I will, but I need your help.

67
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,437
Zoom wants Doctor Light
to send him your new emblem.

68
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,155
Yes. We need it for bait.

69
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,375
If we can get Doctor Light
to take my emblem,

70
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,189
throw it through the breach,
then Zoom will come

71
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,224
to collect my body, and we can trap him.

72
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,309
You know it took a lot of work

73
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,860
to make that emblem, right?

74
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,729
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

75
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,197
in order to escape Zoom,

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,399
but now she's willing to help us catch him?

77
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,984
She knows it's the only way.

78
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,620
Before I left Earth-2,

79
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,189
I worked on a serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

80
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,907
All we would need is for Ramon

81
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,576
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

82
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,028
Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

83
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,413
Maybe another criminal can get it,

84
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,031
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

85
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,549
I would never let that happen.

86
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,301
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

87
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,254
Are we forgetting how much more powerful

88
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,505
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

89
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,391
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

90
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,843
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

91
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,230
Surprise... the element of surprise.

92
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,731
All we would do is rig a projectile

93
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,184
to fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

94
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,552
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

95
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,720
- That's great.
- Thanks.

96
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,106
Joe, voice of reason here?

97
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,076
We need a plan. That's as good as any.

98
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,411
As long as he can deliver.

99
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,528
Don't underestimate me, Detective.

100
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,863
[phone vibrates]

101
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,200
Oh, Patty needs us back at the station.

102
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,619
I'll meet you there, all right?

103
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,010
Are you just forgetting
everything Jay told us

104
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,294
and supporting Wells now?

105
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,929
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

106
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,514
I just want to see what he's up to.

107
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,466
I figure we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

108
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,718
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

109
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,688
Look, my hunch after interrogating suspects

110
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,109
all these years, something's
not right with this dude.

111
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,145
Barry told me about this thing you can do?

112
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,481
- Vibing.
- Oh, God, just relax.

113
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,950
Can you do it with Wells?

114
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,902
I can try.

115
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,544
<i>Incapable?</i>

116
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,329
<i>Well, let me tell you something.</i>

117
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,583
<i>If you are incapable
of aligning the quantum helix</i>

118
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,302
and, by the way, the sole purpose

119
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,087
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

120
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,255
could you save me some time and effort?

121
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,140
Could you go out there and find someone

122
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,478
who can actually do your job for you?

123
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,180
There it is.

124
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,983
Work voice.

125
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,668
When I was little and you used to bring me

126
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,869
to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

127
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,521
it used to freak me out

128
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,823
how differently you talked here
than when you were at home.

129
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,526
You and your mother both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

130
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,912
I graduated high school when I was 15, Dad.

131
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,997
- Right.
- Can miss a day of college.

132
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:38,368
Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick.

133
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,505
- So?
- So?

134
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,457
Is it true?

135
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,092
Is what true?

136
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,161
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference?

137
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:52,299
That your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

138
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,307
- It is... Jesse...
- Why didn't you just tell me?

139
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,890
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

140
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,493
is much faster at assigning blame

141
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,523
than he is at actual heroics.

142
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,725
- Dad, The Flash is a hero.
- Uh-huh.

143
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,061
Okay, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much,

144
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:13,331
but now I know it's because
he knew what you'd done.

145
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,866
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs

146
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,785
is change the world, Jesse,

147
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,871
unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

148
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:23,291
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

149
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:27,245
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

150
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,247
You should get to school.

151
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't worry. I got my education today.

152
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,094
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

153
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,118
[elevator bell dings]

154
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,769
- All right. Talk to you later.
- See you, Joe.

155
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,488
Great, you're here.

156
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,706
Good morning to you too, Patty.

157
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes, I was up all night

158
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,908
working on the Doctor Light case.

159
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,126
I... I've been trying to anticipate

160
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,627
all the powers she might throw our way,

161
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,829
you know, on the premise

162
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,380
that she can manipulate light energy.

163
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,998
- I appreciate it, but...
- Did you know

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,301
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

165
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,552
I mean, that doesn't even sound
like a thing, but it is.

166
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,137
Seriously, Patty...

167
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,222
No, and on the other end
of the spectrum is invisibility.

168
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,458
Look, it... it's just
hypothetical, but I think that...

169
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,262
The Doctor Light case is closed.

170
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh, uh, okay.

171
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,183
Can you tell me why?

172
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,801
No.

173
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,106
No?

174
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,691
- Okay.
- Hey.

175
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,025
- Hi!
- Are you good?

176
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

177
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,496
Your dad just shut me down in a big way.

178
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:37,365
- What do you mean?
- I... I don't know. It just...

179
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:42,787
You don't think it's because
you and I kissed?

180
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,922
Uh, no, I don't think he knows.

181
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,457
I didn't say anything,

182
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,875
but I can talk to him if you want.

183
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,326
No, no, no, I'll talk to him.

184
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,594
You know, he's my partner.

185
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,212
We should have trust and communication.

186
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,214
Are you sure? I don't mind
talking about that kiss.

187
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,466
It was a good kiss.

188
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah, yeah, although the memory...

189
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,722
it's a little foggy.

190
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,307
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,010
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

192
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,013
Okay.

193
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,207
- Hey.
- Hey.

194
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,742
Have you had any word from The Flash

195
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,329
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

196
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:27,999
No, not yet, but I know he's working on it.

197
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,918
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

198
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,170
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

199
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,055
Look, Larkin is dead,

200
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,723
which makes it really hard
for me to concentrate

201
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,875
on field goals and doping scandals.

202
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,677
I don't want to sit around
being told not to worry

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,146
my pretty little head about it.

204
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:44,048
I get that. Believe me, I do.

205
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,733
Then tell him I want to help.

206
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,153
Please, I can't let this woman
who looks like me

207
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,155
hurt anyone else.

208
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,157
I'll ask again.

209
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,110
But trust me, Flash has
everything under control.

210
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,952
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

211
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,370
Crap.

212
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,880
[breathing heavily]

213
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,593
Doctor Light's gone invisible.

214
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,645
Lock the doors.

215
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,481
Shut the doors!

216
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,650
The doors aren't responding.

217
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,069
None of the security protocols
are responding.

218
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,287
She's hacked the system.

219
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,272
Barry, Doctor Light is escaping.

220
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,745
Where is she?

221
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,188
Doctor Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

222
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,924
The whole building runs on fiber optics

223
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,842
that operate on pulses of light,

224
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,428
so she turned off the dampeners
and used her powers.

225
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,896
I told you how dangerous she was.

226
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,431
You should have listened to me
and sedated her.

227
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,166
I thought I had convinced
her that helping us

228
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,568
was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

229
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,602
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,187
Okay, look,

231
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,972
Doctor Light is gone,
so instead of assigning blame,

232
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,690
let's try to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

233
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,659
Do you think she's gonna try
and take Linda again?

234
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,327
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,

235
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,196
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

236
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,647
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

237
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,249
I think we isolated the composite.

238
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,533
And we're modifying the dart The Arrow used

239
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,785
to take down Wells.

240
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,320
He's not Wells. I'm Wells.

241
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,922
Whatever, Harry.

242
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,707
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

243
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,342
Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test,

244
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,460
so can we end
this scintillating staff meeting

245
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,045
and get back to work?

246
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,713
Or how about I say
what everybody's thinking?

247
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,432
Maybe it's a good thing
that Doctor Light is gone.

248
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe it's the universe stopping us

249
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,385
from doing something really stupid.

250
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,271
No. No. Keep going.

251
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,525
I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

252
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,527
Hey, slow your roll. I want to talk to you.

253
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,447
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

254
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,482
Okay, I don't, so why don't you clue me in?

255
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,984
I'm trying to stop Zoom.

256
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,184
I thought you were on board with that.

257
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,203
I'm keeping my options open.

258
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,289
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

259
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,957
Zoom wants me dead.

260
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,659
The meta-humans that
he's sending from Earth-2,

261
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,494
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

262
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,579
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

263
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,882
He was just collateral
damage in Zoom's war.

264
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,051
The next time, that could be you or Iris.

265
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,753
I'm just wondering if going
after him now is premature.

266
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,672
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

267
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,890
Wells does.

268
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,891
You're putting a whole lot of faith

269
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,975
in the man wearing the face

270
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,727
of your mother's killer.

271
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,346
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

272
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't want to help

273
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,600
get me killed, and we can't just sit around

274
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,602
and wait for Zoom
to make his next move anymore.

275
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,071
We can't.

276
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,272
Aren't you the one who told me

277
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,690
life isn't about playing defense,

278
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:41,941
sometimes the only way to succeed

279
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,359
is by working the offense?

280
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,577
I think at the time we were talking about

281
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,995
your high school football tryouts.

282
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,698
You said you'd never bring that up again.

283
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,674
Hey.

284
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,427
I just wanted to say using
the, uh, tungsten composite

285
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,464
to dampen vibrations, that was, uh...

286
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,799
that was pretty brilliant.

287
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,521
What are you doing?

288
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm congratulating you.

289
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,858
Don't touch me.

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,310
Wow, try to give a guy a compliment.

291
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,728
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

292
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,862
You're trying to meddle into things

293
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,147
that are none of your business.

294
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,648
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

295
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,118
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

296
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,403
God, why? What's there to vibe on?

297
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,326
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

298
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,912
Otherwise stay away from me.

299
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,421
So?

300
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,141
God, you'd think the serial killer version

301
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,926
would've been the bigger jerk.

302
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:50,977
What happened when you touched him?

303
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,095
What did you see?

304
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,229
Oh, I didn't see anything.

305
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,964
Go touch him again.

306
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,316
No, he's onto me now.

307
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,634
Well, you have to keep trying.

308
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,020
I mean, I think Joe's right.

309
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,607
Something must have happened
between Wells and Zoom,

310
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,243
made this personal.

311
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,246

312
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,202

I just... I saw on the news...

328
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,620
Just call me, all right?
Let me know that you're okay.

329
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,238
That you weren't...

[exhales]

337
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,587
No.

[exhales]

339
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,535
Joe... Detective...
can we talk for a minute?

340
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,070
If this is about Doctor Light...

341
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,005
No, yeah... No.

342
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,541
Uh, maybe, but okay, look.

343
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:46,909
I think I figured out why you've been

344
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,761
a bit shut down the last couple of days.

345
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,963
[chuckles] Really?

346
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,098
Yeah, I feel like you're not being

347
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,349
completely transparent with me,

348
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,768
but I think that it's my fault.

349
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,438
Look, you're a great...
excellent... wonderful detective,

350
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,274
and I think you can sense I'm not being

351
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,892
completely transparent with you.

352
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,527
And you're right. Look, we're partners.

00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,702
Okay.

00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:23,790
I think maybe the trigger
mechanisms are just sticking.

534
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,441
It's not the trigger mechanisms.

535
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:26,659
- I think...
- It's not the... don't, no...

536
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:27,660
It's just a little bit of oil.

clean this up really quick.

Why?

543
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,655
I don't know, I swear.

Your loyalty is admirable,

I'm sorry.

548
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:24,066
Joe, Doctor Light.

549
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,635
- I thought we settled that.
- No, we didn't.

550
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,853
She's still out there on the loose...

551
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,337
a meta-human who just murdered a man.

552
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,172
Why aren't we doing something about it?

553
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,357
Look, none of this makes any sense,

554
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,708
and you're not talking to me.

555
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,809
All right, all right, all right, look.

556
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,444
It's a bit complicated,

557
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:38,781
but we're not going after
Doctor Light right now.

558
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,783
I need you to trust me, Patty,

559
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:43,069
for a few days or so.

560
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,821
Are you somehow involved in this?

561
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:48,407
If you're asking if I'm dirty, no,

562
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,495
but I need some time
to take care of some things.

563
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,913
I trust you, I do.

564
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,549
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't.

565
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,217
This is about you not trusting me.

566
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:02,805
- Patty, I trust you.
- Not enough.

567
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:06,425
A few days.

568
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,982
- Hey.
- Hey.

569
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:14,400
Do you want to maybe grab dinner tonight?

570
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:16,018
I could use your opinion about something.

571
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,236
I can't tonight. I'm sorry.

572
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:18,321

- Sure.

573
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:20,573
I... I would. Joe and I actually...

574
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,693
Joe and I have a thing
that we've gotta do tonight.

575
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,244
Some other time.

576
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,780
I would much rather be
spending the evening with you.

577
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:32,335
Seriously, if I could cancel
these plans, I would.

578
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,921
Can we do dinner tomorrow?

579
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:36,071
Yeah, I would like that.

580
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,873
All right, I'll see you.

581
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,592
Good luck with your thing.

582
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,628
Thanks. I think I'll need it.

583
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,815

and no one can stop me!

How's that?

585
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:05,484
Uh, it's a little too much.

586
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,119
Uh, stop messing with the earpiece.

587
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:09,622
Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it.

588
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,940
Right, you... you told me that. I'm sorry.

No, no, you're doing great, Linda.

00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:19,498
All right, Doctor Light, here I am.

591
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,334
But we're gonna skip the part where you say

592
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:23,419
you're gonna kill me
and go right to the part

593
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,787
where I don't let you.

594
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,006
I'm here to kill you, Flash.

596
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,141
We're skipping that?

597

[whispering] Yes.

598

Next time we're doing this,

601
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:41,020
I'm writing better dialogue.

Here it is, Zoom, I did what you wanted.

615
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:39,245
Now bring me home.

616
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,663
Come on.

00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:08,922
Come on. Come on.

619
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,689
Come on, Zoom.

620
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:32,362
Hey, stop fidgeting.

621
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:33,847
Sorry, it's been an hour.

622
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,566
I landed in a ridiculous position,

623
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,401
and my foot fell asleep.

624
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:39,486
He's probably just waiting
to see if you're really dead.

625
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:42,322
Any minute now, he's gonna strike.

626
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,576
No.

627
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,750
Sorry, I probably screwed up somehow.

628
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,203
No, Linda, you did great.

629
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,540
Ugh.

630
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,730
So Wells ain't taking this well.

631
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,381
- Mm-hmm.
- How about you?

632
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,268
Yeah, it just sucks, you know.

633
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,520
You were right a little bit

634
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:15,572
about this not being just about Zoom...

635
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:18,775
about it being about the Reverse Flash.

636
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,060
Okay.

637
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,278
But not for the reason that you think,

638
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,080
not because I didn't beat him.

639
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:26,233
It's... Wells...

640
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:28,752
he said something to me on that video

641
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,420
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

642
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:34,208
He said that even if he was dead,

643
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,545
that he still won because I wasn't happy,

644
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:40,881
that I'd never really be happy.

645
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:42,382
How the hell would he know?

646
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,219
He knew me. He knows future me.

647
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,187
That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

648
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,890
I still think that Wells is right.

649
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,259
Ever since I went back to that night

650
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:54,094
and I didn't save her...
I didn't save my mom,

651
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:57,564
I just... there's just
been this void in me.

652
00:29:57,566 --> 00:30:02,936
You know, I just feel like that
is always gonna be there.

653
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:07,274
For better or worse, Wells... He knew me.

654
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:08,825
Better than I know you?

655
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:11,912
He may have stalked you
for 15 years, but I raised you.

656
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:15,582
Look, Wells said what he said
to you to mess with you...

657
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,084
to get in your head one last time.

658
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,670
If you listen to him, you let him win.

659
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,555
I know. I don't want that.

00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:24,508
You're responsible for your
own happiness, Barry.

661

Forget about Wells.

662
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:28,428
Think hard about what you want

663
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,931
and what makes you happy.

664
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:32,900
Go out and get it.

about what makes me happy,

00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,284
And we threw away the last one for nothing.

00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:07,721
You've been going over
this footage dozens of times.

712
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,789
Everything went exactly according to plan.

713
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,259
If it had, Zoom would have shown up.

714
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,677
Maybe Light was wrong.

715
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,128
Maybe he can't see through the breaches.

716
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,013
Or maybe he finally decided to give up.

00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,134
Hey.

719
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,135
Iris, slow down.

720
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,303

Zoom has Linda.

He's on the roof.

You need to get out of here, okay?

735
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,360
No, you can't fight that thing.

736
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:04,394
It's a monster.

737
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:06,480
Just go.

738
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,707
Zoom cannot be human.

739
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,626
He is... Or was.

740
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:35,130
How the hell is Barry
supposed to defeat that?

741
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:39,384
Why is he running away?

742
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,753
He's not. He's not scared.

743
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:49,710
Ooh, he's gonna thunderbolt him!

744
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,929
What?

745
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:54,149
Jay taught him how to throw lightning.

[groaning]

747
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:13,901
Did you guys see that?

748
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,787
See him catch a bolt of lightning

749
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,456
with his demonic claws? Yeah, saw that.

750
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:20,508
Jay was right. He cannot do this alone.

751
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,460
He's not alone.

752
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,912
<i>- Run, Barry.</i>
- No.

753
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,183
I'm gonna see if Wells'
speed-dampening serum works.

754
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,434
What do you want from me?

755
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,252
Everything.

00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,305
You want to be me? Is that it?

757
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,440
You want to be a hero?

758
00:35:35,442 --> 00:35:38,193
[chuckles] Heroes die.

759
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:41,279
Only if you can catch them.

761
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,375
How is Barry gonna match Zoom's speed?

762
00:35:54,377 --> 00:35:56,110
Genius. He's not gonna match it.

763
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,745
He's gonna take it out
of the equation altogether.

764
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:59,664
- What are you talking about?
- Terminal velocity.

765
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,133
The highest velocity attainable
by a falling object.

766
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,752
- Falling through the air?
- Yeah, freefall fight.

767
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,304
Their drag force equals
the downward force of gravity,

768
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,339
making the net force zero, making...

769
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,225
Equal velocities. That is genius.

with this?

You kill The Flash, and you
get your daughter back?

And none of these children are
safe as long as Zoom is here.
