1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,900
老天
Oh, God!

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,490
现在做这个有点太早了吧
It's a little early, isn't it?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,140
继续睡吧  我不需要你醒着才能做
Go back to sleep. I don't need you awake for this.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,730
亲爱的  今天是平安夜
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,250
你要一整天都耗在那玩意儿上吗
Are you gonna spend all day on that thing?

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,630
我发过誓了
I made a promise.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,300
没错
Yes!

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,300
去年圣诞节  菲尔买了一台椭圆健身机
Last Christmas, Phil got an elliptical machine

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,680
还发誓要在一年内走完
and vowed to walk the equivalent

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,240
相当于从我们家到加拿大的公里数
of our house to Canada in one year.

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,550
我这身材可不是说有就有的  女士们
This body doesn't just happen, ladies.

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,810
如果他做不到
If he didn't make it,

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,500
卧室里不准再放任何机器
no machine in the bedroom.

14
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,380
除了我这台机器  女士们
Except for this machine in the bedroom, ladies.

15
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,230
这些女士们到底是谁
Who are these ladies?

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,870
菲尔  放弃吧
Oh, Phil, give it up.

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,350
那你一定乐开花了吧
Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,510
我就快到达加拿大边境了
Just when I'm so close to the Canadian border,

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
都能闻到培根的香味
I can smell the bacon

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,070
还有定价合理的药品了
and the reasonably priced medications.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,860
老妈  这是外婆寄给你的
Mom, this came for you from nana.

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,550
不知道为什么她每年都要费劲包装一下
I don't know why she bothers to wrap it every year.

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,670
内容永远不变  拖鞋
It's always the same thing -- slippers.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,590
谁知道呢  说不定她今年会给你个惊喜
You never know. She might surprise you this year.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,010
你有没有兴趣
Would you care to take a visit

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,560
逛逛冷漠母亲博物馆
to the museum of maternal indifference?

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,440
小心点
Watch it!

28
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,650
小心
Oh, careful!

29
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,840
非要现在就搬到楼下吗
You guys are really moving her downstairs right now?

30
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,800
上班不会迟到吗
Aren't you gonna be late for work?

31
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,940
他们不会在圣诞前夕开除精灵的
They're not gonna fire an elf on Christmas Eve.

32
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,600
我以为不放鞋子  这柜子能轻点呢
Ugh, I thought this would be lighter without my shoes on it.

33
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,700
等你整理好房间
You know, once you set up your room,

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,960
可以放些书上去
you could put books on this.

35
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,110
鞋架上放书
Books...on a shoe shelf.

36
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,300
想什么呢
Right.

37
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,040
-你不反驳一下吗  -我太开心了
- You're not gonna jump on that? - I'm just too happy!

38
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,930
今天过后
After today,

39
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,130
我房间里就不会再有人到处乱扔衣服
there'll be no more clothes thrown everywhere,

40
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,500
不会有人打好几个小时的电话
no more hour-long phone calls

41
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,140
全程只会说"不可能"
where all she says is "No way."

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,530
你们决定今天分开住
I think it's a little sad

43
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,660
我觉得有点悲伤啊
that you guys are doing this today.

44
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,630
我记得你们以前总是
I remember when you used to get

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,530
在平安夜睡同一张床
into the same bed on Christmas Eve

46
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,080
然后一起聊你们将得到的礼物
and talk about all the presents you were gonna get.

47
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,510
今天搬再合适不过了
It's a perfect day for it!

48
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,220
等我明天在我自己的房间醒来
When I wake up in my own room tomorrow,

49
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,400
我会感谢我获得独立
I'm going to be giving thanks for my independence.

50
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,690
那不正是圣诞节的意义所在吗
And isn't that what Christmas is all about?

51
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,760

这是你曾祖母的菜谱
This is your great-grandmother's recipe.

64
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,200
如果她现在能看到你
If she could see you now...

65
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,050
她会死第二次的  因为你弄错了
...she would die again, because you're doing it wrong!

66
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,000
我母亲来这里一星期了
My mother has been here all week.

67
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,690
我非常爱她  但你也知道常言说
I love her very much, but you know what they say --

68
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,940
客人待三天就开始招人烦[发臭]了
house guests start to stink after three days,

69
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,420
就跟尸体一样
like dead bodies.

70
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,030
那是什么玩意儿
What the hell is that?

71
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,700
光纤圣诞树
A fiber-optic tree.

72
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,610
这比用真正的树对环境有利
It's way better for the environment than a real one.

73
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,520
但对我家客厅这个环境就不利
Not if the environment is my living room.

74
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,740
我承认  这得适应一段时间
Look, I admit, it takes some getting used to,

75
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,970
但就像希腊酸奶一样
but so did greek yogurt.

76
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,080
我现在都记不清原来的酸奶是什么味道了
Now I can't even remember how the old stuff tastes.

77
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,130
人们为什么总是改变不需要改变的东西
Why do we keep changing things that don't need changing?

78
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
过圣诞节就得有真正的圣诞树  蛋酒
Christmas is real trees and eggnog,

79
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,010
佩里・科莫还有高保真音响突然的巨响
Perry Como and bing on the hi-fi.

80
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,060
你这是在瞎掰
Now you're just making up words.

81
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,330
我这是在表明立场
I'm drawing a line in the sand.

82
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,120
我们马上去找一棵真正的树
We're gonna get a real tree,

83
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
然后像我小时候那样砍倒它
and we're gonna cut it down like I did when I was a kid.

84
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,820
跟我来
Follow me.

85
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,440
老爸
Hi, dad.

86
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,540
没空聊天  我在拯救圣诞节
Can't talk. Saving Christmas.

87
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,590
再次感谢你能来
Hi. Thank you again for coming.

88
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,750
不客气  我超爱看孩子
No problem. I love babysitting!

89
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,000
太好了  我们要去办点事儿
Good! We're going to run some quick errands.

90
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,250
等等  如果你要带走乔
Wait, if you're taking Joe --

91
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,660
你好啊  克莱尔
Hola, Claire!

92
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,670
大概四点左右回来  她很挑剔她的水瓶
Around 4:00, she gets fussy for her bottle.

93
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,010
莉莉  你知道今天我为什么能
Lily, do you know why I'm able to relax

94
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,340
这么放松地看报纸吗
and read this paper today?

95
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,610
因为你没有工作吗
Because you don't have a job?

96
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,580
告诉你  再过几天我就要开始新工
FYI, I am starting a new job in exactly t--

97
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,680
算了  我不再重复了
No. We're not doing this again.

98
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,510
是因为我提前计划好了
It's because I planned ahead.

99
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,370
我几周前就完成了圣诞购物
I finished my Christmas shopping weeks ago.

100
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,310
保持紧张忙碌非常重要
It's important to keep busy.

101
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,840
偶尔休息一下也非常正常
I-it is perfectly normal to take some downti--

102
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,280
不  算了
No. No!

103
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,790
好吧
Okay.

104
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,370
我把胡娇的派对指南打印出来了
I printed out the directions to Pepper's party.

105
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,170
现在改名叫"十二圣诞基佬"了
We're calling it "The 12 Gays of Christmas" now.

106
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,190
我们说服他没用
Oh, just be thankful

107
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,850
"快乐基男"已经要谢天谢地了
we talked him out of "Feliz Navidude."

108
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,300
好了  亲爱的  快吃完早饭
Okay, honey, finish your breakfast

109
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,560
我们要去帮我们的同胞了
so we can go help our fellow man!

110
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,750
去慈善活动上参与一小时  最多
One hour at this charity event, max.

111
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,320
我吃不了了
I can't eat.

112
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,630
就要得到我的胖胖狗之家了  我好激动
I'm too excited to get my Puppy Pound.

113
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,130
我  抱歉  你说你的什么
I'm -- I'm sorry. Your what?

114
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,550
胖胖狗之家里有六只小狗
Puppy pounds have six puppies

115
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,780
每只都有网络档案
with online profiles.

116
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,660
上网前要寻求家长同意
Ask your parents before using the Internet.

117
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,640
亲爱的  你从没提过什么胖胖狗之家啊
Honey, you never mentioned a-a-a puppy pound.

118
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,290
-她在说什么  -礼物单上没有这个
- What is she talking about? - I-it's not on your list.

119
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,060
有啊  在这儿  "胖胖狗之家"
Yes, it is. "Puppy Pound."

120
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,910
不是吧  她把"P"写反了
Oh, no! She put a "P" backwards.

121
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
而且亲爱的  "Pound"里有字母"u"
And, honey, there's a "u" in "Pound."

122
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,650
-这写的是"古比鱼池"  -古比鱼池
- This says "Guppy Pond"! - Guppy Pond!

123
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,270
什么是古比鱼池
What is a Guppy Pond?

124
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,090
这是  有史以来最酷的礼物
It's only the -- the coolest gift ever!

125
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,480
我要胖胖狗之家
I want a Puppy Pound.

126
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,210
亲爱的  今天是圣
Um, honey, it's C--

127
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,810
好了
Okay.

128
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,060
我不是要指责谁
I am not pointing fingers,

129
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,840
但我们女儿在清单上
but our daughter had

130
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,770
明明白白列出了一样东西
exactly one thing on her list,

131
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,030
但某人却没有买到
and someone didn't get it,

132
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,260
所以某人现在得去商场
so someone needs to go to the mall.

133
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,150
你在"指"责我
You're pointing fingers.

134
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
不  这还是个"1"
No. It's still a "1."

135
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,480
只不过它偷懒睡着了
It just fell asleep on the job.

136
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,970
健身日志  12月24日
Ellipticaler's log, 12/24.

137
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,110
距离加拿大边界还有10英里
10 miles from Canadian border.

138
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,980
情绪高涨  精力充沛
Spirits -- high. Stamina -- strong.

139
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,530
必须再来一剂大腿润滑油
Must get another application of thigh lube.

140
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,500
很好  卢克
Oh, good. Luke.

141
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,880
爸爸  走钢丝时我支持你
Dad, I was with you on the tightrope.

142
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,340
吃鸡翅比赛时  我是你的搭档
I was your wing man in the wing-eating competition.

143
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,990
但这次我不愿意陪着你
But I'm not feeling this one.

144
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,090
你要错过平安夜了
You're missing Christmas Eve.

145
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,730
有些东西比圣诞节更重要  儿子
There's something more important than Christmas, son

146
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,560
那就是自尊
-- pride.

147
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,460
如果我到不了加拿大
If I don't make it to Canada,

148
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,520
你妈妈获胜了  这宝贝
your mom wins, and this baby

149
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,410
明天一早就会被丢进车库里
ends up in the garage first thing in the morning.

150
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,940
我们家车库吗
Our garage?

151
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,480
我负责回收垃圾
I'm in charge of the recycling.

152
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,240
我该在周四早晨六点从车库
I'm supposed to bring it from the garage to the curb

153
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,950
拿出垃圾放在马路边
by 6:00 A.M. Thursday morning.

154
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,890
我也许错过了几周
I may have missed a few weeks.

155
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,390
该死
Shoot!

156
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,090
也许不止几周
Maybe more than a few weeks.

157
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,600
过了一阵子  垃圾堆越来越大
After a while, the pile just got so big,

158
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,020
我不能在前一晚把垃圾都搬出去
I couldn't bring it out the night before

159
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,580
不然人们会问问题的
or people would ask questions.

160
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,130
我可不需要人们问问题
I don't need people asking questions.

161
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,130
你说得对  你得完成
Then you're right! You've got to finish!

162
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,350
你在车库里可用不上这个  那里风太大
You'll never use this thing in the garage! It's too drafty!

163
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,150
所以我才要去加拿大啊  儿子
That's why I'm going to Canada, buddy --

164
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,630
躲开大风
to avoid the draft!

165
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,950
不行
No.

166
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
找到了
Bang.

167
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,950
我知道我们已经走了一小时了  但是
I know we've been hiking for an hour, but...

168
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,290
这棵树多美啊  真是太值得了  对吧
worth it when you look at this beauty, huh?

169
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,430
所以不要砍伐你看到的第一棵树
That's why you don't cut down the first tree you see.

170
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,630
这就是我们看到的第一棵树
This is literally the first tree we saw.

171
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,820
我们的车就停在那里
There's our car.

172
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,550
不  我们是从那边开始的
No, we started that way.

173
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,330
所以你的意思是
So, you're arguing

174
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,220
我们围着地球绕了一圈吗
that we walked entirely around the earth?

175
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,560
把斧子给我
Give me the ax.

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,230
别那样看着我
Don't give me that look.

177
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,220
树就像女人一样
Trees are like women.

178
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,660
你得多费功夫  才能得到最好的
The best ones make you work a little bit harder.

179
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,600
她只是没那么喜欢你
She's just not that into you.

180
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,220
-就是啊  -抱歉花了这么长时间
- I know! - Sorry it too long!

181
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,600
没事啦
Oh, it's fine.

182
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,000
克莱尔和我聊得很开心
Claire and I were having a nice time catching up.

183
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,640
真抱歉我迟到了
I am really sorry that I am late.

184
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,770
你才不抱歉
No, you're not.

185
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,320
的确如此
No, I'm not.

186
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,740
没关系啦
Mm-hmm. It's fine.

187
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,440
希望我这个话唠没烦到皮娜
Just hope I didn't talk Pilar's ear off!

188
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,590
没有啦
No!

189
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,920
我喜欢听你聊你的家人
I love hearing about your family

190
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,400
和你重大新工作的事
and your big, new job!

191
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,920
这工作不算重大啦
Oh, well, it's -- it's not such a big job.

192
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,600
我只是在为我老爸工作而已
I mean, I'm really just working for my dad.

193
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,840
但你有努力工作啊
But you're working hard.

194
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,180
我为你感到骄傲
I'm proud of you.

195
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,680
-看起来怎么样  -完美
- How do they look? - Ooh! Perfect!

196
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,270
-太棒了  -你是超棒的学生
- Yes. - You are a wonderful student.

197
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,740
-谢谢  -这是我祖母教给我妈妈的
-Thank you.  -My grandmother taught my mother.

198
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,290
我妈妈又教给了我
My mother taught me.

199
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,870
现在我教给了克莱尔
And now, I teach Claire.

200
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,140
别谦虚啦
And don't be so modest.

201
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,370
我尊重那种能养育家庭
I respect a woman who can raise a family

202
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,580
同时又有全职工作的女人
and have a full-time job.

203
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,120
你能相信吗  在周五
Can you believe that on Fridays,

204
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,070
她们都没必要盛装打扮
they don't even have to dress up?

205
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,570
尝尝  尝尝
Taste. Taste. Taste.

206
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,420
有时她们甚至穿运动裤哦
Sometimes, they even wear sweatpants.

207
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,720
你想舔一舔面糊吗
Would you like to lick the batter?

208
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,750
超想
Yes! Oh, yes!

209
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,910
-我也想  -不行
- Me, too! - No, no, no!

210
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,740
帮忙的人才能吃到
Helpers only.

211
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
规矩不是我定的
I don't make the rules.

212
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,800
莉莉  装饰品真漂亮
Oh, Lily, what a beautiful ornament!

213
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,220
这会让一个小朋友很开心的
That's gonna make a little kid very happy.

214
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,910
等等  我不能留着吗
Wait. I don't get to keep this?

215
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,660
为什么我还做得这么费力
Why am I killing myself?

216
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,120
好了  孩子们
Okay, kids!

217
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,030
北极有人来探望我们了
We've got a visitor from the North Pole,

218
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,650
而且他带了礼物哦
and he brought presents!

219
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,370
喂  怎么样
Hey! Hey. How's it going?

220
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,010
到处都买不到胖胖狗之家
There are no Puppy Pounds anywhere.

221
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,600
简直就像在1983年的平安夜寻找
It's like trying to find a Cabbage Patch Kid

222
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,510
椰菜娃娃一样
on Christmas Eve 1983.

223
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,740
还无法释怀呐
Still hurts, huh?

224
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,190
我把她的床都铺好了
I had her bed all made.

225
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,300
好吧  莉莉会难过死的
Okay. Well, Lily is gonna be devastated.

226
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,830
打电话问问  把我们排上预订名单
Call around. Get us on some lists.

227
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
你得做些什么
You have to do something!

228
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,450
我会想办法的
I'll figure it out.

229
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,740
募捐会怎么样
How's the fundraiser?

230
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,290
我在设法对付
Oh, well, I'm managing, you know.

231
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,560
把支票本拿来
Oh, bring the checkbook.

232
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,990
能看出他们准备提出重大请求的样子
You can always tell when they're gearing up for the big ask --

233
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,430
给了很多免费赠品
Fill you full of freebies.

234
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,650
我得挂了  得去帮帮别人
Oh, hey, I gotta go. Got to help somebody.

235
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,550
你好  经典小丑
Hi! Classic.

236
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
扔得真完美
Flawlessly executed.

237
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,480
如果我有一个...
If I had one...

238
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,160
只想让你们能笑逐颜开
Just trying to bring a smile to you folks.

239
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,510
-你会度过这一切的  -度过什么
- You're gonna get through this. - Get through what?

240
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,470
别不好意思
Don't be embarrassed.

241
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
我们都处境相同
Everyone here is in the same boat.

242
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,510
是吗
We are?

243
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,260
热可可最妙的一点
Best thing about the hot chocolate --

244
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,880
喝完后杯子也归我们
they let us keep the mug.

245
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,020
我以为这是为有需要的人募捐的慈善活动
I thought it was a charity event for the needy.

246
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,960
结果是让有需要人士来参加的慈善活动
Turns out, it was a charity event for the needy!

247
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,780
瞧  圣诞老人给了我一个胖胖狗之家
Look! Santa gave me a puppy pound!

248
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,850
什么  不
What? No.

249
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,420
我终于开心啦
I'm finally happy!

250
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,640
我需要给新闻报道拍张照片
I'd like a picture for the newsletter.

251
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,770
你可以给你妈妈看看
Oh. You can show your mommy.

252
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,260
我没有妈妈
I don't have a mommy.

253
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,170
所以我才办这活动
This is why I do this.

254
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,930
也许不是抽筋  可能要犯心脏病
That cramp could be a heart attack.

255
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,970
我要给你留下一些建议
Here's some advice I've been holding back on.

256
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,750
刮胡子的时候要顺着皮肤纹理刮
Always shave with the grain.

257
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,220
真正有本事的地产中介
No reputable talent agent

258
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,650
是不会一开始就谈钱的
will ever ask for money up-front.

259
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,120
爸  你没事的
Dad, you're fine.

260
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,270
卢克  我好想放弃啊
I really want to quit, Luke!

261
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,160
不  你可以的
No, you're gonna make it!

262
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,670
他根本不可能做到的
He was never gonna make it.

263
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
我只是要拖延时间
I just needed to buy some time.

264
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,490
你要搬的东西真够多的
That's a lot of product you're moving.

265
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,280
带到垃圾回收场就行了
Just bring it to a recycling place.

266
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,010
给了钱我才办事
Not until I get paid.

267
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,860
这可是人家六个星期的补贴呢
Just so you know, this is six weeks' allowance.

268
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,950
你家长真是酷毙了
Oh, you have the coolest parents ever.

269
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,980
我得知道你什么时候出发
I want to know when you're about to leave,

270
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,500
按一下喇叭通知我
so give me a honk.

271
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,280
-嘀嘀  -按汽车的喇叭
- Honk! -  From your car.

272
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,990
最好的名片就是有力的握手
The best business card is a firm handshake.

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,310
最好的搭讪诀窍是穿紧身工作裤
The best pick-up line is a tight pair of dockers.

274
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,320
最好的工作裤是...
The best dockers are --

275
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,500
爸爸  别说了  还有最后五英里了
Dad, save your breath! You're in the last five miles.

276
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,860
-我永远也跑不完了  -你当然能
- I'm never gonna make it! - Of course you are!

277
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,360
不过你爱怎么办怎么办吧  我还有事
Then again, do what you want. I got stuff to do.

278
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,660
-我要放弃了  -好吧
- I'm gonna quit. - Cool.

279
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,160
再失败一次又怎么样呢
What's one more failure?

280
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,680
你想过我们为什么要绕远去学校吗
You ever wonder why we take such a crazy route to school?

281
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,880
因为那样我就不用路过某些地方了
So I don't have to drive by certain places --

282
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,550
那个我只去过一次的长笛老师家
The flute teacher's house I went to once...

283
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,780
那个我只学了五大基本酱料中的两种
The French cooking academy I quit after learning

284
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,020
就退出了的法餐烹饪学校
only two of the five mother sauces...

285
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,620
那个只学了一个动作就放弃了的瑜伽教室
The hot yoga studio I left after "Happy baby."

286
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,580
看来是怎么也躲不过
I guess there's no avoiding

287
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,380
车库里这个巨大的失败了
this big failure sitting in my garage.

288
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,250
起来
Get up.

289
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,880
谢谢你  伙计  不过...
I appreciate it, buddy, but --

290
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,410
快起来
Get up.

291
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,820
我不会你说的长笛
I don't know anything about flutes

292
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,160
或者烹饪或者瑜伽...
or cooking or happy babies...

293
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,600
但我拼了老命也要让你去加拿大
But I'm damn sure getting my dad to Canada.

294
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
加油跑到终点吧
Now, mount that beast.

295
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,350
谢谢你  儿子
Thank you, son.

296
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,260
等你跑过终点开始庆祝的时候
You can thank me after you cross the finish line

297
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,000
再谢我
and the celebration begins.

298
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,560
想象一下吧
Just picture that.

299
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,550
我能想象到
I'm picturing it!

300
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,510
我能想象到
I'm picturing it!

301
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,260
我真的能想象到
I'm really picturing it!

302
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,530
谢谢你  圣诞老人
Thanks, Santa.

303
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,660
好  没事
Yeah. You got it.

304
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,600
别忘了圣诞夫人给你的糖果棒
Don't forget a candy cane from Mrs. Claus!

305
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,680
我得休息会儿
Oh! I got to take a break.

306
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,690
-什么  -搞什么
- What? - What? What?

307
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,910
没关系
Um...it's okay!

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,910
谁想和我照张相呀
Does anybody want to take a picture with me?

309
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,460
-我想  -我是说孩子们
- I'll do it. - Oh, maybe just the kids.

310
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,690
-刚才怎么回事  -什么怎么回事
- What was that? - What was what?

311
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,310
圣诞老人不能休息
Santa doesn't take breaks.

312
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,190
他要去北极的
He visits the North Pole!

313
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,320
而且你怎么把这里弄得乱七八糟的
And why do you leave your things all over?

314
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,910
最后是我要打扫这里好吗
Who do you think cleans this place up?

315
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,770
你怎么像祥林嫂似的
Oh, you are such a nag!

316
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,070
我们连在过节的时候
Can't we at least

317
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,290
假装是幸福的一对都不行吗
act like a happy couple during the holidays?

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,700
为了孩子们
For the children!

319
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,430
你还喝热巧克力
Another hot chocolate?

320
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,070
你还想喝多少杯啊
How many more of those are you going to drink?

321
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,210
至少它是暖的  不像你
At least it's warm, unlike you!

322
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,040
圣诞老人常在外出差
He travels a lot.

323
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,640
圣诞夫人吃曲奇吃胖了
She's put on cookie weight.

324
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,010
日子不好过
It's hard.

325
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,030
没问题  你可以把我放在
Yes, you can put me on

326
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,650
"亡羊补牢礼物购买者"的名单上
the "Last-minute shoppers" waiting list.

327
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,920
-真行  -你也在这里啊
- Unbelievable. - Oh! Well, there he is!

328
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,020
乔森
H-hey, Jotham!

329
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,220
看来你也是
Oh, looks like someone did

330
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,990
临到圣诞才想起要买礼物
a little last-minute Christmas shopping.

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,530
那个赞尼尔真是幸运啊
That Zaniel's a lucky guy.

332
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,030
他的确很幸运
Yes, he is.

333
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,250
但这些是要带去胡娇的派对的
But these are for Pepper's party.

334
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,170
他的请柬上不是说了不要带礼物吗
His invitation said, "No gifts, please."

335
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,310
重复一遍那句话
Mm, say that again...

336
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,740
用胡娇的语气
as Pepper.

337
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,020
没带礼物吗
No gifts?

338
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,210
想不想活了
Please.

339
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,690
现在是平安夜的下午五点
5 o'clock, Christmas Eve,

340
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,210
我还得去买最完美的礼物
and I have to find a dozen perfect presents

341
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,850
给世界上最挑剔最尖刻的男人们
for the world's snarkiest, cattiest men...

342
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,950
我亲爱的朋友们
My dear, dear friends.

343
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,100
拉  拉  再拉
Pull! Pull! Pull!

344
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,320
好了  休息会儿吧
Yeah. Hey, take a break.

345
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,550
-这也太费时了  -本来就是
- This is taking forever. - It's supposed to.

346
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,140
原来我和我爸要花一整天弄倒一棵树
Took my dad and I all day to get a tree.

347
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,170
当终于把树砍下来的时候
And when he finally brought her down,

348
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,530
他会抽根雪茄来庆祝
he used to celebrate with a cigar.

349
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,300
我那时还是个孩子  所以就抽根香烟
I was just a kid, so I'd have a cigarette.

350
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
好了  抓住另一边
All right. Grab the other end.

351
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,010
这就对了
There we go.

352
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,870
这就进入状态了吧
Now we got a groove.

353
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,410
好了  这就可以...
Yeah. There we --

354
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,740
它就是不断
It won't budge!

355
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,820
这木头是他妈什么做的啊
The hell is this wood made of?

356
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,210
都能拿来做锯了好吗
They ought to make saws out of it!

357
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,940
面对现实吧  这棵树把我们打败了
Let's face it. The tree's beaten us.

358
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,280
我们普里契特家的人是不会半途而废的
Hey, we're Pritchetts. We don't quit.

359
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,610
再说了  我的工具都卡在里面
Besides, all my tools are stuck in it.

360
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,080
我知道该怎么办了
I got it.

361
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
非常简单的原理
It's simple physics.

362
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,640
给这棵树施点压
A little pressure,

363
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,100
它就会在我们砍的地方断掉
the thing will snap where we put the blade in.

364
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,120
-这不就完事了  -赶紧的吧
- Done. - Just hit the gas.

365
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,780
凑效了吧
It's working.

366
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,130
这才叫北方汉子做的发动机
That's why they call it yankee engine--

367
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,450
小心
Get down!

368
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,160
半棵树都秃了
It's bald on one side now!

369
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,360
没事的
It'll be fine!

370
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,030
两边匀一匀就好了
We'll just comb over some branches!

371
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,300
克莱尔  我以为你走了呢
Oh, Claire, I thought that you had left.

372
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,220
她本来是要走了
She was going to,

373
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,270
但我想让她看看没有这些头发挡着
But I wanted to show her how much better she looks

374
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,600
她的脸  她有多美丽动人
without this hair blocking her pretty face.

375
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,590
她头发确实很美
She does have beautiful hair, though.

376
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,740
我知道
I see.

377
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,260
她说什么
What did she say?

378
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,880
说你碰巧赶上一个好发色
That you picked a good color...

379
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,160
反正我觉得她是这个意思
At least, I think that's what she said

380
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,890
她美国口音太重
with that American accent.

381
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
你不用哄她高兴
You don't have to entertain her.

382
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,370
毕竟她是我妈
After all, she's my mother.

383
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,480
这是歌洛莉亚以前最爱吃的
Ah, these used to be Glorita's favorite!

384
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,050
她以前为了能多吃点常做手头倒立
She used to do headstands to get extra cookies.

385
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,120
至少会努力去做
At least, she'd try.

386
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,070
是的  真的不容易做到
Yeah, but it's not easy!

387
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,360
我站着的时候要保持她们坚挺都很不容易
I mean, it's hard enough to keep all this right-side up!

388
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,790
你可以想象倒过来会有多难
Imagine when I had to put it all right-side down!

389
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,720
-那太...  -天呐
- It was... - Oh, my gosh.

390
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,100
真不敢相信我还能做到
I can't believe I can still do it!

391
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,830
看呐
Look at that.

392
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
看看克莱尔  歌洛莉亚
Oh, wow. Look at Claire, Gloria!

393
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,800
真棒  给你两块小点心
Very good! Two cookies for you!

394
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,130
谢谢
Thank you!

395
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,210
是啊  可她需要修修脚
Uh, yeah, but she needs a pedicure.

396
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,350
看呐
Look at that.

397
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,150
你把我弄倒了
You knocked me down!

398
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,060
-我没有  -有  你弄的
- I did not. - Yes, you did, too!

399
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,260
姑娘们  姑娘们  别吵了
Girls! Girls! Girls! No need to fight.

400
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,930
我没有偏爱你们哪一个
I don't have a favorite.

401
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,600
为什么没有
Why the hell not?!

402
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,470
我对你们两个非常失望
I am very disappointed in both of you.

403
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,750
家庭成员应该用爱和尊重
Family members should treat each other

404
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,200
来对待彼此
with love and respect.

她说的对  除非你刚才说的就是这个

408

我听不懂  因为我只学了法语
I can't tell, 'cause I-I only took French,

409

大老远从哥伦比亚来看你

可我妈甚至都不愿意从她住的

但我不该因为我妈妈不好
But I shouldn't take it out on you

427
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,410
就把气撒在你头上
just 'cause I have a lousy mom.

428
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,220
不许不尊重你妈妈

-她总这样吗  -是的
- Is she always like this? - Yes.

430
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,870
你就没想过也许她寄给你那样礼物
Did you-- did you ever think maybe there's a reason

431
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,900
是有原因的吗
she sends you that gift?

432
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,160
想过  因为在我8岁时
Yeah, 'cause she found something

433
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,910
她发现了我很喜欢的礼物
when I was 8 years old that I actually liked,

434
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,420
从此就再也没花心思选礼物给我
and she hasn't thought about it since.

435
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,480
也许她花了很多心思
Well, maybe she thinks about it a lot.

436
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,220
也许她记得她让你开心的那个时刻
Maybe she remembers a time when she made you happy,

437
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,060
她想回到过去
and she wants to go back there.

438
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,870
现在我好难受
Well, now I feel terrible.

439

我只寄给她一张电子贺卡
The only thing I sent her was an e-card.

我们从未停止对自己的女儿的依赖
We never stop needing our little girls.

444
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,810
我也从未停止对你的依赖  妈妈
I will never stop needing you, mama.

445
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,280
你最好不要给我寄拖鞋

可现在我却害怕被他看透
and now I'm scared he will.

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,380
不
No.

557
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,920
不  为什么会这样
No! Why?!

558
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,860
为什么
Why-y-y-y-y?!

559
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,490
事后诸葛亮一下  那支烟是个错误
In hindsight, the cigar was a mistake.

560
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,570
那我们现在怎么办
So, what do we do now?

561
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,980
我们回家吧
We go home.

562
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,210
我以为普里契特家的人是不会放弃的
I thought Pritchetts never give up.

563
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,640
他们知道什么时候应该放手
They know when to give up,

564
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,740
也算是某种战胜自我
which is its own kind of victory.

565
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
-除非  -怎么了
- Unless... - what?

566
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,720
算了  太疯狂了
No it's crazy.

567
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,880
除非
Unless...

568
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,610
你真的想我再问一遍吗
Are you really gonna make me ask you again?

569
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,070
我们可以想办法给树干上的斧头施加压力
...we somehow apply pressure to the axhead already in the tree.

570
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,300
可以用车上的千斤顶
I bet we can use the jack from the car.

571
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,980
不错  向上的力可以撕裂树干
Of course. The upward motion will split the trunk. Yeah.

572
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,030
我们可以跟别人说我们是那么做的
We can always tell people that's how we did it.

573
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,550
我们就是那么做到的
That is how we did it.

574
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,110
人们总喜欢得到新东西
People love getting new things...

575
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,640
不过最好的东西背后都有个故事
But the best stuff has a story behind it.

576
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,100
超棒的树
Damn fine tree.

577
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,520
只是锯子还卡在树上
Except the saw's still stuck in the truck.

578
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,100
你要负责不让你弟弟靠近那个
Yeah, you're gonna want to keep your brother away from that, huh?

579
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,050
很多时候  只有当我们失去了之后
A lot of times, it's only after we get rid of something...

580
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,260
有我的位置吗
Room for me?

581
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,620
才意识到自己有多怀念
...that we realize how much we miss it.

582
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,140
真好
Oh! Nice!

583
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,590
干得不错  卢克
Good job, Luke!

584
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,840
好棒  胖胖狗之家
Yay! A Puppy Pound!

585
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,700
看起来没什么价值的东西
And things that seem worthless

586
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,100
突然就变得很有价值
suddenly turn out to be super valuable...

587
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,740
大家一起到圣诞树前合影
Okay, everybody, picture in front of the tree.

588
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,820
定好时间了  准备好了吗
Timer's set. Ready?

589
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,220
什么  不
What? No!

590
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,330
甚至是宝贵
...maybe even precious...

591
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,500
所以我才觉得我们也许
Which is why I thought getting rid of this stuff

592
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,070
不应该把这些丢掉
would be a huge mistake.

593
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,620
得了吧
Nice try.

594
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,190
你欠我们六个星期的补贴
You still owe us six weeks' allowance,

595
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,510
还有烟花
and the fireworks.

596
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,420
你居然把事情搞砸了
How could you screw this up?

597
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,570
你说什么
What?

598
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,430
我们温哥华见
I'll see you in Vancouver, eh?

599
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,770
不对  卢克  再学一遍口音
No. Luke, do the accent again?

600
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,100
你还在跑着呢
Oh, are you on that machine?

601
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,750
对  朱莉安娜  但跟你老公不同的是
Yes, Juliana, but unlike your husband,

602
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
我会在你反应过来之前就完事的
I'll be finished before you know it.

603
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,970
你知道吗  这样其实更轻松了
You know what? It's actually easier this way!

604
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,720
不知道能不能给这个动作申请专利
Wonder if you could patent a movement?

605
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,740
就叫"菲式旋转"
Call it "Fliptical" --

606
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,920
爸  小朋友们来要糖果了
Dad, trick or treaters!

607
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,260
我们的糖发完了
We're out of candy!

608
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,040
这个爸爸是谁
Who is this dad?

609
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,570
我是甘道夫
I'm Gandalf.

610
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,420
我来啦
Who's on?
