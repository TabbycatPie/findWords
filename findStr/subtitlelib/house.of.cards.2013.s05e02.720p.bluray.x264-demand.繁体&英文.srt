00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,730
我們選擇的開放自由的生活
how we choose to lead our lives, open and free,

146
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,520
這些都受到了威脅
is on the line.

147
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,400
恐懼是非美國的
Fear is un-American.

148
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,260
沒錯  偏偏在萬圣節這天對各位說這番話
And yes, the irony of saying those words to you on Halloween,

149
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,610
這諷刺性我也意識到了
of all days, is not lost on me.

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
但雖然我們作為美國人
But although we may choose, as Americans,

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,040
可能會為了取樂  每年主動嚇自己一次
to scare ourselves once a year for fun...

152
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,220
除了這一天之外  誰也不能
no one else tells any American

153
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,950
告訴美國人什么時候該嚇得發抖
when to shake in their boots at any other time.

154
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,920
我要下達一項行政命令
So I am issuing an executive order,

155
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,350
憑借我
by virtue of the authority vested in me

156
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,470
作為美國總統
as President of the United States

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,000
和三軍統帥的的權力
and commander in chief of the armed forces.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,240
憑借憲法和我國的法律
By our Constitution and the laws of our land,

159
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,700
包括什么什么法第多少多少章
including Section Blah-Blah of the Blah-Blah Act

160
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,730
還有某某法令第多少多少章
and Section Blah-Blah of Title Blah-Blah,

161
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,200
第哪條狗屁款
Paragraph Bullshit-Bullshit.

162
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,740
以防你不明白這是怎么回事
In case you have no idea what's going on,

163
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,710
我要擴充這些州的國民警衛隊
I'm swelling these states' National Guard troops

164
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,350
以確保選舉日公共場合的安全性
to create secure public spaces on Election Day.

165
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,140
我督促這些州長合并投票站
I'm urging these governors to consolidate their polling sites

166
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,580
建立"投票中心"
and create quote, unquote "voting centers"

167
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,160
讓民眾覺得出門投票是安全的
so that people feel safe to come out and vote.

168
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,560
我贊揚偉大的亞利桑那州的州長
I'm commending Governor Sally Morrison

169
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,250
薩莉·莫里森
of the great state of Arizona,

170
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,880
因為她在最近的初選中為我們樹立了
for giving us all such a good example of voting centers

171
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,470
投票中心的好榜樣
as used in their recent primary.

172
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,350
但我其實是在
But what I'm really doing

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,350
引誘五個關鍵州的州長
is seducing the governors of five key states.

174
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,120
新澤西  內華達  伊利諾伊
New Jersey, Nevada, Illinois,

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,470
俄亥俄和賓州
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

176
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,940
州長分別是哈克特  努涅茲  加里納德
Messrs. Harcourt, Nuñez, Gallinard,

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,930
奧姆斯泰德  還有馬修斯
Olmstead and Matthews.

178
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,050
你們還記得馬修斯吧
You remember Matthews, don't you?

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,520
加勒特·沃克總統的前副總統
Former vice president to President Garrett Walker.

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,240
就是個眼光狹隘的偷筆毛賊
Nothing but a provincial and petty pen-stealer.

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,620
但我需要他
But I need him.

182
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,120
想贏得這次選舉  我需要他們五個都支持我
I need all five on my side if I'm gonna win this election.

183
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,550
從以往來看  馬修是我們已知的最大未知數
Matthews, in our history, he's the biggest known unknown.

184
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,390
我差點忘了  金童也來了
And I almost forgot. The boy wonder is here.

185
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,100
我不容小覷的對手
My worthy opponent.

186
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,880
他坐立不安  我卻如魚得水
Out of his element and stuck in mine.

187
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,220
但你看  在政治中聲望[身高]決定一切
But, you see, in politics, stature is everything.

188
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,330
你也能看出來
And wouldn't you say that

189
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,390
小威·康越來越矮了[底氣不足]Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?

190
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,780
總統提出的這些邊境限制令
These border restrictions the president is proposing...

191
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,720
軍隊是否該執行它們  將軍
should the military play a role in enforcing them, General?

192
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
我們應該退后一步
I think we need to take a step back

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,810
站在大局看國家安全的當務之急
and look at our national security priorities.

194
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,250
以及如何調動軍隊
And what constitutes appropriate deployment

195
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,930
才是合理合法的
of our serving men and women.

196
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,260
我們是退役軍人
As veterans,

197
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,470
此事讓康威州長和我尤其掛心
this issue is a personal one for Governor Conway and me.

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,970
-你和  -我再跟你說
- Would you and-- - I'll tell you something else.

199
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,950
州長不會親口這么說
You won't hear this from the governor himself,

200
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,350
但在他的軍旅生涯中
but his military career

201
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,120
非凡的勇敢行為不計其數
is distinguished by exceptional acts of bravery.

202
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,970
尤其是  讓他獲得
In particular, the incident for which

203
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,010
紫心勛章的那次行動  格外突出
he was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.

204
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,820
這表明了他能成為怎樣的三軍統帥
Speaks to the kind of commander in chief he will be.

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,980
也證明了在我看來  是無畏的智慧
Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.

206
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,820
美國應該盡早聽聽他立功的來龍去脈
Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.

207
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,020
感謝您的參與  布洛哈特將軍
Thank you for your time, General Brockhart.

208
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,380
很高興接受采訪
Glad to talk to you.

209
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,520
接下的《特別報道》  我們將關注
Coming up next on Special Report, we take a look at...

210
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,450
我對天發誓  要是安德伍德往邊境派兵
I swear to God, if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

211
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,690
我第一個站出來讓軍人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,580
在撥款分配方面
In terms of allocation of funds,

213
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,970
水源問題讓我整夜發愁
it's our water supply that keeps me up at night.

214
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,970
羅杰  你是說保護基礎設施嗎
Roger, are you talking about protecting the infrastructure?

215
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,630
基礎設施還有水源問題
Infrastructure and water sources.

216
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,950
水庫  水壩  還有輸水管道系統
Reservoirs, the dams, the tunnel delivery systems--

217
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,130
所有這些  是的
All of it, yes.

218
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,440
保護它們免遭恐襲  當然
Protection from terrorism, sure,

219
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,840
但選民們還看到了更大的危險
but the voters see even greater dangers.

220
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,750
建設性的  環境方面的  藻類毒素
Structural, environmental, toxins from algae.

221
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,220
水藻是我們的大麻煩
Algae's quite a problem for us.

222
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,570
關鍵問題是  聯邦政府盡力了嗎
The big question here, are the feds doing all they can do?

223
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,080
聯邦政府還想做更多事情
Well, the feds want to do even more.

224
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,260
那就是我們今天聚在這里的原因
That's the reason that we're all meeting here today.

225
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,530
先生們  我現在看到的
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see

226
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,450
是我們大家都在爭吵
is that we're in violent agreement with each other.

227
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,600
羅杰  我們認識多久了
I mean, Roger, how long have we known each other?

228
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,930
多長時間了
How far do we go back?

229
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,340
我還有頭發的時候你就認識我了  總統先生
You knew me when I had hair, Mr. President.

230
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,860
但不管怎樣  我的選民都說
It doesn't change the fact that my constituents are saying,

231
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,430
"我們需要的是橋  不是戰區"
"Give me a bridge, not a war zone."

232
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,510
我的意思是
All I'm saying is that

233
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,560
我們要及時預測并扼制威脅
we need to anticipate threats when we can and thwart them.

234
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,530
我的意思是  大選將至
I'm saying that we're days away from an election,

235
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,360
我不想把事情搞砸
and I don't wanna upset the apple cart.

236
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,030
抱歉我離開一下
Excuse me for just a moment.

237
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,180
威爾  你看到這個了嗎
Will, have you seen this?

238
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,370
好  我回頭找他
All right. I'll deal with him later.

239
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,740
告訴我她具體說了什么
Tell me exactly what she said.

240
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,520
只說她是從肯·卡斯維爾那里聽到的
Just that she heard it from Ken Caswell.

241
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,850
我向薩里達當局核實過了  先生
I checked with the local authorities in Salida, sir.

242
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,680
不太妙
It doesn't look good.

243
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,210
-可能性  -加強搜索力度
- The chances of-- - Amp up the search.

244
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,530
無論他們是需要物資還是人手
Whatever materials and personnel they need

245
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,460
除了他們已經有的  都給他們
in addition to what they have, give them.

246
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,980
再聯系一下貝絲·科貝特  我想和她通話
And reach out to Beth Corbet. I'd like to speak to her directly.

247
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,950
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

248
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,790
從2012年起我就沒睡過一個好覺
I haven't slept a good night's sleep since 2012.

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
但我覺得當選官員不睡覺的話
But I guess elected officials don't sleep

250
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,440
我們的選民就能睡好了
so our constituents can.

251
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,200
成功打擊恐怖活動的證據
The proof of success in fighting terror...

252
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,570
就是民眾對此毫不知曉
is something the public never hears about.

253
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,690
我州的一座城市
A certain city in my state

254
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,650
是國內最大的恐襲目標
wears the biggest target in the nation.

255
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,790
紐約州和紐約市
The city and state of New York...

256
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,000
十五年來默默地勝利著
has scored silent wins for 15 years...

257
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,310
從未宣戰
without a declaration of war.

258
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,020
好吧
Now...

259
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,460
大多數時候
in most cases...

260
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,050
我會說各州可以進行自我管理
I would argue the states can take care of themselves.

261
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,360
總統先生  
Mr. President!

262
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,540
沒事  繼續  州長
Well, by all means, continue, Governor.

263
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,210
你之前在說什么  失眠
What... what was that part you were talking about? Insomnia?

264
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,930
我的意思是
My point is,

265
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,310
在座各位都是美國人  我們都愛這個國家
we're all Americans in this room, and we all love this country.

266
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,780
我想感謝總統
and I'd like to thank the president

267
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,130
給我機會討論這一非常重要的話題
for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic,

268
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,110
我很抱歉  我的時間太緊張
and apologize for, uh, being on such a tight schedule.

269
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,010
我們非常感謝
Well, we are enormously grateful

270
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,270
今天州長能抽出時間趕來參加
that the governor took the time to come and join us today.

271
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,740
我只是想弄明白
I'm just trying to understand.

272
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,030
克萊爾  如果我的話冒犯到了你
Claire, if I said anything to offend you,

273
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,920
那完全是
it was entirely...

274
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,830
你懂我的  我說話不動腦子
I mean, you know me. No filter.

275
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,810
那就是讓我擔心的事
And that's what worries me.

276
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,430
我只是憑直覺行事  肯
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.

277
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,680
你來這兒是有什么目的嗎
Did you come down here with an agenda?

278
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,640
沒有  我...
No. I mean...

279
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,490
我一直想找弗蘭克  但今天只是...
I have been trying to reach Frank, but today was just...

280
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,630
我看到你要出席一場活動
I saw that you were appearing at an event

281
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,390
就來打個招呼
and I showed up to say hi.

282
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,620
我真的在這附近工作
I... I really do work around here,

283
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,610
在一條叫"華爾"的街上  知道嗎
on a street called "Wall", you know?

284
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,010
但你提到了
But then you made reference

285
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,800
兩個非常親密的朋友的事
to something about two very close friends

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,450
這不關任何人的事  包括你
that's nobody's business, including yours.

287
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,220
你自己也這么說
And you even said so yourself,

288
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,430
肯  你是個大嘴巴
Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.

289
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,590
我
I...

290
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,970
我失去了一位好友
I lost a dear friend.

291
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,940
我愛蒂姆  大家都愛他
I loved Tim. Everybody did.

292
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,560
你還特別暗指了弗蘭西斯
And you implied Francis especially.

293
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,520
是的  我是說  那完全是另一回事
Well, yeah. I mean... That was a whole other thing.

294
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,810
怎么是另一回事
In what way?

295
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,070
就是...你想讓我說什么
In... What do you want me to say?

296
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,440
我相信我知道的并不比你多
I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.

297
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,670
我只是很想知道你是怎么想的
I'm just very interested in your perspective.

298
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,680
弗蘭克很敬重蒂姆  他愿為他做任何事
Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.

299
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,120
我說不好
I don't know.

300
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,780
如果當時的世道是另一番樣子  誰知道呢
If the world were a different place back then... who knows?

301
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,220
那是很久之前的事了  后來他遇見了你
That was a long time ago. And then he met you.

302
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,410
他真有福氣
And lucky him.

303
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,610
瞧  要說我的公司
Look, in terms of my firm and...

304
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,030
和我聯系總統那么費勁...
and trying to get the president's ear...

305
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,650
這的確有點尷尬
I mean, yeah, it's a little embarrassing

306
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,400
跟我有30多年交情的老朋友
that my friend of 30-whatever years

307
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,290
沒有時間接我的電話
didn't have time to pick up the phone.

308
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,780
他應該回你電話的
He should have called you back.

309
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,630
弗蘭西斯和蒂姆是非常要好的朋友
Francis and Tim were very good friends.

310
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,670
但是  肯  隨著年齡的增長
But, you know, Ken, the older I get,

311
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,480
我發現妄下判斷是很危險的
I learn that assumptions are dangerous.

312
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,160
是啊  好吧
Sure. Okay.

313
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,990
很高興見到你
It was great to see you.

314
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,110
她在哪
So where is she?

315
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,180
計劃有變  她需要留在紐約
Change of plans. She needed to stay in New York.

316
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,970
她要我為這次會議做了準備的
She asked me to put something together for this.

317
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,370
是嗎  臨時有事
Yeah? Well, something came up.

318
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,320
副總統會替她出席
The vice president will be filling in for her.

319
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
我的天...
Oh, my...

320
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,890
你好啊
Hey, man.

321
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,350
我們以前組過一個很糟糕的樂隊
Uh, we played in a terrible band together back in the day.

322
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,180
我們那時還年少  不需要付贍養費
Before adulthood and alimony came crashing down.

323
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,430
兩個前妻嗎
Two exes?

324
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,540
第一夫人在哪
So, uh, where's the First Lady?

325
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,010
臨時有事
Something came up.

326
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,160
我想問你幾個關于為競選工作的問題
I'd love to ask you a few questions about working on the campaign.

327
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,280
我只是個講稿撰寫人
I'm just a speechwriter.

328
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,260
是啊  你怎么得到這份工作的
Exactly. How the hell did that happen?

329
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,610
歡迎來到對外關系委員會
Welcome to the Council on Foreign Relations

330
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,820
此次特別活動  跨越國境:前進的道路
and this special event on Crossing Borders: The Way Forward.

331
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,550
這好像是個搖擺州派對
I smell a swing state party.

332
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
注意語氣  瑞克
Tone, Rick.

333
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,510
你不必大費周章召集數十位州長
You didn't have to round up dozens of governors

334
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,160
只為跟我們五個談話
just to talk to the five of us.

335
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,040
你們來這里是因為我們在擔心
You're here because there have been concerning threats

336
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,400
你們各州的遠郊郡存在威脅
in exurban counties in each of your states.

337
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,050
你能再說具體一點嗎
Could you be more specific?

338
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,580
我們在關注亨特頓  埃爾科  杰弗遜郡
We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon, Elko, Jefferson counties.

339
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,150
還有切斯特和麥克亨利
Also Chester and McHenry.

340
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,910
所以在大選來臨前
Which is why it's crucial

341
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,460
我們必須要與你們各州的
that we work with your states' administrations

342
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,050
州政府合作
leading up to the election.

343
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,760
這些選區
Every one of those precincts

344
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,250
都是典型的共和黨票倉
is a typically Republican stronghold.

345
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,520
這和黨派關系無關
This isn't about party affiliation.

346
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,410
如總統所說  這事關國家安全
As the president said, this is about security.

347
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,690
我們相信這些舉措
Now, we believe this course of action,

348
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,160
對投票站增加警力
the voting centers with the added law enforcement,

349
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,940
能充分保證
will give us everything that we need

350
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,510
選舉的安全性
to protect the integrity of the ballot box.

351
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,540
好吧  但我代表
Okay, but speaking for

352
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,110
奧姆斯泰德州長  也許還有所有我們的上司
Governor Olmstead and maybe all of our bosses,

353
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,310
想問問  我們怎么知道這些措施
how can we be sure that these measures

354
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,950
不會讓選民不敢去投票
won't discourage everyone from getting to the polls?

355
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,450
-比如  民主黨人  -我們必須冒這個險
- I.E., Democrats. - It's a chance we have to take.

356
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,180
但我們認為不會出現這樣的結果
But we don't believe it'll play out that way.

357
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,610
我們俄亥俄州的選票非常接近
We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.

358
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,350
重要的是預防可能的
Preventing further acts of terrorism

359
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,350
恐怖襲擊  塔妮婭
is just about all that matters, Tanya.

360
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,820
我非常清楚  威脅的增加
Now, I do realize with these heightened threats

361
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,420
給了你們的州長額外的壓力
comes an additional strain on the governors of your states.

362
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,510
所以...
So...

363
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,270
我要對你們所有人說...
I say to each and every one of you...

364
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,980
告訴我們該如何幫助你們
tell me how we can help.

365
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,480
拋開確實存在的道德問題不談
Putting aside the very real moral questions,

366
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,100
封鎖邊境怎么能可行
how is shutting down the borders even feasible?

367
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,040
我知道這項政策會損害部分人的利益
I know this policy is going to hurt some people,

368
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,190
但容我解釋一下為什么必須這樣做
but let me explain why it's necessary.

369
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,870
副總統隨時可以補充
And the vice president should feel free to jump in.

370
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,370
好玩嗎
But is it fun?

371
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,210
為安德伍德找話說
Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?

372
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,500
我的工作不是這樣的
That's not what I do.

373
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,590
恰好相反
It's more like the opposite.

374
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,760
我只是盡量表達出...
I just try and articulate...

375
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,470
他們的想法和心聲
what's on their minds and in their hearts.

376
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,230
你是這么看待你的工作的
That's how you see your job?

377
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,030
基本上  我的工作就是當個隱形人
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.

378
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,950
那晚上你和他們在一起嗎
Were you with them that night?

379
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,420
吉姆·米勒被殺的那晚
The night Jim Miller was killed?

380
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,170
這我不能回答
I'm not gonna answer that.

381
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,770
那就當作默認
I'll take that as a "yes."

382
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,420
別這樣
Don't.

383
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,690
我只是想了解你的工作
I'm just trying to understand what you do.

384
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,060
那你就弄錯重點了
Then you're missing the point.

385
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,250
我不是主角  史蒂夫  我不是
I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.

386
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,090
你把自己說得可有可無
You make yourself sound replaceable.

387
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,150
事實如此
I am.

388
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,080
-我為總統效勞  -還有第一夫人
- I serve at the pleasure of the president. - And the First Lady?

389
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,650
民主黨副總統候選人
The Democratic vice presidential candidate...

390
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,360
沒錯  還有她
Yeah. Her, too.

391
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,750
但你為他們倆撰寫講稿
But you write speeches for both of them?

392
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,790
更多是為安德伍德夫人寫
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.

393
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,450
將她的想法和心聲表達出來
Articulating what's on her mind and in her heart?

394
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,470
我只是個傳聲筒
I'm just a mouthpiece.

395
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,940
她有交給你其他"任務"嗎
Has she put you in charge of any other parts?

396
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,810
你還是那么混賬
You're still an asshole, man.

397
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,430
祝你贍養費的事好運
Good luck with the alimony.

398
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,900
-真夠嗆  -還算順利吧
- That was rough. - It went fine.

399
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,940
這維系不下去的
It's not sustainable.

400
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,800
你的看法是什么
I mean, what do you think?

401
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,110
-什么的看法  -總統急于宣戰之舉
- About what? - About the president's rush to war.

402
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,810
華府至少有一半人都認為這太過分了
At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.

403
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,160
是很過分
It is outrageous.

404
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,360
我們可以辭職以表示抗議
We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.

405
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,700
我相信我們能說服其他內閣成員一起辭職
I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.

406
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,790
我是想說  目的就是要過分
Outrageous by design, I was going to say.

407
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,180
總統的做法很聰明
It's smart, what the president's doing.

408
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,810
-為他的民調加了分  -唐納德
- It's serving him in the polls. - Donald.

409
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,070
我們先...退幾步說話
Let's... take a step back for a moment.

410
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,410
我低估了你  真的
I underestimated you. I did.

411
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,210
你當代總統時  我對你信心不足
When you were acting president, my faith was less than full.

412
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,120
但現在我能理解你當時的困境和壓力...
But now, I understand the terrible box you were in, the forces--

413
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,620
凱茜  我得...打斷你
Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.

414
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,880
我真的不知道你在說些什么
I honestly don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,290
你是說你的計劃是要
Are you telling me your plan

416
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,920
裝作若無其事直到1月20日總統就職嗎
is just to phone it in until January 20th?

417
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,500
唐納德  你是怎么回事
Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?

418
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,930
想當初
Back in the day,

419
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,910
你和瑪喬莉總是站在
you and Marjorie were at

420
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,120
所有進步革新的最前線
the forefront of every progressive cause,

421
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,980
真正地為善而戰
literally fighting the good fight.

422
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,230
這些人
These people...

423
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,270
我們真要讓他們這么做嗎
Can we really let them do this?

424
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,550
你想緬懷往事  凱茜  好吧
You wanna walk down memory lane, Cathy? Okay.

425
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,570
記得黨代會嗎  記得政治新聞網那篇文章嗎
Remember the convention? Remember the Politico article?

426
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,160
我給了你一條退路
I offered you an out.

427
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,080
你當時就該把握機會下臺
You should've taken that opportunity to resign, then and there.

428
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,560
-當時的情況和現在不同  -沒兩樣
- Circumstances were nothing like this. - Sure they were.

429
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,860
你當時只是不愿認清事實
You just didn't want to see it.

430
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,540
再告訴你一件事
And, just so you know,

431
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,990
在她完全失智前  瑪喬莉就說準了
right before her mind was truly gone, Marjorie called it.

432
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,220
她看出了你和弗蘭克·安德伍德的私下結盟
She saw the unholy alliance you were making with Frank Underwood.

433
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,420
她早就說準了
She called it.

434
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,150
今天我們倆上司的會面...
So this meeting between our bosses today...

435
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,400
總統期待
The president is looking forward to

436
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,410
與馬修斯州長展開有成效的會談
a productive discussion with Governor Matthews.

437
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,530
這里只有我們倆  咱就別說廢話了
There's no one else here. Can we cut the crap?

438
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,030
你要我們刻意壓制投票
You want us to engage in voter suppression.

439
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,090
我不會用那樣的字眼
It's not a phrase I'd ever use.

440
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,650
隨便你  那就稱之為"降低動力"吧
Fine. Call it "motor depression" for all I care.

441
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,730
我們懂的  白人是問題所在
We get it. White people are the problem.

442
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,500
是共和黨人  我懂
Republicans. Understood.

443
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,490
但我的上司并不參加再選
But my boss doesn't happen to be up for reelection.

444
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,280
我洗耳恭聽
I'm listening.

445
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,050
我就說三個字  "熔渣堆"
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."

446
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,300
馬修斯希望環保署把費城郊區
Matthews wants the EPA to name a slag heap

447
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,000
一座熔渣堆列為特別清污地點
on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a Superfund site.

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,180
我高度懷疑這在大選前能實現
I seriously doubt that can happen before the election.

449
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,260
你該克服自我懷疑  道格
I think you should battle your doubts, Doug.

450
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,530
州長愿意讓過去成為往事
The governor is willing to let the past stay in the past.

451
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,190
但除非安德伍德政府
But unless the Underwood administration

452
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,430
備好了上等大禮
is bearing top-tier gifts,

453
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,810
你敢讓前副總統幫忙
you've got a lot of fucking nerve

454
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,340
膽子還真是夠大
asking for favors from the former VP.

455
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,330
但話說回來  如果你能把事情處理好
On the other hand, if you make things right,

456
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,920
馬修斯會做好他該做的
Matthews will do his part.

457
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,270
你應該一向很同情那匹馬吧
Don't you always feel sorry for the horse?

458
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,550
會議室里是誰
Who's in the conference room?

459
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,080
-你是說娘子軍嗎  -什么
- You mean the lady brigade? - What?

460
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,920
就是國安局的法庭審計員
That's what they call the NSA forensic auditors.

461
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,050
我不知道她們今天要來
Yeah, I... I didn't know they were scheduled for today.

462
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,900
她們總這樣  就這么突然出現
That's their routine. They just show up.

463
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,000
國安局就這樣
Welcome to the NSA.

464
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,580
哥們
Hey, boss.

465
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,500
我可以吃嗎  總統先生
May I, Mr. President?

466
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,680
放著就是讓人吃的
Well, that's what they're there for.

467
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,180
我不會占用你太多時間
I won't take up much of your time.

468
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,340
我知道你下午很忙
I know you have a busy afternoon.

469
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,150
-我還是有點時間的  -我很好奇
- Well, I've got a little time. - I'm curious.

470
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,300
為什么委員會先給你打電話
Why do you think the committee decided to call you first?

471
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,580
因為是我要求的
Because I asked them to.

472
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,230
突然要參加
Well, this emergency

473
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,290
你召開的緊急州長會議  所以...
governors' conference of yours came up and, uh...

474
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,840
你肯定記得  我不怎么喜歡特區
I'm sure you recall, I don't much like DC,

475
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,680
所以我想著何不就一次都搞定呢
so I figured why not make it one-stop shopping?

476
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,370
是啊
Yes.

477
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,670
不過我們都知道  行使總統特權
But, of course, we both know that executive privilege

478
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,810
就可以替你省一樁事的
could've negated your having to appear at one of those shops.

479
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,210
吉姆
Jim?

480
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,580
我會幫你解決熔渣堆的事
I'm going to help you with your slag heap.

481
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,230
希望這樣一來我能指望上你
I hope that means that I can count on you.

482
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,570
當然了
Of course that's what it means.

483
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,370
我們是一個小型兄弟會的  都是前副總統
We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.

484
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,250
如果加勒特·沃克去委員會作證
When, and if, Garrett Walker appears before this committee,

485
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,870
你覺得他會...
do you think he'll...

486
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,020
-背叛黨派嗎  -你是說背叛你嗎
- betray the party? - You mean you?

487
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,260
兩者是一回事
Well, that would be the same thing.

488
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,040
我不知道你接替了我副總統的職位
Now, I don't know what really happened

489
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,000
隨后又接替了加勒特總統的職位過程中
on your journey to replace me as vice president

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,920
究竟發生了什么
and then Garrett as president.

491
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,610
我只知道自己的直覺
I only know what my gut tells me.

492
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,980
但我愿意無視我的直覺
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.

493
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,310
總而言之
Bottom line is

494
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,980
我能幫你搞定委員會  也能傷害你
I can help you with this committee or I can hurt you.

495
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,740
我可以說我一無所知
Now, I can say that I know nothing...

496
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,240
我認為加勒特·沃克是個有困擾的人
and that what I saw in Garrett Walker was a troubled man.

497
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,790
我可以只說這些
And I can leave it at that.

498
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,390
你覺得呢
What do you think?

499
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,250
我不能告訴你該怎么做  吉姆
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.

500
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,530
但我可以說  我們副總統不說兩家話
But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,

501
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,610
賓夕法尼亞州的清污工作
that this cleanup in Pennsylvania

502
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,370
價值三億美元和一萬個工作崗位
is gonna be worth about $300 million and 10,000 jobs.

503
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,250
一下午的辛勞能賺來這個不錯了
And that's not bad for an afternoon's work.

504
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,710
我喜歡這條新地毯
I like the new rug.

505
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,640
謝謝  其實都不是我弄的
Oh, thank you. I didn't have much to do with it.

506
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,520
是克萊爾布置的
It was really Claire's design.

507
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,060
很高興見到你  總統先生
Good to see you, Mr. President.

508
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,120
我也是
You, too.

509
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,630
斯坎倫州長
Governor Scanlon.

510
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,440
總統先生
Mr. President.

511
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,150
我一直掛記你
You've been on my mind.

512
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,080
我想跟你上司談談宣戰委員會的事
I wanna talk to your boss about the Declaration of War Committee.

513
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,510
如果
So...

514
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,760
你是想拿欠繳稅款的事來要挾他
if you're hoping to intimidate him because of the back taxes,

515
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,220
就別白費口舌了
you can save your breath.

516
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,270
事情都已經解決干凈了
His closet is back to being clean.

517
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,630
那你的事呢
What about yours?

518
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,100
-你就是個畜生  -我可沒看
- You're a pig. - Hey, I didn't watch it.

519
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,700
我只是傳話的
I'm just the messenger.

520
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,960
-盡管去生發帖人的氣吧  -生著呢
- Be mad at the dude who posted it. - I am.

521
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,790
有很多辦法能解決這個
There are ways to get rid of it.

522
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,220
這是份善意的禮物  讓你知道我是認真的
It's a goodwill gift. To let you know I'm serious.

523
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,430
我猜  早晚我會被傳召
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later, I get called.

524
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,320
如果真這樣  我可以援引第五修正案的權利
And if that happens, I could plead the Fifth.

525
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,800
我也可以跟他們打一天太極
I could press-secretary them all day long.

526
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,090
但我希望還有別的選擇
But I'd like to have another option on the table.

527
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,430
我自己不能做公開證人
Yeah, I can't be a public witness myself...

528
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,370
但你要是能給我提供匿名權和豁免權...
but if you offer me anonymity and immunity...

529
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,200
我可以私下作證
I can testify privately.

530
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,170
告訴委員會"尸體"埋在哪了
Tell the committee where the bodies are buried, so to speak.

531
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,820
我確認一下  你是說
But, just to be clear, you're telling me

532
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,730
你有證據證明總統參與了犯罪活動
you have evidence the president engaged in criminal activity?

533
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,260
不是涉及總統的證據  不
Not evidence regarding the president, no.

534
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,410
我有很多關于他的幕僚長的料
I have a lot of information about his chief of staff.

535
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,770
道格·斯坦普
Doug Stamper.

536
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,400
跟你老板談談  告訴我結果
Talk to your boss. Let me know.

537
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,380
布莉姬特  說句題外話
Uh, Bridget, total non sequitur...

538
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,140
你的脖子真美
You have a very elegant neck.

539
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,100
格雷森先生嗎
Mr. Grayson?

540
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,060
我叫肖恩·杰弗瑞斯  《先驅報》的
Sean Jeffries. I'm with the Herald.

541
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,460
抱歉  沒辦法跟你握手
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.

542
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,900
你在報社待多久了
How long have you been with the paper?

543
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,530
13個月  時尚專欄的
Thirteen months. Style section.

544
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,030
難怪我不認識你
Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.

545
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,070
男人的領帶是心靈的窗戶  
Man's tie is a window into his soul.

546
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,570
我們剛發了一篇相關文章
We just ran a piece on it.

547
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,360
是嗎  那從我的領帶能怎么解讀我
Oh, yeah? So, uh, what does my tie say about me?

548
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
你是個嘔心瀝血的公仆
It says you're a dedicated civil servant

549
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,530
有銀行賬戶可以證明
with the bank account to prove it.

550
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,590
總之  正好認出你了  順便打個招呼
Anyway, recognized you, just wanted to say hi.

551
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,270
當然  除非還能請你喝一杯
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.

552
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,390
你認識卡姆·勞德嗎    
You know, uh, Cam Lawder?

553
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,590
梅賽德斯奔馳的說客
Lobbyist for Mercedes-Benz?

554
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,900
他旁邊是金·菲爾舒克  國防部的
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk, works at the DOD.

555
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,760
那個是蘭迪·博福德
And that's Randy Beauford.

556
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,410
華盛頓死胖子們的私人教練
Personal trainer for fat Washington fucks.

557
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,870
今天下午我們走復古風
We're going old school this afternoon.

558
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,890
來吧  跟我們一起喝一杯
Come on, join us for a quick one.

559
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,790
"傳聲筒"
"Mouthpiece"?

560
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,990
我都不知道他干嗎要接受采訪
I don't know why he was talking to the press in the first place.

561
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,720
毫無疑問  湯姆選這么個詞真是不慎
An unfortunate choice of word for Tom, no doubt.

562
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,500
不過  熱度會很快過去的
But still, it'll play itself out.

563
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,500
但我想知道的是  你看出了什么
But what I want to know is, what do you see?

564
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,000
你為什么不喜歡耶茨
Why don't you like Yates?

565
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,630
湯姆是團隊里很重要的一部分
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.

566
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,660
他的演講一直
His speeches have been--

567
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,960
聽著  他的責任遠不止如此
Oh, look. He has more responsibilities than that.

568
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,390
你知道的  所以你不高興
You know it. So that bothers you.

569
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,710
我只是不希望
I... just wouldn't want

570
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,590
有任何人進行對競選無用的
anyone to infer a personal investment on his part

571
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,850
個人投資
that isn't useful to the campaign.

572
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,090
我只是想表達
I suppose all I'm saying is that

573
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,530
我不會讓第一夫人
I won't let anything happen

574
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,280
或總統先生您出任何事
to the First Lady or you, Mr. President.

575
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,190
我很感激  莉安
I appreciate that, LeAnn.

576
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,820
我們完了  總統先生  原諒我爆粗口
We are fucked, Mr. President. Pardon my French.

577
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,400
我不關心你的粗口  你到底來干什么
I don't care about your French. Why am I even talking to you?

578
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,140
國安局派了審計員來
Well, the NSA has sent in auditors.

579
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,410
要是我不抹去我的檔案  掩蓋我的行蹤
If I don't erase my files, cover my tracks--

580
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,130
我們離選舉只有一周了  麥卡倫先生
We're a week away from the election, Mr. Macallan.

581
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,840
-掩蓋好你的行蹤  -好  這樣的話
- Cover your tracks. - Okay. In which case,

582
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,570
我得讓黑客們暫時
I need to let hackers temporarily

583
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,910
侵入東首都電信的一處轉接中心
invade a Capital East Telecom switching center.

584
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,020
什么意思
Meaning what?

585
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,790
中心承擔了大部分美國政府的網絡流量
Well, the center covers most of the US government cyber traffic.

586
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,660
但我如果登入  并在20分鐘內登出
But if I'm in and out in 20 minutes,

587
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,480
我想損害看上去也就是惡作劇級別的
I think the damage will look mischief-level.

588
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,050
連接故障之類的
Messed-up connections, that sort of thing.

589
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,600
-要是20分鐘沒出來呢  -不會的
- What if it takes you longer? - Uh, it won't,

590
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,690
因為再有十幾二十分鐘...
because another ten, 20 minutes and...

591
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,860
做吧
Do it.

592
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,270
好  我會在下午四點開始
All right. Well, I'll start it at 4:00 p.m.

593
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,540
我一弄完
Uh, as soon as I'm done,

594
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,450
就匿名發送一份修復代碼
I'll anonymously send out a fix to the problem.

595
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,340
-不  -先生
- No. - Sir?

596
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,690
莉安會通知你什么時候發送修復
LeAnn will contact you about when to send out the fix.

597
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,080
-你要等她的消息  -好  不過以防...
- You'll wait for her. - Okay, but just to be--

598
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,330
她會通知你的
She'll let you know.

599
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,760
我剛看了那篇海恩斯的文章
I just saw the Haines article.

600
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,400
我完全不知道湯姆怎么想的
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.

601
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,930
是啊
Yes.

602
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,380
太大意了
It was sloppy.

603
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,100
是啊  我會跟他談的
Agreed. I'll talk to him.

604
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,250
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

605
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,780
紐約怎么樣
How was New York?

606
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,910
我的活動進展順利
My events went well.

607
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,410
然后呢  你有什么沒告訴我的
And? What aren't you telling me?

608
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,330
我遇見肯·卡斯維爾了
I bumped into Ken Caswell.

609
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,450
-他還知道什么情況嗎  -不
- Does he know any more? - No, um...

610
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,260
-你為什么沒回他電話  -什么
- Why didn't you call him back? - What?

611
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,770
他財政部的事  監督立法
His Treasury business. The oversight legislation.

612
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,490
我明白你不在乎這個  無所謂
I understand you don't care about it. Fine.

613
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,390
但你不能無視遺患  你應該聽他說說
But you can't ignore loose ends like that. You owed him your ear.

614
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,040
我沒想到這事會那么傷感情
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna become so personal.

615
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,470
我可是美國總統
I am the President of the United States,

616
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,120
拜托  我有點忙啊
for Christ's sake. I'm a bit busy.

617
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,890
過往不是你一聲令下就能消失  弗蘭西斯
The past doesn't disappear on command, Francis.

618
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,270
哪怕是總統都不行
Not even for presidents.

619
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,080
他對你說什么了
What did he say to you?

620
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,140
肯有張大嘴巴
Ken's got a big mouth.

621
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,530
蒂姆的事我很遺憾  我很抱歉他不在了
I'm sorry about Tim. I'm sorry he's gone.

622
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,740
我知道你對他的感情
I know how you felt about him.

623
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,300
或者我能想象
Or, I can imagine.

624
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,770
聽我說
Listen to me.

625
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,000
你知道我這輩子只真正愛過你一個人
You know you're the only person I've ever truly loved.

626
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,320
你知道的吧
You know that, right?

627
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,620
你聽好
And listen.

628
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,620
有別的事就要發生了
Something else is about to happen.

629
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,000
歡迎回來
Welcome back.

630
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,000
信號不太好  還順利嗎
Reception is sketchy. Good trip?

631
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,880
我只是回來換衣服  馬上就得回去找弗蘭西斯
I just came back to get changed. I need to get back to Francis.

632
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,290
你生我氣了嗎
You mad at me?

633
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,410
你不應該那么說
You shouldn't have said that.

634
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,200
我知道  我知道我們需要小心
I know. I know we need to be careful.

635
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,060
我們可遠遠不止要小心
Careful is far too small a word for what we need to be.

636
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,500
好吧
Okay.

637
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,410
但是你就不累嗎
But don't you get tired of

638
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,820
整天不止要小心
being far bigger than careful all the time?

639
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,110
-我不知道是怎么回事  -我也不知道
- I don't know what's going on. - Me neither.

640
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,660
看來是網絡信號有干擾
Seems to be some kind of network disturbance.

641
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,960
我連不上服務器了
I lost connection on my server.

642
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,550
你知道我煩什么嗎  第一夫人這個角色
You know what I'm tired of? This role. First Lady.

643
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,590
因為感覺一直不對勁
'Cause it's never felt right.

644
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,640
再過八天  我就是副總統了
It's only eight more days to the vice presidency.

645
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,900
-那我的角色是什么  -什么
- What's my role? - What?

646
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,840
話說我到底是你什么人  或者你是我什么人
What am I to you, anyway? Or you, to me?

647
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,320
你是我女朋友嗎
I mean, are you my girlfriend?

648
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,910
等你當選了
And when you win...

649
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,160
那我是不是就成了  第一男友什么的
does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?

650
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,460
第一男寵
First Concubine?

651
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,750
那篇文章的事  我很抱歉
About that article... I'm sorry.

652
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,020
我討厭道歉
I hate apologies.

653
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,880
對不起
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,910
我當時看你了  看你目睹那一幕
I looked over at you. I watched you watching.

655
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,440
-什么時候  -對你有任何影響嗎
- When? - Did it even affect you?

656
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,250
斬首的畫面
The beheading?

657
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,330
問這個干什么
Why would you ask that?

658
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,400
我根本不知道你在想什么
I had no sense of what you were thinking.

659
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,460
完全不知道
None.

660
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,390
我在想什么  我什么都沒想
Of what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking.

661
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,950
我在想  "什么都別想"
I was thinking, "Don't think."

662
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,970
我再跟你說個別的事
And I'll tell you something else.

663
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,270
我可沒說過我喜歡整天小心
I never said I like being careful.

664
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,080
-可惡  -怎么了
- God damn it. - What's wrong?

665
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,280
衛星定位顯示我們還在白宮呢
The GPS thinks we're back at the White House.

666
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,300
你聯系上競選辦公室了嗎
Did you reach the campaign office?

667
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,990
正在打  總是沒信號
Trying. I can't get a signal.

668
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,280
等等  來信號了
Oh, wait. Here we go.

669
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,800
這班飛機我絕不能錯過
I can't miss this flight.

670
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,950
-正在接通  -太好了
- It's ringing. - Good.

671
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,440
-你看還需要多久  -又斷了
- How long do you think? - Now it stopped.

672
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
高速上堵車了  我在盡力了
There's a pile-up on the highway. I'm doing the best I can.

673
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,230
喂
Hello?

674
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,310
喂
Hello!

675
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,320
塔妮婭  我拿你的手機試試
Tanya, let me try your phone.

676
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,680
我的手機也一樣
I'm having the same issues.

677
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,430
你能聯系上辦公室嗎
Can you get through to the office?

678
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,040
不行  州長  打不通
No, Governor, I can't.

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,920
加勒特是個好人
Garrett is a good man.

680
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,320
-他可靠嗎  -當然了  羅梅洛先生
- A trustworthy man? - Absolutely, Mr. Romero.

681
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,460
他是那種
And is he the kind of man

682
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,360
會蓄意參與競選資金欺詐的人嗎
who would knowingly participate in campaign finance fraud?

683
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,520
我不這么認為  不會
I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.

684
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,380
你和安德伍德總統熟悉嗎  先生
How well do you know President Underwood, sir?

685
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,410
我認識總統4年了
I've known the president four years.

686
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,760
是弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood

687
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,750
而不是沃克總統最先建議你辭職的吧
and not President Walker who first suggested you should resign?

688
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,090
據我回憶  不是的
To the best of my recollection, no.

689
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,850
而且你身為總統競選搭檔收到的競選經費
And isn't it true that the source of campaign funds you received

690
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,780
追根溯源  和一起從密蘇里
as the president's running mate was connected to

691
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,970
波及到中國的賄賂案件有聯系吧
a pay-for-play scheme that reached all the way from Missouri to China?

692
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,240
據我所知  不是的
To the best of my knowledge, no.

693
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,800
你們沒通過雷蒙德·塔斯克的公司
Did you receive any campaign donations

694
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,420
克雷頓-維斯特收到任何競選捐助嗎
through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?

695
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,330
據我回憶  沒有
Not to the best of my recollection.

696
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,300
你的回憶和了解
Do you think your recollection

697
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,480
會隨著時間推移而變化嗎
or knowledge will improve as the day goes on?

698
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,510
什么
Excuse me?

699
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,540
貝絲
Beth.

700
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,940
你要向我保證  無論有什么需要
I want you to promise me that you'll call me

701
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,880
都會打給我
anytime you need anything.

702
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,130
你是蒂姆的一生摯愛
You were the love of Tim's life, you know that.

703
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,760
我還是...
Well, I should probably...

704
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,260
對  你也是
Yes. You, too.

705
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
再見
Goodbye.

706
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,700
謝謝你  菲利克斯
Thank you, Felix.

707
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,910
需要我幫你點起來嗎  總統先生
Uh, would you like me to prepare it for you, sir?

708
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,590
不用了  謝謝你
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

709
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,880
首先要問的問題是  進氣口打開了嗎
The first question to ask yourself... "Is the damper open?"

710
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,450
一定不要讓自己被煙霧包圍
Never allow yourself to be overcome with smoke.

711
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,380
火勢要起來  必須要通氣  所以火爐才有格柵
Conflagration relies on airflow. That's what the grate is for.

712
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,140
底下的灰一英寸就夠了
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.

713
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,280
確實有用  但是
It's helpful, but of course

714
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,860
他們清理得太頻繁了
they clean up around here too soon to do that.

715
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,550
至于怎么擺放木材
Now, as for the architecture of the logs,

716
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,670
我建議倒置擺放
I prefer the upside-down method.

717
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,420
大塊木材放在底下
Largest logs right along the base.

718
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,100
上面是中塊的
Then medium-size logs after that.

719
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,820
小塊的
Small logs.

720
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,270
最后  是引火木
And then finally, kindling...

721
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,570
和火絨
and tinder.

722
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,260
當然  家鄉有枯了的棕櫚葉  那個最理想
Now, of course, back home, dead palmetto fronds are ideal.

723
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,040
不過在華盛頓
But, of course, here in Washington,

724
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,250
手邊有什么垃圾都得拿來用
we have to use whatever garbage we find lying around.

725

國會將會追悔莫及

州長  恐怖分子正在襲擊
Governor, aren't you worried about

814
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,490
難道你帶孩子們出門不會擔心嗎

讓孩子在家里更可怕

我有什么想法  你們都看到了
What's on my mind? I mean, you see what's going on here.

都是他干的  一個從沒服過役的人
This is all him. It's a man who's never served.

821

哪怕戰爭咬上他的屁股
Wouldn't know what a real war was

822
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,980
他都認不出來
if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.

823
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,670
還要宣戰
I mean, a declaration of war?

824

他在危及美國人的生命

825
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,660

826
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,260
-你不能亂來  -好啊
- You don't screw around with it. - Why not?

827
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,760
亂來就會變成這樣
This is what happens.

828
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,670
當你濫用"戰爭"這個詞  事情就會變成這樣
This is what happens when you throw around a word like "War."

829
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,270
全都亂作一團
All hell breaks loose.

831
00:50:20,000 --> 00:51:20,000
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}壓制投票的問題是近些年美國兩黨分歧較大  斗爭激烈的一個政治議題
這個問題的核心是  共和黨主張為了防止選舉舞弊
應該在投票時要求選民出示有效的身份證件  但是民主黨認為
由于民主黨選民大多生活窘困  辦理駕照或身份證件很困難
所以要求出示身份證件  實際上就是要阻止底層選民投票
而共和黨反過來指控民主黨這種立場是鼓勵有利于自己的非法移民投票
這一問題在美國多地引發了多起高調的訴訟
一般是一些共和黨占多數的州議會和政府出臺相關法律
要求投票時出示證件  然后支持民主黨的民權組織提起訴訟
稱這種法律違憲  目前美國有多個州的選民證件法面臨法律挑戰
其它壓制投票的方法還有減少投票點  縮短提前投票時間等
