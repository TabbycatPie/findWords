You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.

31
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,610
是為我和克萊爾工作  還是怎么
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?

32
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,070
我已經聯絡了我自己黨派的人
I have already reached out to members of my own party.

33
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,490
但你還是沒回答我的問題
But you're still not answering my question.

34
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,470
我已經回答了
I think I have.

35
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,040
我可以幫你如愿
I can help you get what you want.

36
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,050
我覺得你知道我的愿望
I think you know what I want.

37
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,620
但你是現在想要  還是四年后要
But do you want it now or in four years?

38
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,790
-拿上這個  -不行
- Take this. - No.

39
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,280
拿著  至少上飛機之前要拿著  好嗎
Come on. At least until you get on the flight, okay?

40
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,420
我撤了
I'm out.

41
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,930
別去見沃克
Don't meet with Walker.

42
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,000
這會提醒他  他最好該怎么做
It'll remind him of his best course of action.

43
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,830
我也曾是美國總統
I was once the President of the United States.

44
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,030
然后總統之位被你偷走了  弗蘭克
You stole the presidency, Frank.

麗薩
Lisa...

46
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,520
她是個隱患  是個癮君子
She's a loose end and an addict.

47
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,050
這兩樣合在一起很糟
That's a bad combination.

48
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,850
我建議我的委托人
I am advising my client

49
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,200
目前行使第五修正案的權利
to plead the Fifth at this time...

50
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,440
其實  我愿意回答議員的問題
Actually, I will answer the congressman's questions.

51
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,880
一定會有出路的  弗蘭西斯
There has to be a way out, Francis.

52
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,700
是嗎
Does there?

53
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,120
加勒特·沃克的證詞非常確鑿
Garrett Walker's testimony couldn't be more damning.

54
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,930
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德是中國資金
Francis Underwood is front and center in a scheme

55
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,890
影響美國選舉的陰謀的罪魁禍首
that had Chinese money influencing an American election.

56
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,790
這是一位聲名狼藉  懷恨在心的前總統的證詞
Testimony from a disgraced and disgruntled former president.

57
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,550
他為什么現在才發聲
Why is he just speaking up now?

58
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,750
你是說他們不應該
Well, are you suggesting that they shouldn't...

59
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,020
重視沃克的話嗎
take what Walker said seriously? I mean...

60
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,930
如果是真的  為什么沉默了那么久
If it's true, why stay silent so long?

61
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,090
一旦事態升級
Which is a question I'm sure

62
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,470
我相信司法委員會一定會問這個問題
the Judiciary Committee will ask once it's up and going.

63
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,910
據我所知  彈劾狀最早會在周末前
My sources say articles of impeachment could be voted on

64
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,450
進行投票表決
as early as the end of the week.

65
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,140
眾議院沒那么有效率
Now as if the House is that efficient.

66
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,750
沃克總統才是該被審查的人
Look, President Walker is the one who should be scrutinized here.

67
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,770
他見人說人話  見鬼說鬼話
He's talking out of both sides of his mouth.

68
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,470
別忘了
And let's not forget,

69
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,800
他過去還有
he has had some emotional problems

70
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,110
-情緒問題  -安德伍德被考慮
- in the past. - Underwood has disrespected

71
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,620
作為國務卿人選之前
the presidency since before he was thought of

72
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,400
-就藐視總統一職  -你被這宣傳攻勢蒙蔽了
- for Secretary of State... - You seem blinded by this crusade.

73
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,310
-當時他還是黨鞭  -你們  等等
- ...when he was nothing more than the House Whip. - You guys, wait.

74
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,000
如果安德伍德被彈劾  那么
If Underwood is impeached, then...

75
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,870
那只是假設  這很危險
That's a hypothetical. It's dangerous.

76
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,840
沒錯
Fair. Well...

77
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,840
湯姆  總統被彈劾后
Tom, where would impeachment leave

78
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,300
副總統克萊爾·安德伍德會怎樣
Vice President Claire Underwood?

79
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,380
進入總統辦公室  當總統
In the Oval, as president.

80
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,170
如果那樣的話
What their arrangement would be,

81
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,220
他們會怎么辦  就難說了
in that case, is anybody's guess.

82
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,430
賽斯  第一夫婦現在情況如何
Seth, what is this like right now for the first couple?

83
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,520
他們在回避這些紛擾
They're avoiding all of this distraction.

84
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,350
他們在繼續為美國人民服務
They're continuing to do the work of the American people.

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,270
-黨內警告  -不行
- Censure. - No.

86
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,360
我理解馬克的意思
I see Mark's point.

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,220
根本不可能阻止眾議院的共和黨人
There is no way to stop the Republicans in the House.

88
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,670
沃克不是可信的證人
Walker's not a reliable witness.

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,920
他的證詞能被核實嗎
Is what he said verifiable?

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,370
所以彈劾在所難免
So, impeachment is inevitable.

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,680
好吧  那只是假設
Well, that's... that's a presumption.

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,020
民主黨掌權的參議院
The Democratic Senate

93
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,250
不會愿意彈劾民主黨總統
will not be inclined to remove a Democratic president.

94
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,690
但他們需要政治掩護
But they need political cover.

95
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,390
黨內警告能滿足他們
Censure will help them with that.

96
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,460
他們可能提出其他的懲罰
I mean, they might propose other penalties,

97
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,450
罰款  譴責聲明
a fine, a statement of condemnation

98
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,530
但他們不會去證實犯罪行為
but they'll stop short of finding criminal wrongdoing.

99
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,410
但如果進展得快  大家都能繼續前進了
And if it happens quickly, everyone can move on.

100
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,860
你倆私下商量過這件事嗎
Did you two get together on this privately?

101
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,770
沒有
No.

102
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,070
弗蘭西斯  這是挽救你第一任期的辦法
Francis, this is one way to salvage your first term.

103
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,720
沃克本該保持沉默的
Walker was supposed to plead the Fifth.

104
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,330
事情出現了意外變化
Well, things took an unexpected turn.

105
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,950
對  他違背了協議
Yes. He went back on his deal,

106
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,370
因為他和自己的證詞一樣不可靠
because he's as pliable as his testimony.

107
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,920
馬克  我不會被眾議院彈劾
Mark, I will not be impeached in the House

108
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
那絕對到不了參議院
and it will never get to the Senate.

109
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,370
我們要讓加勒特·沃克名譽掃地
We will destroy Garrett Walker's credibility

110
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,470
這事便會不攻自破
and the case will fall apart.

111
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,430
好吧
Okay.

112
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,550
我能得到豁免權嗎
Can I get immunity?

113
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,460
看你能提供什么信息
Depends on what you give them.

114
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,910
我會聯系副主席
I'll reach out to a ranking member,

115
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,480
但你無法匿名
but you're not gonna get anonymity...

116
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,370
凱茜
Cathy.

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,680
-簡  -你好
- Jane. - Hello?

118
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,350
我為你牽腸掛肚  你能相信發生這種事嗎
You've been on my mind. Can you believe what's going on?

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,780
抱歉失陪一下
Excuse me for a moment.

120
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,830
就像我母親說的  "簡直是一團亂麻"
As my mother used to say, "It's a red hot mess."

121
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,490
弗蘭克·安德伍德倒霉不代表你也得遭殃
Frank Underwood's demise doesn't have to be yours.

122
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,440
還有許多非營利性
There are non-profits,

123
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
民間組織非常希望和你合作
NGOs that would be dying to work with you.

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,350
據我所知  我的工作還沒丟
Well, as far as I know, I still have a job.

125
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,950
當然沒有
No, of course.

126
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,290
但誰知道他們接下來會去查誰
But who knows who they'll come after next?

127
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,590
我本來就不是核心圈子的人
I was never part of their inner circle.

128
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,230
你找莫琳很聰明  她是個好律師
You were smart to go with Maureen. She's a good lawyer.

129
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,940
要說誰能幫你全身而退  就是她了
If someone can find you an exit, it's her.

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,010
我不會就這么輕易退場的
Well, I'm not gonna go away easily,

131
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,340
所以多謝你的關心  簡
so thank you for your concern, Jane.

132
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
我是關心
It is concern.

133
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,120
你認為副總統
do you think the vice president

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,890
知道這些事情嗎
had any knowledge of this stuff?

135
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,760
我說了  我真的不知道
Well, as I said, I have no idea.

136
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,950
如果克萊爾挺過這關  成了總統
If... if Claire survives this and becomes president,

137
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,750
那你要怎么辦
where does that leave you?

138
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,410
我好歹也打拼了三十多年  簡
Well, I've been at this for 30 years, Jane,

139
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
我想我還是能挺過去的
so I think I can survive.

140
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,350
親愛的  我不是想嚇唬你
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to alarm you.

141
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,400
我也沒害怕
I'm not alarmed.

142
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,260
我只是想說
All I'm trying to say,

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,830
我支持你
I'm on your side.

144
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,450
如果是在繼續當總統還是下臺之間選擇的話
If it's the difference in being in office or being out,

145
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,960
我們可以想辦法繞過去
we can work around that.

146
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,780
戴著手銬想辦法吧
Working in handcuffs.

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,060
黨內警告是個挫折  但還沒有輸
Censure is a setback. It's not a loss.

148
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,610
你還真是自信滿滿  執拗得很啊
You're very confident and very insistent.

149
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,830
我們會撐過去的  弗蘭西斯
We can come out of this, Francis.

150
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,860
你是說你自己吧
No, you mean you can.

151
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,150
哪怕就一次  你能不能
Can you, for once,

152
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,560
干脆點  接受開價  別再還價了
just take something at face value instead of fighting it?

153
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,760
就好像我過去造的孽能洗清似的
As if I can be washed clean of past sins.

154
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,070
-你認識我多久了  -很久了
- How long have you known me? - Forever.

155
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,600
那你有多了解我
How well do you know me?

156
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,290
就算你克萊爾·安德伍德
How, in your wildest imagination,

157
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,770
再怎么盡情發動想象力
could you, Claire Underwood,

158
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,010
也不該以為我會接受這個
think I would be okay with this?

159
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,240
求你考慮一下吧
Think about it, please.

160
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,090
這關乎我的總統之位
This is the fate of my presidency!

161
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,880
人民想原諒你
The people want to forgive you.

162
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,250
接受吧
Let them.

163
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,290
快點出來  再給我講講
Come out here already. Give me the rest of it.

164
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,700
漢默施密特是個徹頭徹尾的工作狂
Hammerschmidt is a straight-up workaholic.

165
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,170
但是他就快查出什么了
But... he's getting close.

166
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,820
線索慢慢拼湊起來了
Putting the pieces together.

167
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,230
他還查得這么起勁做什么
What's he still grinding so hard for?

168
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,520
看來沃克就要扳倒安德伍德了
Looks like Walker's gonna bring Underwood down.

169
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,210
我不想再談工作了
I don't wanna do this anymore.

170
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,080
佐伊·巴恩斯  瑞秋·波斯納
Zoe Barnes. Rachel Posner.

171
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,490
肖恩  別說了
Sean, please, I...

172
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,950
是我想把他的調查拉回來
I was the one trying to get him back on that.

173
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,160
-結果害得我被解雇了  -能不說這些了嗎
- That's what got me fired. - Can we stop talking about this?

174
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,510
-我的酒呢  -別這樣
- Where's my drink? - Don't do that.

175
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,350
看著我  看我
Look at me. Look.

176
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,960
我這就  不說了
This is me... not talking.

177
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,390
過來  過來
Come here. Come here.

178
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,490
如果有我能幫忙的地方  就告訴我
But if I can be of any help, you let me know.

179
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,490
看我不收拾你
You're gonna get it.

180
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,620
讓我也喝一口
Give me a taste of that.

181
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,460
慢點
Slow down.

182
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,930
靠邊停
Pull over!

183
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,250
你今天騎得很使勁啊  總統先生  還好嗎
You're going pretty hard, Mr. President. You okay?

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,070
對于一個命運懸而未決的人來說  夠好的了
Well enough for a man whose fate is hanging in the balance.

185
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,900
不對
No.

186
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,850
你的命運已經定了
Your fate is sealed.

187
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,990
怎么說
Oh, how's that?

188
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,630
你又"預見"到了什么了嗎  艾瑞克
You have a vision for me, Eric?

189
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,660
就算你被彈劾定罪
Even if you're impeached and convicted...

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,220
你還是會創造歷史
you still make history.

191
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,390
奧古斯都·安德伍德只是又一個
Augustus Underwood was just another redneck

192
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,230
選錯了立場的農民罷了
who died fighting for the wrong side,

193
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,350
除了你和我沒人記得住他
forgotten by everyone but you and me.

194
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,650
但如果弗蘭西斯·安德伍德下臺了呢
But if Francis Underwood is removed from office?

195
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
你的遺產也不會消散
Your legacy won't die.

196
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,480
反而會更加牢固
It'll be solidified.

197
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,590
你會遺臭萬年
You'll be infamous.

198
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,550
政治遺產和遺臭萬年可不是一回事
Legacy and infamy are not the same thing.

199
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,030
你將被人銘記  誰在乎原因呢
You'll be remembered. Who cares why?

200
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,510
我得回去了
I have to get back.

201
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,670
等等  聽我解釋一下
Hold up. Let me explain.

202
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,740
弗蘭西斯
Francis.

203
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,350
弗蘭西斯
Francis.

204
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,310
弗蘭西斯
Francis?

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,470
我說清楚
Just to be clear,

206
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,290
我其實一直都知道你在看著我
it's not that I haven't always known you were there.

207
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,140
只是我對你的情感很復雜
It's that I have mixed feelings about you.

208
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,240
我質疑你的意圖
I question your intentions...

209
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,850
而且我對關注感到矛盾
and I'm ambivalent about attention.

210
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,970
但別當我是針對你
But don't take it personally.

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,470
我對每個人的感覺幾乎都是這樣的
It's how I feel about most everybody.

212
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,890
我們怎能相信他說的話呢
How can we trust anything he says?

213
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,920
加勒特·沃克任總統期間一直在用藥
Garrett Walker was medicated while he was in office.

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,140
這我們都知道
We all know that.

215
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,660
不  這不是論據  這是事實
No, it's not a talking point. It's the truth.

216
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,870
我們不知道他具體用的什么藥
We don't know exactly what he was taking.

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,670
私下說
Off the record...

218
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,270
你能告訴我湯姆·漢默施密特在忙什么嗎
can you tell me what Tom Hammerschmidt's working on?

219
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,790
拜托  你們倆在那兒就沒有交集嗎
Come on, you two don't cross paths over there?

220
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,470
他為了一篇報道聯系過我
He reached out to me on a story.

221
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,880
之后就沒回音了
I never heard back.

222
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,300
好  謝謝
Okay. Thank you.

223
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,980
隨便你相不相信他說的
You can believe what he's saying or not.

224
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,000
但加勒特·沃克在服藥...
But Garrett Walker was taking serious medication...

225
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,570
千萬不要把一個陌生的U盤
Never... never put an unknown flash drive

226
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,250
插在聯網的電腦上  千萬不要
into a networked computer. Never.

227
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,980
你不用一直說這話
You don't have to keep telling me.

228
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,130
-是我叫你來的  記得嗎  -記得
- I called you, remember? - Yeah.

229
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,930
好  看看能糟糕到哪里去
Okay. Do your worst.

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,570
好  目前來看都還好
Okay. So far so good.

231
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
有東西
There is something.

232
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,330
謝謝
Thank you.

233
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,630
我得掛了
I have to go.

234
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,030
沒事吧
Everything okay?

235
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,130
-現在不方便  -今晚見
- Not now. - See you tonight?

236
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,720
等我忙完了給你打回去
I'll call you when I'm done.

237
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,000
我覺得出現了泄密者
I think there's a leak.

238
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,550
安德伍德政府的
In the Underwood Administration.

239
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,650
不知道
No idea.

240
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,980
不  這話說得有點早
Well, no, that's a little premature.

241
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,990
這不是水門事件  現在還不是
This isn't Watergate... yet.

242
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,040
嗯
Yeah.

243
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,490
好
Okay.

244
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,410
艾力克斯
Alex.

245
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,140
司法委員會是不可能了
So... Judiciary won't be happening for you.

246
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,390
只有零星幾個民主黨人的位置
Just the few slots for Democrats.

247
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,420
都剛被領導層安排了
Leadership just filled those

248
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,920
保守派民主黨人  抱歉
with a couple of old Blue Dogs. Sorry.

249
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,580
有一件事你倒是說對了
Well, you were right about one thing.

250
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,750
加勒特的證詞沒有讓我交到朋友
Garrett's testimony did not make me any friends.

251
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,630
在你們黨不行
Not in your party, no.

252
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,330
今天早晨  我正式成為無黨派議員了
Well, as of this morning, I'm officially an independent.

253
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,880
我覺得共和黨能給我在司法委員會找個差事
I think the GOP can find me a place on judiciary.

254
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,240
-好吧  艾力克斯  -這一步很明智
- Okay, Alex. - It's a good move.

255
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,600
四年后
Four years from now,

256
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
我覺得選民們會想要一個局外人的
I think an outsider's what the voter will be looking for.

257
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
是啊  未來屬于第三黨候選人
Yeah, third-party candidate is the future,

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,970
而且永遠都是
and always will be.

259
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,230
加勒特·沃克為什么改主意了
Why did Garrett Walker change his mind?

260
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,310
不是我讓他改主意的
It wasn't me who made that happen.

261
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,900
我不知道
I don't know.

262
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,110
有時我們不知為何  但事情就發生了
Sometimes things happen without us knowing why.

263
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,090
他們逮捕了一個他們明知清白的人
They arrested someone they knew was innocent.

264
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,560
-斯坎倫州長否認了  -他當然會了
- Governor Scanlon denies it. - Of course he does.

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,520
-而國安局無可奉告  -一貫如此
- And the NSA has no comment. - As a rule.

266
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,620
不行  出去
No, out. Get out.

267
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,850
請五分鐘后再來
Five minutes, please.

268
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,730
謝謝
Thank you.

269
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,940
聯調局確認他們逮捕了卡拉比
The FBI confirms that they arrested Kalabi

270
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,240
他正在候審  但僅此而已
and that he's awaiting trial, but that's all.

271
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,750
沒錯  僅此而已
That's right, that's all.

272
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,640
但是有聯調局的探員
But there are agents in the FBI

273
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,830
對此案的處理方式很不滿
who were not happy with the way this went down.

274
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,680
而且沒有一個人允許我們
And not one of them will let us

275
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,600
公開他們的姓名
use their name on the record.

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
我們無法核實
We can't confirm the story.

277
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,360
湯姆  這么大的事沒有消息源是不能發的
Tom, we can't run a story this big without a source.

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,430
-我知道  -本報從來沒這么做過
- No. I know. I know. - This paper has never done that.

279
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,600
-我知道  -誰知道是什么人給你發的
- I know. - Who knows who sent you this?

280
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

281
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,450
我需要你幫我放個料出去
I need you to float something out for me.

282
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,350
給頭條網
Give it to Slugline.

283
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,850
你要我怎么說
What do you want me to say?

284
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,340
就說你在辦公室偶然看到
You picked it up here in the office.

285
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,730
雖然沒查實
It's not confirmed...

286
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,030
但似乎值得報道
but it seems like a story.

287
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,740
去印出來吧
Go ahead and print it.

288
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,350
我對你這么做完全不知情
And I had no idea you're doing this.

289
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,820
操  我操  操操操
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

290
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,920
在我看來
Well, it looks to me like

291
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,060
安德伍德團隊錯誤逮捕了一名
the Underwood campaign had a Muslim visiting the US

292
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,410
訪美穆斯林  就為了
wrongly arrested in order to

293
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,370
能在大選日影響選情
influence the vote on Election Day.

294
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,600
如果你相信這個
And if you believe that,

295
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,930
那你就不得不質疑
then you have to ask some questions

296
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,580
這對田納西州選情的影響有多大
about the impact this had on the results in Tennessee,

297
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,490
當時各方均預計安德伍德總統會輸掉田州
where President Underwood was predicted to lose.

298
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,080
我們都知道哈里發國的威脅是真實的
We all know that ICO is a real threat.

299
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,410
沒人否認這一點  而且我
Nobody is denying that, and I...

300
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,100
今天不要轉接電話進來
No calls get through to me, not today.

301
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,770
如果有媒體問你
And if you get pressed,

302
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,380
就說白宮目前沒有任何評論
the White House has no comment at this time.

303
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,200
好  先生
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,390
拜托你人走關門
Close the door behind you, please.

305
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,560
這事你知道多少
What do you know about this?

306
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,780
首先  你這么問什么意思
First of all, what are you getting at?

307
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,880
其次  如果我知情的話
And secondly, if I had any information,

308
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,580
我也肯定不會瞞著不報
I wouldn't be keeping it to myself.

309
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,250
賽斯  我就跟你直說了
Seth, I am asking you straight up.

310
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,700
如果你知道什么  現在就告訴我
If you know anything, you tell me now.

311
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,590
-別等我動手去查  -不然呢
- Don't make me find out. - Or what?

312
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,830
你想怎么辦  道格
What are you gonna do, Doug?

313
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,560
拿白宮馬克杯悶死我嗎
You gonna suffocate me with a White House mug?

314
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,250
局面已經失控了
The shit is hitting the fan

315
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,530
如果我們再不趕快動手
and we're all going to be covered in it

316
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,860
就都會被牽連進去
if we don't get to work.

317
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,820
請問  我可以繼續忙了嗎
Now... can I please get back to it?

318
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,180
媽的
Shit.

319
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,610
我們只需要啟動
We're essentially turning on

320
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,720
一臺早已就位的設備
an apparatus that's already in place.

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,820
我們會打開音頻接收
We'll enable audio capabilities.

322
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,000
所有電話  電郵和短信
All calls, e-mails, messages

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,390
進出白宮的一切通訊
in and out of the White House

324
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,390
都會被監控歸檔
will be monitored and archived.

325
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,460
搜索泄密者期間每通電話都會被錄音
Every phone call will be recorded as we search for the leak.

326
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,830
視頻監控呢
Video surveillance?

327
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,520
我們可以再加裝設備
We can install additional devices,

328
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,540
-可是  -用現成的就行
- but... - We use what's already there.

329
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,330
我們將能夠監視監聽白宮所有職員的
It enables us to look and listen in on every computer

330
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,210
每一臺電腦和手機
and every cell phone of everyone working for us.

331
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,810
我們會成立一個衛星監控辦公室
We'll set up a satellite office

332
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,930
成員僅限我本人和斯坦普先生
limited to Mr. Stamper and myself.

333
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,980
格林助理局長和我
Assistant Director Green and I

334
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,550
會匯報任何有價值的情報
will bring whatever is valuable forward.

335
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,330
我想要直接訪問權
I want direct access.

336
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,790
實時影像
Live streaming.

337
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,870
我向您保證  總統先生
I assure you, Mr. President,

338
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,890
有什么有用內容我們都會呈遞給您
we'll bring you anything of substance.

339
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,640
去吧
Do it.

340
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,810
不用說
And needless to say...

341
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,920
我只向您匯報  先生
I report only to you, sir.

342
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,520
我要知道是誰在坑我
I wanna know who did this to me.

343
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,880
我去查  先生
I'm on it, sir.

344
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,480
你對道格有顧慮嗎
You're having doubts about Doug?

345
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
-怎么  你有嗎  -沒有  就是
- Why? Are you? - No, I'm just...

346
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,770
我現在大概質疑一切了
I'm questioning everything, I guess.

347
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,380
這事解決之前
Until this is resolved,

348
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,720
你和我對于我們的言行
you and I should be very careful

349
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,100
要萬分小心了
about what we say or do.

350
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,200
我們的私人需求得放到一邊
And our personal needs have to be put aside.

351
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,300
你了解一些人  認識他們多年
You know people. You know them for years.

352
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,920
而突然  他們就像出現在你廚房里的陌生人
And then... suddenly they're like strangers in your kitchen.

353
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,730
熟悉和陌生只有一線之隔
Familiar can turn foreign on a dime.

354
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,990
-我能做什么嗎  -你可以別妄動
- Is there anything I can do? - You can be quiet.

355
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,140
道格  我可不是泄密者  你知道的
Doug, I am not the leak here. You know that.

356
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,470
-我會再聯系  -別掛
- I'll be in touch. - Don't hang up.

357
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,580
要我列出我為本屆政府
Do I need to make a list of the risks

358
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,080
冒的風險嗎
I've taken for this administration?

359
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,990
都是我從未做過的事
Things I have never done before.

360
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,410
我們當面談吧  好嗎
Let's just talk in person, okay?

361
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,870
誰啊
Yes?

362
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,700
請找莉安·哈維
LeAnn Harvey, please.

363
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,260
-是誰  -聯調局
- Who is it? - FBI.

364
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,460
如果你能想到什么
If you think of anything,

365
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
名片最下面是我的手機號
that's my cell at the bottom of the card.

366
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,640
是自殺嗎
Was it a suicide?

367
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,330
槍管抵著他的眼睛
Barrel of the gun was pressed against his eye, so...

368
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,620
你是他的聯系人  他會做出這樣的事嗎
You were his contact. Would he do something like that?

369
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,210
我覺得不會
I don't think so.

370
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,810
或許他沒有
Well, maybe he didn't.

371
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,580
-那槍呢  -問題就在這里
- And the gun? - That's the thing.

372
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,830
不見了
It's not there.

373
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,820
或許是酒店的住客或員工拿走了
Maybe someone staying at the hotel or working there took it.

374
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,090
你們會告知我吧
You'll let me know?

375
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,630
當然
Yeah. Sure.

376
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,910
馬克
Mark...

377
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,840
副總統和我商量了
the vice president and I have discussed it and...

378
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,780
我們接受你的立場了
we've come around to your position.

379
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,750
很好
Very good.

380
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,150
鑒于現在爆出的新聞
Uh, considering the news that's breaking,

381
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,760
恐怕不會那么容易了
it's not going to be quite as easy.

382
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,270
知道消息是哪來的嗎
Any idea where this story came from?

383
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,480
還不知道  但很快就會知道
No, not yet. But I will soon.

384
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,270
我會告訴他們你愿接受黨內警告
I'll let it be known that you're open to censure.

385
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,600
你該知道
And you should be aware.

386
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,370
這并不意外
It's not surprising.

387
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,920
羅梅洛要進入司法委員會了
Romero is moving over to the Judiciary Committee.

388
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,510
他為什么不呢
Well, why wouldn't he?

389
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,660
他想把這事做到底  他還沒放過我呢
He wants to see this through. He's still coming after me.

390
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,430
我猜兩方的領導層都已經受夠他了吧
Well, I imagine leadership from both parties has had enough of him.

391
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,550
嗯  我不想往小了說
Yeah, I don't want to diminish this.

392
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,820
我們在控制損失
We are in damage control.

393
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,000
克萊爾  我覺得
Claire, I think...

394
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,940
或許你最好還是
it might be best for you to

395
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,920
盡量別摻和這事
stay out of this as much as possible.

396
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,520
不  我要維護總統
No, I... I will defend the president.

397
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,020
我覺得最好是
Vice presidential business as usual

398
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,980
副總統一切照舊
is the way to play it, I think.

399
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,840
這事你得相信我的直覺
You need to trust my instincts on this one.

400
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,460
-好  -謝謝  馬克
- Okay. - Thank you, Mark.

401
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,510
謝謝
Thank you.

402
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,410
你可能并不總同意他  但你喜歡他
You may not always agree with him, but you like him.

403
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,650
我喜歡他清醒的頭腦
I like his clarity.

404
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,260
別忘了  他的候選人輸了
Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.

405
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,370
而現在他為你工作
And now he works for you.

406
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,300
不  我覺得他其實在為你工作  不是嗎
No, I think he's really working for you, isn't he?

407
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,810
別疑神疑鬼  弗蘭西斯
Don't get paranoid, Francis.

408
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,550
現在不  更待何時
If not now, when?

409
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,590
你得走了
You have to go.

410
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,130
什么
I what?

411
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,540
你得離開
You need to leave.

412
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,270
發生什么了
What's happened?

413
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,710
這里就是容不下你了
There's just no place for you here anymore.

414
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,400
你考慮過了嗎
Have you been thinking about this?

415
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
是的
Yes.

416
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,050
我不同意
I don't agree.

417
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,350
我說得很明白了
I'm completely clear about it.

418
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,050
你可以喝完你的咖啡
You can finish your coffee.

419
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,110
你怎么做到的
How do you do that?

420
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,250
就那樣關閉感情
Just... turn off like that?

421
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,770
走吧  湯姆
Please go, Tom.

422
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,290
走
Go.

423
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,480
好吧
Okay.

424
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,440
如果這是你的選擇
If that's what you choose.

425
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,970
也來點
Join us?

426
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,850
算了  我不想把新肝也喝壞
No, I'm trying not to wear out the new model.

427
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,780
什么事你們大駕光臨
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

428
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,100
我就直說了  弗蘭克
Well, I'll get right to it, Frank.

429
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,660
眾議院的共和黨人終于有一次
Well, for once, the House Republicans...

430
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,430
能完成工作了
are getting something done.

431
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,680
壞消息是  那就是彈劾你
And the bad news is, is that thing is impeaching you.

432
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,970
我覺得司法委員會
Oh, I think the judiciary

433
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,850
離做出決定還差得遠呢
is a long way from making any sort of decision.

434
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,070
我得知  他們接下來幾天里就會把
They're sending articles of impeachment to the House

435
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,110
彈劾狀送交眾議院
in the next few days, I'm told.

436
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,060
而今早的新聞更是火上澆油
And that news this morning is just adding fuel to the fire.

437
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,680
天吶
Jesus Christ.

438
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,770
我是來問你是否...
And I'm here to ask if you...

439
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,860
你是否能考慮辭職
Would you consider resigning

440
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,930
而不是把這事扯到參議院去
instead of dragging this through the Senate?

441
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,910
你們倆瘋了嗎
Have the two of you lost your minds?

442
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,750
你  泰瑞  你自己也在受調查
And you, Terry, you're under investigation yourself

443
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,170
你還敢跑來跟我說這話
and you dare come here and ask me this?

444
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,890
我經常恨你恨得牙根癢
I've often hated your guts,

445
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,940
但我承認  我會懷念你的
but I have to admit, I'll miss you.

446
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,670
鮑勃  別忘了
Oh, Bob, in case you've forgotten,

447
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,130
參議院是民主黨的
the Senate is Democratic.

448
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,740
-我短時間內不會走人的  -不是你
- I won't be leaving anytime soon. - Oh, not you.

449
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,560
是我  我已經干不動了
Me. I'm getting too old for this.

450
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,560
什么
What?

451
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,410
眾議院離了鮑勃·博奇不得面目全非了
A House without Bob Birch? It will be unrecognizable.

452
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,490
我覺得已經是這樣了  天吶
I feel like it already is. God...

453
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,900
一直都是這么骯臟的嗎
Was it always this dirty?

454
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,320
那不可能
That's impossible.

455
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,230
我們的先輩就要更干凈些嗎
Were the men before us any more moral?

456
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,660
更配得上他們所處的位置
Any more worthy of the power and position

457
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,750
和所擁有的權力嗎
that they had found themselves in?

458
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,650
更有能力為公眾牟利嗎
Any more capable of doing a single goddamn thing for the public?

459
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,260
也是  也不是
Well, yes and no.

460
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,720
歷史總是看上去比實際上要好
History has a way of looking better than it was.

461
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,090
或許莎士比亞是對的
Or perhaps Shakespeare was right.

462
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,230
我們都是瘋子給瞎子帶路
We're all just madmen leading the blind.

463
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,650
李女士  我是白宮的賽斯·格雷森

等一下  我查查我的筆記
Give me a second. Let me just check my notes.

對  他在做一篇捐贈名單的報道
Yeah, he's working on a story about the donor list,

470
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,350
就是總統接受移植期間的事
around the time of the president's transplant.

471
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,740
不知你能不能來一趟
I was wondering if you could come in

472
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,200
我們好協調一下回應
and we can coordinate our response.

473
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,150
李女士  我們不希望大家認為
Ms. Lee, we don't want people to think

474
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,110
總統得到了特殊待遇
that the president got preferential treatment.

475
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,410
天吶
Jesus.

476
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,790
你給了我什么啊  麥卡
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

477
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,120
天啊
Jesus.

478
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,640
你給了我什么啊  麥卡
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

479
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,310
我有關于頭條網爆料來源的消息
I had a tip on where that Slugline story came from.

480
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,240
你該打給我的
You should have called me.

481
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,150
那也阻止不了什么
That wouldn't have stopped it.

482
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,070
-你是為這事而來嗎  -不  我有別的消息
- Is that why you're here? - No, I got something else.

483
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,070
說吧
Tell me.

484
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,260
我想跟副總統聊聊
I'd like to talk to the vice president about it.

485
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,720
那不可能
That's not possible.

486
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,200
一切都要經過我
Everything goes through me.

487
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,300
我之前沒機會解釋清楚
Well, I didn't have a chance to explain myself.

488
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,870
太可惜了
That's too bad.

489
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,650
她什么樣
What's she like?

490
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,780
她不忍受愚蠢  也不給人第二次機會
She doesn't suffer fools and she doesn't give second chances.

491
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,830
如果你不能讓我再跟她見面
Well, if you can't get me in to talk to her again,

492
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,780
我會另想辦法
I'll find some other way.

493
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,220
你沖昏頭了
You're in over your head.

494
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,570
要么告訴我你知道什么  要么滾蛋
Tell me what you know or move along.

495

不
No.

496

我們沒有  漢默施密特先生
We don't, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

497
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,110
不管你掌握了什么信息
Whatever information you have...

498
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,660
別再打給我了
Don't call me again.

499
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,370
我還擔心我那天晚上說錯話了
I was concerned I was out of line the other night.

500
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,930
或許吧
You might have been.

501
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,780
對不起  我有時候口不擇言

算了
Forget it.

503
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,890

我需要告訴你我的想法

508
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,560
不  你為什么不愿聽我想說的話
No. Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you?

聽著  你...夠了
Listen. You... enough.

你是怎么了  你為什么不愿聽
What's wrong with you? Why don't you wanna hear

513
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,770
-我想說的話  -我沒怎么

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,490
但你得回家了
But you need to go home.

515
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,470
是你找我的  是你叫我來的
You reached out to me. You brought me in. I...

516
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,370
夠了
Enough.

517
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,460
-對不起  -他不在

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,620

不管是什么  我可以轉交給他
Whatever it is, I can give it to him.

520

你可以托給我轉交的  道格

521
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,770
-沒叫你跟蹤湯姆·耶茨啊  -有的
- You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates. - Yes, I was.

522
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,110
總統說要監視每個人
According to the president, everyone needs to be watched.

523
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,240
湯姆都不在這里了
Tom's not even here anymore.

524
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,780
弗蘭西斯叫你跟蹤他的嗎
Francis asked you to follow him?

525
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,160
我擔心一個人
I'm concerned about someone.

526
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,920
勞拉·莫雷蒂
Laura Moretti.

527
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,710
我知道她  和她丈夫的事
I know about her... and her husband.

528
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,760
你的行為是判斷不佳的表現  道格
Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug,

529
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,180
而且可能連累總統
and could be a liability for the president.

530
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,900
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,290
等弗蘭西斯回來把這給他
Give these to Francis when he gets back.

532
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,200
我可以給你拿到豁免權
I can get you immunity.

533
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,960
你只需要講出真話
You just need to tell the truth.

534
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,250
確認沃克的證詞都是真的
Confirm that all of Walker's testimony is true.

535
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,780
你不需要這么做
You don't have to do it.

536
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,740
不  莫琳  我要公開說
No, Maureen, I want this on the record.

537
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,460
你怎么能這么背叛安德伍德夫婦
How dare you betray the Underwoods like this?

538
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,190
我們說完了  議員
We're done here, Congressman.

539
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,280
謝謝你抽時間
Well, thank you for your time.

請你準備好
So you're prepared,

541

司法委員會很快會簽發傳票
a subpoena will be coming soon from the Judiciary Committee.

542
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,210
國務卿女士
Madam Secretary.

543
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,160
你想進去嗎
Do you wanna come in?

544
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,460
是我導致了你丈夫的死
I'm the reason your husband's dead.

545
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,090
我逼迫衛生和人類服務部部長
I forced the Secretary of Health and Human Services...

546
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
把弗蘭西斯·安德伍德插在捐贈名單上他之前
to put Francis Underwood in front of him on the donor list.

547
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,540
如果你覺得我是禽獸我也能理解
I understand if you think I'm a monster.

548
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
但我不后悔
But I'd do it again.

549
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,140
為了救總統  我愿不惜一切
To save the president, I'd do anything.

550
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,960
你真覺得我不知道嗎  道格
You really think that I didn't know, Doug?

551
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,700
是時機暴露了
The timing gave it away.

552
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,660
來吧  快進屋
Come on. Come on in.

553
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,040
你以為是怎么回事
What did you think was going on here?

554
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,860
我操你不是因為我喜歡你
I'm not fucking you because I like you.

555
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,850
我操你是因為我恨你
I'm fucking you because I hate you.

556
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,190
出去
Get out.

557
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,280
滾出我的車
Get out of my car.

558
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,300
快滾出我的車
Get the fuck out of my car.

559
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,450
滾
Get out!

560
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,420
麥卡倫給了你什么
What did Macallan give you?

561
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,570
-我不知道你在說什么  -我聽見你說話了
- I don't know what you're talking about. - I heard you.

562
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,410
他給了你什么東西
You got something from him.

563
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,720
什么叫"你聽見我說話了"
What do you mean you heard me?

564
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,540
你還在監視我嗎
Were you watching me, too?

565
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,970
他是你什么人
Who was he to you?

566
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,170
喝一杯嗎
Want a drink?

567
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,050
我不喝酒
I don't drink.

568
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
對了
Oh, right.

569
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,750
我和他睡過
I was with him.

570
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,250
我還年輕  不該跟他睡的時候
When I was young and shouldn't have been with him.

571
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,460
你喜歡什么  道格
What gets you off, Doug?

572
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,430
有嗎
Anything?

573
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,170
要是麥卡倫給了你什么  我們應該上交
If Macallan gave you something, we should hand it over.

574
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,170
你喜歡嗎
Did you like it?

575
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,380
什么
What?

576
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,900
監視我
Watching me.

577
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,100
喜歡
Yes.

578
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,970
你喜歡你看見的嗎
You liked what you saw?

579
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,410
這是你來找我的原因嗎
That why you came here?

580
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,890
那好吧
Well, then.

581
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,190
我要去健身房  跑步消解壓力
Going to the gym. Run off some of this stress.

582
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,120
你的教練呢
Where's your trainer?

583
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,950
他有一段時間都不會來了
Oh, he won't be coming around for a while.

584
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,620
他有個表情我可不會懷念
He did have a facial expression I won't miss.

585
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,250
是嗎
Is that so?

586
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,530
那種凝固的笑  很瘆人
Sort of perma-smile. It was creepy.

587
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,270
也許他只是開心罷了
Maybe he's just happy.

588
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,580
我不擔心開心
Happiness isn't my concern.

589
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,790
現在不  從來都不
Not now, not ever.

590
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,300
這局面太不幸了  克萊爾
It's a tragic situation, Claire.

591
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,790
-我知道  -我可以給你看看正在發生的事
- I know. - I could show you what's happening.

592
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,270
我看過照片了
I've seen the images.

593
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,020
務必要讓民眾知道霍姆斯城正在發生什么
It's important people know what's going on in Homs.

594
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,820
你改主意了嗎
Are you having second thoughts?

595
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,180
只是現在時機還不到
It's just the timing isn't right yet.

596
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,610
因為你丈夫得不到支持
Because your husband doesn't have the support.

597
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,980
我們得有理有據
We need to make a case.

598
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,240
你做聲明之前  讓全世界做好準備
Prepare the world for when you make a statement.

599
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,900
我認為弗蘭西斯得來做主導
I think Francis needs to be front and center on this.

600
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,330
你沒查到麥卡倫告訴佩特羅夫什么了
You never found out what Macallan told Petrov?

601
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,290
我的線人說  他沒說什么真正有用的
My sources say he never gave him anything concrete.

602
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,390
-他給了莉安一些東西  -我們希望如此
- Well, he gave LeAnn something. - Well, that was our hope.

603
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,520
也許是時候再把她請回來了
Maybe it's time to invite her back in.

604
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,070
也許吧  我得上樓了
Maybe. I need to get back upstairs.

605
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,530
下次在我辦公室見
The next time we meet will be in my office.

606
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,440
我不覺得你丈夫該做主導
I... I don't think your husband should be front and center.

607
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,830
應該是你
I think it should be you.

608
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,700
我沒問你的意見
I didn't ask you what you think.

609
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,470
你得有所準備  克萊爾
You need to be armed, Claire.

610
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,890
無論他怎樣
It's important that you can walk away

611
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,140
你務必得能全身而退
from anything that happens to him.

612
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,420
去他們的
They can kiss my ass.

613
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,910
參議員韋斯特維爾特有意要我
I got an offer from Senator Westervelt.

614
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,690
我也在找
I'm looking, too.

615
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,320
但想下這艘船越來越困難了
But it's getting harder and harder to get off this ship.

616
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,890
我妻子在哪
Where is my wife?

617
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,460
她去哪了
Where has she gone?

618
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,790
如果她是你妻子  你不會想知道嗎
If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?

619
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,240
好  安德伍德夫人
Yes, Mrs. Underwood.

620
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,210
別擔心  這事沒發生過
Don't worry. This never happened.

621
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,900
不用你告訴我
You don't have to tell me.

622
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,680
-道格  -該死
- Doug. - Shit.

623
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,760
我該過去嗎
Should I come in?

624
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,930
不  除非你把你手里的東西給我
No. Not until you give me what you've got.

625
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,380
總統先生
Mr. President.

626
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,180
"一位白宮內部人士透露
"A source deep within the White House...

627
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,630
安德伍德總統確實
confirms President Underwood

628
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,360
曾利用可疑情報
used questionable intelligence

629
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,030
為關閉投票中心找理由
to justify voting center closures,

630
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,190
從而使選舉陷入了混亂"
which threw the election into chaos."

631
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,020
你覺得會是誰
Who do you think it is?

632
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,990
可能是格林
Green, probably.

633
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,720
-我們高估了他的忠誠  -我明白了
- We overestimated his loyalty. - I see.

634
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,940
要不
I mean...

635
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,020
還能是誰
who else could it be?

636
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,470
我能做些什么
How can I help?

637
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,200
我們得自救
We need to save ourselves here.

638
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,870
-這事對我倆都很不利  凱茜  -我明白
- It's as much your head as mine, Cathy. - I understand.

639
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,910
我需要你編寫額外的材料
I need you to create additional documents

640
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,870
為追捕卡拉比找理由
that justify going after Kalabi.

641
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,440
制造書面痕跡來支撐我們
A paper trail that will support our actions

642
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,210
選舉日在田納西采取的行動
that we took on Election Day in Tennessee.

643
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,150
我不確定
I'm not sure...

644
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,180
該是什么樣的材料
what those documents would be.

645
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,880
可你夠聰明  對吧  凱茜
Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?

646
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,040
你會想到的
I mean, you can figure it out.

647
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,680
讓我看看你有多聰明吧
Why don't you just show me how smart you are.

648
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,430
-當然  總統先生  -還有在聯合國的演講
- Of course, Mr. President. - And the presentation at the UN.

649
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,770
-關于敘利亞的  -必須進行
- With Syria? - It needs to happen.

650
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,940
-好吧  -可能會引起非議
- Very well. - There's a possibility of talks,

651
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,200
但我們得讓所有相關方重新回到談判桌上
but we need to get all the interested parties back to the table.

652
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,340
當然
Of course.

653
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,880
你是個好外交官  凱茜
You're a good diplomat, Cathy.

654
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,400
謝謝  總統先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

655
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,770
另外  克萊爾呢
And where is Claire?

656
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,990
她現在需要保持些距離
She needed a little distance right now.

657
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,780
直到我們看清我到底怎么回事
Till we find out what's happening with me.

658
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,450
所以我現在必須指望你了  凱茜
That's why I need to rely on you, Cathy. Now.

659
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,870
很高興你這么想  弗蘭西斯
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, Francis.

660
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,380
是我  我可以見面了
Yes. I'm ready to meet.

661
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,370
我現在就要見面  馬上
I wanna meet now. Right now.

662
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,010
在一次
After a tumultuous election,

663
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,700
前所未有的混亂選舉后
the likes of which have never been seen,

664
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,590
美國面臨著更多的問題
America faces more questions...

665
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,140
我現在一堆破事  沒時間應付你
Shit is insane right now. I don't have any more time for you.

666
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,170
如果最近從白宮泄露出來的情報
If the recent leaks coming out of the White House

667
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,350
得到證實  總統將面臨...
prove to be true, the president could face...

668
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,060
白宮身份牌  你從哪弄的
A White House ID? Where did you get that?

669
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,500
我還以為是你給的
I thought this came from you.

670
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,670
你說什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

671
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,810
-我現在是副新聞發言人了  -去你媽的
- I'm deputy press secretary. - The fuck you are.

672
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,330
我接到了副總統辦公室的電話
I got a call from the vice president's office,

673
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,600
讓我過來
asking me to come in.

674
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,060
我到的時候  這個已經準備好了
And when I got here, this was waiting for me.

675
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,060
我剛才一小時都在辦手續
I just spent the last hour doing my paperwork.

676
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,180
我沒時間跟你胡扯
I don't have time for this.

677
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,360
加勒特·沃克總統的爆炸性證詞
President Garrett Walker's bombshell testimony, which...

678
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,720
我有國務卿杜蘭特的辭職信
I have Secretary Durant's resignation.

679
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,520
我相信她就是泄密者
I believe she was the leak,

680
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,080
并且可能要為
and might have to take responsibility

681
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,010
選舉當晚發生的事負責
for whatever happened on election night.

682
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,910
先生  司法委員會現在隨時
Sir, the judiciary could issue a resolution

683
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,670
會發出彈劾決議了
for impeachment any day now.

684
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,570
我們得現實地面對這事對總統的傷害
We need to be realistic about damage to the president

685
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,050
即便參議院不定罪
even if the Senate doesn't convict.

686
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,470
你承諾的是黨內警告
You promised us censure.

687
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,380
杜蘭特的泄密已經起到同樣的效果了  不是嗎
Well, Durant's leak took care of that, didn't it?

688
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,620
我們有個應對參議院的計劃
So, we have a plan for the Senate.

689
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,090
我建議重點保護副總統
I suggest we work on protecting the vice president.

690
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,990
確保她在整個過程中能全身而退
Make sure she exits this whole process unscathed.

691
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,510
我們要怎么才能做到
And how do we do that?

692
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,730
聲稱不知情  副總統沒審閱任何相關信息
Plead ignorance. The vice president wasn't read into anything.

693
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,190
什么也不知道
Didn't know anything.

694
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,500
-也什么都沒做  -不行的
- Didn't do anything. - That won't play.

695
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,110
她會看上去不知情  但人們知道并非如此
She'll look uninformed, and the people know she isn't.

696
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,420
距離會讓她看起來無辜
Oh, the distance will help her look innocent.

697
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,570
無辜或有罪  有能力或沒用  不管怎樣
Innocent, guilty, capable, incompetent, whatever it is...

698
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,550
公眾都會往反方向想
the public is going to think the opposite.

699
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,650
所以真是怎么都輸
So, really there is no winning.

700
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,570
照你的意思來吧
Whatever you think is best.

701
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,030
如果我被判無罪  你會有四年時間
You're gonna have four years to prove yourself

702
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,280
在位子上證明自己  希望是八年
on the inside if I'm acquitted. Hopefully, eight.

703
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,180
但如果我被判有罪呢
But what happens if I'm not acquitted?

704
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,240
我們現在不用考慮那個
We don't have to deal with that right now.

705
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,350
不  我想聽到一個計劃
No, I want to hear a plan.

706
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,130
這正是找你來的原因
That's why you're here.

707
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,600
給我冷冰冰  硬梆梆的事實
To give me the cold, hard facts.

708
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,400
我的盤算不比您高明  總統先生
Oh, your calculus is as good as mine, Mr. President.

709
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,450
根本沒有計劃
There is no plan.

710
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,580
只能拖住司法委員會  穩住參議院
Except slow down judiciary, secure the Senate.

711
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,640
我擔心一個人
I'm concerned about someone.

712
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,360
勞拉·莫雷蒂
Laura Moretti.

713
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:28,430
為什么把這個也放進來
Why did you include this?

714
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,180
你跟克萊爾談這個什么勞拉·莫雷蒂
You and Claire talking about a Laura Moretti?

715
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,720
我想讓你知道  先生  她知道了
I wanted you to know, sir, that she knows.

716
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,010
我在名單上幫你插了隊
I jumped you on the list.

717
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,240
好獲得肝臟捐贈
To receive a donor liver.

718
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,180
我強迫衛生和人類服務部部長調高了你的排名
I forced the HHS Secretary to move you up.

719
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,020
-那不可能  -我威脅了她  先生
- That's not possible. - I threatened her, sir.

720
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,720
這是前所未有的道德違規  但我不后悔這樣做
It was an unprecedented ethical violation. But I don't regret it.

721
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,100
我獨守這個秘密  好讓你...
I kept it to myself, so that you would...

722
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,880
在有人發現時可以合理推諉
have plausible deniability if anyone found out.

723
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,860
我也沒告訴安德伍德夫人
I didn't tell Mrs. Underwood either.

724
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,120
她是從別處知道的
She learned another way.

725
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,480
她知道卻沒告訴我
She knew and didn't tell me.

726
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,310
看起來是這樣
Seems so.

727
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,520
她對耶茨的監控反應如何
And how did she react to the Yates surveillance?

728
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,000
那個她怎么說的
What did she say about that?

729
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,760
她沒對我表達她的感受  先生
She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.

730
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,430
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

731
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,360
我與你同在  先生
I'm here for you, sir.

732
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,100
直到永遠
Always.

733
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,530
你對安德伍德夫人有疑慮嗎
Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?

734
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,370
-你有嗎  -我永遠不會這樣講
- Do you? - I would never say that.

735
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,860
我要給你看點東西
I want to show you something.

736
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,010
有45分鐘我不清楚她的行蹤
There's 45 minutes where I can't account for her whereabouts.

737
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,570
我不知道她去了哪里  見了什么人
I don't know where she went or who she saw.

738
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,290
但是她對我說謊了
But she lied to me.

739
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,080
我認為你應該休息一下  先生
I, uh... I think you should get some rest, sir.

740
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,730
總統沒有讓我審閱
The president didn't read me in.

741
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,770
我不在房間里

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}特朗普上任后一直麻煩不斷  不僅一系列政策遭到媒體的廣泛批評
還有多個國會委員會在對俄羅斯干擾2016大選進行調查
在前聯調局局長科米被突然撤職后  媒體普遍認為特朗普干預司法
許多媒體開始討論是否應該彈劾他  但也有冷靜的聲音指出
目前特朗普所屬的共和黨在參眾兩院都占多數  彈劾基本無可能

765
00:49:51,420 --> 00:50:41,420
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}當年比爾·克林頓因為在萊溫斯基事件上公然說謊  國會啟動彈劾程序
眾議院投票表決同意彈劾后  彈劾的決議在參議院沒有獲得足夠票數
在參眾兩院的兩次投票中  克林頓所屬的民主黨黨員大都堅定地站在總統這邊
目前批評特朗普的聲浪雖高  但都是來自民主黨
而即便在特朗普的一些言行明顯離譜  甚至有違法嫌疑的情況下
國會共和黨也不敢對他有太多微辭  所以媒體才認為目前彈劾可能性很小
可以看出  涉及到彈劾時  美國兩黨議員
基本都是根據自己的黨派歸屬來決定立場的
