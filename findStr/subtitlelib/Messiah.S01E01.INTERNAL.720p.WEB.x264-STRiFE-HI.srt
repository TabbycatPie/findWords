Mother?

5
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,731
I had a nightmare.

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,943
I saw them shoot him, in the dream.

Mama, why did he die?

[sighs]

11
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,212
Because that is what's written
in God's book -

12
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,301
Say, "Nothing shall befall us,
except what God has ordained."

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,679
Did God not love him?

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,682
God loved him so much...

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:03,021
He took him sooner than we wanted.

16
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,691
Does God love me that much?

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,195
Yes...

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,115

They said you joined the rebels.

Listen to me, my brothers and sisters.

56
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,457
They pretend to preach God's word,

57
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,753
and all they do is twist its meaning.

58
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,381
It is written in The Book.

He cannot swallow me.

66
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,169
[in Arabic] It is written -
Say, "Nothing shall befall us,

Believe me when I say God
will defeat your enemies!

79
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,275
Because God wants you to live.

80

Mark my words!

81

There is nothing to be afraid of!

- and get dressed now, Ms. Geller.

Uh, yes.

122
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,750
You'll probably feel funny
for the first few days...

- [man] Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,754
[Ms. Geller] So, why do you wanna work
for the CIA?

132
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,007
I think it's one of the most
important jobs a person can have.

133
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,176
Keeping our country safe.

134

Upholding its values.

135
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,100
What's a misconception
that some people may have about you?

136
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,186
That I'm judgmental.

137
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,939
- So, you're not?
- Not really.

138
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,774
I accept
all different kinds of people.

139
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,275
Would you accept a criminal?

140
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,946
If he'd served his time
and was remorseful.

141
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,989
- Would you trust him?
- No.

142
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,450
Not with... everything.

143
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,286
What wouldn't you trust him with?

144
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,579
My family.

145
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
- A secret.
- [beep]

146
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,503
[Ms. Geller] The truth?

147
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,131
Would you trust him
to tell you the truth?

148
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,553
Well, the truth has
many different versions.

149
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,096
So it's hard to say.

150
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,390
The truth has many different versions?

151
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,642
The truth is pretty gray.

152
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,105
I'm gonna stop the interview there.

153
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,442
I know I shouldn't be telling you this,
but I won't be recommending you.

154
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,279
Uh, why not?

155
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,614
The CIA is like a holy order.

156
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,826
It's a doctrine that you live by.

157
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,829
People's lives depend on the decisions
that we make,

158
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,956
the actions that we take.

159
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,085
When you're in the trenches,
you need to know who your enemies are.

160
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,546
The truth may look gray,
but I assure you it is not.

161
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,089
I'm sorry.

- [phone chimes]
- [sighs]

193
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,634
Dad, what part of "I'm working"
don't you understand?

194
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,638
Well, I was just wondering
how it went today at the clinic.

195
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,558
[sighs] Fine. Just... just like last time.

196
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,228
- What are you doing working?
<i>- Please, Dad.</i>

197
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,063
No, you need your rest.

198
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,399
You're not taking this seriously.

199
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,443
Of course I'm taking it seriously.

200
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,236
[phone alert]

201
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,655
- I gotta go.
<i>- All right.</i>

202
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,700
Get some sleep.

203
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,369
Good night.

204
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>I love you.</i>

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,967
- [bleep]
- [sighs]

206
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,676
What do you got?

207
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,222
<i>Rumor is he's from Egypt.</i>

208
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,476
I listened to those other files.
I'm hearing, uh, some other accent.

209
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,187
Iranian, maybe,
which likely means he's Shi'ite.

210
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,858
He just led 2,000 Syrian Palestinians
into the desert.

211
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,362
<i>What's a Shi'ite doing
leading a bunch of Sunnis?</i>

212
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,989
Yeah, feels like trouble.

213
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,117
I'll put him on our watch list
and get eyes on him in the morning.

214
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,036
- Thanks, Q.
<i>- Okay.</i>

[men shouting]

00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:05,696
[in Arabic] "If you look for truth,
you may find comfort.

219
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,118
If you look for comfort,
you will never find truth."

220
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,081
[man] Why do you quote an infidel?

221
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,336
Who are you to judge who's an infidel?

222
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,632
- People are hungry, Imam.
- Don't interrupt, boy.

223
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,676
Why do you call me Imam?

224
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,013
Because you are great.

225
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,557
No greater than you.

226
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
"There is no deity but God."

227
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,856
But you turned away evil
as you said you would.

228
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
He turned away evil.

229
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,238
But He works through you.

230
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,576
"Did He create you in jest?
Without purpose?"

231
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,206
You expect a shoemaker's son
to know the scriptures?

232
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,168
Do you serve God?

233
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,462
Yes.

234
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,131
Then He works through you.

235
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,510
He works through everyone.

236
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,559
You mean He works through all
who righteously follow Islam.

237
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,397
Don't tell me what I mean.

238
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,701
Why are there no women here?

239
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,828
[laughter]

240
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,750
[cleric] Surely you're not serious.
[laughs]

00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,254
[clattering]

242
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,884
Go find a woman...

243
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,928
and give her your seat.

244
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,062
This man is the Devil.

245
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,857
He has led us into the desert
with no food.

246
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,485
And to leave me now is to perish.

247
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm here to tell you to throw away
your assumptions about God.

248
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,838
Stop clinging to what you think you know.

249
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,509
In this hour,
mankind is a rudderless boat.

250
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,846
Cling to me.

251
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,527

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,361
- [waiter] Hey, we're closing in 20.
- Already?

259
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,821
It's three a.m.

260
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,491
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,494
Am I stopping you from getting home?

262
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,038
It's my job. Gotta be here anyway.

<i>The Clash of Civilizations.</i>

266

Samuel P. Huntington.

267
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,600
How you finding it?

268
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,186
Dry.

269
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,148

270
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,608
- Yeah.
- Senior year?

271
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,192
Uh-huh.

272
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,697
When's your paper due?

273
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,281
Tomorrow.

274
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,414
The only thing you have to remember
is that he was right.

275
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,418
Huntington predicted that the primary axis
of world conflict after the Cold War

276
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,221
would be along cultural
and religious lines.

277
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,797
It's exactly what's happening
in world politics today,

278
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,717
so just... center your paper
around that argument.

279
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,429
- Uh... You teach?
- No.

280
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,181
Just a nerd.

[chuckles]

282
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,231
My boss calls you Ms. Night Owl.

283
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,735
I have a nickname?

284
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,987
I think he likes you.

285
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,829
I'm Eva.

286
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,914
Keon.

287
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,042
Nice to meet you, Keon.

288
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214
Wait, so, what do you do...

289
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,341
if you don't teach?

290
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,594
I work in international relations.

291
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,890
That's what my uncle used to say.

292
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,893
He worked for the CIA.

293
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,569
- You a field agent?
- I never said I worked for the CIA.

294
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,365
He died.

295
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,035
My uncle. In Turkey.

296
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,828
- [sighs]
- Last year.

297
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,706
That bombing.

298
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,419
Terrible.

299
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,174
I'm sorry to hear that.

300
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,344
He was doing what... what he loved.

303
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
[Samer, in Arabic] What is he doing?

304
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,193
Hm?

305
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
[Jibril] Talking with God.

306
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,534
He looks crazy.

307
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
He stood for 30 days
on the Gate of St. Thomas

308
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,916
and preached without food or water,
during a sandstorm,

309
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,296
while we hid in a building,
fearing for our lives.

[scoffs]

311
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,842
You don't believe
he really did that, do you?

312
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,014
He is Isa returned.

313
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,185
al-Masih.

314
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,270
[al-Masih] Jibril!

315
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,292
Sit down with me.

316
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,137
Do you know there is a star
for every soul?

317
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,849
Do you believe me?

318
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,019
Yes.

319
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,985
Imam... is my mother in a good place?

320
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,822
She's where God wants her.

321
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,074
She is with Him?

322
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,162
Do you think...

323
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,417
He would forsake a soul as good as hers?

324
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,419
I miss her.

325
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,505
I want to see her.

326
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,883
It's good you're thinking about
the next life.

327
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,136
Why have you come now?

328
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,347
It's pointless to question these things.

329
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,099
I'm here...

330
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,145
in this moment because
I have always been here in this moment...

331
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,105
and so have you.

332
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,450
You have light in you, Jibril...

333
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,873
but God is going to ask some hard things
of you.

334
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,418
I am ready.

335
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,008
Pack up the camp. We're moving.

336
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,185
[crowd chanting in Arabic] <i>Messiah!</i>

337
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,604
"Masih" in Arabic means "Messiah."

338
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,564
[chanting] <i>Messiah! Messiah!</i>

339
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,441
So, this is a cult?

340
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,404
Possibly. ISIL use this type
of apocalyptic propaganda all the time,

341
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,906
and to good effect.

342
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,158
This guy's just taken it
to the next level.

343
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,994
So, he's some rival faction? Al-Qaeda?

344
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,838
- We don't know who he's associated with.
- What do we know about him?

345
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,081
That's the concerning thing.

346
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,376
He's come out of nowhere and he's leading
desperate people into the desert.

347
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,753
To what end?

348
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,672
Well, if it's a cult,
he could be leading them to their death.

349
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,758
Or he could be creating an army.

350
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,136
An army of sick and starving refugees?

351
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,389
He's creating a cause, in the hope
that other people will join him.

352
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,228
- That's a lot of speculation, Eva.
- It's my job to speculate, ma'am.

353
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,855
He has over 2,000 followers.

354
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,316
What if he turns out
to be another al-Baghdadi?

355
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,030
I'd like to keep an eye on him.

356
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,994
Minimal resources.

357
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,289
Thank you, ma'am.

[whirring]

359
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,648
What do you have over Syria?

360
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
[crowd approaching]

361
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,577
We'll lose range in about four minutes.
What are we looking for, exactly?

362
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,120
Can you zoom in on that?

363
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,207
Closer?

364
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,593
There we are.

365
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,222
They're nowhere near Damascus.

366
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,933
[Eva] Where are we?

367
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,728
[technician] There's Damascus.

368
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,189
- And that's...
- Israel.

369
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,985
He's led us to our deaths.

370
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,737
He's led us into battle!

371
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,489
[cheering]

372
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,407
[ululating]

373
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,123
Collect all the weapons.

374
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,173
[Eva] Get me Director Bailey.

375
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,677
We need to get a message
to that security post in Israel.

376
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,107
Imam, what do you want us to do?

377
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,237
Dig a hole and bury them.

378
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,364
Then how do we fight?

379
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,767
[pop music playing]

380
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,607
[man singing in Hebrew]

381
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,000
[woman] Shit.

382
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,168
[man, in Hebrew] What?

383
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,589
We've got a crazy fucker.

384
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,798
[man sighs]

385
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,976
Hello there, crazy fucker.

386
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,288
[in English] Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

387
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,539
[woman mutters in Hebrew]

388
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,998
Fuck.

389
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,898
[man, in Hebrew] Patrol house 283ip.
Repeat, 283ip.

390
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,567
Request immediate reinforcement.

391
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,860
[radio chatter in Hebrew]

392
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,153
[both speaking Hebrew]

393
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,828
- [woman] Shit!
- [man] No!

394
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,121
- [yells in Hebrew]
- [radio chatter]

395
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,957
- No, no, no!
- [both speaking Hebrew]

396
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,329
[screaming]

397
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,376
[in Arabic] Be strong.

398
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,378
God is with you.

399
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,803
[in Hebrew] Hands up!

400
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,263
Hands away from your clothes!

401
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,640
[female soldier] Get down!

402
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,994
- [on radio] <i>Hold fire!</i>
- Where the hell is reinforcement?

403
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,418
[in Hebrew] These people need food.

404
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,354
Lebanon is that way.

405
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,649
Lay down on the ground. I said lay down!

406
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,151
[male soldier] Hands up!

407
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,280
Stand down.

408
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,835
Arrest him.

409
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,673
[woman, in English] <i>A dramatic arrest
took place at the Israeli border...</i>

410
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,592
[Arabic]
<i>The occupying forces have refused...</i>

411
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,178
<i>the Palestinian refugees
entry back into their homeland,</i>

412
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,763
<i>led by a man they call al-Masih.</i>

413
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,158
- [English]<i>...crowd was fired at...
- ...man from Lebanon...</i>

414
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,310
<i>- ...Israelis to the Syrian border...
- ...so far refused the refugees passage,</i>

415
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,522
<i>- criticised by Muslims worldwide...
- ...a caravan of asylum seekers...</i>

416
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,776
[in English] As displaced Palestinians,
they claim they are entitled passage

417
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,861
into the West Bank as rightful citizens.

418
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,321
Okay, we'll go again.

419
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,949
And someone fix my hair.
I look like Phil Spector.

420
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
[helicopter engine]

421
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,840
[man grunting]

422
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,717
[phone ringing]

423
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,265
[sighs]

424
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,560
[sighs]

425
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,104
[ringing continues]

426
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,731
[sighs]

427
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,815
Shit.

428
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,152
[door opens]

429
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,155
[sighs]

430
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,328
- [woman, in Hebrew] What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

431
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,247
You can't just let yourself in.

432
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,374
I pay for this place.

433
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,043
There's my princess.

434
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,420
Daddy!

435
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,005
Let me look at you!

436
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,214
I'm all sweaty.

437
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,297
Ah!

438
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,509
You're supposed to call
and let me know you're coming.

439
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
They're the rules.

440
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,389
[in English] Fuck the rules.

441
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,512
[in English] Great way to talk
around your daughter.

442
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,393
Oh, like she never heard that from you?

443
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,106
- Where are you going?
- I need to take a shower.

444
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,566
[in Hebrew] This isn't a hotel.

445
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,526
Do you ever clean up?

446
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,570
[in English]
Did you just come here to judge me?

447
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,587
When are you going
to move your shit out?

448
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,366
<i>...arrested this morning,
when attempting to cross the border.</i>

449
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,784
<i>- He is being held in...</i>
- Hey.

450
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

451
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,163
- [phone rings]
- I came to see Eli.

452
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,790
[in Hebrew] Oh, so you bothered this week?

453
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,001
[in Hebrew] Have you got a job yet?

454
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,164
[in English] My job is to look after
our daughter. You should try it sometime.

455
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,758
Go get your coat, princess.

456
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,843
Hello.

457
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,264
Yeah? It's my day off.

458
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,017
When?

459
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,145
Okay.

460
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,147
[in English] Are you going
to break her heart again?

461
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,824
REFUGEE LEADER ARRESTED

462
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,912
We'll eventually pull something on him,
but it's gonna take time and resources.

463
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,498
The fastest way to get to know him
is to meet him.

464
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,087
He's not our detainee,
so, for the moment, he's not our concern.

465
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,880
Israel's handling it.

466
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,342
[Eva] I wouldn't
underestimate this guy, sir.

467
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,843
This wasn't just aimed at Israel.

468
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,471
He knows that
America has to defend Israel's position,

469
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,808
and as long as those starving people
sit at their border,

470
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,227
the more indefensible
that position becomes.

471
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,313
We'll get dragged
into something we don't want.

472
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,732
Why don't you let the politicians
worry about that?

473
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,904
That wasn't very politic.

474
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,322
But it's the truth.

475
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,283
My God, you're like your father.

476
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,580
[horns blaring]

477
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,207
[clanking]

478
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,460
[door slams]

479
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,633
[water dripping]

480
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,159
[in English] This is my day off.

481
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,911
I don't want you to waste my time,

482
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,289
so it would be best
if you just answer my questions.

483
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,378
Why are you here?

484
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,550
[in English] To see the Holy Land.

485
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,305
Welcome to the Holy Land.

486
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,602
- So, I'm free to leave?
- I ask the questions here.

487
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,353
Who are you?

488
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,857
[in Hebrew] The Word.

489
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,193
[Aviram, in Hebrew] The Word?

490
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,987
[in English] Do you even know
what that means?

491
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,031
- [in English] Yes.
- Yes?

492
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,325
So, you are "the word"?

493
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,914
Okay, Mr. The Word,
I don't care if you sit here and rot,

494
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,333
I just don't want you
to waste my fucking time.

495
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,836
So, where did you learn all your Hebrew?

496
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,338
Here.

497
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,923
So, you're from here?

498
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,006
Originally.

499
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,010
From where? Ramat Gan? Jerusalem? Where?

500
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,554
- Why, you assume I'm Palestinian?
- Oh, you're not?

501
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,306
- So, you're Jewish?
- Originally.

502
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,515
Originally.

503
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,976
And now, you're what?

504
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,353
I'm with God.

505
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,232
God.

506
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,532
I don't see him.

507
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,452
You will.

508
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,036
Will I?

509
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,378
Why don't you take God
and stick him up your fucking ass?

510
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,841
What were you doing in Syria?

511
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,593
Delivering a message.

512
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,388
- A message from who?
- My father.

513
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,765
And who is your father?

514
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,142
[in Hebrew] That will be revealed in time.

515
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,938
Why not save me the fucking suspense
and just admit it now?

516
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,815
[in English] Because, Aviram,

517
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,400
it's not time.

518
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,406
Who told you my name?

519
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,619
[in Hebrew] No one needed
to tell me your name.

520
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,289
You are in my father's book.

521
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,584
Don't fuck with me.

522
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,045
[in English] Your anger is misplaced.

523
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,256
You don't want to know
about my anger.

524
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,970
[in Hebrew]
You hold onto hatred like it's a prize,

525
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,349
when it's the weight around your neck.

526
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
[in English] You want to hurt me...

527
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,863
like they hurt you.

528
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,327
You talk a lot of shit.

529
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,705
You hurt a lot of people.

530
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,915
It's part of my job, yes.

531
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,044
You enjoy it.

532
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,629
I take pride in my work.

533
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,969
Except for that boy.

534
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,891
What boy?

535
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,312
The boy, in Megiddo.

536
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,152
Is that when you stopped believing?

537
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,574
I ask the questions here.

538
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,743
[in Hebrew]
He is waiting for you, Aviram...

539
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,538
whenever you are ready.

540
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,213
[chair scraping]

541
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,134

DELETE FILE

544
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,355
Hey!

545
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,940
[in Hebrew] Put him in the hole.

546
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,203
- [pool balls click]
- [sighs]

547
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,379
[in English] You look like shit.

548
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,967
[in Hebrew] Have you seen Omer?

549
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,220
[in Hebrew] Why would I do that?

550
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,806
Because he's your brother.

551
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,438
He did something stupid,
I'm not going to take pity on him.

552
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,690
[sighs] I love your compassion.

553
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,863
The country's crumbling
and he decides to rob a fucking store.

554
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,115
He deserves what he gets.

555
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,910
[in English] What's up?

556
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,290
[in Hebrew] You're angrier than usual.

557
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,670
[speaks Hebrew]

558
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,014
You...

559
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,770
You've never mentioned Megiddo
to anyone?

560
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,319
Why would I do that?

561
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,906
Why are you even talking about it?

562
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,996
Nothing.

00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,129

00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,745
- Hey, thief. Give it back.
- [mutters]

569
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,747
Goodnight.

[Aviram, in English] You know how many
times I've sat opposite that hood?

574
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,966
[in English] 227.

575
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,220
And every time, it was me.

576
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,476
We could go on doing this forever,
you know?

577
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,604
It's up to you.

578
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,190
This is no solution.

579
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,402
Who are you?

580
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,113
The better question is...

581
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,532
who are you,

582
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
Aviram Dahan?

583
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,456
I'm the one asking the questions.

584
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,208
Are you?

00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,712
