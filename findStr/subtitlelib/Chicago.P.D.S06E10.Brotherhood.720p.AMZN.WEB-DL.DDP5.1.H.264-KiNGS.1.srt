to do a buy bust.

I was there
to score oxy for me.

just kidnapped my daughter.

- What are you doing here?

Be honest, when
was the last time you used?

19
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,431

We gotta get you out of here.
Take your gun.

Take your gun.
Okay.

It's okay.

All right, put this

- You arrive on scene.

34
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:11,288
You came around that corner,
through that door.

35
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,594

in a physical altercation.

- Then you witnessed Rizzo--
- No, no, no, no, no.

39

- You witnessed Rizzo
go over the wall.

- No, no, no.
Boss, no.

You run downstairs.
You attempt to administer aid.

You determined he was dead
on impact.

You can't take it.

Then body.

What's going on?

- Ruzek was involved?

00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,817
Where's Antonio?
- I called him off.

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,210

on his way here.

in simple terms what happened?

of the offender.

As I closed in I announced
my office several times.

91
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,987
I ordered him to stop.

92
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,859
He did not.
He was non-compliant.

93
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,382
He was violent.
He lunged for me.

but to defend myself.

- No, sir.
It was a physical altercation.

my life was at risk.

- Time off?
He was on his way there.

121

this team will discuss it.

- Sarge, is he--
- You never have to explain

or hear.

127
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,451
Is that understood?

00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,976
- It is.

129
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,501
But I wanna know if Antonio's
gonna be okay.

130
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,983
- Yeah. He will be.

131
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,551
He just--just needs some time.

- Uh, sorry to interrupt
whatever this is.

- Hey, Sarge.

144
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,631

- Yeah, looks like it.

It's just like
the other four carjackings.

148
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,379
You know, they waited for her
to step away from the vehicle

149
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,423
and then charged.

150
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,424
You know, only this time--

151
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,686
- She fought back.

152
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,035
- We've got
multiple witnesses.

153
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,689
They say the carjackers
moved fast.

154
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,909
She reacted to the violence.

155
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,042
- Okay, I'm gonna get forensics
to set up a tarp.

156
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,697
- Hey, uh, listen, I want
you to get her hands bagged.

157
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,874
Hopefully you'll find some DNA
under her fingernails.

158
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,528
Girl's parents been notified?

159
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,051
- Patrol's en route
to her house.

160
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,879
- I think you should take it.

161
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,968
Look, this thing's already
gonna be all over the press.

162
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,580
Don't want some rookie cop
confirming their kid's gone.

163
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,538
- Right.
- Thanks.

164
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:49,583
- Put out an investigative
alert

165
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:50,584
on the stolen vehicle.

166
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,412
It was a Lexus F type.

167
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,066
Seems like the carjackers
sped directly onto Lake Shore,

168
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,807
probably hooked up
with 94 or 55.

169
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,853
- Talked to a witness
who owns that shop.

170
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,071
Said there's security cameras
that look

171
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,203
directly at the scene.

172
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,683
- Go check it out.

173
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,206
- That's where we're headed.

174
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,168
- Detectives?

175
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,868
Camera feed relays
to my laptop.

176
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm sure it caught
the whole thing as it happened.

177
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,915
Would have at least
seen the girl.

178
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,439
She...

179
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,092
she was right outside and...

180
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,225
they just...

181
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:26,576
- Ma'am, you don't have
to watch the footage with us.

182
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,056
- Thank you.

183
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,538
I'll just, uh...be in the back.

184
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,756
- All right.

185
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,639
- Jesus.

186
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,170
- You see that?

187
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,172
- Yeah. They're coming
from the L stop.

188
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,611
- Whoever they are,
they're smart.

189
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,091
They never look up
at the camera once.

190
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,615
But they took the L train
the whole way there.

191
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,487
We were able to trace them
back to the Red Line

192
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,879
and they hopped on
at the 47th Street station.

193
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,012
- Right. They paid cash,
so nothing to trace.

194
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,622
but I'm sending the footage
to the CTA workers.

195
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,233
- 47th Street station.
That's Canaryville.

196
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,627
47th Street's, like, two blocks
from my mom's house.

197
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,150
I got a real good CI there,
Mark Rollins.

198
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,630
Guy I grew up with.

199
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:21,979
He's working off
a home invasion case.

200
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,590
He's plugged in too.

201
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,200
Runs with Pat Kent's crew
and...

202
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,855
if these carjackers
are Canaryville locals,

203
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,161
Kent'll know about it.

204
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,250
- You know nobody
in Canaryville's gonna

205
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:35,689
willingly talk to us,
so we do need an angle.

206
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,255
- All right, so dig
into the pattern.

207
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,084
Find the nexus between time
and neighborhood.

208
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,653
And I want a detail posted
on every L stop above Jackson.

209
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,829
And uniformed patrol
sitting on 47th.

210
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,570
We don't let another one
of these happen,

211
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,181
you understand?
- Copy that.

212
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,835
- I'm assuming
it's not news to you

213
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,011
IRT wants you on a short leash.

214
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,013
So you visit your CI with me.

215
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,972
- All right.

216
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,147
- Let's go.

217
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,639
You have no idea
what you just did.

218
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,859
I mean, there could
be witnesses.

219
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,949
Cameras. They could have
caught you on PODS.

220
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,691
Phone records could indicate
Antonio was there.

221
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:22,953
- I know.
- There could be forensics.

222
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,999
DNA evidence.
- Boss.

223
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,000
- You're not getting
out of the car yet.

224
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,567
- All of that would be there

225
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,959
had you done what I did.
- And who the hell

226
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,092
do you think you are?

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,920
You don't protect me.

228
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,574
I protect you.

229
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,619
That's my job.

230
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,188
I'm the one who allowed
Antonio to be there.

231
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,842
This is on me.

232
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,280
From this point on,

233
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:48,022
you don't say another word
about this, you get me?

234
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,327
- Yes, sir.

235
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,635
- There's a single crack
in this,

236
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,898
this tips sideways,
we're all on the hook.

237
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,770
- Sarge, I did
what I had to do.

238
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,816
I don't know what you want.

239
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,992
- We buried Al six months ago.

240
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,779
- This is not that.

241
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:18,400
.

242
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,662
- Hey.

243
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,100
- Oh, hell, no.
- Mark.

244
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,189
- I said I'm not working with--
I'm not doing it!

245
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,538
I'm not working with you, man.
- Nice to see you too.

246
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,539
May I remind you
you still have a case

247
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,367
you gotta work off.

248
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,500
- Yeah, I've been working that
off for the last ten months.

249
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:34,677
You got me snitching
on the whole damn neighborhood.

250
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,071
You sent me those
narco cops last month.

251
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,160
- They were beat cops and they
had one question for you.

252
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,379
- They were idiots.

253
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,555
This is all, uh,
legally personal--legal--

254
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,687
- Would you just calm down,
all right?

255
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,384
We're not here
to search your stuff

256
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,691
and shutting curtains
and slamming doors in my face

257
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,128
isn't gonna stop us if we were.

258
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,304
- Sergeant Hank Voight.

259
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,697
- You brought your boss?

260
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,656
- What, you don't want
to work with me, either?

261
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,570
- Yeah, no.
No thanks.

262
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,094
- Well, see, I think you do.

263
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,312
'Cause I'm the guy
who can actually

264
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,097
get your whole file cleared.

265
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

266
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,842
- And what do I have to do
for you to do that?

267
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,713
- Inform on the carjacking crew

268
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:13,585
working out of Canaryville.

269
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,719
- What, are they boosting
Saturn twin-cams on 42nd?

270
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,725
I don't know any crews
jacking cars. Sorry.

271
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,335
- That so?

272
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,163
- Yeah, that's literally
what I just said.

273
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,469
- Okay.

274
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,776
Well, you know anyone
who might know?

275
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,386
Pat Kent?

276
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,128
- You gotta be kidding me.

277
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,391
- You inform on this one thing,

278
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,089
you get Pat to give us
something, and you're done.

279
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,264
All right? You're off the hook.

280
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,136
No more me, no more cops,
nothing.

281
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,402
- No.

282
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,533
No thanks.

283
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,665
- Okay, well,

284
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,580
consider your case still open.

285
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,800
I got a lot of friends
who'd love to talk to you.

286
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,846
- Okay. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

287
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,543
What do you--What do I
gotta do?

288
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,372
Just tell me.

289
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,679
What?

290
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,768
- You go in, you push Pat
for info.

291
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,728
But be smart, subtle.
Don't push too hard.

292
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,207
This phone is your wire.

293
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,905
We'll be outside listening.

294
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,777
We'll also be hacked into their
surveillance cam for eyes.

295
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,692
We can have a ghost
in there for you.

296
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,738
Someone under, you won't
even know they're there.

297
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,351
- Something funny?

298
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:24,700
- If one of the two of you

299
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,354
starts slinking
around Canaryville,

300
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:29,226
there's no way in hell
no one notices.

301
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,662
But I have a second idea.

302
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,448
Um, I don't even use a wire.

303
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,145
Right, yeah, so I just--

304
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,321
I go in and I talk
to a couple people.

305
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,410
I'll get you a little info
and...

306
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,151
you know, we'd all
be real happy.

307
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,719
- No, see,
I talked to Adam.

308
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,548
And he said he's known you
for, like, a long time.

309
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,202
And you're getting a wire.

310
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,333
- That's cute.

311
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,508
- Uh, this is up and running,

312
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,553
so I'm gonna
let everybody know.

313
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,946
- All right.
- Cool.

314
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,861
- How do you know Adam?

315
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,689
- We, uh...we grew up
around the block.

316
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,778
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

317
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,692
- Took different paths, huh?

318
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,695
- No. No, not really.
You know...

319
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,610
it's only in Chicago
a kid like Adam

320
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,569
can grow up and become a cop.

321
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,355
Do you...

322
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,793
have time for coffee, or--
- Move.

323
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:20,277
Are you really okay
with all this?

324
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,409
- With what?

325
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,889
- With not knowing why Ruzek's

326
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,978
staring down the barrel
of an OID?

327
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,547
- I don't know if I'm okay
with any of it.

328
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:33,856
But I think the best way
to protect everyone

329
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,815
is to not talk about it.

330
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,779
- Hey there, Mark.
- Mark's here. We're up.

331
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,824
- Hey.

332
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,480
- You know we got police heat
all up on 47th?

333
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,221
- What the hell
are you talking about?

334
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,528
- The two cops in full uniform
sitting at the stop

335
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:54,616
like their asses are on fire.

336
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,660
- What the hell is he doing?

337
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,706
- Yeah.
- No idea.

338
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,795
- They're, like, a lick away
from pulling a stop and frisk.

339
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,405
Who the hell's
bringing the heat?

340
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,754
- I don't know.

341
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,844
- Someone should
probably find out.

342
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,671
- Yeah.

343
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,990
- You going
to Becker's tonight?

344
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,644
Valerie said she's only going
if you go.

345
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:27,910
- You want me
to talk to someone?

346
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,652
- No. It's good.

347
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,569
- Pricks apparently been
out there for, like, 12 hours.

348
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,918
- Jesus. We gotta be ready
to pull this guy.

349
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,615
- I know they're gonna
get bored.

350
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,835
Start pulling their weight
with pat downs.

351
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,532
No one's gonna wanna go in
with possession--

352
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,317
- It's fine.

353
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,622
I'll talk to Billy.

354
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,537
- Billy?
- Billy's been clearing?

355
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,539
- Clearing. Chop shop.
- Yeah.

356
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,498
- Did I not just say
it was good?

357
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:58,636
- Question.

358
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,377
How the hell are you okay
with the fact

359
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,813
that the girl
you want to screw

360
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,729
will only go to this
house party if I'm there?

361
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:08,037
[all laughing]

362
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,996
- She only likes you there
as a buffer, all right?

363
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,954
- I think she wants me there
'cause she likes me, Coop.

364
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,651
- She said she wouldn't
even kiss him

365
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,479
'cause it might ruin
their friendship.

366
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:18,352
- He's known her for
three days, what friendship?

367
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,358
- Ah, man.

368
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,839
- Wasn't quite
what we talked about.

369
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,059
- Yeah, are we done?

370
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,974
- This Billy's place,
is that Billy Cowan?

371
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,845
Owns an auto repair on 45th?

372
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,457
Guessing that's an
off-the-books chop shop?

373
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,633
- Crack team.

374
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,417

as a confirmation.

That was a dumbass way
to press for info.

377
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,817
- No it wasn't.

378
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,776
Not when everyone in there
knows you've got their back.

379
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,002

380
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,743
- That's me.
How can I help you?

381
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,701
- Right here, buddy.

382
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,749
I gotta say, Billy, you do not
look surprised to see us.

383
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,011
He doesn't look surprised,
does he?

384
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,012
- Yeah, well,
that's because he knows

385
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,405
we're not gonna cause a scene.

386
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,754
Unless he doesn't want
to talk to us.

387
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,670
- Not sure how I can help you.
- Oh.

388
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,889
- Well, I think we all know
that there's a few ways

389
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:18,890
this can go down.

390
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:19,891
We can search the shop,

391
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,154
talk to people, get loud,

392
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,721
tear this place up
piece by piece, or...

393
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,375
- Or you can give us
something better.

394
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,116
- Trade up.
Name of the game, Billy.

395
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,683
- Who's dropping off
the luxury cars

396
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,902
you're chopping, Billy?

397
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,730
- I don't run
that kind of shop.

398
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,516
- Oh, okay.

399
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,039
5021 Eddie, we're gonna need
an assist

400
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,389
on executing a search warrant,
1432 West 45h--

401
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,869
- Look, I don't know any names,
all right?

402
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,827
- Yeah, no names?
Okay.

403
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,745
- What's that?

404
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,138
- I don't ask people
for their names.

405
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,140
- Billy.

406
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,750
You're trying my patience here.

407
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:53,925
- She's gonna need a name, man.

408
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,146
- All right.
All right, okay?

409
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,930
He drops off the cars.

410
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,759
I give him the cash same night
and clear them out.

411
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,631
I ain't got any of them here.

412
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,893
- He?

413
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,939
- I really don't know his name.

414
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,855
But I'm not a damn idiot.

415
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,554
I got contingencies
for if something happens.

416
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,470
- Of course you do.

417
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,081
- Our friend Billy
installed his own camera.

418
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,691
Said this is the guy
right here

419
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,084
that comes in
and drops the cars off.

420
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,607
Comes in alone,
drops 'em,

421
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,000
and Billy pays him cash
same day.

422
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,915
- Billy didn't know his ID,
license plate,

423
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,830
any identifying markers, so.

424
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:30,440
- That's the best shot we got.
- Yeah.

425
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,181
- All right, so we do it
the old-fashioned way.

426
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,574
Farm it off.

427
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,966
Every beat cop, CTA worker,

428
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,968
get every gang and tact unit
across the city.

429
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,622
If someone knows this guy,

430
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,624
that picture's gonna be
enough to spark it.

431
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,104
Hey, you can run it past Mark.
- All right.

432
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,932
- He should be around here.
Hey.

433
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:45,803
Hank, this is
Detective Tim Powell.

434
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:46,891
- Hank.
- Powell.

435
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:47,979
- Are you Officer Adam Ruzek?

436
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,590
I'm with IRT.

437
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,549
I'm taking over your
officer-involved death.

438
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,725
- Why the change in lead?

439
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,118
- Let's talk downstairs.

440
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,641
- Yes, sir.

441
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,567
.

442
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,961
- We did full forensics
at the crime scene.

443
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:17,008
Found some blood on the wall.

444
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,967
- Huh. Well...

445
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,186
as I stated at the scene,

446
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,491
there was a hell
of an altercation.

447
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,579
So it's possible Rizzo
was injured

448
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,277
before he went over the wall.

449
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,149
- Blood wasn't Rizzo's.
Unidentified profile.

450
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,585
- Huh.

451
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,500
- Just as a reminder,
you said at the scene

452
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,023
that you were not injured.

453
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,416
Photographs we took
confirm that.

454
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,157
- No, I didn't believe so,
but, you know.

455
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,245
It's possible.

456
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,117
- Okay.

457
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,509
So you have no idea
who could have left

458
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,684
the fresh blood at the scene?

459
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,121
- No, sir.

460
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,993
- All right.

461
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,429
Thank you.
- Thank you.

You have to tell me
what's going on right now.

These are just nice words

472

- Adam.

Please tell me you didn't do
what I think you did.

474
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,650
Are you insane?

475

Some half-assed notion
of loyalty?

484
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,241
- It is not a notion.

485
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:04,072

It's Voight.

Why do you have
