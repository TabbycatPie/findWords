孩子们 在2012年的夏天
Kids,in the spring of 2012,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,500
Barney叔叔消失了几个星期
your Uncle Barney went off the grid for a couple weeks.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,100
所以他发短信让我去他家的时候 我感觉松了口气
So I was relieved when I got a text asking me to come over to his place.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,110
你终于联系我了 我一直担心你是不是
Glad to hear from you,buddy. I was worried something bad happened...

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,680
出了什么问题
...to you.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,210
- 欢迎 兄弟 - 这是在唱哪出?
- Welcome,brother. - What is this?

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,480
Ted Evelyn Mosby 你要承诺保守秘密
Ted Evelyn Mosby,you are about to be sworn to secrecy

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,350
在神圣的兄弟契约的见证之下 也就是兄约
through the sacred vows of a Bro Oath,or "Broath.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,620
请穿上你的兄袍
" Please,put on your "brobe.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,020
我才不要穿什么兄袍
" Yeah,I'm not putting on the "brobe.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,340
Ted 你就穿一下下啦
" Ted,just... just... Okay?

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,630
这歌声是在唱"兄弟"吗?
Wait,are they chanting "bro"?

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,090
我请一些修道士录的
I got some local monks to record this.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,020
我连修道士都认识 很厉害吧?
Yeah! I got a monk guy. Cool,right?

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,390
确实
It actually is,yeah.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,940
我给你刻一张盘 宣完誓之后提醒我
I'll burn it for you. Just remind me after The Broath.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,350
言归正传 Ted Evelyn Mosby
Anyway,Ted Evelyn Mosby,

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,690
这个仪式是为了让你 保守一个庄严的秘密
this ritual forever binds you to keep a solemn secret...

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,590
- 什么秘密? - 我真的很喜欢Quinn!
- Which is? - I really like this Quinn girl!

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,210
我们已经交往一段时间了 我想把她正式介绍给你们认识
We've been spending tons of time together,and I want the gang to meet her.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,900
但是我怕你们不同意 因为你懂的
but I'm afraid they're gonna disapprove because,well,you know.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,030
我的确知道
I did know.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,660
Quinn是个脱衣舞娘
You see,Quinn was a stripper...

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,510
还坑了Barney一大笔钱
who had swindled Barney out of quite a bit of cash.

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,490
我们想请所有人去Quinn家吃饭
We're inviting everyone to dinner at Quinn's,

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,250
我不想大家对她有成见 所以请跟我宣读兄约
and I want them to keep an open mind,which brings us to The Broath.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,070
把手放在兄弟法典上
Place your hand on The Bro Code.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,780
好吧好吧
Yeah,yeah,yeah...

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,880
跟着我念 我Ted Evelyn Mosby...
Repeat after me. I,Ted Evelyn Mosby...

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,920
我Ted(真不该告诉你我的中间名)Mosby
"I,Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You My Middle Name" Mosby...

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,780
郑重承诺不会告诉其他人 Quinn是脱衣舞娘
" ...solemnly swear not to tell our friends that Quinn is a stripper.

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,040
郑重承诺不会告诉其他人 Quinn是脱衣舞娘
"...solemnly swear not to tell our friends that Quinn is a stripper"

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,880
而且还骗了你一大笔钱
who duped you out of lots of money.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,350
你只能重复我的话
You're only supposed to repeat after me.

36
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,780
你只能重复我的话
"You're only supposed to repeat after me.

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,860
- 别闹 - 别闹
- Stop it. - Stop it.

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,560
安静!
Silence!

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,840
虽然我和Quinn刚开始发展得不顺
Look,I know that things started out sketchy with me and Quinn,

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,970
但是我真的很喜欢她 所以拜托你
but I really like her,so please.

41
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,510
请问你 Ted(省略中间名)Mosby
Do you,Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,610
愿意发誓遵守这条兄约吗?
swear to uphold this Broath?

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,060
我愿意
I do.

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,080
Barney在和一个脱衣舞娘交往 结果可能是人财两空
Barney's dating a stripper who's gonna steal all his money!

45

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,670
准备去Quinn家了 记住 我什么都没说过
Okay,time to go to Quinn's. Now remember,I told you nothing,okay?

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,520
Barney真的希望我们能喜欢她
Barney really wants us all to like her.

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,460
怎么可能? Quinn明显是在骗Barney 而且他还浑然不觉
But how can we? Quinn totally duped Barney,and he couldn't even see it.

51
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,900
因为她床上功夫好
Well,apparently,the sex is mind-blowing.

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,800
这我有经验
Ha,I've been there. Yeah.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,490
我曾经有个女人 给我开门的时候几乎全裸
I was once with this chick who answered the door wearing nothing

54
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,030
身上只有鲜奶油 项圈领子 和一条性感粉红丁字裤
but,uh,whipped cream,a dog collar and a hot pink thong.

55
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,220
Marshall 你不能讲这些三俗故事
Marshall,you can't tell sex stories about "this chick,"

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,290
因为所有人都知道那是我
because everyone knows it's me.

57
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,300
你这辈子就我一个女人
I'm the only woman you've ever been with.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,910
这不公平 别的男人都能讲三俗故事
It's not fair,the guys are always telling their sex stories

59
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,750
何况我的故事绝对能秒杀他们
and I can top every one of them.

60
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,960
老婆 你就是20个风情万种 性感女郎的集合
Baby,you're like 20 slutty chicks all rolled into one.

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,870
甜言蜜语也哄不了我
Sweet talk is not going to change my mind.

62
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,270
说正事
Let's focus.

63
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,300
今晚 我们要确认Quinn 是不是在骗Barney的钱
Tonight,we want to make sure that Quinn is not out to scam Barney.

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,390
所以三个小时之后 当我们回来的时候
So,when we walk back through that door three hours from now,

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,920
都必须明白一个简单的问题
we should all be able to answer one simple question:

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,530
{\a6}<i>3个小时之后</i>
<i>3***</i>

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,740
这姑娘可靠吗?
Do we trust this girl?

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,370
至少 她能镇得住Barney
Well,for one thing,she seems kind of controlling.

69
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,140
现在把豆泥拿来吃行吗 亲爱的?
Is it okay if I put out the hummus,bunny face?

70
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,390
不行 留着当甜点 白痴
No,save it for dessert. Idiot.

71
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,400
又要续杯了 大美女?
More red wine,beauty-swan?

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,450
她真能喝啊
She drinks a lot.

73
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,230
我能去上厕所吗 小乖乖?
Is it okay if I go pee,sugar lamb?

74
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,230
不行 你三小时前刚上过了
No! You just went three hours ago.

75
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,370
你说得对 小甜心!
You're right,baby bear!

76
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,570
Barney确实很听话 但那也不代表Quinn是个骗子
Yes,so Barney's whipped; it doesn't mean that Quinn is a con artist.

77
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,070
也许我们能对她了解多一点
Well,maybe we could've gotten a better read on her

78
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,210
如果某两位不跑偏题的话
if two people hadn't gone off topic.

79
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,920
Quinn 你这公寓真漂亮
By the way,Quinn,your apartment is amazing.

80
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,600
- 是啊 很漂亮 - 我快搬家了
Oh,yeah,it's beautiful. I'm actually moving out soon.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,310
正想找人转租出去 这房子租金受管制
If you know anyone looking for a sublet,this place is rent-controlled.

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,390
你们肯定不相信我房租多少钱
You would not believe what I pay.

83
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,800
孩子们 这段时间我和Robin 的关系有些紧张
Kids,things have been tense between Robin and I for weeks.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,950
自从她搬走之后 我把公寓给了Marshall和Lily
Ever since she moved out,and I gave the apartment to Marshall and Lily,

85
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,190
我一直住在大学宿舍
I'd been crashing in university housing.

86
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,510
已经10点呢
It's 10:00,damn it.

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,770
Ned Martin和Millie 我要睡觉了好么
Ned,Martin and Millie,people are trying to sleep!

88
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,850
你也曾经年轻过吧?
Hey,you were young like us once,right?

89
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,630
我从来不像你们
I was never like you guys.

90
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,490
Robin和她的同事Patrice住在一起
And Robin was staying with her coworker,Patrice.

91
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,660
你今天好像不高兴 Robin 我给你做了些曲奇
You seem so down today,Robin. I made you cookies.

92
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,940
天哪 Patrice 你想逼死我吗!
Damn it,Patrice,stop smothering me!

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,660
所以当Quinn说她的公寓招租时
So,when Quinn said her apartment was available...

94
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,370
- 我要!我要!我要! - 我抢!我抢!我抢!
- It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! - Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,110
我们偏题了? 那Marshall呢?
We got off topic? What about Marshall?

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,220
我只是按照某人的建议在玩游戏
Hey,I was just going along with whoever suggested we play that game.

97
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,530
我们来玩个游戏吧!
Hey,let's play a game!

98
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,460
最疯狂的公共场所三俗故事 我先开头
Uh,craziest sex-in-public story; I'll start.

99
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,600
有个姑娘喜欢在电梯里搞搞
I was once with this chick who loved to get freaky in elevators.

100
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,440
电梯门一关 她突然趴下来 就像一只发热的小狗
Doors would close; suddenly,she's panting on all fours like a dog in heat.

101
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,850
- Marshall 别说了 - 我又没说是你
- Marshall,stop. - I never said that it was you.

102
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,820
去年八月  我和这姑娘来了次不戴套的
Okay,so anyway,last August,I go bareback with this same slut.

103
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,480
她虽然怀孕了 可以比以前更饥渴了
She get's pregnant; bitch is even hornier.

104
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,260
我曾经搞过一个人 做的时候在吃三明治
Oh,yeah? I was once with this dude who I caught eating a sandwich during sex.

105
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,690
肉丸子掉到我背上 滚到电梯地上
Big ol' meatball falls out,lands on my back,rolls on to the elevator floor.

106
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,350
很恶心是吧?
Hmm. Disgusting,right?

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,680
怎么 我又没说是你
What,I never said it was you.

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
抱歉我们没你们那么集中精力
Yeah,sorry we didn't stay as laser-focused as you guys.

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,420
至少我发现了证据
Hey,at least I got some evidence.

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,530
看我在Quinn卧室里发现了什么 Barney要带她去夏威夷
Look what I found in Quinn's bedroom. Barney's taking her to Hawaii.

111
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,370
Lily 你翻人家东西了?
Lily,you snooped through her stuff?

112
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,500
没有 第一眼就看到了
No. It's like the first thing you see

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,330
就像Jimmy日记里写的
when you jimmy open her desk drawer with a letter opener her grandfather left her,

114
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,300
用她爷爷留给她的开信刀 撬开桌子抽屉就行了
according to her diary.

115
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,600
头等舱机票 四星级酒店 Barney肯定花了不少钱
First-class tickets,a four-star hotel-- this cost Barney a fortune.

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,500
这表示Quinn完全是为了钱在利用他
Yeah,this proves that Quinn is totally using him for his money.

117
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,180
Lily 别闹了
You know what Lily,enough.

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,600
就算Quinn是这种人 但这是Barney
Guys,even if you're right about Quinn,this is Barney.

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,370
他总会想明白的 顶多花一个星期 最多两个星期
He'll come to his senses. I give this whole thing a week,two weeks,tops.

120
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,480
- 现在我们要宣布一件事 - 我来说吗?
- And now,we have an announcement. - Can I tell them?

121
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,310
- 不行 我们要搬到一起住了 - 我们...
- No. We're moving in together - We're m...

122
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,020
恭喜 太好了 真替你们高兴
- Congrats! - That's great. - So happy for you.

123
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,840
必须解决这个事
We gotta end this.

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
对
Yup.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
孩子们 你们应该记得
Kids,as you'll recall,

126
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,180
当我们其中一人快犯错误时 有一个小传统来解决问题
our gang had a subtle way of letting someone know they were making a mistake.

127
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,390
{\a6}<i>劝说会</i>
<i>intervention</i>

128
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,190
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

129
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,380
正经事 等等
Oh,worth it. Hang on.

130
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,160
<i>Quinn说会</i>
<i>quin***</i>

131
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,050
我们确实很烦人是吧?
You know we would've hated ourselves,right?

132
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,960
Robin告诉你们她今天所做的 见不得人的事儿了吗?
So,did Robin tell you the incredibly devious thing she did today?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
我?!
Me?!

134
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,400
我正好路过
Hey,so I just happened to be in the neighborhood

135
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,080
我忽然想到 上帝啊 Quinn的身材 好到爆 绝对喜欢水果
and I thought,"Man,Quinn is in such great shape,she must love fruit.

136
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,930

好吧 我来满足她

201
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,470

204
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,580
我让Ted发誓不告诉他们你的职业
I made Ted promise not to tell them what you do,

205
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,570
可他还是说了 他们现在不信任你
but he did,and now they don't trust you.

206
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,960
那可真伤人
Wow,that really hurts.

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,580
更糟的是你觉得你需要对此隐瞒
But what's even worse is that you felt the need to lie about me.

208
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,180
我不以自己为耻 Barney 显然你会
I'm not ashamed of who I am,Barney,but you clearly are.

209

我不以你为耻 我只是不希望 他们随意评价你
I'm not ashamed of you. I just didn't want them to judge you without...

也许我们进展太快了
Maybe we are moving too fast.

211
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,090
什么?这什么意思?
What? What is that supposed to mean?

212
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,640
我觉得我没法儿这样
I don't think I can do this.

213
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,210
等等 这就是你一贯的结束方式?
Wait,are you ending things just like that?

214
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,380
如果你走出了那扇门 你就证明了 他们是对的
If you walk out that door,you prove them right.

215

证明了你只是个毫无感情可言的 脱衣舞女郎
You prove that you're just some heartless stripper

216

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,570
不许给我打电话
Don't call me.

218
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,240
这下真够狠的 (Marshall还想让Lily加上Quinn)

我们刚刚毁了可能一生一次的幸福
We just destroyed what could have been a once-in-a-lifetime shot at happiness.

220

我知道 我也很有负罪感
I know. I feel guilty,too.

221
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,260
壁炉 阳台 硬木地板...
Fireplace,balcony,hardwood floors...

222
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,930
好 我就这么说
Okay,I'll just say it:

223
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,300
在经历了我们之间的风风雨雨之后
After everything that happened between us,

224
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,390
我不敢相信你不示弱 还不让我租Quinn的房子
I can't believe you wouldn't back down and let me have Quinn's place.

225
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,880
Ted 我们能出去谈谈吗?
Ted,can I talk to you out in the hall?

226
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,120
你有没有想过过去的几周对我来说 也不容易?
Has it ever occurred to you that the last few weeks haven't been easy for me either?

227

在一天的时间里 我的婚约取消了

What do you mean?

231
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,950
我工作完全无法集中精神
I-I've been completely distracted at work.

232
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,630
我老板想在星期五五点见我
And now my boss wants to see me Friday at 5:00,

233
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,770
公司人都知道那是"炒鱿鱼时间"
which,around the office,is known as "fire o'clock."

234
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,970
- 我不知道 - 你怎么会?
- I had no idea. - How could you?

235
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,010
我最想谈谈的人甚至都不看我一眼
The one person I want to talk to most barely looks me in the eye anymore,

236
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,170
不回我电话
much less returns my calls.

237
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,030
Ted我知道让你说爱我不容易
Ted,I know it took guts to tell me you love me.

238
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,330
我知道我没回应你很受伤
And I-I know how much it hurt that I didn't say it back,but...

239
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,780
见鬼 我也很难受
Damn it,th-this sucks for me,too.

240
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,180
我想你了
And I-I miss you.

241
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,790
有什么办法能让我们...
Is there any way we can just...

242
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,230
恢复正常?
go back to normal?

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,470
我觉得我们没法儿回到过去了
I don't think I can do normal anymore.

244
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,450
Barney还不回电话 我们得去找他 跟他道歉
Barney still isn't answering. We gotta go find him and apologize.

245
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,270

Oh. I thought you were Quinn.

246
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,890
Barney对不起 我们不该那样插手
Barney,we're so sorry. We never should've meddled like that.

247
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,130
能原谅我们吗?
Can you forgive us?

248
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,070
不知道 你们无权那么做
I don't know. You had no right to do that.

249
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,240
伙计 我们要怎么补偿你?
How can we make it up to you,buddy?

250
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,050
我 Barney的挚友之一
I,one of Barney's best friends...

251
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,790
"我 Barney的挚友之一"

252
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,880
发誓永远不再干涉他的私人生活
... promise never to interfere with his personal life again...

253
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,550
"发誓永远不再干涉他的私人生活"
"...promise never to interfere with his personal life again..."

254
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,310
除非有关健康 国家安全
...unless it's an issue of health,national security,

255
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,780
或者他变胖
or he's about to get up on a fattie.

256
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,750
"除非有关健康 国家安全
"...unless it's an issue of health,national security,

257
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,780
或者他变胖"
or he's about to get up on a fattie."

258
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,340
为了坚固这个誓言 两位女士亲吻
And now,to seal this sacred vow,the two ladies will kiss.

259
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,850
- Barney... - 两位女士亲吻!
- Barney... - The two ladies will kiss!

260
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,360
Lil...好吧
Lil... Okay.

261
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,160
- 现在轮到男士 - 伙计...
- And now the gentlemen. - Dude...

262

该男士们了!
And now the gentlemen!

263
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,590
我们就...这样也太蠢了
Let's just... This is silly.

264
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,060
别 别捧着我的脸
Don't-don't touch my face.

265
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,530
我本来是要说 "该先生们碰拳了"
I was going to say,"And now the gentlemen bump fists.

266
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,940
你们是憋了多久了?
" How long you been holding back that one?

267
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,410
很劲爆啊 各位
Hot stuff,fellas.

268
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,790
舌头功夫都用上了吧?
Did I see a little tongue in there?

269
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,060
我不明白
I don't understand.

270
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,490
如果这两个家伙能有半秒的时间 不把手放在对方身上我就解释
Well,if these two will keep their sweaty paws off each other for half a second,I'll explain.

271
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,630
一切开始于几天前...
It all started a couple days ago...

272
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,230
我想让你见见我的朋友们
I want you to meet my friends.

273
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,440
我该不该紧张啊?  这是不是相当于见家长了?
Should I be nervous? Is it like bringing me home to meet your parents?

274
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,390
不 不 不 比见家长压力还大
No,no,no. Much more stressful than that.

275
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,130
我的朋友们 虽然人都很好 但有时候也很专横 爱管闲事 破坏力超大
You see,my friends,while awesome,can be presumptuous, meddlesome and downright destructive.

276
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,360
如果他们知道了你的工作 和我们是如何相遇
When they learn what you do and how we met,

277
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,770
他们可能会想办法拆散我们
they'll probably try to break us up.

278
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,040
所以让我们耍耍他们吧
So let's have some fun with them. Mess with their heads.

279
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,760
你是说...邪恶计划?
Are you saying... evil plan?

280
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,450
没错
Hells to the yes.

281
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,350
上帝 你太性感了
My God,you're hot.

282
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,380
等一下
Wait for it.

283
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,770
我们就这么办
Here's what we do.

284
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,740
我先让Ted发誓不告诉任何人你的身份
I'll make Ted swear not to tell anyone what he knows about you,

285
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,250
然后他就会马上崩溃了
and he'll cave immediately.

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,630
Barney正在和一个脱衣舞女约会 她会把他的所有钱骗走!
Barney's dating a stripper who's gonna steal all his money!

287
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,970
然后 我们就请所有人来玩儿 我就会一直说这样的话:
Next,we invite everyone over. I'll keep saying stuff like:

288
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,020
我是不是应该 把鹰嘴豆泥拿出来了 娃娃脸?
Is it okay if I put out the hummus,bunny face?

289
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,440
然后我就演一个跋扈的贱人 说:
And I'll be the bossy bitch who says:

290
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,380
不要 留着当甜点 白痴
No,save it for dessert,idiot.

291
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,430
漂亮 最后 我们就宣布...
Nice. And,finally,we'll announce...

292
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,200
我们要同居了!
We're moving in together!

293
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
我又有一个主意
I've got an idea.

294
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,860
我们应该让Ted和Robin 为我的公寓争斗不休
Let's get your friends Ted and Robin fighting over my apartment.

295
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,530
等下 这和我们有什么关系?
Wait,what does that have to do with you and me?

296
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,230
没什么关系 我就是喜欢闹剧
Nothing. I just worship chaos.

297
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,090
你太性感了 我受不了了
I can't handle how hot you are right now.

298
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,500
等一下
Wait for it.

299
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,650
接下来 他们肯定会劝我甩了你
Next, they'll try to talk me into dumping you.

300
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,450
- 然后我去撞个正着 - 然后我们就假装要分手
- And I'll walk in on it. - Then we pretend to break up.

301
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,080
然后等他们回来祈求原谅时...
And when they crawl back,begging for forgiveness...

302
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,510
我就当个好人 结束这个闹剧
I'll be the bigger man and let them off the hook.

303
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,690
或者让猴子们为你起舞
Or make the monkeys dance for you.

304
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,710
上帝 你太聪明了!
God,you're smart!

305
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,400
这将会是传...
It's gonna be legen...

306
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,480
我等不了了
I'm not waiting for it anymore.

307
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,830

天生一对
Perfect together.

310
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,130
所以你们不是真的同居?
So you're not really moving in?

311
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,460
开始的时候是个玩笑来着 但我们越是讨论...
Well,it started out as a joke,but the more we talked about it...

312
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,520
越觉得激动 所以 我们确实同居了
The more excited we got. So,yeah,we are.

313
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,350
你们就没有什么要说的?

318
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,780

319
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,900
这就是我们如何遇见Quinn的故事
And that's the story of how we met Quinn.

320

那个周五 我去见了Robin 问她"解雇时刻"的结果如何
That Friday,I met Robin to see how it went at "fire o'clock.

321

By opening night,I was too big for the flying harness,and,well...

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,930
我手先落下掉在Jenna Cristalli身上

The tissues in her bra saved me two broken wrists.

车是你偷来去看金属乐队演唱会的

357
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,710
然后你和那个婊子上了三垒

谢谢你并不介意我的工作

361
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,270
很多男人都会觉得怪异或者吃醋
A lot of guys would be weird or jealous.

362
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,950
开什么玩笑? 我哪有资格去指责别人?  我就是大魔头!
Are you kidding? Who am I to judge anyone? I'm the devil!

我是说如果你不想跳脱衣舞的话 我会支持你的
I mean,if you ever wanted to stop stripping,I'd support it.

365
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,570
哈 所以说 你还是吃醋了?

我绝对理解你
I'd completely understand.

369
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,720
不必了 我挺享受为钱宽衣的感觉
Nah,I like taking my clothes off for money.

370
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,990
很好 等我...等我说完
Great. Let me... let me finish.

371
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,620
假设一下 你怎样才愿意不跳?
Hypothetically,what would make you stop?

372
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,880
假设一下...
Hypothetically...

373
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,400
如果我结婚了 就不跳了
I would stop stripping if I ever got married.

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,790
晚安
Good night.

375
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,400
然后我们决定"回到普通朋友"
And then we agreed to "go back to normal.

376
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,150
但是我开始怀疑 我们真的能只做普通朋友吗
" But I'm starting to wonder if we can ever really just be friends.

377
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,240
总之 这就是我和Robin  2005年到现在的故事
Anyway,that's the story of me and Robin,2005 to the present.

378
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,550

379
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,540
我觉得你的故事也太长了
I think your stories are way too long.

380
