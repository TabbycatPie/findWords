1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,830
This season, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,480
I was told once that a man

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,830
cannot live by two names.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,720
I thought that I could be me and the arrow,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,750
but I can't.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,470
I see it in your eyes--

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,800
The struggle you have with your dual identity.

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,160
I am the demon's head. I want you to take my place.

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,920
I want you to become the next Ra's Al Ghul.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,140
Oliver queen is the Arrow.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,860
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,830
There is no more Arrow.

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,370
Ra's took that from you.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,300
Take your rightful place as heir to the demon,

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,990
and Ra's Al Ghul will bring your sister back.

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,570
All this time, I've been struggling with who I am.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,520
Do you recognize this?

18
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,340
The Alpha and Omega bioweapon.

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,880
You will unleash this on Starling City.

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,380
My son was killed by the virus

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,320
Ra's intends to use on your city.

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,070
Oliver...

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,310
You asked us to trust you and we trusted you!

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,320
No, Oliver!

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,130
You were asleep.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,390
I was dreaming.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,590
Ibn Sirin once wrote there are three types of dreams--

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,460
there are ones about truth;

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,500
there are ones about desire,

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,580
and there are ones about temptation.

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,850
What did you dream of?

32
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,220
Rebirth...

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,000
As Ra's Al Ghul.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,300
There is no greater burden

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,020
than the one you're about to take on--

36
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,150
the annihilation of one's home.

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,310
It is necessary to complete my ascension.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,350
And I will be there to steady your hand when the time comes.

39
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,740
I appreciate your assistance.

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,860
Soon you will wear this.

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,030
And you will command a multitude,

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,090
and I shall call you Ra's.

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,450
Something's wrong.

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,500
Not that I'm complaining,

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,240
but shouldn't we be dead by now?

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,410
Oliver tried to kill us.

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,450
Ra's tried.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,770
Oliver was forced to let him appear to be successful.

49
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,280
So now we're back to trust Oliver,

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,870
and while we're at it, trust you, too?

51
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,520
Yeah, because the last time I checked,

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,610
you tried to make a deal with Ra's to save yourself.

53
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,030
In order for our plan to work,

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Ra's trust in Oliver had to be complete.

55
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,830
And after that plane fiasco, it wasn't.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,730
Oliver needed to demonstrate

57
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,710
one more time his loyalty to Ra's.

58
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,880
Which I guess brings us back to...

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
why aren't we dead?

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,630
Not that I'm complaining.

61
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,390
Oliver...

62
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,100
was vaccinated against the Alpha Omega virus five years ago.

63
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,110
An associate was able to draw a version of the vaccine

64
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,690
from his blood.

65
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,150
A synthetic skin graft.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,700
Upon our incarceration,

67
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,290
I was able to vaccinate

68
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,810
each one of you cutaneously.

69
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,790
I saved your lives.

70
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,030
I believe the words you're searching for

71
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,630
are "Thank" and "You."

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,510
Ok.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,400
Assuming this is all some part

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,740
of a brilliant double double cross

75
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,610
or triple cross-- I'm losing count--

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,880
your master plan still has one major flaw,

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,940
since we're still chained in a dungeon.

78
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,150
Patience, Miss Smoak.

79
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,620
All we have to do is wait.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,640
Wait for what?

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,450
The thunder.

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,030
Keep walking.

83
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,970
It's time.

84
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,670
All right.

85
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,590
You guys have a hot tub?

86
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,450
Nice.

87
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,210
Hi, you guys!

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,550
I mean, this is like a real dungeon!

89
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,480
Barry!

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,340
Thank you, Felicity.

91
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,990
You just outed my secret identity to a super villain.

92
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,340
No offense.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
None taken.

94
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,230
Now get us out of here!

95
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,670
All right, uh, stand back.

96
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,090
Excellent.

97
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,460
How many assassins, do you figure?

98
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,050
Uh, none. They're all taking a little nappy time.

99
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,680
Thank you. And not to be greedy,

100
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,040
but we could really use your help

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,340
on this whole Starling City super virus thing.

102
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,490
And you know I would, but I am overdue

103
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,620
for a very pointed conversation with Harrison Wells.

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,350
I'm sure Oliver's got this.

105
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,590
I wouldn't count on it.

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,190
Oliver hasn't been very forthcoming

107
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,400
with his plans lately.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,010
Well, I don't know

109
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,480
what's been going on with him lately,

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,120
apart from a recent wardrobe change,

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,230
but one thing that hasn't changed is,

112
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,850
he needs you guys.

113
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,770
Even if he doesn't think so.

114
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,380
Good luck.

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,730
I'll never get used to that.

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Well, there goes our ride home. John?

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,350
The plane we came in is still secure,

118
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,900
but we need to get to it quickly.

119
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,520
Come on.

120
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,250
Tatsu. Let's go, we're leaving.

121
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,600
I left a life of solitude because Oliver asked it of me.

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
It's time to return to it.

123
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,190
I'm wired.

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,690
In direct communication with my men outside.

125
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm going to count to five.

126
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,600
One...

127
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,200
What's happening?

128
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,220
Two engines are down.

129
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,340
We're trying to compensate, but they've been tampered with.

130
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,400
Sabotage?

131
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,180
You!

132
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,780
This is all your doing.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,650
Don't!

134
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,530
Nyssa had nothing to do with this.

135
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,760
You were delivered by the prophecy.

136
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,740
You wed my daughter.

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,770
Your name is Al Sah-Him

138
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,670
and you are Wareeth Al Ghul!

139
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,960
My name...

140
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,290
is Oliver Queen!

141
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,880
Oliver Queen is dead.

142
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,380
And soon, you will be, too!

143
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,860
I handed you my crusade!

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,390
My only mission!

145
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,580
I already have one.

146
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,220
Survive this,

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,140
and I will come for you again and again

148
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,290
until your end of days!

149
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,490
But first, your city will perish!

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,330
It's the only parachute.

151
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,140
Stay strapped in and do exactly as I say.

152
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,190
All right, we've lost hydraulics.

153
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,170
Is there a red lever by your right leg?

154
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,030
Yes!

155
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,070
Ok, on my go,

156
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,090
you'll pull it up, you'll turn it clockwise,

157
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,610
push it back down. You understand?

158
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,350
Yes!

159
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,740
3, 2, 1. Now!

160
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,790
Now back down!

161
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,280
This is going to hurt.

162
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,670
Oh, no.

163
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,780
I couldn't.

164
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,310
He loved you.

165
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,740
You were his friend.

166
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,450
Excuse me.

167
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,190
My people will be looking for me.

168
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
It's just a matter of time till they find me.

169
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,170
Do it.

170
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,660
Do you remember Amanda Walle?

171
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,280
She's the reason that I'm in Hong Kong.

172
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,050
She thought I had a special talent.

173
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,800
She taught me things.

174
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,510
Let me show you.

175
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,190
We don't have much time.

176
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,310
For what?

177
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,870
I thought you said Oliver had a plan.

178
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,820
Yeah, and in the event that it doesn't work,

179
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,280
He has a back-up

180
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
us.

181
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,880
John, let's determine

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,220
the status of our arsenal.

183
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,610
Laurel, go to your father; start mobilizing the police.

184
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,990
Mr. Palmer, I need you to find something that will neutralize

185
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,230
an airborne contagion.

186
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,490
Miss Smoak, let's find out

187
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,580
where our League of Assassin friends might be.

188
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm sorry. Did I mumble?

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,800
We follow his lead.

190
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,770
For now.

191
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,310
Ah, guys, I set up a proximity alarm

192
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,300
to detect an unauthorized entry to this level.

193
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,830
It's going off like crazy.

194
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,240
Nyssa.

195
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,010
- John-- - You son of a bitch!

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
Maybe we should give these guys the room.

197
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,110
Nyssa looks happy.

198
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,430
You two on your honeymoon?

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,060
What the hell's going on, Oliver?

200
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,910
Start talking!

201
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,330
The reason that I have

202
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,050
kept Malcolm close for the past several months

203
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,240
is because he had critical intel on our enemy.

204
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,950
He knows Ra's. He knows the league.

205
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,670
And he knew that if I was appointed his successor,

206
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,160
that meant Starling City was marked for death.

207
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,840
The only way that we were going to defeat the league

208
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,380
was from the inside.

209
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,890
I had to get close enough to Ra's to find out how he was

210
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,220
going to destroy the city...

211
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,100
and stop him.

212
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,860
You trusted malcolm Merlyn

213
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,970
more than you did the two people closest to you!

214
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,450
John, it wasn't about trust!

215
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,760
It was about making sure that you and you were safe.

216
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,330
I had to keep the circle as small as possible.

217
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,630
How did you expect to repair all this once you got back?

218
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,650
I didn't.

219
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,070
I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling

220
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,410
and I sabotaged the plane.

221
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,940
The plan...

222
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,380
was to kill ra's and destroy the virus.

223
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,890
It didn't work.

224
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,720
How did you expect to survive the plane crash?

225
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,020
You didn't.

226
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,140
You never expected to have this conversation.

227
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,050
You were planning on dying.

228
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,380
So that was your big plan?

229
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,760
Sacrificing yourself to take out Ra's?

230
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,730
It was the only way.

231
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,800
At least now that it didn't work,

232
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,390
I get a chance to tell both of you

233
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,460
how sorry I am.

234
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,530
Sorry won't cut it, Oliver.

235
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,700
Not this time.

236
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,600
But we have bigger problems

237
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,300
than hurt feelings

238
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,860
and broken trust.

239
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,740
Laurel needs to contact her father.

240
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,900
Ray needs to find a way to counteract the virus.

241
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,350
I'm sure Malcolm told you...

242
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,740
we don't have a lot of time.

243
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,420
Oliver!

244
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,240
What have you done?

245
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,650
He failed this city.

246
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,270
And I'm giving him the justice he deserves.

247
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,560
This isn't justice!

248
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,180
It's... wrong.

249
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,540
He's still alive.

250
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,510
Just passed out from the pain.

251
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,290
What'd you find?

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,830
My father isn't using any of the league's

253
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,430
ordinary redoubts in the city.

254
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,650
If Ra's is here with the virus,

255
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,160
why hasn't he used it yet?

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,680
Where are we?

257
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,260
Nowhere. Ra's is old school.

258
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,590
Every way I have of finding him is new school.

259
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,660
Oliver, maybe we need to change the way we're looking for him.

260
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,170
If we're trying to find a sub that's gone dark,

261
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,050
we should look for what's out of the ordinary in the water.

262
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,280
So we look for what's unusual

263
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,790
and maybe that points us

264
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,210
to how or where Ra's plans to release the virus.

265
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,800
Traffic lights were down for 20 minutes at Adams and O'Neil.

266
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,110
All computers at Starling National Bank are offline.

267
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,960
The entire top floor of the Essex Hotel is closed.

268
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,480
There's an electrical spike at 52nd and Robson.

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,140
Wait, go back. The top floor of the Essex is closed.

270
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,100
My father doesn't frequent hotels.

271
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,270
According to internal emails,

272
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,330
the floor was shut down for a Damien Darhk.

273
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,230
A name like that has to be an alias.

274
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,430
Damien Darhk is in Starling city.

275
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,040
My father's most bitter enemy.

276
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,760
That's why Ra's hasn't released the virus.

277
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,010
He wants to use it to kill Damien Darhk.

278
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,840
This was never just about my ascension.

279
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,640
Ra's wants to take out his nemesis.

280
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,770
Looks like you weren't the only one with a hidden agenda.

281
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,260
This can work for us.

282
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,040
Ra's wants Damien.

283
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,840
So we give him Damien.

284
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,870
We trade Damien for the virus.

285
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,980
That is remarkably ruthless and cold-blooded.

286
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,630
I approve.

287
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,690
Count two on the roof,

288
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,430
One on the penthouse floor.

289
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,410
I got two guarding the elevators,

290
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,680
another three going in and out of the service entrance.

291
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,020
And a patrol in the stairwell.

292
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,770
Same for the northwest corridor.

293
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,150
Keep Darhk's men from joining the party.

294
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,210
Getting into position.

295
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,030
Damien Darhk.

296
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,590
You know, the hotel's going to bill me for that window.

297
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,640
Turn around!

298
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,140
This is bold,

299
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,330
Even for Ra's.

300
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,870
Ra's Al Ghul wants you dead.

301
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,740
He's planning a bioweapon to take you out.

302
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,470
Well, that's a considerable amount of work to go to.

303
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,420
Ra's certainly must want Mr. Darhk off the board.

304
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,810
Oh, you seem surprised.

305
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,930
Mr. Darhk left Starling the moment he learned

306
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,500
of Ra's' intention.

307
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,650
It's amusing the demon's head

308
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,410
thinks he can catch my employer unawares.

309
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,260
It's just my phone.

310
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,010
Hello, Al Sah-him.

311
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,880
Apparently both our plans did not go as we'd hoped.

312
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,790
I'm going to find you.

313
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,500
It was a bold gambit, hoping to leverage Mr. Darhk,

314
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,270
but one which had done you no good.

315
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,490
I set in motion the death of your city

316
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,280
10 minutes ago.

317
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,140
The Alpha Omega shall be disseminated by means of four vessels.

318
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,970
Four instruments of death.

319
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,510
And I doubt that you and your friends

320
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,150
will have time to stop all of them.

321
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,160
Unlike you, Oliver Queen,

322
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,170
I'm a man of my word.

323
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,780
And I swore that you would see your city perish.

324
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,840
I told you I needed the dd-fives for the Andreyko case on my desk,

325
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,100
and unless I recently went blind, they're not here!

326
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,200
Now what...

327
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,230
I got to put you on hold for a second.

328
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,920
Won't be long.

329
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,980
I thought you and I agreed to give ourselves some space.

330
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,640
Not when the city's in danger.

331
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,580
I don't have time for this.

332
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,720
Wait. Do you remember that chemical spill

333
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,980
in Hong Kong five years ago?

334
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,080
It turns out, it was a biological attack

335
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,240
- and that bioweapon... - Let me guess.

336
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,780
This is coming from your buddy Queen, right?

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,630
The city's under attack? Must be may?

338
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,930
What do...

339
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,420
You still keep it in the middle drawer?

340
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,870
- What? - The bottle?

341
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,100
I'm going to bet that it's scotch.

342
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,390
It's not what you think it is.

343
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,460
Don't.

344
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,910
If you want to drink, then drink.

345
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,100
But don't just stand there and lie to me right to my face.

346
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,380
Doesn't feel good, does it?

347
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,310
It makes you thirsty.

348
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,550
I love you.

349
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,460
No matter what happens between us, that'll never change.

350
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,460
You can hate me for lying,

351
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,080
you can blame Oliver for Sara,

352
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,290
you can even blame me.

353
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,460
But falling off the wagon, that's on you.

354
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
I got it under control, all right?

355
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,250
It's two drinks a day and that's it.

356
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,630
We're alcoholics, dad! Drunks!

357
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,490
There's no such thing as two drinks a day.

358
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,270
And now you have a choice.

359
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,620
You can keep drinking

360
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,780
and keep being angry at me and Oliver or the rest of the world, if you want.

361
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,080
Or you can make both of your daughters proud

362
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,430
and throw away the bottle and help save the city.

363
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,190
John, Malcolm, and Nyssa are on their way back.

364
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,330
- What happened with Darhk? - He was gone.

365
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,900
Man that I found was a cut-out.

366
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,470
Ra's plans to release the virus at four points across the city.

367
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,240
I worked out a containment system that can safely neutralize the virus,

368
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,260
if we can get our hands on it.

369
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,310
Well, we need four of them,

370
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,530
and a way to spread the inoculant if this gets out of control.

371
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,450
I scrubbed through all the information that Malcolm gave us

372
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,080
on the Hong Kong attack five years ago.

373
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,960
The Alpha Omega virus gave off a low level

374
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,890
mission from its R.N.A., almost like radiation.

375
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,470
If you can hack the Keyhole Hexagon satellite,

376
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,000
you can tune the quadband to search for it...

377
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
which you've been doing for the last five minutes.

378
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,480
We need probable locations

379
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,990
where he would release the virus

380
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,170
as soon as you can get them.

381
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,790
Maseo!

382
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,700
Where you going?

383
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,230
I don't know.

384
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,080
All I know...

385
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,760
is I wasn't strong enough

386
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,260
to save my son.

387
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,500
Or to do what Oliver did.

388
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,530
What oliver did was horrible.

389
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,660
He allowed himself to become a monster.

390
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,870
No more of a monster than I am.

391
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,490
I am...

392
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,020
without a soul, Tatsu.

393
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,710
Only if you abandon your wife when she needs you the most.

394
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,210
Every time...

395
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,350
I look in your eyes...

396
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,910
I see my son's.

397
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,540
I see my failure.

398
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,040
I love you.

399
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,290
I'm not worthy of that love.

400
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,740
Where's he going?

401
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,260
Somewhere we cannot follow.

402
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,100
I know I said I would never, ever bring you coffee again,

403
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,780
but the city facing

404
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,620
a bioweapon attack

405
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,690
seemed like a valid exception.

406
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,860
So your plan to take out Ra's by dying...

407
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,760
We should talk about that.

408
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,200
Every night since the mountain,

409
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
I've had the same dream.

410
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,260
You are pleading with me not to go face Ra's,

411
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,560
and I listen to you.

412
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,610
Sometimes the dream still ends badly;

413
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,930
I end up with this sword in my chest.

414
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,840
But most of the time,

415
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,490
we escape.

416
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,080
And we're just driving.

417
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,140
And all this seems...

418
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,120
it seems so far away,

419
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,710
because it's just...

420
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,110
it's the two of us.

421
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,190
I know you think that that's not possible,

422
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
that you dead and Ra's

423
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,730
dead is the only realistic best case scenario.

424
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,150
Felicity...

425
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,230
I can't defeat Ra's Al Ghul.

426
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,940
Oliver Queen can't.

427
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,930
The Arrow can't.

428
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,670
Both those men tried and both those men failed.

429
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,950
You remember what you said to me during our night together

430
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,100
in Nanda Parbat?

431
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,020
You're no longer either of those men.

432
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,770
You've become...

433
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,820
someone else.

434
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,390
Become something else.

435
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,290
This...

436
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,220
is different now.

437
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,760
Because despite your best efforts,

438
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,100
you've allowed yourself to feel something.

439
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,980
I know you think that that's a weakness; it's not.

440
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,790
It's your key

441
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,010
to beating Ra's.

442
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,310
Don't fight to die.

443
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,510
Fight to live.

444
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,700
Satellite trace is back. I've got four locations.

445
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,640
OK, let's go.

446
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,450
Felicity...

447
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,900
thank you.

448
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,330
All right, yeah, got 'em.

449
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,490
I don't know, we'll talk about that later.

450
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,670
I need all units. I need E.S.U., all squad cars

451
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,030
converging on these four locations.

452
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,300
We got a potential bioweapons attack.

453
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,280
I'm onsite.

454
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,960
Onsite.

455
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,710
Onsite.

456
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,230
I'm onsite,

457
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,850
But I have no idea what I should be looking for around here.

458
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,300
Do you see anyone in a League of Assassins outfit?

459
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,530
That would be a dead giveaway.

460
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,480
I have no weapons.

461
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,940
And I have no virus.

462
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,940
Ra's Al Ghul awaits you on the Starling City dam.

463
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,050
He wishes to be in your presence

464
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,520
as your city dies.

465
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,160
And what makes him think that I won't just stay focused

466
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,790
on saving my city?

467
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,020
Because he knows of your deluded belief

468
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,910
that you can defeat him in battle.

469
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,070
And you know that as long as the demon's head lives,

470
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,440
he will continue to threaten your home.

471
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,180
Ok, I got a runner carrying a metal briefcase.

472
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,970
The bioweapon is going to be in the briefcase.

473
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
OK, I'm scrubbing footage from traffic

474
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,540
and surveillance cameras at the remaining three locations.

475
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,620
Don't... move.

476
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,490
- Nice threads. - Thanks.

477
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,750
Felicity, the briefcase is empty.

478
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,730
It's empty!

479
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,400
Where's the virus?

480
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,750
Where's the virus?!

481
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,880
He is the weapon.

482
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,200
Ra's is using his own men to disperse the virus!

483
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,980
And we will not be stopped.

484
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,200
The will of Ra's Al Ghul is our own!

485
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

486
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,560
I knew you couldn't resist.

487
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,290
The man who survives the sword of Ra's Al Ghul

488
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,390
shall become Ra's Al Ghul.

489
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,250
So you brought me here to kill you?

490
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,350
Either way, I am victorious.

491
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,110
You either ascend to Ra's as I have designed,

492
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,340
or you will die. And the last thing

493
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,460
you will ever see is your beloved city

494
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,660
succumbing to disease and death.

495
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,150
Look out! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

496
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,830
Get back! Go! Go, run!

497
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,550
Go, go, go, go, go!

498
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,610
Get back, go, go, go, go, go, go!

499
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,440
Everybody get back!

500
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,550
You got to get out of here!

501
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,400
No, Malcolm inoculated me. Oh, my god.

502
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,030
Starling city appears to be in the throes of a biological attack.

503
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,110
Outbreak at Nelson Plaza. It's bad.

504
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,200
It looks the virus spreads

505
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,400
when infected blood is exposed to open air.

506
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,860
Even if we find Ra's men, how are we supposed

507
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,650
to stop them from spreading the virus?

508
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,750
Really bad temporary solution--

509
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,770
get them off the streets in a secured place as possible

510
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,600
and do not let them cut themselves.

511
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
Wait. You're not inoculated.

512
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,430
This is my father's doing.

513
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,900
I will see it undone.

514
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,100
You choose a sword that has already defeated you in battle.

515
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,970
Miss Smoak, I've taken out one of Ra's' men.

516
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,390
Don't take chances. Put that body some place airtight,

517
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,300
and try not to kill anyone else, while you're at it!

518
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,340
The virus is spreading. Can you replicate the inoculant?

519
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,820
That is the easy part.

520
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,470
The hard part is disseminating it over a three block radius.

521
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,570
Your nanotech.

522
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,980
Can you make them airborne?

523
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,680
That is what I'm trying to do.

524
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,640
I have been a most excellent trainer.

525
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,790
We need to get this guy somewhere he can't infect anyone.

526
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,450
What the hell's going on here?

527
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,230
We're in the middle of a city-wide crisis.

528
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,190
I don't have time for this.

529
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,750
We've got two suspects up on the dam.

530
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,110
Don't know why they're fighting each other,

531
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,400
but the chief says they're responsible for what's happening.

532
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,000
He's ordered me to take them out as soon as I have a clean shot.

533
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,070
Something has changed within you, boy.

534
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,510
Your will to live burns brighter,

535
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,240
and yet you rejected my offer of eternal life.

536
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,710
What you were offering wasn't living!

537
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,180
Power serves you no interest.

538
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
You'd rather love.

539
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,570
A man who condemns his daughter to death wouldn't understand.

540
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,540
Detective, Captain?

541
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,710
We got a problem.

542
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,470
You're going to have to be a lot more specific.

543
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,270
I'm pretty sure your boy is at the Starling City dam,

544
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,040
and I got officers not listening to me

545
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,200
getting ready to shoot him.

546
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,210
Now, despite what I think about your guy,

547
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,310
I don't want to see him killed

548
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,140
while I think he is trying to save the city.

549
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,890
But unless you order up a miracle pretty quick,

550
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,640
that's exactly what's going to happen.

551
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,050
- Got number four. - Hold on a second, John.

552
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,120
We have a new problem.

553
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,400
Hey, you have to get to Starling City dam. You have to fly.

554
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,910
I'm still uploading the operating code to the nanotech.

555
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,260
And I'm still rewriting on the fly.

556
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,290
I--I can't leave the station. Why?

557
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,150
Oliver's in trouble. He needs your help.

558
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,420
Felicity, if I can't get

559
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,560
the nanotech to disperse the inoculant,

560
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,200
thousands of people in this city will die.

561
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,670
What? No! Ray, Oliver!

562
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,830
It's one life against the city's.

563
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,310
What would Oliver do?

564
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,100
Unlike you,

565
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,450
thousands of honorable men will mourn my death

566
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,160
when I leave this earth.

567
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,640
No.

568
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,780
They will kneel

569
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,730
before the next Ra's Al Ghul.

570
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,040
I knew I chose well with you, boy.

571
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,960
If I could figure out how

572
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,840
to get this thing off, I would be kissing you right now.

573
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,780
The casualty count would have been much higher

574
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,010
if not for an airborne inoculant

575
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,320
that rumors credit Palmer Technologies with developing.

576
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,820
You killed my father.

577
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,800
I had to.

578
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,130
I wanted to be the one.

579
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,370
You're lucky you're still alive.

580
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,530
You wouldn't be had you not been wearing League armor.

581
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,100
I like to think I had

582
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,700
a little something to do with that.

583
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,910
When I started this,

584
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,340
I wanted to keep you as far away from it as possible,

585
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,890
because that has always been my instinct--

586
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,150
to go it alone.

587
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,410
But the truth is that we won tonight

588
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,770
because I wasn't alone.

589
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,500
I thought that this crusade would only end with my death.

590
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,540
But even if I had died tonight,

591
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,750
it would live on, because of you...

592
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,670
and you.

593
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,430
Oh, and you.

594
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,460
It's true.

595
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,340
This city isn't lacking masks.

596
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,410
Heroes.

597
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,920
Which is why I no longer need to be one.

598
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,180
What are you saying?

599
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,620
Ra's took the Arrow identity from me.

600
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,650
I couldn't be that person even if I wanted to be.

601
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,860
And I don't want to be.

602
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,330
I told you that...

603
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,620
I couldn't be the Arrow and be with you.

604
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,380
I want to be with you.

605
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,490
You told me that I have become someone else,

606
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,670
and I would like to...

607
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,330
maybe discover a little more about that person.

608
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,270
If you'll come with me.

609
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,430
With you where?

610
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,420
Some place far away from here.

611
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,040
Even without me,

612
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,290
Starling still has heroes to watch over it.

613
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,410
John...

614
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,380
I'll talk to him.

615
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,940
- Wow. - Yeah.

616
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,490
That's the word I've been saying over and over in my head.

617
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,150
So, does that mean I'm going to have to find

618
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,810
a new vice president?

619
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,920
I think so.

620
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,560
I hope that you find someone who makes you happy, Ray.

621
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,870
You deserve that.

622
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,570
- John? - I'm happy for you, Oliver.

623
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,080
Despite our issues,

624
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,720
you deserve to be happy. You and Felicity.

625
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,650
And you're right, the city's in good hands.

626
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,560
- Including yours. - I'm no superhero.

627
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,700
You're a hero.

628
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,680
For three years, you've been a rock.

629
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,660
The city's rock, my rock.

630
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,390
For three years, you have been the person i can count on.

631
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,590
I'm still counting on you.

632
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,700
Oliver, I don't know if I can get past

633
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,220
what happened between the two of us.

634
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm not asking you to.

635
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,660
I'll think on it.

636
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,170
Ok.

637
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,110
John.

638
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,100
If you're going to keep going,

639
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,190
you may want to find a way to conceal your identity

640
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,380
when you're out there.

641
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,370
I'll think on that, too.

642
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,740
- You be well, Oliver. - You, too.

643
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,820
Where will you go?

644
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,610
Kumamoto.

645
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,480
There's a monastery there

646
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,910
near my childhood home.

647
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,050
I had always hoped to show it to Akio

648
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,490
when we returned to Japan as a family.

649
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,930
I'm so very sorry, Tatsu.

650
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,510
And where will you go?

651
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,410
Back to Starling City?

652
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,830
No, I...

653
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,200
I tortured Shrieve for hours.

654
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,450
I don't want that darkness around my mother or my sister.

655
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,240
What of your father?

656
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
You told me about his message.

657
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,710
His hope that you would save your city.

658
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,110
I'm not the man my father thinks I am.

659
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,200
Even if I was, I...

660
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,660
I should be alone.

661
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,540
I need to be alone.

662
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,330
Be well, Tatsu.

663
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,400
He's upstairs,

664
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,460
packing.

665
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,460
I'll be leaving Starling as well.

666
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,820
Try to imagine my profound disappointment.

667
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,980
Thea, I love you.

668
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,820
I know my actions always haven't shown that.

669
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,520
But I am your father.

670
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,100
and whatever you need,

671
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,000
I will always be there for you.

672
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,890
Yeah, well, don't wait by the phone.

673
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,600
But, a year ago,

674
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,590
you told me that you could teach me to be strong.

675
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,630
You've made good by that promise.

676
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,480
God, are you sure you really want to do this?

677
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
As sure as I was the last five times you asked me.

678
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,250
Be safe out there, ok?

679
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,680
As safe as anybody with a mask on can be.

680
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,020
But, actually, I was thinking, um,

681
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,030
maybe I'll call myself the Red Arrow?

682
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,210
I think I already told everyone to call you speedy.

683
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,290
As we agreed.

684
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,020
We've come a long way, you and I.

685
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,510
I've always looked at you as a son, Oliver.

686
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,630
And I'm glad we got to work together

687
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,550
to trust as we did.

688
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,270
I will never forgive you

689
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,920
for what you did to Sara.

690
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,420
And my sister.

691
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,490
Ever.

692
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,760
Does that mean we're enemies once more?

693
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,790
That depends on what you do with your end of the bargain.

694
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,910
Open new file.

695
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,700
"Atom project update gamma."

696
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,570
Had an interesting breakthrough

697
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,200
while repurposing nanotechnology

698
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,900
for anti-viral dissemination.

699
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,380
With the proper modifications,

700
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,550
the nanotech can be applied

701
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,940
to the miniaturization of key components

702
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,120
of the suit.

703
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,210
This will be miniaturization test number one.

704
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,860
Why can't anything ever work the first try?

705
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,590
At least admit this was your goal all along.

706
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,260
My only aspiration was to free myself of your father's grasp.

707
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,260
A feat we both managed to achieve.

708
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,800
I don't see how it was possible in your case.

709
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,950
When I was your father's captive three months ago,

710
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,800
he tortured me with his blade.

711
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
And you survived because my father chose to release you.

712
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,510
Funny thing, prophecies.

713
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,860
Fate and my father have shown you mercy.

714
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,660
I will not.

715
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,760
You took Sara from me, and I will have justice.

716
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,280
You are welcome to try.

717
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,180
Until then...

718
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,850
kneel before Ra's Al Ghul.

719
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,880
My name is Oliver Queen.

720
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,350
After five years in hell,

721
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,810
I returned home with only one goal--

722
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,970
to save my city.

723
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,140
And I did.

724
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,860
I became a hero who helped people.

725
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,040
But now it is time for me to be someone else.

726
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,880
It is time for me to be... something else.

727
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,930
So, where are we going?

728
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,500
I'm thinking a state that can annul a Nanda Parbat marriage.

729
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,910
Can I say something strange?

730
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,750
I'm happy.
