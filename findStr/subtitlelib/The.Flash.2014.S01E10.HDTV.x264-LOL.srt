180
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,888
- Okay, thanks.

181
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:27,032
- No second thoughts
about moving in together?

182
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,200
- None.

183
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,905
- Joe, hey.

184
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,840
- Hey. I'm glad you're back.

185
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,675
I've been going
over snart's file.

186
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:40,346
- Thanks.
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

187
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:43,782
As csi, my work
on this case is done.

188
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,352
And as the flash,

189
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:49,555
I don't think
I can focus on snart right now.

190
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,392
- You mind telling me
what brought about this change

191
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,194
Of heart?

192
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,330
- This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom,

193
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,232
Is still out there.

194
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,533
I have to be ready
to face him,

195
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,203
Which means amping up my speed.

196
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,239
It's a question of priorities.
- Your mom's killer

197
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,275
Isn't the only reason
you've been doing this.

198
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,877
You told me that if you
could use your powers

199
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,747
To save someone from a burning
building, you would.

200
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:18,083
- Look, dr. Wells and s.T.A.R.
Labs are gonna work with you.

201
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,752
Cisco thinks he has a way

202
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,620
To protect the police
against snart's cold gun.

203
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,322
- Barry, I can understand
if you're scared.

204
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,492
We talked about this.
- Of course I'm scared, joe.

205
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:28,093
This guy could run
into the precinct

206
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,095
And kill everyone
in here in seconds.

207
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,031
He threatened iris.

208
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,732
I won't let him hurt
the most important people

209
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,067
In my life again.

210
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,536
If that means devoting
every second

211
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,705
I have outside this place
to getting faster

212
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,007
And to stopping him,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

213
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,109
I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

214
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,462
- Aw. Mcsnurtle the turtle.

215
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,830
How you been?

216
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,066
When did you stop
sleeping with this?

217
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,801
It was your favorite.
- He was.

218
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,636
But if I remember correctly,

219
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:14,340
You took him away from me after
I broke your<i> duke ellington:</i>

220
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,241
<i>Live at the blue note</i> vinyl.

221
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,643
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

222
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,681
- You can have him back now.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

223
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,252
Oh, dad.

224
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,489
- I'm going to miss you, baby.

225
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,324
- Dad, I'm only
ten minutes away.

226
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:35,427
- I know.
Don't you worry about me.

227
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,396
I'll be fine, just like always.

228
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,266
- Hey.
- Hey.

229
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,968
- You came to help her pack?

230
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,570
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

231
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,107
Iris said that she had
something for me.

232
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,175
- Oh, um...

233
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,845
I found this in my closet.

234
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,347
[iris and father laughing]

235
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,683
- I haven't seen this in years.

236
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:02,154
- Well, the nerd survival kit
is still intact.

237
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,857
- Wow.

238
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,292
- I thought
those might be worth something.

239
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,967
I am so late for work.

240
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,841
I promise I will clean this
up when I get back, okay?

241
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,377
- Bye.
- Bye, yeah.

242
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,915
- Okay.

243
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,153
You mind telling me what's
going on with you and iris?

244
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,088
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

245
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,857
That's funny, because I have
these two things called eyes,

246
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,027
And it doesn't look like you
two are fine.

247
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,196
- I told iris.

248
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,565
- You told iris
you're the flash?

249
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,867
- No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,369
No.
[laughs]

251
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:56,475
I told her
how I felt about her.

252
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,210
- Oh, god.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,179
- What did she say?

254
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:04,249
- Well, I mean, she's still
moving in with eddie, isn't she?

255
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,553
I just want to pretend
like it never even happened.

256
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,988
I mean, that's what
we're both doing, so...

257
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,725
- Well, not saying how you feel
is what got you in this mess

258
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,794
In the first place.

259
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,696
Speaking of which,

260
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:21,133
We both know she's not gonna
clean this mess up anytime soon.

261
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,868
- Nope.

262
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,206
Sure.

263
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,152
- Uh, excuse me.

264
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,222
If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

265
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,725
- You have our attention,
mr. Ramon.

266
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,794
- Okay, check it.

267
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,562
So dr. Wells and I,

268
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,931
We took your ballistic shields
and...

269
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,437
And we lined them with a pretty
sweet compacted heating ribbon

270
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,873
Designed to repel
temperature attacks,

271
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,475
Especially
those reaching absolute zero,

272
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,511
Like captain cold's gun.

273
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,212
- And that's supposed
to keep us from getting

274
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,047
Turned into popsicles?
- Um, yeah.

275
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,983
Yeah, they will.

276
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,152
- How are we supposed to trust
anything from s.T.A.R. Labs

277
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,187
After you nuked the city?

278
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,626
- You're right.

279
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,462
You're right,
you shouldn't trust us.

280
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:27,432
What happened a year ago...
that was our fault.

281
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:32,337
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

282
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,940
But tomorrow
is a different story.

283
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,643
Tomorrow's a different thing.

284
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:41,146
We just want the chance
to make things better.

285
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,981
Observe.

286
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,905
[chatter]

287
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,747
- Dummies are one thing.

288
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,849
My officers are another.

289
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,724
- You seem pleased
with yourself, doctor.

290
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,727
- Well, I'm just happy to help
the police catch snart, joe.

291
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,662
- Barry might be able
to help too.

292
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,233
- I think cisco's heat shields
are more than up to the task.

293
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,568
And, joe, if barry
feels he's gonna endanger lives

294
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,337
By taking on snart
and, conversely, feels

295
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,038
He's gonna
save lives by training

296
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,909
To take on the man in yellow...

297
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,844
That's ultimately his call.

298
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,081
- You know what makes
barry so special?

299
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,051
He wants to help everyone
he can, however he can.

300
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,786
Always has.

301
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,555
Until now.

302
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,691
- I guess it's just a question
of priorities then.

303
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:04,663
- You know, barry
said the exact same thing to me.

304
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,566
And I thought,
"doesn't sound like him."

305
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,235
I guess because
it sounds like you.

306
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,613
- Hey.
- [gasps]

307
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,649
- Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.

308
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,817
- No, it's okay.
I was just kind of focused.

309
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,586
- Gotcha.

310
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,155
What's firestorm?
- It's one of the last things

311
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,125
Ronnie said to me before he...
Flew away.

312
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,794
My dead fiance can fly.

313
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,796
I haven't broke that
to my parents yet.

314
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,399
You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

315
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,734
No, I just...

316
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,238
I told iris
how I felt about her.

317
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,839
- Bold choice.

318
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,776
- I knew where we stood before.
We were best friends.

319
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,111
And... I don't know.
Now I just don't know

320
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,147
What's normal for us anymore.

321
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,516
- Before I met ronnie,

322
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,153
I knew exactly what was going
to happen every day of my life.

323
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,588
It was predictable.
I like predictable.

324
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,325
But when ronnie
and I started dating,

325
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,860
Everything started to change.

326
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:14,399
He made me try indian food
and scuba diving.

327
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,803
At first it was scary.

328
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:21,139
But then it was better.

329
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,209
Things weren't really normal
with you pining after iris

330
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,812
And her being totally unaware.

331
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:30,182
Whatever happens next,
it will be better.

332
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,756
- Wait, caitlin.

333
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,191
Scuba.

334
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,726
- What about it?

335
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,828
- Self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus,

336
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,696
It's an acronym.

337
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,665
- What if firestorm
isn't a word?

338
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,500
[keys clicking]

339
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,073
Fusion ignition research
experiment and science

340
00:17:55,075 --> 00:18:01,146
Of transmutation originating rna
and molecular structures.

341
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,782
It's 800 pages.

342
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,918
- [clears throat]

343
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,028
There's a lot
of stuff in there,

344
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,064
But it mostly
focuses on transmutation,

345
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,233
Which is the process of altering
the structure of an element

346
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,868
By unzipping the atoms...

347
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,972
- And rebuilding it to create
an entirely new element.

348
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:29,107
- Well, the article
was co-written by jason rush,

349
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,309
Who's a grad student
here at hudson university.

350
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,311
So if anybody knows
what happened to ronnie...

351
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,780
- Maybe he does.

352

00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:02,973
- Dad, is it okay if I...

706
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,141
- Yeah.

707
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,919
My baby girl.

708
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,863
- See you.

709
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,371
Pffft.
Well...

710
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,546
- You okay?

711
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,515
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,183
How about you?

713
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:48,919
- It was bound
to happen sometime, right?

714
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:50,487
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,923
- Want to order some pizza
and watch the ball game?

716
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,325
- Make it pizzas and you're on.

717
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,227
- [laughing]

718
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,662
- You know, if you ever
need somebody

719
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,330
To come and eat your food,
I'm there.

720
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,999
Besides, the laundry machines
in my building

721
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,901
Have been broken for,
like, a month, so...

722
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:05,569
- I don't know why you

723
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,404
Moved into that deathtrap
in the first place,

724
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,740
Since you still got
a perfectly good room here.

725
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,375
- You said you were turning it
into a gym.

726
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:14,845
- We both know I'm not
turning it into a gym.

727
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,480
- Yeah.
- Besides,

728
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:20,384
You got me running around enough
as it is.

729
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:22,653
- You know, it is getting hard
to hide the blasting

730
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:25,556
In and out of my apartment
at all hours of the night

731
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:27,758
From my neighbors.

732
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,096
I suppose it would make sense
for me to move back in.

733
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,099
I mean, I am a millennial.
That is what we do.

734
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,000
- [laughing]

735
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,135
Well, don't do it
on my account.

736
00:40:38,137 --> 00:40:39,737
I'll be fine on my own.

737
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,205
- Oh, yeah, me too.

738
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:44,475
Sure.

739
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,481
All right, roomie.
You order the pizzas.

740
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:51,815
I'll unpack.

741
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,318
- No way.

742
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,686
I want to help you.

743
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,822
I want to enjoy this.

744
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,958
- All right.

745
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,630
You know this does nothing
to me.

746
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,332
- Just drink it.
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,974
- I should've burned
the entire city block down.

748
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,877
But instead, I listened to you.

749
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,578
We had the painting.
We had the guns.

750
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,314
We could've had everything.

751
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,050
But you had your stupid plan.

752
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,220
How is that stupid plan
working out for us now?

753
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:33,390
- Everyone's seen the flash now.

754
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:37,060
This changes things, again.

755
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:39,296
[boom]

756
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:41,298
[tires screeching]

757
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,600
- What the...

758
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,135
Snart!

759
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,137
- Relax, mick.

760
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,374
- What's going on?

761
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:51,742
- The plan.

762
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:53,610
[clatter]

763
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,979
[door hinges squeak]

764
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,315
Hey, sis.

765
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,652
- Nice.
