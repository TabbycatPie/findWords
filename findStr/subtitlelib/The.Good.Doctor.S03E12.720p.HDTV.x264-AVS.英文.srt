18
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,500
Those are yours.

19
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,390
We bought them together.

20
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,430
Because you "Found the pattern soothing."

21
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,490
I'm gonna miss you, Shaun.

22
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,870
I love Carly.

23
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,260
And that's great.

24
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,470
I am so happy for you.

25
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,310
Now you can hang the toilet paper incorrectly

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,700
anytime you want.

27
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,220
And Carly and I can go back

28
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,450
to the way things were before our fight.

29
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,210
Well, sometimes couples need a little time to recover.

30
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,980
We won't.

31
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,610
Carly asked for you to move out.

32
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,680
You are moving out.

33
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,510
How many kidneys do I need in my body to attend prom?

34
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,370
Ryan...

35
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,190
Even if the surgery removes my kidney,

36
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,620
it'll be laparoscopic,

37
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,620
so my inpatient time will be seven days, tops.

38
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,380
And then three more days of rest at home.

39
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,890
I can take my girlfriend to prom, right?

40
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,750
That's not a purely medical decision.

41
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,920
I have to draw some blood.

42
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,000
What are the chances Dr. Melendez might be able

43
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,160
to remove the tumor but spare Ryan's kidney?

44
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, the MRI will let us know

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,570
how much the chemo shrunk the tumor,

46
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,240
but you shouldn't count on it.

47
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,300
One chili burger, extra mustard, extra pickles.

48
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,020
Hi. Morning, Mr. Cooper.

49
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,720
I'm not sure he can have that with his surgery...

50
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,990
Oh, he's fine until about 6:30 tonight.

51
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,710
I know you.

52
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,610
Angie...Valens.

53
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,300
I helped put in your chemo port.

54
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,270
I owe you a big thank-you.

55
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,740
We met in chemo.

56
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,020
They should put us in a

57
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,490
public service announcement or something.

58
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,280
Yeah... "I lost a tumor and gained a boyfriend.

59
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,300
Thanks, chemo."

60
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,760
James McDougall?

61
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,260
That's who we're here for, too.

62
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,820
All of you can head over to Bay 4.

63
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,940
Guy saw me six months ago for a stress fracture.

64
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,880
He's a lunatic ultra-marathoner.

65
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,790
I just hope he didn't go too hard too soon

66
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,910
and break it again.

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,420
He didn't break it again.

70
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,650
Your GP was right to start you on ketoprofen for the swelling,

71
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,250
but clearly, it isn't working.

72
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,700
That's why Drs. Murphy and Reznick

73
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,970
are going to block off some of your lymphatic channels.

74
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,350
It should reduce production.

75
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,070
The more pressing concern is why.

76
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,650
Have you ever had surgery on your lymph nodes?

77
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,700
What about cancer or radiation treatment?

78
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,220
No. Physically, I've always been healthy.

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,340
Physically?

80
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,000
I was diagnosed with

81
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,630
Persistent Depressive Disorder when I was 16.

82
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,410
That's why you got to get me back out on the road, Doc.

83
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,770
Are antidepressants not effective for you?

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,250
I mean, they help.

85
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,740
But running really is key.

86
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,850
Saved my marriage and... my life.

87
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,950
Lymphedema can be caused by an infection.

88
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,250
He doesn't have a fever.

89
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,380
Ketoprofen can suppress fevers.

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,250
Let's get some cultures

91
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,250
and start him on broad-spec antibiotics.

92
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,400
As requested, your restock on enemas.

93
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,550
Nice cover.

94
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,220
How've you been feeling?

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,210
The methotrexate is working great.

96
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,320
No pain, no redness.

97
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,610
Stiffness, flu-like symptoms?

98
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,960
No. All good.

99
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,400
How long are you planning to hide out doing RA exams

100
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,170
and clipping diabetics' toenails?

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,490
Dizziness, headaches, nausea?

102
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,480
I... Sometimes I'm a little queasy after I eat.

103
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,630
You had to love neurosurgery.

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,510
How about we try to get you a medication

105
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,060
that doesn't irritate your stomach?

106
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,480
No. My hands feel great. That's all I care about.

107
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,020
You used to open up skulls

108
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,070
and poke around people's brains.

109
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,430
There's no way this fulfills you.

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I enjoy it.

111
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Or, rather, I usually enjoy it.

112
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,050
I'll let you get back to it.

113
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,480
Maybe someone out there needs an enema.

114
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,260
Got a measurement on the Wilms tumor?

115
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,900
Mm, not quite there yet.

116
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,340
You mentioned 7 centimeters as our limit

117
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,790
to doing this laparoscopically.

118
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,940
What if we pushed it to 7.2?

119
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,870
Would speed up recovery.

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,630
By a few days.

121
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,810
Forget I brought it up.

122
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,340
Ryan wanting to take his girlfriend to prom

123
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,010
should not factor into our surgical plan.

124
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,030
Is he nuts about her?

125
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,080
Ohh. Crazy, head over heels in love.

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,120
They both are.

127
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,460
Idiots.

128
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,760
I wouldn't mind being an idiot like that again.

129
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,150
Though, I'm not sure I ever felt that way,

130
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,440
totally happy.

131
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,160
So therapy's going well?

132
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,700
No metastasis in the lungs.

133
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,200
Look at that.

134
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,760
Your tumor is gone.

135
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,050
Gone?

136
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,930
How's that possible?

137
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,730
The chemotherapy worked better than we expected.

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,640
Wait, like, no tumor? Zero?

139
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,130
No need for surgery whatsoever?

140
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,050
That is right.

141
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,870
These are discharge forms.

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,790
Both of my kidneys are taking you to prom!

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,510
Aah! Hell, yeah!

144
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,250
Angie?

145
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,800
- Angie! - She's having a seizure!

146
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,540
2 milligrams of lorazepam and portable oxygen, stat.

147
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,770
Let's get that under her head.

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,230
His lungs are filled with fluid.

149
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,480
I need a chest X-ray and a bedside ultrasound.

150
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,050
And page Dr. Reznick.

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,110
Imaging has confirmed the reoccurrence

152
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,020
of your brain tumor.

153
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,400
What stage?

154
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,540
Three.

155
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,970
The best approach is surgery,

156
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,520
a wide resection of the tumor,

157
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,070
followed by radiation and chemo

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,560
to encourage full remission.

159
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,490
Sounds like a fun couple months.

160
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,100
Full recovery will probably take closer to eight.

161
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,160
We can get through this, baby, just like last time.

162
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,460
W-when will the surgery be?

163
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,860
We need to do some additional imaging,

164
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,560
and I'd like to consult a colleague

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,050
about the best surgical approach.

166
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,100
That'll take a few days.

167
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,130
Take your time.

168
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,090
Prom?

169
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,200
Yeah.

170
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,460
Now that Ryan can go, I have to go.

171
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,380
Honey.

172
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,600
This is your health we're talking about.

173
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,610
Mom, please.

174
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,230
I just want to do this one thing like a normal kid.

175
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,170
Can you tell her it's okay?

176
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,240
We can't.

177
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,140
Until we remove your tumor,

178
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,570
you're at risk of potentially fatal seizures.

179
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,320
After you're recovered,

180
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,000
you and Ryan can get all dressed up,

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,370
and we'll go have dinner at the Grandview. Okay?

182
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,270
Prom sucks.

183
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,630
My buddy had a fake ID.

184
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,490
I got so drunk in the limo that I passed out

185
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,160
and never made it into the dance.

186
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,260
Maybe that wasn't everybody's experience.

187
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,750
I was prom king. My date was queen.

188
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,780
I had the dress, I had the date,

189
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,640
I had the mom who got arrested.

190
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,910
Spent the night picking her up from the drunk tank.

191
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,100
Did you see Park while you were there?

192
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,910
Go to scheduling, get Angie's surgery set for Friday

193
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,960
with the best neurosurgery OR nurses.

194
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,280
Let's go see Glassman.

195
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,590
Now I'm identifying

196
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,470
the submillimeter lymphatic vessels.

197
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,150
I need an 11-0 micro suture and a 70 micron needle.

198
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,090
Instead of harvesting nodes to this area,

199
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,190
could we redirect lymphatics away from his lymph system?

200
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,230
We could.

201
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,540
If you identify an appropriate vessel,

202
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,870
you can make the connection.

203
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,540
We're clearly not dealing with an infection.

204
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,060
There must be a blockage somewhere in his lymph system.

205
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,250
Most likely cancer.

206
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,140
His CBC didn't show any abnormal cells.

207
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,950
Lymphoma doesn't always show up.

208
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,880
We need to run cytology on his lymphatic fluid.

209
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,900
It's either gonna be nasty or very nasty,

210
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,280
depending upon how it attaches

211
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,230
to the thalamus and fornix.

212
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,460
Which no imaging or testing can possibly determine.

213
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,210
So, our options are?

214
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,660
Between an endoscopic approach or an open anterior one.

215
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,150
That is correct.

216
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,100
I'd run a stereotactic MRI with fiducials and DTI

217
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,900
to gauge how close the white matter tracts actually are.

218
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
You should scrub in.

219
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,730
Another doctor can cover the clinic.

220
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,190
I haven't been in an OR in over a year,

221
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,770
and then, as a patient.

222
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,970
I'm not asking you to cut.

223
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,280
But it'd be a huge value to have you there.

224
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,060
I appreciate that.

225
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,650
I'll consider it.

226
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,460
Hello. We need to run cytology on this lymphatic fluid.

227
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,900
I would be happy to.

228
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,730
Lea moved out this morning.

229
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,660
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

230
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,810
Can you come over tonight?

231
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,520
Uh, that probably won't work...

232
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,150
Or we could go to your apartment?

233
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,710
I can't.

234
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,280
Lea said that it might take time

235
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,430
for us to recover from our fight.

236
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,330
But I told her that we were okay.

237
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,480
We are.

238
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,070
I made plans tonight.

239
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,730
To hang out with a friend who just got fired.

240
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,060
But I would love to come over tomorrow night.

241
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,540
Okay.

242
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,420
I'll put a rush on this test, too.

243
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,180
Your lymphovenous anastomosis technique...

244
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,070
I was impressed.

245
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,480
It's a little early in the morning

246
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,920
to be sucking up, Reznick.

247
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,820
Not for me. I like to get a jump on things.

248
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,350
I'm fascinated by the way you use plastic procedures,

249
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,140
like microsurgery, in other surgical specialties.

250
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,480
I thought it might make an interesting topic for a paper.

251
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,590
Want to write it with me?

252
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,970
Yes.

253
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,080
Let's talk and eat.

254
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,920
That's not breakfast.

255
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm buying.

256
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,750
What publications do you want to target?

257
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,920
Last time, Angie had bad post-op vomiting.

258
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,420
- Of course. I'll make note of it... - Excuse me.

259
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,090
She's asleep. She needs her rest.

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,800
I'll wait out here until she's awake.

261
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,750
Ryan, your immune system is weak.

262
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,690
It would be so easy for

263
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,760
you to pick up a bug and pass it to Angie.

264
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,040
I haven't been around anyone but my dad. I swear.

265
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,320
He could wear a mask.

266
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,660
After Angie's surgery, we'll see about arranging a visit.

267
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,220
Please tell her Ryan came by.

268
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,890
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

269
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,040
I'd like to change Angie's status

270
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,680
to "No visitors" on her chart.

271
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,690
Yeah.

272
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,760
Please take Mr. McDougall to his room.

273
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,860
I'll be there in a moment.

274
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,870
Is that James McDougall?

275
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,550
- And the woman with him? - His wife.

276
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,930
Is it cancer? 

277
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,260
No... Worse.

278
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,720
His lymphedema is caused by a genetic mutation.

279
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,800
If you don't find a medication he responds to,

280
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
he'll drown from the inside.

281
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,540
The mutation is on James' ARAF gene.

282
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,270
It makes an enzyme called kinase,

283
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,650
which can cause cells to overproliferate.

284
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,090
It's a genetic condition.

285
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,370
What set it off now?

286
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,760
Probably the stress fracture.

287
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Sent his immune system into overdrive,

288
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
which fired up his lymphatic system.

289
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,850
What treatment protocol targets this mutation?

290
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,640
An MEK inhibitor.

291
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,950
The problem is, which one?

292
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,430
There are 41 possibilities,

293
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,300
each with different side effects.

294
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,290
Good luck.

295
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,940
Well, I was hoping you could stay.

296
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,670
Okay. Sure.

297
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,980
We need you to stay completely still.

298
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,720
Not a problem.

299
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,700
You okay?

300
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,480
Ryan totally bailed.

301
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,150
He hasn't come back to see me.

302
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,560
If you tell her that her mom said he couldn't visit,

303
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,890
she'll be pissed at her mom.

304
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,080
How's that gonna help?

305
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,550
He's probably busy catching up in school.

306
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,970
We had a pact.

307
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,230
As long as we were together, cancer wasn't gonna beat us.

308
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,560
He broke it.

309
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,560
Cancer wins.

310
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,210
Do you mind finishing?

311
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,560
Imaging finished?

312
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,640
Not quite.

313
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,800
Mrs. Valens, Angie would really like to see Ryan.

314
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,610
I know you're concerned about infection,

315
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,020
but there is minimal risk.

316
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,050
Actually... actually, none, if they do a video chat.

317
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,170
Interesting idea.

318
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,800
I'll think about it.

319
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,120
Angie's depressed.

320
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,660
And studies have shown that

321
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,660
that can have a negative impact

322
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,410
on her surgical outcome.

323
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,080
Ryan doesn't always improve Angie's mood.

324
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,590
A couple of weeks ago, they had some silly fight,

325
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,990
and she cried for days.

326
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
Thank you for letting me know.

327
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm gonna do my best to cheer her up.

328
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,030
She's a 16-year-old.

329
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,550
She wants her boyfriend.

330
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,960
Yeah.

331
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,060
And how smart were you when you were 16?

332
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,740
Well, what about Selumetinib?

333
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,290
It's shown promising results on related conditions.

334
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,660
And a high occurrence of liver disease.

335
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,800
Binimetinib is similar, but has fewer complications.

336
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,110
Any objections?

337
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,160
Let's start James on that.

338
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,760
This is exciting, working together.

339
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,690
It is.

340
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,690
Although, I'm used to

341
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,950
samples and slides instead of patients.

342
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,560
Patients can be difficult.

343
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,950
But you will be fine.

344
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,580
Do you need something?

345
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,430
I was curious how James was responding

346
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,890
to the Binimetinib.

347
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,440
His urine output is up,

348
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,640
which suggests the lymphatic fluid...

349
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,480
and his potassium is a little low.

350
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,200
Can you...give him this?

351
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
I wasn't really...

352
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,550
Hi. I'm Dr. Lever.

353
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,430
The tumor's abutting and possibly infiltrating

354
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,350
the white matter tracts of her fornix.

355
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,100
We'll likely have to remove a section.

356
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,360
That'll affect her ability to form memories.

357
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,080
With a lot of neuropsych rehab,

358
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,310
she may be able to compensate with other pathways.

359
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,610
Studies have shown that

360
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,040
positive attitudes lead to positive outcomes.

361
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,460
You're worried about her attitude?

362
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,720
She's worried about young love.

363
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,930
I'm worried about what Angie is facing after surgery.

364
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,520
Physical therapy, cognitive therapy,

365
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,840
one challenge after another.

366
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,690
And what she wants is so simple.

367
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,640
You want to make a sad kid happy?

368
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,350
I guess I do.

369
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,890
Which isn't my job, and I need to stop

370
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,530
getting sucked into people's personal issues.

371
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,480
Is there a way to do that without

372
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,090
antagonizing the mother?

373
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,840
Maybe.

374
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,580
Then make her happy.

375
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,920
We've never gotten this far before.

376
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,410
No.

377
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,900
We haven't.

378
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,440
And you're okay?

379
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,500
I am very okay.

380
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,360
Carly.

381
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,290
Okay.

382
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,950
Did...I do something wrong?

383
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,950
No, I'm sorry. It's me.

384
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,510
You said we were okay.

385
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,150
I thought we were.

386
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,410
I-I want us to be.

387
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,380
You have no reason to still be mad.

388
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,660
I'm not mad.

389
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm... I'm just...

390
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,360
It's Morgan.

391
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,600
The medication caused James an upper GI bleed.

392
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,080
Have you localized the source of the bleeding?

393
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Working on it.

394
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,300
Seems to be coming from the antrum of the stomach.

395
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,260
We stopped the Binimetinib.

396
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,190
On top of causing this,

397
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,980
it hadn't done much to curtail the swelling.

398
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,790
Where's Dr. Lever?

399
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,010
There's the ulcerative lesion. Cautery.

400
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
Zebrafish.

401
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,640
They're used in medical research

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,040
because of their quick maturation,

403
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,790
and 84% of genes associated with human disease

404
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,360
have a zebrafish equivalent.

405
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,250
You think we should do a transgenic expression

406
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,260
of James' ARAF mutation into the zebrafish genome.

407
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,240
Translation for those of us without a genetics textbook handy?

408
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,190
We make mini-Jameses, as zebrafish, all with the same disorder.

409
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,850
Then we test every conceivable drug on those fish.

410
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,060
How long before we can start testing?

411
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,660
If we implant the embryos now,

412
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,600
probably by late afternoon tomorrow.

413
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,540
Get going.

414
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,520
Shaun, go with her. You have Path experience.

415
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,160
I understand no means no.

416
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,690
If you don't want to have sex,

417
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,390
I accept that.

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,120
But I am very confused.

419
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,890
So am I.

420
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,670
I thought I was fine u-until I...

421
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,770
I told Lea to move out, like you wanted.

422
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,630
You said that things were okay.

423
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,880
They aren't. How do I make them okay?

424
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,810
I can't tell you, because I don't know.

425
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,040
When I was in chemo,

426
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,550
the nurses used to force that stuff down my throat,

427
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,620
so I know you're not drinking it because of the taste.

428
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,830
It's fast, easy nutrition.

429
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,040
That and you don't end up puking your guts out in the bathroom.

430
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,890
I was president of this hospital for over 10 years.

431
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,060
I made a few friends, including Jack the janitor...

432
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,630
Talks a lot, A's fan, horrible gossip.

433
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,280
If the methotrexate is making you sick,

434
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,140
we should try another medication.

435
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,450
How can you guarantee that you're not gonna throw up

436
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,310
in the middle of your next surgery?

437
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,310
It won't happen.

438
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,480
Because it only happens if I eat solid food.

439
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,900
And I stopped.

440
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,360
At least at work.

441
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,810
That is a lot of fish tanks.

442
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,710
Forty. So we can test all of the possible medications for...

443
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,670
Are you throwing a party?

444
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,630
Hope so.

445
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,940
How are you doing, Shaun?

446
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,860
Since your father passed away?

447
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,240
I don't think about him very much.

448
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,560
My mom...died recently.

449
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,580
I-I don't know if you knew that.

450
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,670
She pops into my head all the time.

451
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,630
Not always the nicest thoughts.

452
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,230
It's okay not to love them.

453
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,810
They didn't make us who we are.

454
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,730
Has your mom gone home?

455
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,900
There is one more thing we have to deal with tonight.

456
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,150
Come on.

457
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,860
How many more sets of imaging can you possibly do?

458
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,290
One of these is your prom dress.

459
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,460
I like the pink, but I think you'd look gorgeous in both.

460
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,640
Hurry up and choose.

461
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,210
Your date'll be here soon.

462
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,560
All the medications are in.

463
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,230
Which means more waiting to see which medicine works.

464
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,780
It's hard to be patient.

465
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,240
Do you think the fish control how they react to the meds?

466
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,830
No.

467
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,500
It's just how their bodies respond.

468
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,960
That's how I felt last night.

469
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,110
I thought I was ready for us to be together,

470
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,220
but my body had a different response.

471
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,300
I can't turn that response off any more than these fish

472
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,600
can control how their mutation reacts to the medication.

473
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,650
Was our mutation

474
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,030
me going to Wyoming with Lea?

475
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,090
Do you think we can find our right medication?

Cross SL-327 off the list.

532
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,160
I see one...

533
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,830
No, two tumors.

534
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,430
Okay.

535
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,060
This is my stop.

536
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,900
I'll see you after.

537
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,520
I love you.

538
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,440
I love you, too, Mom.

539
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,950
Don't worry. Okay?

540
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,450
I got this.

541
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,410
I know you do.

542
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,750
Okay.

543
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,430
What if I wake up and don't remember Ryan at all?

544
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,390
Then...

545
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,400
you'll have the chance to fall in love with him all over again.

546
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,610
Okay.

547
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,100
We're down to five potential options.

548
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,270
I don't need five potential. I need one actual.

549
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,230
There are two that best curb...

550
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,090
Choose one.

551
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,110
We should try Refametinib.

552
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,950
It caused abnormal cell growth.

553
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,430
Trametinib is safer.

554
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,740
Which doesn't mean it's safe.

555
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,770
Nothing's safe.

556
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,150
Which do you want us to do?

557
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,290
Trametinib.

558
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,360
That's the one.

559
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,490
Saline in.

560
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,300
Advancing scope toward the third ventricle.

561
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,310
Claire, hold gentle pressure on the tumor

562
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,170
while I cut off its blood supply.

563
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,690
We've got some significant bleeding.

564
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,260
Adjust the scope and suction.

565
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,270
Look higher.

566
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,240
Septal vein... There's your bleeder.

567
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,480
Cauterize away.

568
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,860
Micro dissector.

569
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,450
The tumor's immobile.

570
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,090
I can't resect it without injuring the nerve tracts.

571
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,490
She'd be comatose.

572
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,460
Try sharp dissection.

573
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,430
- I can't get a plane. -How bad?

574
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,460
It's completely invaded her thalamus.

575
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,210
Thin it out with a suction aspirator.

576
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,260
It's too adherent.

577
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,350
If I keep going, I'm gonna kill her.

578
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,640
Any ideas?

579
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,380
Tell ICU Angie will be coming sooner than we planned.

580
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,090
Let's close her up.

581
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,070
What next?

582
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,730
Another round of radiation, chemo?

583
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,340
Her carcinoma is

584
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,450
unlikely to respond to those therapies.

585
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,290
No. We have to try.

586
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,710
Angie will want to fight.

587
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,640
She's seizing.

588
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,150
Give me lorazepam and Dilantin, stat.

589
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,760
Phenobarb and propofol on deck.

590
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,320
You're crying.

591
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,030
Yes.

592
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,830
Why?

593
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,840
I found James on Facebook.

594
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,380
He and Marjorie want to go to Costa Rica.

595
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,680
Their dog is a three-legged rescue named Tripod.

596
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,730
He's not a slide. He's a person.

597
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,440
He's a good person.

598
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,810
And he might die.

599
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,240
This is why I like to stay in the lab.

600
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,580
That...

601
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,290
Is a very dumb thing to say.

602
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,130
If you had stayed in the lab,

603
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,960
James would probably be dead already.

604
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,720
Your plan with the zebrafish gave him a chance.

605
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,730
It was a beautiful, perfect idea,

606
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,770
from a beautiful, almost perfect person.

607
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,150
Your earlobes are lopsided.

608
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,190
I'm so sorry.

609
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,690
We couldn't save her.

610
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,630
Ms. Valens?

611
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,420
Nice call on the zebrafish.

612
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,290
About our paper, let's meet weekly.

613
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,040
I'm thinking lunch every Tuesday in the cafeteria.

614
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,940
Perfect.

615
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,290
I heard about Melendez's patient.

616
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,330
Yeah.

617
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,050
You were right.

618
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,560
I should probably try another medication for my RA.

619
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,690
I need solid food.

620
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,280
Claire? Wait up.

621
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,620
You okay?

622
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,080
Fine. I'm just tired.

623
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,430
You did an amazing thing for Angie.

624
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,880
You gave her mother a memory that she will have forever.

625
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,630
Well, it won't make up for the daughter she lost.

626
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,220
You're angry.

627
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,730
I'm not. I am sad.

628
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,690
- Who are you angry at? - I'm not.

629
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,950
Are you angry at me and Glassman

630
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,950
because we couldn't save her?

631
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,660
- No! - At Angie?

632
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,140
No, you can't be mad at someone for dying!

633
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,310
That's not true. You know that.

634
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,360
She was sick.

635
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,320
And she was trying to get better.

636
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,610
She failed and left you alone,

637
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,530
after you'd spent a lifetime trying to take care of her.

638
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,830
You have every reason to be mad at your mother.

639
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,830
I hate feeling this way.

640
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,020
My whole life, I've been angry at her,

641
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,920
and now it will never change.

642
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,800
I don't know how to stop.

643
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,220
Therapy will help.

644
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,340
Time will help.

645
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,140
There is one other thing that's worked for me.

646
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,820
Did we fix our mutation?

647
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,590
That the best you got?
