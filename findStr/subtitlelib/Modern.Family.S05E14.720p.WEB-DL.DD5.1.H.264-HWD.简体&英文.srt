1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,530
好了  伙计们
Okay, gang.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,130
今晚  录影带告别仪式继续
Tonight, the Farewell to VHS Festival continues.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,620
大寒潮[《山水又相逢》]以来  这里变得很冷
It's been mighty cold in here since "The Big Chill."

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,560
能够温暖我们内心的就是
What say we warm our hearts by...

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,500
圣艾尔摩之火[电影《七个毕业生》]
"St. Elmo's Fire"?

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,980
没错
Yes!

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,620
一边喝清爽酒  一边看80年代帅哥
Couple of wine coolers and some '80s Rob Lowe--

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,700
我应该会喜欢
I can get into that.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,050
我还是希望今晚有我自己的计划
I'm still holding out hope I'll have plans tonight.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,580
太好了  两个都赞同  海莉呢
Great. Two for two. Haley?

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,840
听起来很有意思  但我没空参加
Oh, so fun, but I'm gonna have to say no.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,320
我有个摄影课的事情
I have a photography-class thing.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,250
什么事情
What kind of a thing?

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,420
就是展览嘛
Oh, you know, just an exhibit,

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,930
展示我们的照片什么的
like, to show our photos.

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,180
需要我们参加吗
Is it something that we should go to?

17
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,560
克莱尔  我们有计划了
Claire, we just made plans.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,200
老妈  这是大学的课程
Mom, this is a college class.

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,720
我不是三年级小学生了
I'm not in the third grade.

20
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,860
你们不是还有午休时间么
Don't you have nap time there?

21
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,700
没有  我只有空课时间
No. I have free periods,

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,890
那时候我才偶尔午休一下
during which I sometimes nap.

23
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,910
是我想多了 还是她刚刚故意说得很含糊
Is it me, or was she just being purposefully vague?

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,450
艾丽克斯  你去看看她的东西
Alex, I want you to go through her stuff

25
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,490
查出她今晚到底是干嘛
and find out about this thing tonight.

26
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,170
等等
Wait, wait.

27
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,320
我觉得我们这样窥探不太好
I-I don't feel good about us snooping.

28
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,530
我知道  所以我才让艾丽克斯去做
I know. That's why I told Alex to do it.

29
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,240
我觉得海莉知道的比看上去的多
I think Haley knows more than she's letting on.

30
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,430
你这样想真是伤透了我的心
It breaks my heart how badly you want to believe that.

31
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,800
我们过会儿见
We'll see you guys later.

32
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,580
你们要去哪里
Where are you going?

33
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,980
骑自行车去赞德家
Riding our bikes to Xander's.

34
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,950
你们去那里干什么
What are you doing there?

35
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,390
不知道啊  就一起玩玩
I don't know. Hanging out.

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,990
听起来很有意思  戴上头盔哦
Sounds fun. Wear your helmets.

37
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,630
会的
We will.

38
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,240
我可不想插着呼吸机写我的第一本小说
I'm not writing my first novel by blowing through a tube.

39
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,510
我不喜欢他们去那孩子家
I don't like them going over to that kid's house.

40
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,170
为什么
Why not?

41
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,250
赞德会带坏他们的
Mm, Xander's a bad influence.

42
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,680
他哥哥简直更糟糕
His older brother is even worse.

43
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,290
满身肌肉的大块头  很爱抽大麻
Huge stoner always walking around

44
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,720
总穿着他的军装瞎晃悠
in his army jacket with his muscles,

45
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,100
还老喜欢拨弄头发  露出蓝眼睛
flipping his hair out of his blue eyes.

46
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,310
他有一次还说我漂亮
He told me I was looking good one time.

47
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,600
拜托省省吧
I mean, come on.

48
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,710
好吧  我们会留意的
Yeah, we'll keep our eye on that.

49
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,330
但现在问题是赞德  我不信任他
But for now...Xander. I don't trust him.

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,010
克莱尔  你真是难以捉摸
Claire, you're a tough one to figure out.

51
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,670
你不信任坏男孩  却嫁给了我
You don't trust bad boys, and yet you married one.

52

第五季 第十四集

63
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,870
我的帅小子饿坏了
My handsome boy's so hungry.

64
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,020
好了  我很快回来
All right. Be back in a few.

65
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,370
如果小短打电话来  告诉他我死了
If Shorty calls, tell him I died,

66
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,140
但要保证让他信服
but make sure you really sell it.

67
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,230
我们在玩一个很有趣的游戏
It's a funny thing we're doing.

68
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,200
那怎么会好玩
How is that funny?

69
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
我就知道你会这样说
I knew you'd say that.

70
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,870
总之别接电话  再见  伙计
Just don't answer the phone. Bye, buddy.

71
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,730
这是怎么回事
What's all that about?

72
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,050
你生我气了还是怎么了
You mad at me or something?

73
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,000
我不知道
I don't know.

74
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,640
你有做什么让我生气的事吗
Did you do something to make me mad?

75
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,610
那样的话  我就是在生气
Because then I am.

76
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,310
如果没有  我就没生气
But if you didn't, then I am not.

77
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,290
我什么也没干啊
I didn't do anything.

78
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,600
那我就没生气
Then I am not mad.

79
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
我生气了
I am mad.

80
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,640
昨晚  杰做了个有关别的女人的春梦
Last night, Jay had a sexy dream about some woman.

81
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,230
宝贝
Baby.

82
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,330
宝贝
Oh, baby.

83
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,070
宝贝
Oh, baby!

84
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,300
我知道那不是我
And I know it wasn't about me,

85
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,760
因为他知道我讨厌男人叫我宝贝
Because he knows that I hate when men call me baby.

86
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,660
没错  人们允许有自己的私密想法
And, yes, people are allowed their private thoughts,

87
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,670
我也不应该这么生气
and I shouldn't be so angry,

88
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,150
但我是拉丁人  所以姐想生气就生气
But I am latin, so I get to feel whatever I want.

89
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,790
你想跟我说我干了什么吗
You want to tell me what I did?

90
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,320
你想跟我说你干了什么吗
Do you want to tell me what you did?

91
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,250
我不知道我干了什么啊
I don't know what I did.

92
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,800
那我就不知道你干了什么
Then I don't know what you did.

93
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,540
我受够了  我要走了
I'm bored. I'm going.

94
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,940
别忘了你的手机
Don't forget your phone.

95
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,410
我手臂上有片淤青
I got a bruise on my arm.

96
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,390
不知道从哪儿来的
I don't know where it came from.

97
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,380
可怜的宝贝
Oh, poor baby.

98
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,930
于是我意识到
And then I realized

99
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,490
我不想为查理工作了
I don't want to work for Charlie anymore.

100
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,270
我真正想要的是
What I really want --

101
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,050
抱歉  我听不下去了
I'm sorry. I can't listen to this.

102
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,220
我要跟你说件事
I need to tell you something,

103
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,790
但你得保密
but you have to keep it a secret.

104
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,850
当然  我是律师
Of course. I'm a lawyer.

105
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,310
我还听过谋杀供述呢
I've heard murder confessions.

106
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,540
-真的吗  -好吧  在
- Really?   - Well, in --

107
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,570
在法学院的模拟法庭上
in mock trials at law school.

108
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,110
不过我还是守口如瓶
But still, I never told anyone.

109
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,840
说真的  只跟你说
Seriously, this is only for you.

110
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,360
连小卡都不能说  你能保证吗
You can't even tell Cam. Promise?

111
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,850
好
Uh, okay.

112
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,200
你还好吗
Is everything all right?

113
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,350
看桌子下面
Look under the table.

114
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,810
脚踝以上  膝盖以下  你看到什么了
Above the ankle, below the knee, what do you see?

115
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
我对此有点紧张  但是
I'm a little nervous about this, but --

116
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,170
天啊  你没有吧
Oh, oh, my gosh! You didn't?

117
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,700
我做了  小腿肌肉植入
I did. Calf implants.

118
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,340
你还真是没少往里面植入啊
Wow, and you really went for it, didn't you?

119
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,800
不不不  它们还肿着呢
No, no, no. They're still swollen.

120
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,380
所以你才穿着运动裤
And that's why you're wearing sweat pants.

121
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
好吧  我...
Okay, I was --

122
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,080
我还怕你就这样放弃
I was afraid you'd just given up.

123
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,050
真是松了口气
So, whew!

124
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,010
它们会恢复的
They'll settle.

125
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,940
我打算随意地提到我的新健身计划
I'm gonna start casually referencing my new workout plan,

126
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,280
然后在阵亡将士纪念日那天
and then I'm gonna debut them

127
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,090
我会在拉古纳海滩展示出来
memorial day at Laguna beach.

128
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,660
我个人认为你不需要这样
I personally don't think that you needed them,

129
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,010
但如果那能让你开心
but if they make you happy --

130
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,960
-会的  -那就好
- They do. - Good.

131
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,550
我总是想成为
I always wanted to be

132
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,000
穿着紧身裤跑步的男人
one of those guys running in tights,

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,610
但我的小腿腿型还不够完美
but I was too embarrassed about my legs.

134
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,650
如果你去跑步...
Well, if you'd just gone running --

135
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,290
你多虑了  米奇尔
Yep. You're overthinking this, Mitchell.

136
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,500
不开玩笑  你不能告诉小卡
No joke, you can't tell Cam.

137
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,760
我爱他  但他是个超级大嘴巴
I love him, but he is a giant blabbermouth.

138
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,770
拜托  他没那么坏啦
Oh, come on. He's not that bad.

139
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,730
他只是  算了  我自己都不信
He just -- yeah, no, I can't even sell that.

140
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,380
杰  哪阵风把你吹来寒舍了
Jay, to what do I owe the pleasure?

141
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,530
我只是来接曼尼的
I'm just here to pick up Manny.

142
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,190
没必要搞这么隆重
No need for a whole thing.

143
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,810
我不知道我为什么要那样对他
I don't know why I do that to him.

144
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,640
他见到我总是很高兴
The guy's always so happy to see me.

145
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,190
我懒得管了
I'm not gonna worry about it.

146
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,560
曼尼不在
Manny's not here.

147
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,910
他和卢克去了赞德家
He actually went with Luke over to Xander's.

148
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,800
曼尼也没告诉你他要去那里吗
Whoa! Manny didn't tell you he was going either?

149
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,570
我告诉过你  那些男孩子在隐瞒什么
I told you, those boys are being cagey.

150
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,340
有可能是
There is a chance

151
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,390
歌洛莉亚让我白跑一趟来惩罚我
Gloria let me drive over here for nothing as punishment.

152
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,060
我觉得她偷看了我的手机
I think she snooped on my phone,

153
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,350
读了几封邮件
read some of my e-mails.

154
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,230
这样可不好  邮件是个人隐私
That's not cool. E-mails are private.

155
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,280
是找我借钱的朋友发来的
They were from a friend I loaned money to.

156
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,370
-绝对是你的特权  -一个女人
- 100% your prerogative. - A woman.

157
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,500
不是吧
Oh, no.

158
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,930
我来告诉你我会怎么做
Well, I'll tell you what I'd do.

159
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
我会告诉我女人
I'd tell my lady,

160
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,940
你没权力干涉我的事
"You got no business being in my business."

161
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
尊重你男人的隐私
Respect your man's boundaries.

162
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,050
亲爱的  你答应过
Honey, you promised

163
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,940
做完布朗尼蛋糕后会洗盘子的
you'd clean the pan if you made brownies.

164
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,650
也许我忘了先喷点水
Well, maybe I forgot to spray it first

165
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,450
现在我让它泡着呢  女人
and I'm letting it soak, woman.

166
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,770
你来时他才这样说话
He only talks like this when you're around.

167
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,960
那他今天可以到此为止了
Well, then, he's done for the day.

168
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,470
好吧  很好
Oh, okay. Good.

169
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,910
-拜拜  爸  -回头见  伙计
- Bye, dad. - See ya...buddy.

170
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,760
我追踪了卢克的手机
I have tracked Luke's cellphone,

171
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,940
他可不在赞德家附近
and he is nowhere near his friend Xander's.

172
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,680
亲爱的  我像下一位沃兹尼克一样热爱科技
Honey, I love technology as much as the next Wozniak,

173
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,680
[苹果公司创始人]

174
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,460
但我们真的要监视自家孩子吗
but are we sure we want to be spying on our kids?

175
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,020
不要  你也不该用伪造的身份
No, and you also shouldn't try to friend us

176
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,590
在Facebook上加我们好友
with fake Facebook profiles,

177
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,750
玛戈特・拉克鲁瓦
Margot LaCroix.

178
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,520
我原本期望
I was really hoping some

179
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,150
你工作以后能不这么疯狂了呢
of this would go away when you got a job.

180
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,580
我直接问他怎么样
How about I just ask him?

181
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,240
天啊
Oh, man.

182
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,570
真希望你是我爸爸
I wish you were my dad.

183
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,050
能避免我犯多少我没犯过的错啊
The things I would have done.

184
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,350
-喂  -儿子
- Hello? - Hey, buddy.

185
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,520
只是想确定你平安到达了赞德家
Just making sure you got to Xander's okay.

186
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
是啊  平安无事
Yep. All good.

187
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,890
真的吗  因为我听到汽车的声音
Really? 'cause I hear traffic...

188
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,630
赞德住在一条很安静的街道上  对吧
...and Xander lives on a pretty quiet street, right?

189
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,990
其实我们离开了赞德家
Actually, we left Xander's,

190
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,390
现在我们在萨米这里
and now we're at Sammy's.

191
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,120
这就讲得通了
Well, that makes perfect sense.

192
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
你好好玩  注意安全
You have fun. Be safe.

193
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,370
他在撒谎
He's lying.

194
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,220
瞧  他朋友萨米住在这里
Look. His friend Sammy lives here.

195
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
而他在奥林匹克街和20号大街的路口
He's all the way over on Olympic and 20th.

196
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,530
奥林匹克街和20号大街吗
Olympic and 20th?

197
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,230
那是一家废品回收站
That's the old salvage yard

198
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,590
孩子们会去那里嗑药
where kids go to get high.

199
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,510
-什么  -不
- What?! - No.

200
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,830
我们现在就要赶过去
Oh, we are going there right now.

201
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,250
等等  你确定吗
Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?

202
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
我回答完这个问题后就出门
I'm gonna answer, and then I'm gonna walk away.

203
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
好吗
Deal?

204
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,360
好
Okay.

205
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,330
我百分之420肯定
I'm 420% sure.

206
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,080
她数学真差
Wow, she's bad at math.

207
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,440
爱人们
Hey, guys.

208
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,630
二爸
Hi, daddy.

209
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,600
午饭怎么样
How was lunch?

210
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,010
还不错
Oh, it was fine.

211
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,630
人们什么时候开始往沙拉里加三文鱼了
Hey, when did salmon become a thing that we put on salad?

212
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,750
市里是2008年  郊区是2011年
2008 in the city, 2011 in the suburbs.

213
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,040
布雷特怎么样  今天又有什么好戏
How was Brett? What's the drama du jour?

214
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,810
没什么
Nothing.

215
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,800
拜托  他就不是个安分的角色
Oh, please. It's never nothing with that one.

216
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
他的烫发  假装自己有跟踪者
His perm, the stalker he pretends to have,

217
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,150
在国税局工作就没人愿意和你约会了
nobody will date you when you work at the I.R.S.

218
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,160
我烦死了  这次又是什么事
I hate it. What was it this time?

219
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,690
说真的  没事
No, seriously, nothing.

220
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,490
也许在沙拉里加点鸡肉以外的东西
I guess it is nice to have something other than chicken

221
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,620
也挺好的
to throw on there.

222
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,830
你为什么逃避话题
Okay, why are you being so evasive?

223
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,940
我没有逃避啊  我...
I'm not being evasive. I--

224
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,480
瞧瞧这条新领带
Check out this new tie.

225
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,830
我的天
Oh, my gosh.

226
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,370
你在转移话题
You are redirecting me,

227
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,510
就像我们不想回答
like we do when Lily asks us a question

228
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,200
莉莉的问题时
we don't want to answer

229
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,670
就把娃娃塞到她面前
and just throw a doll in her face.

230
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,940
等等
Wait a minute.

231
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,890
别胡思乱想了
Don't be ridiculous.

232
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,370
我怎么会这么糊弄一个成年人
Like I could do that with an adult.

233
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,610
看看我给你买了什么
Check out what I got for you.

234
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,160
太好了  压蒜器
Oh, good, yes. A garlic press.

235
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
我还真受不了我的手指闻起来
I am so tired of my fingers smell--

236
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,210
我的天  你又在转移话题了
Oh, my gosh. You did it again.

237
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,290
-什么  -肯定很劲爆
- What's that? - Oh, it's got to be good.

238
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,150
-什么  -告诉我
- What?!  - Tell me.

239
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,030
-不  没什么  -告诉我
- No, nothing.  - Tell me.

240
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,280
-没什么好说的 -告诉我
- There's nothing to tell!  - Tell me.

241
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,470
-没什么可说的  -告诉我  告诉我
- There's nothing to tell! - Tell me, tell me,

242
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,120
告诉我  告诉我
tell me, tell me.

243
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,260
来  回答我
Here. Answer me.

244
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,650
圣诞老人怎么去得了那么多房子
How does santa claus get to all of those houses?

245
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,330
好了亲爱的  大人在说话呢
Okay, sweetie, the adults are talking right now,

246
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,180
看爸爸给你买了什么
And look what daddy brought you.

247
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,290
米奇尔  要是有人跟我说了什么
Mitchell, when somebody tells me something,

248
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,530
我都等不及回家告诉你
I can't wait to get home and tell you.

249
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,740
你难道没有同感吗
Don't you feel the same?

250
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
我当然有了
Of course I do.

251
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,230
但是他  他让我保证不说的
But he -- he made me promise.

252
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,200
你知道吗  我们不需要分享秘密
Well, you know what? We don't have to share secrets.

253
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,820
不需要
We don't.

254
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,460
我们都已经分享了房子  生活
We already share a house, a life,

255
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,430
还有个女儿
a daughter.

256
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,390
你知道吗  我不
You know what?I don't --

257
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,830
我不知道我为什么这么在意
I don't know why I care so much.

258
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,720
好吧  好吧
Okay, all right, okay.

259
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,530
他做了小腿肌肉植入
He got calf implants.

260
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,030
我的上帝  什么效果啊
Oh, my god! Oh, what do they look like?

261
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,060
就像他偷运了两个葡萄柚一样
Like he's smuggling two grapefruits.

262
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
而且我的沙拉里也有葡萄柚
Which, by the way, were also on my salad.

263
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,180
这可是大新闻啊  太大了
Okay, this is huge. This is huge.

264
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,520
都谁知道  我们得请他们来吃早午餐
Who all knows? We have to host a brunch.

265
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
不许跟任何人说  知道吗
Don't you dare tell a single person, okay?

266
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
他让我保证不告诉别人 特别是你
He made me promise not to tell anyone, especially you.

267
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,470
-特别是我  -拜托
- Especially me?   - Oh, please.

268
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,410
谁都知道你守不住秘密
Everybody knows you're terrible at keeping secrets.

269
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,340
好吧 我还不知道我有这样的名声
Okay, well, I didn't know that was my reputation.

270
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,490
也许这是个大家都在瞒着我的秘密
Maybe that's a secret people have been keeping from me.

271
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,580
我不想伤害你的感情
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

272
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,360
你已经伤了
Well, you did.

273
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,820
你知道让人难过的是什么吗
And you know what the sad thing is?

274
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,330
我们本来可以一起嘲笑某人的小腿植入的
We could be laughing at someone's calf implants right now.

275
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,990
你在干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

276
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,580
我只是在欣赏你的睡姿
I'm just watching you sleep.

277
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,290
你看上去真漂亮
You look so pretty.

278
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,800
好吧  但别太大声喘气
Okay, but don't breathe so loud.

279
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,650
你去哪儿啊
Hey, where are you going?!

280
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,870
我找不到可以进去的地方
I can't find a way in.

281
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,150
我什么都看不见
I can't see anything,

282
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,490
但我听见他们的笑声了
but I hear them laughing.

283
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,930
你知道小孩子为什么会笑
And you know why kids laugh.

284
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,950
因为他们心中充满喜悦  而不是怀疑吗
Because their hearts are filled with joy, not suspicion?

285
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,640
我们一定要搞清楚他们在干什么
We have got to see what is going on in there.

286
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,100
把那个嗡嗡响的东西从车里拿出来
Get the drone thing out of the car.

287
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,500
那个'东西'可是专业航空摄影器材
That "Thing" is a professional aerial-photography tool

288
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,180
只为房地产事业服务
for real-estate use only!

289
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,340
你用它拍你自己在沙滩堆小天使
You used it at the beach to film yourself doing sand angels.

290
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,460
那是我在拍宣传片
For my "Phil Dunphy Will Get You

291
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,870
《菲尔为您的海滨别墅提供天堂般好价格》
a Heavenly Deal On a Beach House" video.

292
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,300
专业房地产用具
A professional real-estate tool!

293
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,970
你答应过了的
That was the consensus.

294
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,060
喂  艾利克斯  你找到什么了
Hey, Alex. What did you find out?

295
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,380
好吧  这件事确实比海莉说的更重大
Okay, this is a bigger deal than Haley let on.

296
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,620
她班上只有5个人
Only five people in her class

297
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,800
被选上参加摄影展
were picked to show their photographs,

298
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,030
海莉是其中之一
And haley was one of them.

299
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,540
太棒了
Amazing!

300
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,270
她班上一共不止5个人吧
Are there more than five people in the class?

301
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,760
是的  那是我最先核查的
Yes. That's the first thing I checked.

302
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,630
那我们确实一定要去看看了
Then we really do have to be there.

303
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,800
打电话邀请米奇尔舅舅和外公一起来
Call uncle Mitchell and grandpa and see if they can join us.

304
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
她没发现你打探她的隐私吧
She didn't catch you snooping, did she?

305
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,380
没有  她在睡午觉
No. She's taking a nap.

306
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,420
她最近睡午觉比以前多多了
She's been taking a lot more naps lately.

307
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,060
去看看能不能查出是怎么回事
See what you can find out about that.

308
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,450
这样做太不对了
This is so wrong.

309
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,300
特殊时期特殊...
Eh, well, desperate times call for desperate --

310
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,990
你脑袋上是什么东西
What is on your head?

311
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,470
用来防眩光的  但显然挡不住你的怒视
It provides glare protection, but apparently not from you.

312
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,810
赶紧开始吧
Let's just do this.

313
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,740
我们是空军
We are airborne.

314
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,430
熟练地越过电线
Expertly navigating the wires.

315
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,200
你说得对
You're right.

316
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,290
我们已经通过围墙  接近目标
We have cleared the wall. Approaching target.

317
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,850
他们在那里
There they are.

318
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,830
他们在干什么
What are they doing?

319
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,680
他们在什么东西上跳来跳去
They're jumping around on stuff.

320
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,690
你看到什么可疑的东西了吗  比如
Do you see anything suspicious, like, um --

321
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,370
比如烟或者什么相关设备  干酪玉米片
like smoke or paraphernalia, nachos?

322
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,500
不  他们在互相拍摄
No, they're filming each other

323
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,800
还像僵尸那样跳来跳去
and moving around like zombies.

324
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,020
亲爱的  他们没在吸毒
Honey, they're not getting high.

325
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,860
他们在拍电影  居然没带我
They're making a movie... without me!

326
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,500
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,860
那为什么卢克要撒谎说
Then why would luke have lied

328
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,930
去萨米家呢
about going to Sammy's, huh?

329
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,460
亲爱的  你看
Honey, look.

330
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,020
萨米废品回收站

331
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,650
天啊
Oh, god.

332
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,050
他还是我们的小乖乖
Well, he's still our little boy.

333
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,480
我们得走了
Oh, we got to get out of here.

334
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,370
可不能让他知道我们监视他
He cannot know we were spying on him.

335
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,550
-快点  -已经晚了
- Come on. - Too late.

336
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,830
太晚了  他们发现了我的遥控飞机
It's too late. They're pointing at the drone.

337
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,990
-什么  -我们被发现了
- What?  - We're compromised!

338
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,670
快走  快走
Get out, get out!

339
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,430
我不能丢下遥控飞机
I can't leave the drone!

340
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,810
那是公司财产
It belongs to the office!

341
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,790
他们还在因为我在白板上
They're still mad at me for writing

342
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,150
用永久性记号笔而生我的气呢
on the dry-erase board with a permanent marker!

343
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
快上车
Get in the car.

344
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,330
快走  快走
Go, go, go!

345
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,090
那是什么东西
What was that thing?

346
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,370
有人在偷拍我们
Somebody was filming us.

347
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,070
我爸有个那种玩意儿
Hey, my dad has one of those.

348
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,230
我知道怎么回事了
I know what's going on here.

349
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,350
有个电影公司想偷我们的点子
A movie studio is trying to steal our idea!

350
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,470
斯皮尔伯格
Spielberg.

351
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,650
我就说过  僵尸跑酷是个超棒的点子
I told you guys, zombie parkour is a million-dollar idea.

352
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,790
我还是没懂  僵尸移动速度不够快
I still don't get it. Zombies don't move well.

353
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,930
吸血鬼估计会好一点
Vampires, maybe.

354
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,230
标题我都想好了  "吸血鬼跑酷"
Plus, there's your title -- "Vam-par-kour."

355
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,240
我听不出有什么特别的
I don't hear it.

356
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,000
瞧瞧
Look at that.

357
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,530
我最喜欢回到家被这样迎接了
That's how I like to be greeted when I come home!

358
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,550
曼尼今天跟朋友出去玩了
It turns out Manny's hanging with his friends today,

359
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,080
所以我不用接他
so I didn't need to go pick him up.

360
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
是哦  不好意思忘了告诉你
Oh, right. So sorry. I forgot to tell you.

361
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
不过  反正你也不是什么都告诉我
But, then, you don't tell me everything,

362
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
所以没什么所谓
so I guess it's okay.

363
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,040
你说这话太过分了
You got a lot of nerve.

364
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,390
你都已经查过我手机上的邮件了
You are the one who went through my emails on my phone.

365
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,220
你在说什么  我才没有
What are you talking about? No, I didn't.

366
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,490
所以你不是因为我手机里的东西生气
So you're not mad at me for something you found on my phone?

367
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,400
不是
No.

368
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,580
好吧  那很好
All right, then. Great.

369
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,340
没有伤害就不算犯规
No harm, no foul.

370
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,850
晚餐见
I'll see you at dinner.

371
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,440
把手机给我
Give me that phone!

372
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
我要看看你在藏什么
I want to see what you're hiding!

373
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,500
我什么都没有藏
I'm not hiding anything.

374
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,100
我都不知道怎么用这该死的玩意儿
I don't even know how to use the damn thing.

375
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,810
看吧  我不小心拨给了艾丽克斯
Oh, look. I accidentally dialed Alex.

376
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,160
我先跟她说两句  她可崇拜我了
Let me say hi to her. The kid idolizes me.

377
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,480
你好  宝贝
Hi, hon.

378
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,420
外公好
Hi, Grandpa.

379
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,940
问个问题  我要怎么删除手机上的邮件
Real quick, how do I delete e-mails on my phone?

380
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,660
你得先查一下收件箱
Well, first, you have to check your inbox,

381
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,360
垃圾箱还有已发送邮件
your trash folder, and your sent folder.

382
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,270
很多人会忽略已发送邮件
People often forget about the sent folder.

383
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,720
相信我  你要是也得抢在一个
Trust me, you get pretty adept at this

384
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
喜欢偷窥的老妈之前删掉邮件
when you have to stay one step

385
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
你也会很擅长这个的
ahead of your snooping mother.

386
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,700
把电话给我
Give me the phone.

387
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,470
我得挂了
Got to go.

388
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,160
好的  我  我手机里没有秘密
Uh, yeah, sure. I-I-I have nothing on here.

389
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,490
我先挂了外公的电话
Let me just disconnect from grandpa,

390
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,360
好像挂不掉
which is not happening right now.

391
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
我看到你在干什么了  艾丽克斯
I can see what you're doing, Alex.

392
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,710
你干嘛要删掉米奇尔舅舅的短信
Why did just delete a text from uncle Mitchell?

393
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,680
我没有
I didn't!

394
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,590
你不是应该更担心
Shouldn't you be more worried

395
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,710
海莉衣柜里的护士服吗
that Haley has a nurse's uniform in her closet?!

396
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,580
我一次只能顾得上一件事
I can only handle one thing at a time.

397
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,910
-你好  克莱尔  -你好  米奇尔
- Hey, Claire. - Hey, Mitchell.

398
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,160
为什么艾丽克斯要删掉你给她的短信
Why would Alex delete a text from you off her phone?

399
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,380
这个问题我不回答
I'm not answering that question.

400
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,380
手机是人家的私事
People's phones are their own business.

401
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,580
怎么了
What?

402
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,500
我得挂了  把手机给我
I got to go. Give me your phone.

403
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,460
不行  凭什么
No. Why?

404
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,560
因为你在跟人发短信
Because you're texting someone

405
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,250
而且看起来很内疚
and you look very guilty right now.

406
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,890
我在玩"一起来填词"
Or I'm playing "Words with friends"

407
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,240
跟朗吉尼斯一起
with Longines.

408
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,300
猜的词包括"小腿肌肉"和"植入"吧
None of those words better be "Calf" or "Implants."

409
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,740
天啊  给你  你知道吗
Oh, my gosh. Here. You know what?

410
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
拿走我的手机
Take my phone...

411
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,760
然后承认你一点都不信任我吧
and admit that you don't trust me,

412
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,400
你的未婚夫  和你女儿的另一个爹
Your fiance, and co-father of your daughter.

413
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,140
查吧
Go ahead.

414
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,880
按键啊
Push the button.

415
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,050
没什么  我很好  我信任你
I'm good. No, I'm fine. I trust you.

416
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,140
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh!

417
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,840
伙计们
Hey, guys.

418
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,770
想喝点红色的像酒的东西吗
You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?

419
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,140
-当然  -我也是
- Sure. - Yep, I do.

420
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
展会什么时候开
So, when's this exhibit open?

421
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,300
我不知道  细节大概还在杰的手机里
I don't know. Maybe the details are in Jay's phone.

422
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,120
不过我希望不是
But I hope not,

423
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,610
毕竟那里面装的都是秘密
because everything is very secret on there.

424
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,300
你们大概也看出来了
Don't know if you caught that subtle cue.

425
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,520
她在生我的气
She's mad at me.

426
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
他做了很可怕的事
He did something very terrible

427
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,860
又不愿意让我知道
that he doesn't want me to know about.

428
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,790
很可怕
"Very terrible"?

429
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,770
除非你告诉我
Until you tell me what it is,

430
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,000
不然我会联想到最坏的可能
I'm gonna think the worst possible thing,

431
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,330
比如你杀了个人
like maybe you killed somebody.

432
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,080
不过你估计没那个能耐  是吧
But you don't have the stomach for that, do you?

433
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,840
真高兴你们能来
Thank you so much for coming.

434
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,200
我知道你们都忙着工作和杂事
I know how busy you all are with work and errands

435
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,020
还有卑鄙地在短信里说我闲话
and snarking about me on your cellphone.

436
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,050
别纠结这事了  克莱尔
Let it go, Claire.

437
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,490
说实话  菲尔  我不知道你是怎么忍受的
Honestly, Phil, i don't know how you do it.

438
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,460
我不知道你是怎么忍受的
I don't know how you do it.

439
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,100
退一步海阔天空
Compromise and compassion.

440
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,760
她不是真的在问你
She wasn't really asking you.

441
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,450
卢克来了
Hey, hey! Here comes Luke.

442
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,500
我们该说我们今天干了什么
What do we say we were doing today?

443
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,800
什么时候卢克关心过我们干了什么
When has Luke ever showed any interest in what we do?

444
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
好吧  放轻松
Okay, but be cool.

445
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
如果他发现你追踪了他的手机
If he finds out you were tracking his phone,

446
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,990
他会认为我们不信任他
he'll think we don't trust him.

447
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,030
可不是  而且我也就不能继续追踪了
Ooh. Plus, then I could never do it again.

448
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,880
你们好啊
Hey, guys!

449
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,800
你好
What's up?

450
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,860
你今天过得怎么样
How was your day?

451
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,470
还不错  你们知道的
It was fine, you know.

452
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,610
我们不知道  我们怎么会知道
We don't know. How would we know?

453
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,320
我们只是问问而已
Oh, we just mean what did you do?

454
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,130
不是在问你都做了些什么
Not like, what did you do?

455
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,900
只是顺口一问"嗨  你都做了些什么"
And we're just like, "Hey, what -- what'd you do?"

456
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,450
你们表现得好奇怪
You guys are acting weird.

457
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,500
我们没有  你才奇怪
No, we're not. You are.

458
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
你们今天都做了些什么
What did you do today?

459
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,730
-我们只是待在家里  -我们去购物了
- We just stayed home  - We went shopping.

460
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,520
在家里网购裤子
Online shopping at home for pants.

461
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,060
我们俩都需要裤子
We both needed pants.

462
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,640
我跟你说过了他会问起的
I told you he was gonna ask.

463
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,840
等一下
Wait a minute.

464
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,330
今天那是你的遥控飞机吗
Was that your drone today?

465
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,450
你们在暗中监视我们吗
Were you spying on us?

466
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,060
对不起  是你妈妈逼我做的
I'm sorry. Your mom made me do it.

467
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,650
她以为你在吸大麻
She thought you were smoking grass.

468
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,490
大麻  克莱尔
Grass? Claire.

469
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,470
现在没人用大麻这个词了
No one says grass.

470
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,760
我没说过是大麻
I never said grass.

471
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,460
这种想法也不是那么疯狂
It's not that crazy an idea.

472
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,160
我们什么都没有吸
We weren't smoking anything.

473
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,220
曼尼永远不会做那种事
Manny would never.

474
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,000
谢谢  妈妈
Thank you, mom.

475
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,880
他总是很嫌弃那种事情
He's so judgy about those things.

476
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,940
我遛那条蠢狗的唯一原因
The only reason why I walk that stupid dog

477
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,570
就是我可以安静的抽会儿烟
is so that I can smoke my cigars in peace.

478
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,210
我简直不敢相信你监视我们
I can't believe you were spying on us.

479
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,400
你不能再这么疑神疑鬼的了  克莱尔
You have to stop being so suspicious, Claire.

480
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,040
你要学会相信别人
It's okay to trust people.

481
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,650
某些人可以  其他人  鬼知道
Some people. Other people, who knows?

482
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,230
你就疏忽了一秒钟
You turn your back for one second,

483
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,220
他们就不知在什么鬼地方
and they have a whole other family

484
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,330
组建了一个新家庭
on the bad side of town.

485
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,270
你就是我组建的新家庭
You are my other family from the bad side of town.

486
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,790
我不能一晚上都得忍受这些指责
Look, I can't stand this all night.

487
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,970
我借钱给别人了  歌洛莉亚
I loaned someone money, Gloria.

488
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,190
我没有征求你的意见因为我知道你会生气
I didn't consult you. I knew you'd be pissed.

489
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,430
她只是一个朋友
She's just a friend.

490
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,410
"她"
"She"?

491
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,520
这就是那个
Is this the woman

492
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,740
你夜里梦见的女人吗
that you've been dreaming about at night,

493
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,040
你甚至用性感的嗓音叫她
that you've been making the sexy noises and saying,

494
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,420
"宝贝  宝贝"
"Baby, baby"?

495
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,520
你这是在说些什么  当然不是
What the hell are you talking about?! No?!

496
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,930
那就证明一下  给我你的手机
Then prove it! Give me the phone!

497
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,360
实话说  你们这群人
Honestly, you people --

498
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,950
我指的是你们这些直人  简直太可笑了
and by that, I mean straight people are ridiculous!

499
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,180
每个人都有权力拥有一些隐私
Everyone's entitled to a little bit of privacy.

500
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,730
逼我说出朋友的秘密的人
Says the guy who forced me to

501
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,740
还好意思说出这种话
tell him our friend's secret.

502
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,780
好吧  那是不一样的
Okay, that's different.

503
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,880
那是八卦
That was gossip,

504
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,900
-八卦是属于所有人的  -好吧
- and gossip belongs to everyone.  - Okay.

505
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,520
别老惦记着别人的手机了
Just keep your nose out of other people's phones.

506
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,400
你要么就相信他们要么就不
You either trust them or you don't.

507
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,270
把手机给我
Give me that.

508
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,300
-终于拿到了  -还给我  还给
- Ha! Yes.  - Give it back. Give it --

509
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,170
不行  但你可以拿我的看
No, but you can have mine,

510
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,310
因为我光明磊落
'cause I have nothing to hide.

511
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,080
我要了
I'll take that.

512
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,060
天哪  妈妈  不要这样做
Oh, my god. Mom, no, please, stop.

513
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,340
在这  在这  等等  我帮你拿出来
Here, here. Wait. Let me help you.

514
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,980
这太疯狂了  对吧
It's crazy, right?

515
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,960
我就知道
Ha ha. No, I knew it.

516
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
笑死了
"L.O.L.

517
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
你觉得布雷特喜欢喝黑咖啡
Do you think Brett likes his coffee black

518
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,490
还是一半咖啡一半水
or with calf-and-calf?"

519
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,490
[calf小腿与half一半 音似]

520
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,480
好吧  我承认  我是有问题
Okay, I admit it. I have a problem.

521
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,580
但我只告诉了一个人  这消息太劲爆了
But I only told one person. It was too juicy.

522
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,440
而且克里斯宾说了他会保守秘密
And Crispin said he wouldn't tell anyone.

523
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,610
这条是朗吉尼斯发来的
This is from Longines.

524
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,500
那个骗子克里斯宾  把手机还给我
Oh, that lying Crispin. Give me that.

525
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,300
我不敢相信他背叛了我的信任
I cannot believe he betrayed my trust.

526
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,470
现在胡娇也插进来了
Now Pepper's chiming in.

527
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,440
大骗子  所有人
Jackals, all of them.

528
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,570
胡娇真会说笑
Oh, that Pepper.

529
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,210
我的天
Oh, my g--

530
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,160
你让米奇尔叔叔帮你给我买生日礼物吗
Uncle Mitchell was helping you get me a birthday present?

531
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,490
是的  我想给你做饭
Yeah, I wanted to make you dinner

532
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,190
然后送你一瓶上好的红酒
and get you a nice bottle of wine,

533
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,520
那瓶他在新年夜给我们喝的
The one he served at new year's

534
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
你说你很喜欢
you said you liked.

535
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,500
我确实喜欢那瓶红酒
Ooh, I did like that wine.

536
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,350
我很抱歉我把惊喜给毁了
I'm sorry I ruined the surprise.

537
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,410
你应该觉得抱歉
You should be.

538
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,830
要不然你以为我在干什么
What did you think I was doing, anyways?

539
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,100
你应该信任我才对
Give me some credit.

540
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,540
或许我们可以算是扯平了
Oh, well, then, maybe we could just call it even,

541
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,670
因为他说  我只是很吃惊
since he typed, "I'm just surprised

542
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,750
她还记得那天晚上来过我家
She remembered coming to my house that night."

543
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,060
你回复说  啊哈哈哈
To which you responded, "Bahahahahahaha"

544
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,240
后面还有五个感叹号
with like five exclamation points.

545
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,910
很公平
Seems fair.

546
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,070
找到你要找的东西了吗
Did you find what you were looking for?

547
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,060
没有
No.

548
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
她是俱乐部的服务员
She's a waitress at the club.

549
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,830
她的车被男朋友砸了  所以我帮了她
Her boyfriend crashed her car, so I helped her,

550
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,020
因为我们之间有个有趣的游戏
because we have that fun game where I order salad

551
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
每次我点沙拉她都给我上薯条
and she brings me french fries.

552
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,920
但是我从来没梦见过她
But I never dreamt of her.

553
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,850
昨天晚上我做了个噩梦
Last night, I had a nightmare.

554
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,720
乔爬到一栋高楼的天台上
Joe got out onto a ledge of a tall building.

555
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
我救不到他
I couldn't get to him.

556
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,270
我特别着急
I was very upset,

557
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,930
我可能在梦里还哭了
and I think I might have cried a little in my sleep,

558
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,650
你可能觉得那听起来很色情
which might have sounded like sex to you,

559
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,800
这点我很不喜欢
which I don't love.

560
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
但乔才是我喊的那个"宝贝"
But that's the "Baby" I was talking about.

561
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
真的吗
Really?

562
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,070
很吓人
That's scary.

563
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,120
是啊
Yes!

564
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,240
苍天在上
Why in god's name

565
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,520
我怎么会梦到别的女人
would I need to dream about another woman?

566
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,720
你这么一说
Now that you say it out loud,

567
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,860
我也觉得的确很离谱
it does seem kind of crazy.

568
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,250
不骄傲地说  我并没有梦到乔
I'm not proud of this, but the dream wasn't about Joe.

569
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,360
而是这个小宝贝
It was about this little baby right here.

570
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,350
没错
That's right.

571
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,930
你差点从天台上掉下去  吓死爸爸了
You almost fell off a ledge, and daddy was so scared.

572
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,260
我的天  是我们
Oh, my gosh. It's us!

573
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,020
全都是
All over the place.

574
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
我不知道现在是什么感觉
I don't know how I feel about this.

575
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,850
你看  你有多喜欢八卦
Okay, okay, now, see -- look how much you gossip.

576
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,370
海莉都用胶片捕捉到了
Haley managed to capture it on film.

577
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,270
再看看你  笑得见牙不见眼
And look at you, smiling ear to ear.

578
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,560
你知道你最爱听我说八卦了
You know you love it when I give you the dirt.

579
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,690
这倒是提醒我了
Oh, which reminds me,

580
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,490
猜猜谁刚因为向服务生乱献殷勤
guess who got kicked out of a hotel bar

581
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,080
被赶出大堂酒吧了
for making unwanted advances at the waitstaff?

582
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
我不想知道  那不关我的事
I don't want to know. It's none of my business.

583
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,080
好吧
Okay.

584
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,050
约坦  赞尼尔  还是萨尔
Jotham. Zaniel. Sal.

585
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,650
告诉我吧
Just tell me!

586
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,610
我不知道
I don't know.

587
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,430
老天  看看我脸上的皱纹
Good god, look at those lines on my face.

588
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,920
我什么时候变得这么老了
When did I get so old?

589
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,790
那是笑纹  因为你正抱着你的儿子
Their smile lines because you're holding your son

590
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,490
你爱他  在睡梦中都要保护他
who you love, who you had to protect in your dream.

591
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,850
她是个很棒的摄影师
She is a great photographer,

592
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,630
虽然每个人都盯着我的
even though it's embarrassing

593
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,600
六块腹肌  让我很不好意思
that everyone's staring at my six-pack.

594
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,060
她真的很棒
She is really good.

595
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,310
你看到我的照片了吗
Have you seen my photo?

596
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,810
歌洛莉亚看到了吗
Has Gloria seen this?

597
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,020
歌洛莉亚看到什么
Gloria see what?

598
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,870
我觉得我看起来不错
I think I look good.

599
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,650
她都没看到照片里也有我
Wow. She didn't even see me in there.

600
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,550
天啊  你们来干什么
Oh, my god! What are you guys doing here?!

601
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,060
艾丽克斯邀请我们来的
Alex invited us.

602
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,700
你  你怎么知道是在这里的
You? How did you know where this was?

603
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,610
传单从你的背包里掉出来了
Uh, the flier fell out of your backpack.

604
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,580
骗人
Liar.

605
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,530
妈妈逼我的
Mom made me.

606
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,720
我们是来支持你的
We came to be supportive.

607
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,410
我告诉你们不要来的  这太不尊重人了
I told you not to come here. This is such a violation!

608
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,470
她也对我这样
She just did it to me, too.

609
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,550
她看了我的短信
She read my texts.

610
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,290
那没什么
That's nothing.

611
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,250
她用了个遥控飞机监视我
She totally used a drone to spy on me.

612
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,760
我有正当理由使用遥控飞机
Use of the drone was completely justified.

613
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,800
-你有病吗  -你在说什么
- What is wrong with you?! - What are you talking about?

614
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,430
行了  别吵了
All right, knock it off.

615
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,530
你们根本不知道做家长有多难
You have no idea how hard it is to be a parent,

616
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,400
要费尽心思打探孩子们的状况
to figure out what's going on with your kid

617
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,190
你们只会咕哝或者说"还行"
when all you get is a grunt or a "Fine"

618
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,580
或者甩甩头发
or a flick of the hair.

619
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,180
保护你们是我的责任
It's my job to protect you

620
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,310
要保证你们做的选择是对的
and make sure you're making good choices.

621
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,140
如果我在这样做的时候
And if I step over the line every now and again

622
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,120
偶尔有点过分  难免
when I'm doing that, tough.

623
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,610
只有知道你们平安
Knowing you're safe is the only thing

624
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,340
我晚上才能睡着
that lets me sleep at night.

625
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,830
我还以为是靠酒精
I thought it was the wine.

626
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,220
恭喜你  海莉
Congratulations, Haley.

627
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,850
恭喜什么
For what?

628
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,110
有人刚刚买下了你拍的那张
Someone just bought your photo

629
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,670

of this beautiful lady.

今天卖出的第一张
First one sold.

631
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,110
天啊
Oh, my god!

632
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,070
有人花钱买了我的作品  我的
Someone paid for something that I made! Me!

633
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,050
我真高兴大家能在这里一起见证
I am so psyched we were here for this!

634
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,130
我也是
Me too!

635
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,280
你现在高兴我们来了吗
Now you're glad we're here, huh?

636
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,090
我必须承认
I got to admit,

637
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,800
你这张照片美极了
that's a gorgeous picture of you.

638
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,770
里面也有我  爸
I'm in it, too, dad.
