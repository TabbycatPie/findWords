00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,491
Of course. Oh, no, no, no.

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,327
There… it… goes.

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,953
[groans]

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,504
If you know nothing else about Shane,
know this.

11
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,963
He's a man of his word.

12
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,550
"Leave by sunup or you're dead,"
isn't a suggestion.

13
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,927
It's a promise.

14
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,805
We were just saying goodbye.

15
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,308
Listen, Cadet.

16
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,062
Try thinking of it this way.
The Jaeger's better off with us.

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,440
Those things are made for battle,
not long walks to the beach.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,528
Oh, big plans to fight Kaiju?

19
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,405
There's far worse things than Kaiju
in the Black.

-[stabbing noise]
-[gasps]

21
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,743
No. Boy! Stop.

22
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,222
Princess, look.

23
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,808
It's not worth dying
over a hunk of hardware

24
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,186
or bruised egos or some doomed sense
of right and wrong.

25
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,314
Just go.

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,282
Now!

27
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,637
Can't believe you let 'em go.

28
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,682
I promised Mei they could leave Bogan.

29
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,060
-Never said what comes after.
<i>-</i>And that is?

30
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,730
You kill 'em.

00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,860

00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,528
[Rickter chuckles]

33
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,489
You promised.

34
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,118
Rickter's just making sure they don't get
any ideas about sneaking back.

35
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,745
You worry about Joel.

36
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,581
Copperhead's still out there
sniffing around for this Jaeger.

37
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,754
And give Joel a message.

38
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,592
If the Jaeger isn't walking out of here
by end of day…

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,969
he's dead.

40
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,647
Making good progress, I see.

41
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,816
Yeah. [scoffs]

42
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,112
[rattling]

43
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,294
Here, better have some more.

44
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,463
Not helping.

45
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,300
Why didn't you stop the Drift?
You had to see this coming.

46
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,095
Like I had a choice, Mei? You know Shane.

47
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,722
Maybe I can buy you some time
if I remind him--

48
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,599
Time won't help.

49
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,393
Pretty sure I popped
a few breakers up here

50
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,061
and don't think the power's coming back.

51
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,272
-What are you talking about?
-My memory.

52
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,399
That marathon mind meld shot it to hell.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,735
Whole sections of it, poof. Gone.

54
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,072
I don't even know what
half these components are,

55
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,574
much less how to fix… this.

56
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,119
Do you know what this is? I don't.
[chuckles]

57
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,956
I should've just piloted with you.
None of this would have happened.

58
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,334
Hey! There's a bright side
to humping brains

59
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,253
with that many bush rat riders.

60
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,548
-Remember how good I was at throwing?
-Yeah. Like a three-year-old.

61
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,260
I got all kinds of new skills.

62
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,847
Just not the ones Shane cares about.

63
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,017
How long is he giving me?

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,103
End of day.

65
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,771
Or?

66
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,942
-What? I gotta get out of town?
-You know the answer.

67
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,697
After all I've done
for that bloody bludger, he'll off me?

68
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,242
Just like that?
This mess up here is because of him!

69
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,618
[grunts angrily]

70
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,579
[tools clatter]

71
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,456
[panting]

72
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,749
[Mei] Do what you have to.

73
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,376
Get this thing walking
a straight line out of this camp

74
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,794
and all will be good.

75
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,923
[breathing heavily]

76
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,850
So what now?

77
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,729
Taylor, what are we gonna do?

78
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,732
Great! We'll just keep walking.

79
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,777
Maybe run into our parents.
Oh! Get to Sydney!

80
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,237
And if we're really, really lucky,

81
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,239
we'll even survive the day.

82
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,369
-What do you want me to say, Hayley?
-That you haven't given up.

83
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,079
Why shouldn't I give up?

84
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,290
I got us captured,
lost our Jaeger, attacked a Kaiju

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,668
and barely lived through it.
Everything I do is wrong.

86
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,379
[Rickter] You got that right.

87
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
[suspenseful music playing]

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,759
Hmm-hmm.

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,471
We've got unfinished business.

90
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,473
Just leave us alone.

91
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,767
Shane said we could go.

92
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
I didn't.

93
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,567

-No.

Boy?

112
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,280
You're okay! You're okay!

113
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,325
He's not bleeding. He…

114
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,370
He's not even hurt.

115
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,080
Maybe the gun misfired?

116

-[gun cocks]

118
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,420
Huh?

119
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,715
Whoa!

120
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,469
Whoa. Easy, mate.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

121
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,393
You don't need to do this.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,187
[whimpers, sighs]

123
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,150
-[Rickter] Mei?
-Me, on the other hand…

124
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,568
Mei!

125
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,741
[Taylor's breath trembling]

[Shane on walkie-talkie] <i>Rickter, report.</i>

128
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,964

Oof!

132
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,108
Take a truck out and find Rickter.

133
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,240
-Joel!
-[Mei] Here's an idea.

134
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,367
Maybe let him do his job?

135
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,411
What job? Not a sound's
come out of that Jaeger in hours.

136
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,790
Well, after the psychic skid mark
he got drifting with an epileptic,

137
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,542
he's probably being extra careful.

138
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,877
Doesn't change
the facts on the ground, Mei.

139
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,255
He's of no further use to me
if he can't fix a Jaeger.

140
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,800
I'll go see how he's doing.

141
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,968
[Shane] Mei.

142
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
Tick-tock.

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,014
[Joel breathes shakily]

144
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,517
Okay, come on, come on, come on. It's not…

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,935
It's… it's, um…

146
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,062
-It's, uh…
-Yoo-hoo!

00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,189
-[yelps]
-You're almost done, right?

148
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,360
[scoffs] If I was, you think I'd scream
like a pre-teen when somebody stops by?

149
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,822
Everything I touch in here breaks more.

150
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,451
[sighs] It's gonna be okay.
I put a plan in motion.

151
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,078
Ah!

152
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,622
Jeez! Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

153
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,000
That's upside down.

154
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,127
Oh.

155
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,963
-The hell are you doing here?
-[Taylor] Ask her.

156
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,009
I snuck him back to get the Jaeger
running since you obviously can't.

157
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,720
Good, good, saving my neck. I like it.

158
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,889
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get to work.

159
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,433
I'm gonna need Loa's help.

160
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,312
Yeah. Uh, she stopped talking to me
a while ago. Probably mad.

161
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,022
It's kinda my way with the ladies.

162
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,941
[Loa powers up]

163

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
Oh. I missed you too, love.

165
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,618
Loa, we need to stabilize your walk cycle.

166

[Loa] <i>Affirmative. Shall we get to work?</i>

167

Now we're talking, Loa.

168
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,041
One question
for the party planners, though.

169
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,460
What's he get out of this?

170
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,337
The Jaeger.

171
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,549
Oh, that's a plan all right.

172
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,426
Double taps to the head for all. Whoopee.

173
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,472
Look, you get credit for the repair,
I get to sleep at night.

174
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,308
Not our fault
Princess and the Cadet stole it back.

175
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,936
Once we're on the ground,
you got 30 minutes.

176
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,313
Whoa! Whoa. Uh…

177
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,023
Not so fast, Mei.

178
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,276
I mean, you're in the Bogan boat
with Shane.

179
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,613
-Why rock it by helping me?
-You've had my back.

180
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,782
-I have yours.
-Wait. Wait, girl. Uh…

181
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,534
My memory is spotty, but…

182
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,120
About watching backs…

183
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,248
Yeah?

184
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,710
[sighs]

185
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,253
I-- I gotta confess something, Mei.

186
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,799
I'm not your priest, okay?
Just let Taylor do his thing--

187
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,635
-It's about Shane.
-Can't you tell I'm not in the mood?

188
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,969
And about you.

189
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,098
You're like a daughter to him, you know?

190
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,767
Makes him kind of your dad.

191
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,895
-Ever wonder why?
-He told me why.

192
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,898
-He lost his family.
-And you lost yours, right?

193
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,528
Get to the point, Joel.

194
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,534
Uh… he never had a family.

195
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,661
[gasps]

196
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,335
No, we… we drifted.
I've seen his wife, his daughter.

197
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,879
And I saw them die in Whitehorn
when the city fell.

198
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,006
That wife and daughter…

199
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,592
belonged to someone else.

200
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,761
Someone he drifted with years ago.

201
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,973
Their session recorded onto one
of those memory drives he carries.

202
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,853
Yeah, he's a jackass!

203
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,981
But he created the family
he wished he had.

204
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,192
You're the family he wished he had, Mei.

205
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,362
-He picked you out of a crowd.
-No. He rescued me off the street.

206
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,531
No.

207
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,743
No, Mei. I'm sorry.

208
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,494
-He didn't.
-[exhales]

209
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,997
-What are you talking about?
-[groans]

210
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,585
Shane stole you from your family,
a loving family.

211
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,629
You thought your Drift sessions
were about hiding your pain?

212
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,633
Locking it away so you could find peace?
It wasn't pain he buried.

213
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,512
It was your memories. Real memories.

214
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,432
-He buried you.
-No!

215
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,893
No, no, no, stop! He wouldn't!

216
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,562
Is this necessary?
She's trying to help you.

217
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,980
And I'm helping her.

218
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,357
She needs to get out of here,
away from Shane.

219
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,903
Mei, I'll leave with you.
We'll go together.

220
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,616
His timing sucks, but maybe Joel's right.

221
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,409
-Ah!
-[coughs]

222
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,369
-You just fix this Jaeger.
-Mei.

223
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,329
And you,

224
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,872
shut up!

225
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,471
Don't worry. Mei's coming to get us.

226
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,724
[clatters]

227
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,312
Now, fingers crossed
Taylor can get Atlas working.

228
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,775
We'll all be safely back in our Jaeger
before you know it. [chuckles]

229
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,112
Snake bites, bullets…

230
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,282
What did they do to you in that lab?

231
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,326
[footsteps approaching]

232
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,953
[Hayley gasps]

233
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,205
Boy, stay behind me.

234
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,627
Huh.

235
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,339
[man] Back into camp!

236
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,384
[heavy whirring]

237
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,809

238
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,689
Keep moving!

[Loa] <i>Insert the sub-unit coupling module</i>
<i>into the cabling bypass.</i>

240
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,917
Got it.

241
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,961
[walkie-talkie beeps]

242
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,214
[Mei] <i>Joel, you copy?</i>
<i>Hayley and the boy were captured.</i>

243
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,173
Huh?

244
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,344
Can nothing go right in the bloody Black?

245
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,723
Where are they now?

246
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,309
[Mei] <i>Taken to the shipping container</i>
<i>near Shane's.</i>

247
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,060
[Joel] Wait, wait, wait!

248
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,230
Going after them will get you killed.
Finish the repairs and--

249
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,483
I don't need your self-serving crap.
You're on your own with Shane.

250
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,986
No, no. Okay, yes,
I was thinking about myself.

251
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,947
But if you wanna get your sister
and that idiot kid out,

252
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,490
no better way than with a Jaeger.

253
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,327
-You'll pilot with me?
-Oh, no.

254
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,663
[scoffs] I'll have oatmeal
coming out of my ears in 30 seconds.

255
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,874
-Then Mei.
-She won't leave Shane.

256
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,917
Who, then?

257
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,128
You. Alone.

258
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,881
-Not possible!
-[Loa]<i> Taylor, you are correct.</i>

259
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Solo piloting should not be attempted</i>
<i>with your limited training.</i>

260
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,344
She's wrong.

261
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,720
I can show you.

262
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,890
[Hayley groans]

263
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,227
Get comfortable. You're not leaving
until I find your brother.

264
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,566
[breathes heavily]

265
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,693
[Shane] I wanna know what you're up to.

266
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,532
Still not talking?

267
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,911

270
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,964
[Loa]<i> Taylor, Joel is suggesting that</i>
<i>you drift with a memory of another pilot.</i>

271
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,841
Ghost piloting?
You really have lost your mind.

272
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,302
Maybe, but Rangers have done it.

273
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,388
[scoffs] Rangers have <i>tried.</i>

274
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,391
The ones that didn't kill themselves
are left drooling into cups.

275
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,687
Okay, that's what the PPDC tells cadets,
because they don't want anyone trying it.

276
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,356
-Are they wrong?
-Ghost piloting is possible.

277
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,109
It's the best way to save
Hayley and the boy right now.

278
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,988
God! I… I wouldn't even know what to do.

279
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,491
Loa, do you have access to
historical pilot Drift files?

280
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,161
<i>Affirmative, but they should</i>
<i>not be accessed without proper scrubbing.</i>

281
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,539
No, no, okay.
You don't want them scrubbed.

282
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,791
Intense emotion
sears memory into the brain.

283
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,293
You ghost pilot,
you feel the whole bloody battle.

284
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,046
And in the end, you get bonza skills.

285
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,181
Loa, suit me up.

286
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,853
[Loa]<i> Taylor, I strongly recommend that</i>
<i>you do not take this course of action.</i>

287
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,898
I appreciate that, Loa, but do it anyway.

351
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,963
[Taylor grunts]

352
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,512
Huh?

353
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,599
No!

354
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
[loud thud]

355
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,453
[gunfire]

356
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,415
More riders. Now!

357
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,500
[bullets ricocheting]

358
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,586
Take that thing down.

359
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,848
Whoa! Whoa! [yells]

360
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
[Taylor] <i>Hurry. Get in!</i>

361
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,854
[grunts]

362
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,606
[Hayley] Go, go, go.

[labored breathing]

365
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,743
Get in there with him.

366
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,331
He was drifting alone?

367
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,215
[Loa] <i>Initiating neural handshake.</i>

368
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>Link complete.</i>

369
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,553
-Come on, Taylor, let's get out of here!
-[heaving]

370
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,098
No.<i> </i>No, not without Mei.

371
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,809
[Loa] <i>Warning.</i>
<i>Conflicting neural pathways.</i>

[grunts]

373
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,904
[Taylor] <i>Mei, you can't stay here.</i>

374
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,463
Mei!

375
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,388
Get some RPGs out here. Now!
We'll blow the legs off that bastard!

376
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,977
Loa, end the Drift.

377
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,021
-[Loa]<i> Gladly.</i>
<i>-</i>Get Taylor out of there.

378
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,947
No, you idiot! Nothing above the knee.
Mei's in there.

379
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,532
-[muffled bang]
-[grunts]

380
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,576
[Loa] <i>Right leg structural integrity</i>
<i>is at 50%.</i>

381
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,205
Can't take another one of those.

382
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
[Loa] <i>Initiating neural handshake.</i>

383
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,717
[gasps softly]

384
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,597
[whimpers, gasps]

385
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,356
I guess we're not
that different after all.

386
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,525
Let's save the girl talk for later.

387
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,138
Try coming after us now.

388
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,908
[metal creaking]

389

[birds chirping]

390
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,801
Any better?

391
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,387
Maybe after another dozen of these.

392
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,098
[gags]

393
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,934
Or not. God!

394
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,851
Ugh.

395
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,271
[grunts] One of these days,
you gotta tell me what's in this stuff.

396
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,567
[chuckles] Unfortunately,
that's one of the things I do remember.

397
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,361
You see, you gotta sneak up on a Kai--

398
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,655
[laughs]

399
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,866
Hey, look at this.
Turns out I can now juggle. [chuckles]

400
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,495
[Shane on walkie-talkie] <i>Mei. Copy?</i>

401
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,171
She doesn't want to talk to you.

402
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,676
<i>-Can you give her a message for me?</i>
<i>-</i>Sure.

403
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,929

<i>come with an insurance policy.</i>

404
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,139
<i>It's for anyone</i>
<i>who turns their back on me.</i>

405
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,099
[beeps rapidly]

406
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,897
[gasps]

407
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,524
