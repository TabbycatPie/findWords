(HARVEY READING)

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,924
Mike Ross never
went to law school.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,929
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,724
I still can't stay, Harvey.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,491
I know. I just want to stop
lying to the people I love.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,806
This makes it look
like Forstman's payment

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,365
never went to any offshore accounts.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,641
That's forgery.

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,649
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,602
I had no choice!

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,881
HARVEY: Bullshit,
you had no choice!

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,889
You could've said no at any
goddamn point along the way.

13
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,725
One thing is for sure.
When all this is over,

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,410
I'm gonna fire
the shit out of you.

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,761
I went to Robert Zane
and I asked him to give Louis a job.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,048
You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement.

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,561
If you can't do that,
what the hell good are you?

18
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,882
Louis won't be going to Zane.
And neither will you.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,082
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,567
- And why would I do that?
- If you do, I'll owe you one.

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,886
Mike Ross doesn't forget anything.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,843
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,803
was because
he didn't go to Harvard.

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,481
You've been lying to me since
the day Mike Ross arrived.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,807
- I am your friend, Louis.
- No, you're not.

26
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,206
And don't you ever
say that to me again.

27
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,771
You might as well spit it out.

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,247
You asked me what I wanted
once before and I told you.

29
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,044
And then, you told me
that I couldn't have it.

30
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,929
Pearson...

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,325

32
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,406

<i>The whole world s

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,642
Want to tell me what was so important
I had to get back here?

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,761
He knows.

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,603
I know what you're thinking.
Why didn't Donna tell you?

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,485
I'll tell you why.

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,770
Because as my first official act
as name partner,

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,530
I told her not to.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,210
- What?
- You heard me.

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,961
You can look at her as long as you want.
She can't help you.

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,162
Because my name is going up there
first thing tomorrow.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,288
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,481
But it won't be tomorrow.

51
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,761
I'm not waiting just so
you can have your own...

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,281
Louis, I have to sell this
to the senior partners.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,721
I can't just slap your name up there
one morning.

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,762
You did it for him.

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,611
- I didn't resign the week before.
- I don't care.

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,563
Louis, that's enough.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,250
This is going to take time.

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,522
And while it does,
you're going to keep this to yourself.

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,802
Bullshit. You're just trying to buy time
so you can get out of this.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,445
I'm not trying to buy anything.

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,406
We have an agreement.
And this is for your own good.

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,846
Well, for your own good,

63
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,928
you better remember
what I'll do if this takes too long.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,771
- Please tell me you had no other choice.
- You know damn well I didn't.

65
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,963
- No, I don't.
- That's because you didn't see him.

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,801
All he's ever thought about since
the day he was born was getting this.

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,129
So, if I have to choose between giving it
to him and going to jail...

68
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,651
He really threatened that?

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,001
He didn't just threaten it.
He was going to do it.

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,525
- And what are we going to do?
- We are going to take it.

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,847
We give him this,
it is never gonna end.

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,884
Harvey, before you say
another word to me,

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,051
I want you to think about the fact
that I just ate a big bowl of shit

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,051
because you brought that kid
into my house, and I had to take it.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,764
So, you're going to take it.

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,009
- Harvey.
- You don't need to say it.

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,610
Yeah, I do.

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,201
Louis came looking for you
and I didn't know what to do.

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,047
He was going to call Sheila
and tell her everything.

80
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,606
- I'd never seen him like that before.
- Donna, this is not on you.

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,721
Yes, it is.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,041
He pressed me and I broke.

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,003
It doesn't matter,
because he already knew.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,920
- How can you know that?
- Because I know Louis and I know you.

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,442
And he couldn't have broken you,
unless he knew the truth already.

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,729
So, this is not your fault, and I never
want to hear you say that again.

87
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,808
I should have at least
warned you before you got here.

88
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,968
All that would have done
was antagonize him even more,

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,923
because he would have
known you did it.

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,966
You did everything
you could have done.

91
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,002
Okay-

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,930
We have to tell Mike.

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,327
- No, we don't. Not now.
- Harvey.

94
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,930
I'll tell him in the morning.

95
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,129
We just had a huge win and I am not
in the mood to ruin his night.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,681
Louis.

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,241
What are you doing here?

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,162
- They didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,805
Jessica made me name partner.

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,607
- But, uh...
- But... But... But what?

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,885
I resigned in shame?

102
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,242
Well, that's all changed.
And it's all because of you.

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,806
Remember this?
No, you don't.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,888
Because you can't remember
something you never knew.

105
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,331
Cool to the end.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,444
Well, it doesn't matter,
because Donna told me.

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,961
And Harvey.
And Jessica.

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,242
When I told them that I knew
that you were a fraud,

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,681
did they run from you
like you were the plague.

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,807
What do you want?

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,161
I already got what I want from you.
Name partner.

112
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,123
You must want something else.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,844
See, that's what
I love about you, Mike.

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,928
Almost always a step ahead.

115
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,726
What I want from you is to know
that you're dead at my law firm.

116
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,121
You can't fire me.

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,844
Why would I fire you,
when I can break you?

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,251
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big,

119
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,522
you're going to be
begging me to take it off.

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,404
And all you'll have to do
is say two simple words.

121
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,684
The same two words that you let me say
to Harvey and Jessica.

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,007
"I resign."

- What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

Yeah, I know. And a little
heads up would have been nice.

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,806
I wanted to give you the night.

142
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,810
Well, the night kind of got blown up
when Louis showed up at my apartment

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,809
and said he was going to break me.

144
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,365
What do you want from me, Mike?

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,562
I want to know how you let him
become name partner.

146
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,681
Would you rather we let
him go to the police?

147
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,451
Come on. I don't believe that Louis
would actually go to the police.

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,721
He would.
Because Jessica said he would.

149
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,161
So, if you're here to say that
we can figure some way out of it,

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,247
that's not going to happen.

Did you hear what I said?

154
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,807
Louis came to my apartment
filled with rage,

155
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,163
and he told me he was making it
his personal mission to break me.

156
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,209
Then, you make it your
mission not to let him.

157
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,049
Harvey, he's name partner.

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,605
Did I ever tell you
the story about the gym?

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,684
I'm really not in the mood
for a story right now.

160

Well, you're going to hear it anyway.

161
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,841
When I was a kid,
my father put me in boxing camp.

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,247
Middle of summer, 90 degrees.

163
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,328
Every day after sparring in that,

164
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,171
they'd make you do
100 laps and 50 pull ups.

165
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,649
They'd push you until you either
threw up or passed out or both.

166
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,843
Anyone could leave at any point,
all you had to do was quit.

167
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,804
- And let me guess, you didn't quit.
- I quit every goddamn day.

168
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,843
I just never said it out loud.

169
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,089
Because no way was I going to give
them the satisfaction of breaking me.

170
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,171
So, I guess it's time for me to drop down
and give Louis 20.

171
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,727
I think it's going to be a little
more than 20, buddy.

172
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,726
I see you noticed I scraped
your little associate title away.

173
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,841
You scraped it away.

174
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,849
Yeah. Just like I'm going
to scrape you away.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,810
- Starting with these.
- Well, Louis, go ahead.

176
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,769
Give me all of the shittiest cases
that you can find.

177
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,491
But I'm telling you,
it's not going to break me.

178
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,045
You overestimate yourself.

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,882
Did you think when I said

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,729
I was going to bury you in shit,
I meant legal work?

181
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,046
No, no, no.

182
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,845
You're not a lawyer,
which means you must be a paralegal.

183
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,803
And that's exactly the kind of work
you're going to be doing.

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,444
Louis, you can't do this.

185
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,847
Everyone out there
thinks of me as a lawyer.

186
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,691
And two days ago, they thought of me
as someone who used to work here.

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,006
Look at us now.

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,851
Oh, and if you're thinking of crying to
Harvey, that would be a major mistake.

189
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,406
Because this is
between you and me.

190
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,163
What are you doing here?

191
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,931
I'm here because I know you're angry
and you're feeling betrayed,

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,441
but I am not going
to let you throw our friendship away.

193
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,727
I can't throw away something
that never existed in the first place.

194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,046
- Louis...
- Donna, we're not friends.

195
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,640
We never were friends,
because it was all based on a lie.

196
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,171
So you think my giving you this,

197
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,123
and every other nice thing
that I ever did for you,

198
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,083
was just to keep you
from finding out about Mike?

199
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,043
No, I don't.

200
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,970
But I do think, if you had the chance
to take back all those nice things you did

201
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,969
in exchange for me never finding out
about your little secret,

202
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,206
you'd do it in a heartbeat.

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,010
You want a chance
to tell me the truth?

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,645
Go ahead.
Tell me the truth right now.

205
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,888
And that answers my question.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,889
You know what, Louis?
It was a bullshit question

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,082
designed to do nothing
but make me feel like shit.

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,850
Mission accomplished.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,048
And now, I'm going to tell you
what I told Mike. You're dead to me.

210
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,403
Okay. You want to hate me? Hate me.

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,284
You want to hate Mike? Hate Mike.

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,243
But everybody at this firm
can't be dead to you

213
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,931
because sooner or later,
you're going to need someone.

214
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,726
Thank you, Donna.
But that someone isn't going to be you.

215
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,691
Donna said you wanted to see me.

216
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,202
No, I didn't want to see you,
I needed to see you.

217
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,045
I know you're under a lot of stress,
but that was a one-time thing.

218
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,207
(EXHALES)

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,886
I don't need you to do that to me.
Louis has already done it.

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,082
- What are you talking about?
- Look at this.

221
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,846
He's buried me in paralegal work.

222
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,803
Okay, that's bullshit.
He can't treat you like that.

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,843
Rachel, I don't care how he treats me.
All right?

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,368
I can take it until he gets over this.
But look at these deadlines.

225
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,370
There's no way I can get all of this work
done on time without your help.

226
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,801
I will do whatever you need.
But, Mike, he is not going to get over it

227
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,888
- unless you make him get over it.
- Rachel, please.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,967
[RUE

229
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,283
The day after what happened
in here happened, I shut you out.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,604
But then, a week later,
you came to my door

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,530
and you said you weren't going
to let me go without a fight.

232
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,644
That is not the same.
I wanted you to fall in love with me.

233
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,082
I was already in love with you
and you knew it.

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,364
Yeah, well, Louis is a lot of things,
but he's not in love with me.

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,650
He used to be.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,883
You just have to
make him remember that.

237
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,164
Okay. The first thing we need to do
is finish all of this work.

238
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,328
Unless, of course, that offer still stands.

239
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,326
I don't recall making an offer.

240
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,489
- You did say, "Whatever I need."
- That's not what I meant.

241
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,285
And then you said,
"Never take no for an answer", so...

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,241
- Okay.
- Lock the doors.

243
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,206
- Are you serious?
- Take yes for an answer.

244
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,970
I'm locking the door.

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,881
Louis, you sounded urgent
on the phone. What's going on?

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,721
I'll tell you what's going on.
I'm back at Pearson Specter.

247
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,923
- What? I don't understand.
- Let me explain it to you.

248
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,770
I just became name partner.

249
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,724
Louis...
(LAUGHS)

250
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,322
This is amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

251
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,407
Okay. Well, you can keep
being happy for me

252
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,000
but you better start being happy for you
because I'm bringing you back.

253
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,722
What? I don't... Oh!

254
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,407
Katrina Amanda Bennett,
will you be my associate?

255
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,322
Louis Marlowe Litt,
I will be your associate. Again.

256
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,283
You've just made me
the happiest attorney on Earth.

257
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,647
When do we consummate
our new pre-existing relationship?

258
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,842
As soon as my new
position is official.

259
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,167
- Wait, why isn't it official?
- I can't tell you that.

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,243
Louis, I think I've more
than proven you can trust me.

261
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,930
No, are you kidding me?
You're the only one I can trust.

262
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,530
It's not that. It's just...

263
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,927
Okay, Louis,
you don't need to tell me. But...

264
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,408
...if you won't tell me,
and they won't tell the world,

265
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,966
- something's wrong.
- Katrina, I know what I'm doing.

266
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,448
And Jessica knows what she's doing,
which is playing you for a fool.

267
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,649
Harvey, I was just gonna call you.

268
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,730
I'll save you the trouble. We're bringing
Louis Litt back to the firm.

269
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,966
That doesn't matter.

270
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,129
Because that call was to tell you
I'm hiring him and you owe me.

271
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,810
Flaw

272
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,048
- You calling me a liar?
- I'm not calling you anything,

273
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,606
but you are calling
Sylvia out there a liar.

274
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,802
Oh, no, no.
Sylvia wouldn't tell you shit.

275
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,048
Wrong. One compliment
about her hair

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,602
and she told me you gave Louis
the bad news an hour ago.

277
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,245
See you around, Robert.

278
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,727
Harvey, uh, one more thing.

279
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,770
- You do still owe me that favor.
- What kind of math are you doing?

280
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,766
The kind of math that says Jessica
Pearson hiring Louis Litt back

281
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,809
- adds up to shady.
- If that's all you've got,

282
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,287
you can collect your favor when
the clock strikes kiss my ass,

283
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,721
because partners leave firms
and come back all the time.

284
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,968
Maybe, but they don't come back
with their name on the wall.

285
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,850
Oh. I'm guessing he wasn't
supposed to tell me that.

286
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,965
But he did. And Louis Litt
is not name partner material,

287
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,809
which means he must
have something on you.

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,526
So, unless you want
me going around town

289
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,405
flapping my big mouth that something
isn't right in your kitchen,

290
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,410
you're going to make
good on that favor.

291
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,284
Sylvia didn't slip up at all, did she?

292
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,290
No, she didn't.
You have your girl Friday, I have mine.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,404
But you can still tell her how nice
her hair looks on the way out.

294
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,885
I'll be in touch.

295
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,248
Oh, you tapping out already?

296
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,930
I thought you'd have a lot
more backbone than that.

297
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,804
I'm not tapping out.

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,121
I finished all of the work.

299
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,844
Which I expected
to be done an hour ago.

300
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,042
Come on, Louis, you didn't
expect it to be done at all.

301
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,606
- Just like you didn't expect this.
- What the hell's that?

302
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,165
It's a gift certificate.

303
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,850
What, are you trying
to bribe me now?

304
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,122
It's not a bribe, it's a reminder.

305
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,811
Look, the gift certificate
is for Peter's Steak House.

306
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,809
The place that you and I saved.
Together.

307
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,288
And after we saved it, you told me
that we had something in common.

308
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,811
- Yeah, I don't give a shit.
- Yes, you do.

309
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,289
Because what we had in common
was a love of the law.

310
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,008
You told me that when you asked me
to be your associate, Louis,

311
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,849
and I am still the same person.

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,802
And if I found out a woman

313
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,843
that I had something in common with
was actually a man,

314
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,927
I wouldn't keep seeing her.

315
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,441
Okay. What I did is not at all
the same thing.

316
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,841
No, it's worse.

317
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,882
You say you love the law so much,

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,890
but every single case you've ever
touched is tainted.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,082
So, you get exposed,
Peter's gets bulldozed.

320
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,123
It wouldn't even be there
to get bulldozed

321
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,844
if you and I hadn't worked together.

322
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,610
All right, genius.
You want to work together?

323
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,007
You love the law so much?

324
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,282
You're going to memorize every case
that I've ever done.

325
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,531
- (STAMMERING) Louis.
- No, get to work

326
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,449
and use that magnificent
memory of yours

327
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,166
for something more than bullshitting
your way through life.

328
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,810
- We have a problem.
- Unless it's urgent, I don't have the time.

329
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Louis is telling people.

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,162
- What people?
- For starters, Robert Zane.

331
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,884
Why the hell is Louis even
talking to Robert Zane?

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,162
I asked him to hire Louis
after we took back VersaLife.

333
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,248
And you didn't think to tell me that
after last night?

334
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,282
I was handling it.

335
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,408
From what I can tell,
you handled it like shit.

336
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,568
- So, this is my fault?
- Well, it sure as hell isn't mine.

337
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,842
You know what, Jessica?
I'm not the one who wanted to fire Louis,

338
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,769
and I'm not the one
who wanted to deny him clients.

339
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,531
I did that because of
his performance as an attorney.

340
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,644
You antagonized him for years
for your own pleasure.

341
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,809
Tell yourself whatever you want.
You handed out your share of abuse.

342
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,570
Tell yourself whatever you want.

343
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,808
You're the one who hired a fraud
and gave Louis leverage.

344
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,645
And I told you Louis would get worse
and you said I had to take it.

345
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,205
Well, I don't care whose fault it is.

346
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,288
He is getting worse
and I'm not going to take it.

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,405
Oh, yes, you are.

348
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,763
You're going to take it and you're going
to do it with a smile on your face

349
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
until I say otherwise.

350
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,248
And what the hell
are you going to do?

351
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,250
I'm going to clean up this mess,
once and for all.

352
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,561
What do you mean you don't have
diamond encrusted business cards?

353
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,523
Fine. What about
the embossed ivory?

354
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,802
Okay, great. Well, how much would
10,000 of those run me?

355
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,809
Money is no object.

356
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,524
What, are you crazy?
I'm not paying that much.

357
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,846
Unless it comes with a reach around.

358
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,803
Which, by the way,
I'm still not paying that much.

359
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,888
Elite Printing, my ass.

360
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,483
I gave you one simple instruction

361
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,206
to keep your mouth shut,
and you couldn't even do that.

362
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,605
Um, okay. Did you make
an appointment with Norma?

363
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,921
- What?
- To see me.

364
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,486
Did you check
with my secretary, Norma?

365
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,807
Cut the shit, Louis.
I'm not in the mood.

366
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,048
Well, get in the mood.
Because I hold all the cards.

367
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,083
And those cards are getting you
your name on the wall,

368
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,964
but you need to keep this to yourself.

369
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,889
Why? So you can figure
out a way to screw me?

370
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
I gave you my word.

371
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,450
Well, no disrespect, Jessica,
but your word means shit.

372
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,130
So, if you want me
to stop telling people,

373
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,567
you better start telling
people yourself.

374
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,365
I told you, in good time.

375
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,643
And I just told you I don't give a shit.

376
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,445
So, I suggest you call a meeting
with the senior partners.

377
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,927
- Those meetings are on Thursdays.
- Well, consider today Thursday.

378
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,691
I told you, I have yet
to figure out how to sell it.

379
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,648
You want to sell it?
I'll tell you how to sell it.

380
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,325
You and Harvey do it together,

381
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,364
you do it like you mean it,
and you do it now.

382
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,005
Got it? Good.

383
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,203
JESSICA: I'm sure
you've all heard rumors

384
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,731
about why we called this meeting.

385
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,730
But that's because it's hard
to keep good news quiet.

386
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,808
We'll be making this
official later this week,

387
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,403
but we are here to announce
our newest name partner,

388
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,806
Louis Litt.

389
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,524
(APPLAUDING)

390
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,681
Thank you, Jessica.

391
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,887
Harvey.

392
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,920
Some of you may be wondering
how this happened.

393
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,410
There's a simple explanation,

394
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,683
and all it requires
is for me to admit something.

395
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,251
I made a mistake.

396
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,969
I never should have
accepted Louis' resignation.

397
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,641
Because not only is he a billing machine
and a damn good attorney,

398
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,366
he has personally gotten me
out of more than one jam.

399
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,042
And there's no one I'd rather have my
name next to than my friend, Louis Litt.

400
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,320
Thank you, Harvey.

401
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,727
Um, even though it's not official,

402
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,684
I already feel like my name's been up
there as long as yours. (CHUCKLES)

403
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:17,491
And I, um, definitely feel like it's going
to be up there for a long, long time.

404
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,847
HARVEY: A lot of good that did.

405
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,645
Leave it to Louis to take
his big moment like a dick.

406
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,966
- Harvey, calm down.
- Calm down?

407
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,844
I just did exactly what he wanted

408
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,883
and he acted like a dick
and he's not going to stop.

409
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,082
He's not going to stop
because you didn't do what he wanted.

410
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,931
What? Jessica,
I just got up there and kissed his ass

411
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,771
in front of the entire partnership
and pretended to like it.

412
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,928
Exactly. Pretended.

413
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,361
Oh. You want me to actually like it?

414
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,767
- I want you to make him feel accepted.
- Jessica...

415
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,406
Harvey, what Louis wants
is to be accepted.

416
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,330
And like it or not, the person he wants
that from the most is you.

417
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,010
So, you are going to go to him,
you're gonna make nice

418
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,168
and that is how we're going
to put all of this to bed.

419
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,809
You want to tell me
what the hell that was?

420
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,050
Okay. If you'll excuse me, I'm going
to let Jessica handle this conversation.

421
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,764
I have to go kill myself.

422
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,325
- Jeff, I can't do this right now.
- Should I make an appointment?

423
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,925
Because the partners may have bought

424
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,042
that fairy tale about
Louis' triumphant return,

425
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,128
- but they don't know what I know.
- What exactly is that?

426
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,322
That Louis committed a crime,

427
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,843
and then he resigned five seconds
before you were about to fire him.

428
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,760
And now, he's not only back,
he's name partner.

429
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,769
I reconsidered.

430
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,882
Which, as managing partner,
I am entitled to do.

431
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,486
And as someone with a brain,

432
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,127
I'm entitled to come to the conclusion
that Louis has something on you.

433
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,043
Jeff, you said you didn't
want me to lie to you anymore.

434
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,969
And I'm trying like hell not to.

435
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,206
And that's the same thing as lying to me.

436
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,290
- No, it's not.
- Oh, you are one hell of a lawyer.

437
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,880
So are you.
Which is why you're here.

438
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,809
So, I'll come clean.

439
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,491
I can't tell you
the truth about this,

440
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,002
and that's as honest
as I can be with you right now.

441
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,161
Can you handle that?

442
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,888
I can handle it for now.

443
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,445
But I won't handle it forever.

444
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,086
Louis, what are you doing here?

445
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,407
I noticed you haven't
congratulated me yet.

446
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,761
So, I wanted to give you
a chance to make up for it.

447
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,281
Right. Congratulations, we're all so
happy for you. Is that what you wanted?

448
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,325
- Seemed a little disingenuous.
- Then, let me be clear.

449
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,441
I don't mean a word of it.

450
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,204
You really want to talk that
way to the new name partner?

451
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,924
I'm talking to you that way

452
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,008
because you threatened
to throw the man that I love in jail

453
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,690
to become that name partner.

454
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,531
So, you know what, Louis?
I'm sorry that I didn't bake you a cake.

455
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,008
That's too bad.
You didn't do anything for me,

456
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,566
but I got something for you.
Doc review.

457
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,763
Filings to be done in triplicate.
Paralegal work,

458
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,882
since you like doing it so much.

459
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,089
You know I don't like
doing it at all.

460
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,964
You helped your boyfriend
with his work.

461
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,206
You didn't think I'd figure that out?

462
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,041
You know what? I don't care.
You have no authority over me.

463
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,605
I'm Harvey's associate.

464
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,162
Yeah, but I run the associates.
Therefore, I run you.

465
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,442
- I know what you're doing.
- But do you know what you're doing?

466
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,564
Not only do you live with a fraud,
you're just like him.

467
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,011
Pretending to be a lawyer
when you're not.

468
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,122
I'm not pretending to be anything.
I am in law school.

469
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,605
Are you really going to make it through?

470
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,803
You could barely handle the LSATs.
You couldn't get into Harvard.

471
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,002
As a matter of fact,
your boyfriend may be a fraud,

472
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,770
but he's a better lawyer
than you'll ever be.

473
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,526
You have no idea what kind
of lawyer I'm going to be.

474
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,005
Don't I?

475
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,050
You learn from the best
liars around, Rachel.

476
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,650
Harvey.

477
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,524
[RUE

478
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,926
Your father.

479
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,848
Yeah. I know exactly the kind of lawyer
you're going to be.

480
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,887
But until that day,
this kind of work is all you're good for.

481
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,010
(LAUGHING) So, you like
marinated meat, right?

482
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,770
(LAUGHS) Oh, yum.

483
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,609
Okay, wait.
But which one do you make?

484
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,963
- Kansas City or Memphis style?
- Oh, hell. When it comes to ribs,

485
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,971
- I make them every which way I can.
- I am now officially starving.

486
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,285
- Harvey.
- Please, have a seat.

487
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,767
Don't let my law firm
get in the way of your coffee klatch.

488
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,211
Oh, now, now,
don't blame Donna here.

489
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,243
I told her you and I had
some unfinished business.

490
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,001
Already. What, did you pick something
out of your generic favor file?

491
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,044
I've never done anything
generic in my life.

492
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,891
This favor is tailor-made for you.

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,082
It's very specific and very personal.

494
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,521
We're in a little dispute
with another firm.

495
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,091
I need you to get them
to back off of it.

496
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,281
Why can't you do it yourself?

497
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,846
Because I don't know the lawyer
on the other side. You do.

498
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,291
Good luck.

499
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,645
- What the hell is he talking about?
- It's Scottie.

500
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,205
- Oh, shit.
- I know.

501
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,330
Scottie doesn't do favors like this
and I don't have any leverage on her.

502
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,204
Yeah, you do.

503
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,049
You're just not going
to like using it.

504
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,848
Hey, there you are. Look, I just finished
memorizing all of Louis' cases.

505
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,604
I had an idea I want to run by...

506
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,684
- Rachel, what happened?
- Nothing happened.

507
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,529
What did Louis do?

508
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,689
It's nothing.
Um, he found out that I helped you

509
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,167
and now he's giving me
paralegal work and I was

510
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,691
a little upset, but now I'm okay.

511
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,564
You weren't just a little upset.
You were crying.

512
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,205
And a little paralegal work
wouldn't do that.

513
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,164
It is not important. And you know what?
I had it coming.

514
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,691
You had it coming?
What are you talking... Rachel...

515
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,962
Mike, I was the one that told you
to make up with him.

516
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,491
- I helped you with the work. And you...
- What did he do?

517
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,807
And you know what, like I lied to him
just as much as you.

518
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,365
What did he do?

519
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,451
It's not what he did,
it's what he said.

520
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,121
What did he say?

521
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,050
Mike, I'm a big girl.
And I can take care of Louis.

522
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,686
This isn't about you.
This is about me and him.

523
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,007
And I'm going to make
him remember that.

524
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,322
You piece of shit. You said
this was between me and you.

525
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,282
It is between me and you.

526
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,210
No, it stopped being between me
and you the second you went to Rachel.

527
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,561
You put her between us the second
you went to her to help you.

528
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,685
God, are you insane? Rachel has never
been anything but kind to you.

529
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,962
I can't even count the amount of times
that she defended you.

530
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,003
And now she tries
to help me just a little bit,

531
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,610
and you rip her to pieces.

532
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,371
No. That's not the help
I'm talking about, fraud.

533
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,164
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

534
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,965
You went to her to help you
lie to me about who you are.

535
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,691
And like the good little lackey that she is,

536
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,769
she came to me and lied to my face.

537
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,769
She did it to protect me, Louis.

538
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,524
Well, good for you.
But when I found out about it,

539
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,722
I felt like shit for the 180th time.

540
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,804
So, I just went to her
and did the same thing. (SIGHS)

541
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,283
You know, Louis, I've just been
memorizing all of your old arguments.

542
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,370
I was actually going to
try and come in here

543
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,841
and use one of them to change
your mind about me.

544
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,769
- Well, it won't work.
- Oh, I know.

545
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,930
Because while I am the same person
that I was before,

546
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,326
you're not.

547
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,726
You're right.

548
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,009
I'm not the same person.

549
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,131
I used to be a man of my word,

550
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,210
but you people taught me that
doesn't mean a thing. So...

551
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,847
When I told you it was
between me and you, I lied.

552
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,525
I found your weak spot.

553
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,322
And you know what I'm going to do?

554
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,411
I'm going to keep hammering on her
until you break.

555
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,721
Jessica.

556
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,887
Please, if it can wait, I've had a long day
and I need to go home.

557
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,365
Too bad. You're staying here

558
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,211
and drafting Louis Litt's
new partnership agreement.

559
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,923
- So, you're piling on, too, now.
- I'm not piling on.

560
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,845
I am giving you
this because it's non-billable work.

561
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,731
And the only reason
it exists is because of you.

562
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,890
This again. Ha.

563
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,849
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

564
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,410
I've seen this movie before.

565
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,488
And the reason it keeps rerunning

566
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,483
is because every time
I think I'm done with you,

567
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,008
you and your dirty little secret
rear your ugly heads.

568
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,167
You know what, Jessica?

569
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,921
I have had it up to here with you saying
that this is my dirty little secret.

570
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,441
You could have fired me
when you found out, and you didn't.

571
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,562
No, you decided
to keep me around

572
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,762
because you were more concerned
with beating Daniel Hardman

573
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,927
and keeping your power.

574
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,930
And then, you kept me around
because you didn't want to lose Harvey.

575
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,327
And then, you wanted to use
my secret to beat Harvey

576
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,442
and then again
and again and again.

577
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,483
So, please, Jessica,
why don't you tell me

578
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,002
when the hell does this become
your dirty little secret?

579
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,330
This seat taken?

580
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,881
Hi.

581
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,801
Hey.

582
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,771
Since your message was so cryptic,
I'm assuming this is about business?

583
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,641
I need a favor.

584
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,324
Hey, Scottie.

585
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,841
How are you?
How have you been since you left?

586
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,282
I heard that you took some time off.
Where did you land?

587
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,926
I need you to settle your case
against Robert Zane.

588
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,566
- And why would I do that?
- Because I owe him one.

589
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,366
Harvey, I'm just getting back
on my feet at a new firm.

590
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,289
This case is winnable.

591
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,688
The firm knows that it is
because I told them it is.

592
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,881
I settle, I look like shit.

593
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,570
I know that. But you came to me once

594
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,603
to take it easy on you
with Folsom Foods.

595
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,802
Because you said if I was
ever in trouble personally...

596
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,410
I am in trouble personally.

597
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,249
What the hell is personal
about Robert Zane?

598
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,640
You don't do this for me,

599
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,161
Zane's going to put it
together about Mike Ross.

600
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,849
You selfish son of a bitch.
You said you told me that

601
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,571
because you didn't want to keep lying
to the people you love.

602
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,886
- I didn't want to...
- And now you come to me

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,401
trading on the fact that I know
how to get you out of a jam

604
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,443
for doing something stupid and selfish

605
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,449
that drove a wedge between us
before we ever even had a chance.

606
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,166
- I told you the truth.
- After it was too late.

607
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,248
- Scottie...
- I loved you!

608
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,881
I loved you.

609
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,287
And you let some stupid secret
that I would never tell anyone

610
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,721
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

611
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,203
You're right, Scottie.
I don't have a leg to stand on.

612
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,763
But if you don't do this for me,
I am in trouble.

613
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,885
I'm going to recommend
we settle with Robert Zane.

614
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,082
- Thank you.
- But to be clear,

615
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,521
you get to ask me this once.

616
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,125
And I never want to hear
the name Mike Ross again.

617
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,685
- Scottie...
- Once.

618
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,969
You wanted it to be official.
There it is, Louis. It's official.

619
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,171
So, that's it.

620
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,368
People are just going to walk in here
tomorrow morning

621
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
like it's any other day
and see it or maybe not see it?

622
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,491
What were you expecting?

623
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,967
A ceremony and a brass band?
We don't do that.

624
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,651
Well, I'm name partner,
and I say we do now.

625
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,049
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

626
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,243
I want pomp and circumstance
in the fonn of an unveiling.

627
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,765
I'm going home, Louis.

628
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,282
I'm not spending the rest of the night
emailing invitations to an unveiling.

629
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,244
You're going home.
Well, then, I'll send them out myself.

630
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,930
Because tomorrow,

631
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,281
this is happening. 4:00 p.m. sharp.

632
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,846
- I have a meeting at 4:00.
- Then reschedule it.

633
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,408
You don't want me to reschedule.

634
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,888
What you want is to know
that you've earned that.

635
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,491
I have earned it.

636
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,684
But I want you to know it.

637
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,081
Okay, here it is.
You got your name up there

638
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,282
by finding leverage
and using it to strong-ann me

639
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,368
into doing something
that I never would have done.

640
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,642
- See? I knew...
- Let me finish.

641
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,888
It was a stone cold move.

642
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,649
And it's exactly what
Harvey would have done.

643
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,686
Now, if that doesn't tell you that you've
earned it, then I don't know what will.

644
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,483
You still want me to reschedule
my meeting?

645
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,487
Yes, I do.

646
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,280
Fine. I'll be there.

647
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,486
You and Harvey.

648
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,403
Of course, Louis.
We're your partners.

649
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,567
Jesus, you look like shit.
What's going on?

650
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,803
Between drafting Louis' partnership
agreement for Jessica

651
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,891
and Louis' never-ending onslaught,
I didn't get any sleep.

652
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,525
Well, splash some water on your face,

653
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,130
'cause we have to go
to his debutante ball

654
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,811
- and look like we give a shit.
- No. I'm not going.

655
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,491
What do you mean, you're not going?
Now is not the time to poke the bear.

656
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,204
It's too late. The bear is an asshole

657
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,442
and he's not just
taking it out on me anymore.

658
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,800
- He's taking it out on Rachel.
- What?

659
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,764
Yeah, he made it clear that he found
the weak spot that's going to get to me.

660
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,850
And he's going to keep pressing it and
pressing it until I can't take it anymore.

661
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,644
Mike, you are not ringing that bell.

662
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,649
You're damn right
I'm not ringing that bell.

663
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,888
But if I have to go raise a glass
to that son of a bitch,

664
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,566
I'm going to end up
smashing it over his head.

665
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,361
Come with me.

666
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,809
- What are you going to do?
- Enough is enough.

667
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,126
Harvey. You're just in time.

668
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,810
Jessica's on her way down
with the partnership agreement.

669
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,921
Are you here to be my witness?

670
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,088
He's here to keep me
from ripping your face off.

671
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,929
Oh, I see. Now that big brother's here,
you're just going to...

672
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,451
HARVEY: Okay, that's enough.

673
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,484
Louis, you got everything you wanted
and you are done taking it out on him.

674
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,080
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not letting him quit.

675
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,281
Then, I'll just fire him.

676
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,721
- You can't.
- I can and I will.

677
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,003
Because Jessica would rather he be fired
than you all go to jail.

678
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,050
- No one's going to jail.
- See? She knows what's what.

679
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,730
I sign the agreement, he's done,

680
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,043
and then I hire Katrina
back as my associate.

681
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,925
- And that's not going to happen.
- What are you talking about?

682
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,805
Louis, I'm afraid you've made your last
dictate to me as name partner.

683
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,884
I'm not going to let you
take this away from me.

684
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,525
I'm not taking anything
away from you.

685
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,450
You are still name partner,
right after you sign this.

686
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,850
I added a little something extra
after you finished drafting it.

687
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,167
This says I'm co-conspirator
to hiring a fraud.

688
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,122
JESSICA: You are.

689
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,483
You became one the second you used
him to get your name on the door.

690
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,843
I know I'm not a real lawyer,
but that sounds like he is to me.

691
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,008
I am a real lawyer. He is.

692
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,883
- I'm not signing it.
- JESSICA: Louis, here's the thing.

693
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,968
I told you not to tell anybody about this.

694
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,646
And then you went and
you shouted it to Robert Zane.

695
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,171
And then, you made me
tell the partners.

696
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,726
And the capper is
there are about 100 people

697
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,923
waiting to greet you after
the unveiling you arranged,

698
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,010
which won't happen
if you don't sign that.

699
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,484
I can still go to the police.

700
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,285
Yeah, you could, but you won't.

701
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,121
Because you used that little secret
to get where you are right now.

702
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,610
It was the only bullet in your chamber,
and I am taking your gun away.

703
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,569
- You set me up.
- You set yourself up.

704
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,569
Just like you did
with Charles Forstman.

705
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,684
And what I learned from him, was once
you get something that you want,

706
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,565
you will do whatever
it takes to keep it.

707
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,369
So, why don't you go ahead and sign

708
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,723
so that we can get out
to your goddamn party?

709
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,171
JESSICA: You know what's funny?

710
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,762
We've never had a ceremony
when we've changed names before.

711
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,771
But Louis Litt had the audacity
to convene us all here today.

712
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,484
And as it turns out,

713
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,363
his first decision
as name partner is brilliant.

714
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Because a ceremony like this

715
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,962
gives us the chance to reevaluate where
we've been and where we're going.

716
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,129
Perhaps you had
a disagreement with a colleague

717
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,801
or there's some other issue
that's been on your mind.

718
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,646
The point is, with a new name
comes a new beginning.

719
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,011
For me, I'm hoping we can see this
as a chance to wipe the slate clean.

720
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,970
With that said,
here's to our newest name partner,

721
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,650
Louis Litt.

722
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,250
(APPLAUDING)

723
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,844
- Nice speech.
- Let's hope it takes.

724
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,043
It's got a better chance of taking now
that you made him sign the agreement.

725
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,009
That it does.

726
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,283
Speaking of which, when exactly did you
know you were going to do that?

727
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,291
Oh, um... About 15 seconds
after Donna told me he knew.

728
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,289
And you didn't feel the need
to bring me in on that plan?

729
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,641
- I felt the exact opposite.
- What are you talking about?

730
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,967
Harvey, Louis wanted to see you suffer.

731
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,889
If I had told you,
you would have had to fake it.

732
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,482
- And you're a shitty actor.
- Excuse me, but I can act.

733
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,682
No, everybody thinks they can act.

734
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,041
The fact of the matter is,
you're just a pretty face.

735
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,844
Oh? You think I'm pretty?

736
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,689
Pretty stupid.

737
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,921
(INDISTINCT)

738
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,841
I can't believe
it's actually up there.

739
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,931
This firm has changed
names more than Prince.

740
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,081
Who?

741
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,683
You're kidding, right?

742
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,646
Purple Rain.

743
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,727
Raspberry Beret.

744
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,086
I'm kidding.

745
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,201
(LAUGHS)

746
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,891
I almost had to re-evaluate
our entire relationship.

747
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,607
Mmm-hmm. After you were going to go
and beat Louis up for me?

748
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,966
I doubt that.

749
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,480
Mike. Thank you.

750
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,849
Hey, it just seemed right.

751
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,042
- After all, you stood up to Louis for me.
- Mmm-hmm.

752
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,164
And I almost got pummeled for it.

753
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,242
That took guts.
And that's why I love you.

754
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,450
I love you, too.

755
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,361
I wanted to tell you that you were right.

756
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,280
I started this whole thing by hiring Mike.
It's my fault.

757
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,925
Thank you.

758
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,162
But I've been on board long enough.

759
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,966
And it's time I accepted the fact
that it's my secret, too.

760
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,564
So, where do we go from here?

761
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,768
We fight like hell to protect it.

762
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,927
No cake.

763
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,887
What are you doing here, Jessica?

764
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,400
I know you're tired of
waiting for an explanation.

765
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,488
So, I'm here to give you one.

766
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,921
You've given me explanations before.

767
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,046
I want the truth.

768
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,282
Are you ready for the truth?
Because it's not pretty.

769
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,483
There's only one way to find out.

770
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,209
It seems like forever ago,
but it wasn't that long ago at all.

771
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,410
Daniel Hardman embezzled money
from the firm and I covered it up.

772
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,489
Now, make no mistake,

773
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,728
I found out about it,
I confronted him,

774
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,889
and I eventually
made him pay it all back.

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,802
But I did cover it up
from the partners,

776
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,651
from the police, from everyone.

777
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,440
I even adjusted
our books to hide the crime.

778
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,922
And being a bloodhound about
these things, Louis found out

779
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,004
and used it as
leverage to come back.

780
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,885
As name partner?

781
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,801
As name partner.

782
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,685
Why couldn't you
trust me with this before?

783
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,371
Because I didn't know
how you'd react.

784
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,522
And I didn't want
to risk losing

785
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,443
everything I had.

786
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,681
(SIGHS)

787
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,887
Jessica,

788
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,048
your secret is safe with me.

789
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,962
- You're late.
- But I come bearing gifts.

790
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,560
Uh-huh. That doesn't look like cannoli.

791
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,650
It's better than cannoli, Dad.
It's the resume of your new associate.

792
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,761
If this is Harvey's way of trying to

793
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,006
make up for the fact
that I didn't hire Louis...

794
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,361
This isn't from Harvey.
It's from me.

795
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,441
And you're going to do this for me.
And I am not going to owe you a thing.

796
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,961
This is what
they're teaching you at Columbia?

797
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,851
- Because that's not how favors work.
- I know how favors work.

798
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,287
You do this and then you want
something from me someday.

799
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,529
But by then, you're going
to understand that right now,

800
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,166
I'm the one doing you a favor.

801
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,602
Because Katrina Bennett
is an amazing lawyer.

802
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,611
I was wrong about you.
You're not like your mother.

803
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,564
You're like your father.

804
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,088
(IN RASPY VOICE)
Come on.

805
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,645
- Oh, that's good.
- That was a good one. (LAUGHING)

806
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,843
That was a good one.
Sounds just like me, baby girl.

807
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,849
I had you fooled, huh?

808
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,803
You did. I can't stand...

809
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,604
Now, let me show you
how a lawyer cooks.

810
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,009
- LOUIS: What do you want?
- I just thought you'd want this.

811
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,610
The associates saved it for you.

812
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,324
No, they didn't.
You saved it for me.

813
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,090
Because you want to pretend
to be my friend again.

814
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,884
Louis, didn't you hear
Jessica's speech?

815
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,764
This is our chance
to wipe the slate clean.

816
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,211
I did hear her speech.

817
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,403
And I know that she sent
you here to say that to me.

818
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,330
No one sent me here.
I'm here because I want to be here.

819
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,363
You see? That's sweet.

820
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,808
But how can I ever
believe a word you say?

821
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,645
I want to know if
you ever thought once

822
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,523
to tell me the truth about Mike.

823
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,409
No, I didn't.

824
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,602
Of course you didn't.
Because we're not friends.

825
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,484
You're wrong. We are friends,

826
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,729
but my professional loyalty
to Harvey comes above that.

827
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,524
Which is why I never told anyone.

828
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,610
Jessica, Rachel, anyone.

829
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,365
So, put yourself in my position
and ask yourself,

830
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,005
"What would you have done?"

831
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,451
I want you to tell me
something else.

832
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,364
(SCOFFS) Yes. Anything.

833
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,409
- Did you ever sleep with Harvey?
- Wait. What?

834
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,248
It's not a professional question.
It's a personal question.

835
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,528
Can you put our so-called
"friendship" high enough

836
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,005
to answer that one honestly?

837
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,922
Louis...

838
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,644
Because it's the only thing I can think of

839
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,843
to know if I can even
begin to trust you again.

840
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,041
Once.

841
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,683
That's my way of wiping
the slate clean.

842
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,723
You can accept it or not.
