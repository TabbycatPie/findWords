I don't believe you.

我認為道格·斯坦普殺了佐伊·巴恩斯

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,040
但我知道真相
But I know the real story.

44
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,610
她叫羅謝爾
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.

45
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,390
救命  救命
Help. Help.

湯姆
Tom.

47
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,020
我需要你的服務
I need your services.

48
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,870
我要向委員會和全國人民宣布
I am announcing to this committee and to the nation

49
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,050
明晚6點起

我將辭去美國總統一職
I shall resign the office of President of the United States.

羅梅洛議員
Oh, Congressman Romero,

52
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,810
我只是想走前最后看你一眼
I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.

53
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,630
我覺得沒什么好說的了
I don't believe there's anything left to be said.

54
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,400
我倆確實無話可說了
No, not between us. Not any longer.

55
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,250
我只是想謝謝
I just wanted to thank you for...

56
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,160
你的韌勁
your tenacity.

57
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,380
無論你想干什么  你都無法逍遙法外
Whatever you're up to, you won't get away with it.

58
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
也許我已經做到了
Maybe I already have.

59
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,720
委員會將繼續工作
The committee will continue its work.

60
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,760
我們會建議司法部提出起訴
We'll recommend charges to DOJ.

羅謝爾
Rochelle.

62
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,720
羅謝爾
Rochelle.

63
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,170
多美的名字
Such a lovely name.

64
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,050
告訴我你有多么不想那名字上新聞
Tell me how much you don't want that to end up in the press.

65
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,590
然后解散這個委員會
And then shut this committee down.

66
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,810
你得無條件聽我的
No deals.

67
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,400
總統先生  總統先生
Mr. President! Mr. President!

68
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,850
你怎么能這樣
How could you?

69
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,280
-你怎么能不提前告訴我  -為了保護你
- How could you not warn me? - To protect you.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,850
-我是要保護你  -你別碰我
- I was protecting you. - You should take your hands off me.

71
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,810
如果你覺得措手不及  我理解
No, look, I understand if you feel broadsided.

72
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,400
-我不在意什么感覺  弗蘭西斯  -但聽我說
- I don't care about feelings, Francis. - But listen to me...

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480
克萊爾  聽我說
Look, Claire, listen to me.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,360
你讓我把丑出盡了
You made me look absolutely ridiculous.

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,790
-毫無準備  稀里糊涂  -不  克萊爾
- Ill-prepared and ignorant. - No! Claire.

76
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,220
-我們有一條規則  弗蘭西斯  -不
- We have one rule, Francis. - No,

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,920
-一條  -現在沒了
- One rule.  - not anymore. Not anymore.

78
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,960
-沒了  -如果我不知道你的想法
- We don't. - I cannot be your ally

79
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,490
就無法當你的盟友
if I don't know what you're thinking.

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,030
克萊爾  事情本會鬧個沒完
Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.

81
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,540
好吧  就算阻止了司法委員會
All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary,

82
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,720
其他委員會也會冒出來
but other committees would have sprung up,

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,330
一直指控我們
just to keep the charges going.

84
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,960
監管  軍事  外事  情報等等委員會
Oversight, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,050
事情會沒完沒了的
It would have gone on and on.

86
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,350
-年復一年的  -我不管  弗蘭西斯
- Years and - I don't care, Francis.

87
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,210
-調查  -你該跟我說的
- years of investigation. - You should have talked to me,

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,650
而不是像這樣臨時決定
instead of making a last-minute decision like this.

89
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,830
我沒有
I didn't.

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,340
我制造了這混亂  好利用它
I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.

91
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,730
所有事情都是計劃好的
Everything that has happened... was planned.

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,490
何時開始的
Since when?

93
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,030
去極樂之地前
Since before Elysian Fields.

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,450
但我是在極樂之地猛然領悟到
But it was at Elysian Fields that it hit me.

95
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,720
我明白了
I saw it...

96
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,440
就像頭頂上的燈泡亮了起來
almost like a light bulb going off above my head.

97
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,790
真正的權力在何處
Where does the real power lie?

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,640
就是權力背后的權力
The power behind the power.

99
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,920
克萊爾  我明白了
And I understood, Claire,

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,570
我們不能像過去那樣思考行動
that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.

101
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,370
因為關鍵已經不在于誰住在白宮
Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House...

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,570
而在于誰擁有白宮
it's about who owns the White House.

103
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,340
這可是總統一職  政客還能爬多高
This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,960
真正的權力不在這兒
The real power isn't here.

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,770
而在之外
It's beyond here.

106
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,010
超越了它  但仍要與之配合工作
It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,990
克萊爾  你我一直都在圈內
Look, Claire, you and I have always been on the inside.

108
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,670
被困在泡泡里
Trapped. In the bubble.

109
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,750
但從今往后
But going forward...

110
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,360
我在私營部門經營圈外
with my operating on the outside, in the private sector,

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,780
你在這里工作
and you working from here...

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,100
我們能一起擁有白宮
we can own this house together.

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
你不明白嗎  這是我計劃好的
Don't you see? I've designed this.

114
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,760
我想讓你當總統
I wanted you to be the president.

115
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,770
我讓你成為了總統
I've made you the president.

116
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,020
我該向你道謝嗎
Am I supposed to say thank you?

117
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,380
不
No.

118
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,370
但你得赦免我  赦免我所有的罪行
But you will have to pardon me. Pardon me for all of my crimes.

119
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
作為總統  只有你才能這么做
As the president, you're the only one who can.

120
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,840
弗蘭西斯  如果我這么做會被彈劾
Francis, I could be impeached if I do that.

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,790
不會的  戴維斯和厄舍
No, no. Look, Davis and Usher,

122
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,890
他們可以保護你
they're in a position to protect you.

123
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,250
-他們希望你成功  -世事難料  弗蘭西斯
- They want you to succeed. - We can be sure of nothing, Francis.

124
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,680
道格的事
Everything going on with Doug,

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,690
白宮還有泄密者
the leak still in the White House...

126
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,380
不  那也是我
No, that was me, too.

127
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,670
-什么  -我就是泄密者
- What? - I'm the leak.

128
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
這幾個月我一直在道格的幫助下
I've been feeding information to Tom Hammerschmidt

129
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,660
給湯姆·漢默施密特放料
for months with Doug's help.

130
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,550
這沒道理  弗蘭西斯
That doesn't make any sense, Francis.

131
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,610
克萊爾  如果你在別人之前扳倒自己
Claire, when you bring yourself down before someone else can,

132
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,940
你就能控制這個過程了
you control the way it happens.

133
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,890
只有這條路才能讓我們來到此刻
This was the only path to get us to this moment

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,140
你和我  能夠擁有一切
where you and I can own it all.

135
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,610
撤掉監控
Get rid of the surveillance.

136
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,090
抹除一切  停掉一切  你跟道格做的一切
Erase it. Shut everything down. Anything you and Doug were up to.

137
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,750
好  但是你得先赦免我
All right. But you have to pardon me first.

138
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,100
等時機合適  還要赦免道格
And, at the right time, Doug.

139
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,360
否則我們可能都要進監獄
Or we could both go to prison.

140
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,800
我殺了湯姆
I killed Tom.

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,930
我殺了湯姆·耶茨  他死了
I killed Tom Yates. He's dead.

142
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,360
我讓馬克處理掉了
And I had Mark clean it up.

143
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,590
所以這永遠不會追查到我們
So it will never make its way back to us.

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,090
那我們都做了必須做的事
Well, then I guess we both did what we had to.

145
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,890
-你知道他要做這事嗎  -不知道
- Did you know he was gonna do this? - No.

146
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,700
因為這很不好  克萊爾  這非常不好
Because this is bad, Claire. This is very... very bad.

147
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,940
天哪
My God!

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
你們兩個怎么回事
What is it with you two?

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,690
-如果你在想什么  說...  -在我家里
- If there's something on your mind, say... - In my house?

150
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,440
你把他留在我家里了
You left him in my house?!

151
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,760
小聲點  至少改變你的語氣
Lower your voice, or at least change your tone.

152
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,960
你處理好了嗎
Did you take care of it?

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
是的  那是我的工作
Yes, that's what I do.

154
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,520
那謝謝你  做得好
Then thank you, and well done.

155
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,750
現在我們回到眼前的事
Now let's get back to what's in front of us.

156
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,200
他想讓你待在這里嗎  克萊爾
Does he even want you to be here, Claire?

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,290
馬克  拜托  我現在需要的是你的政治盤算
Mark, please. What I need right now is your political calculus.

158
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,370
他將你和我們所有人置于了為難的境地
He has put you, he has put all of us, in an impossible position.

159
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,220
你明白嗎
You see that?

160
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,420
如果你不能正確處理這件事  就無法恢復了
If you don't handle this correctly, you do not recover from it.

161
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,520
這事關政府的持續運作
This is about continuity of government.

162
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,630
通知北約  通知各國領導人
Informing NATO, informing world leaders.

163
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,010
我們本該讓大使們待命的
We should have had ambassadors on call.

164
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,030
參謀長聯席會議  國家安全...
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security...

165
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,740
連尼克松都那樣做了
Even Nixon did that!

166
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,430
我準備好上交了
I'm ready to hand it over,

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
但是我要得到保證  不管怎樣
but I want to be assured that no matter what,

168
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,170
麥卡倫之死不會牽連到我
Macallan's death is not related to me.

169
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,850
這可以辦到
That can be taken care of.

170
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,110
-我要你手上我的東西  -好
- I want what you have of mine. - Okay.

171
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,540
會給你的
That's what you'll get.

172
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,820
我還要當幕僚長
And I want to be Chief of Staff.

173
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,260
我覺得這不是問題
Well, I don't think that's a problem.

174
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,510
很高興你在提要求
I'm glad you're asking for what you want.

175
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,570
道格·斯坦普會為總統做任何事
Doug Stamper would do anything for the president.

176
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,010
他看到了佐伊·巴恩斯的威脅
He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes,

177
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,020
她跟總統有私情
who the president was involved with.

178
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,980
他就處理掉了
And he took care of it.

179
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,860
他不止一次地威脅過我的生命
He's threatened my life on numerous occasions.

180
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,300
-但是回到我的問題  -不  女士
- But to go back to my question... - No, ma'am.

181
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,200
我不認為總統知道道格在做什么
I don't think the president knew what Doug was up to.

182
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,650
完全不了解
Not at all.

183
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,050
漢默施密特先生
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

184
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,510
我想給你打電話來著
I've been meaning to call you.

185
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,120
肖恩
Sean.

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
你應該能看出來  我現在在這里工作
As you can tell, I work here now.

187
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,750
我現在跟你握手
I'm shaking your hand right now

188
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,440
是因為我崇尚社交禮儀
because I believe in social graces.

189
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,980
你迷失了
You're lost.

190
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,530
-我不這么認為  -不  你就是迷失了
- I don't think so. - No, you are.

191
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,740
不  我一點都沒迷失
No, not at all.

192
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,280
這就是你想要的
This is what you wanted?

193
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,230
為腐敗的政府和走向毀滅的總統賣命
A job in a corrupt administration? Presidency in ruin?

194
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,800
我是在白宮里面
I'm in the White House.

195
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,210
不是在外面  好奇著里面是什么樣
Not out there, wondering what it's like in here.

196
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,650
不會很久的
Not for long.

197
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,720
你一旦進來了  就是進來了  這就是美國特色
Once you're in, you're in. It's the American way.

198
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,610
-斯坦普先生現在可以見你了  -謝謝
- Mr. Stamper will see you now. - Thank you.

199
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,780
抱歉讓你久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,410
當我提出這次會面時  我不知道
When I asked for this meeting, I had no idea

201
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,180
總統今晚要簽字辭職
the president would be signing his resignation this evening.

202
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,910
還有我  今天早上辭職
And I, this morning.

203
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,830
-我聽說了傳聞  -現在確定了
- I heard a rumor you might. - Now it's confirmed.

204
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,370
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper...

205
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,950
請說  你可以叫我道格
Yeah, please. You can call me Doug.

206
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,520
還是免了  畢竟這是正式采訪
I'd rather not, for the sake of this interview.

207
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,260
希望你知道這不是私下談話
I want you to know this will not be off the record,

208
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,550
或作為幕后消息
or on background.

209
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,160
我確實認識麗薩·威廉姆斯  幾年前認識的
I do know Lisa Williams. I met her a couple years ago.

210
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,880
好的
Okay.

211
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,850
但在我們談其他事之前
But before we get to anything else...

212
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,700
安德伍德總統
did President Underwood,

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,300
在還是議員時  是否殺害了佐伊·巴恩斯
when he was congressman, kill Zoe Barnes?

214
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,430
沒有
No.

215
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,220
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper...

216
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,680
你是否殺害了佐伊·巴恩斯
did you kill Zoe Barnes?

217
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,010
我沒準備好回答那個問題
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

218
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,190
你明白我可以白紙黑字寫明你拒絕回答吧
You understand I can use your refusal in print.

219
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,860
明白
Yes.

220
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,290
佐伊死的那天  你是否在大教堂高地
Were you on the Cathedral Heights D.C. Metro platform

221
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,790
地鐵站的站臺上
the day of Zoe's death?

222
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,840
任何涉及佐伊·巴恩斯的問題
Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes,

223
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,690
你得去跟我的律師談
you need to speak with my attorneys.

224
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,090
佐伊·巴恩斯是否用一部一次性手機
Did Zoe Barnes make a call to Francis Underwood

225
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,970
打給了時任議員的弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
from a burner phone when he was congressman?

226
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,410
-你為什么要問我  -你為什么不回答
- Why would you ask me that? - Why won't you answer?

227
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,750
總統的手機幾乎都是我在接
I almost always answer the president's phone.

228
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,590
電話  短信
Calls, texts...

229
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,760
你知道那些短信嗎
Do you have any knowledge of those texts?

230
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,780
我沒準備好作出評論
I'm not prepared to comment on that.

231
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,630
那么這次談話到此為止
Then this conversation is over.

232
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,140
祝好
Have a good day.

233
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,330
最后一件事
One last thing.

234
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,280
你是否給我寄過兩張生日賀卡
Did you send me two birthday cards?

235
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,870
沒有
No.

236
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,210
[蘇格蘭蓋爾語]
Slàinte mhath.

237
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,840
是蘇格蘭蓋爾語  意思是"祝安康"
That's Scottish Gaelic. It means "Good health."

238
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,740
我父親有點執迷
My father's kind of obsessed.

239
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,380
他將我們格雷森家的歷史
And he traced our line of Graysons back to,

240
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,800
追溯到了16世紀左右
like, 16th century or something.

241
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,930
如果我們午休時需要喝一杯
Well, if we ever needed a drink in the middle of the day...

242
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,010
聯邦檢察官那邊進展順利
It went well with the US attorney.

243
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,160
真令人悲痛
It's tragic.

244
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,370
一想到道格做了什么  我們的心都碎了
Our hearts are just broken at the thought of what Doug did.

245
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,900
我不知道他怎么了
I don't know what happened to him.

246
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,760
可能到了某個時候...
I guess somewhere along the line...

247
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,420
他什么時候會宣布辭職
When will, uh, he be announcing his resignation?

248
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,290
-今天下午  -當然
- It's happening this afternoon. - Oh, of course.

249
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,380
賽斯  你也得辭職
And, Seth, you'll need to resign as well.

250
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,870
-我還以為  -我知道  但你想想
- I thought that, uh... - I know, but think about this.

251
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,520
我得建立我自己的團隊  得公開進行
I need to establish my own team. Publicly.

252
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,960
不能回避
And there's no avoiding

253
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,850
目前你跟道格和弗蘭西斯的關系有多緊密
how tied you and Doug are to Francis at this point.

254
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,430
這只是為了等一切煙消云散  僅此而已
So, it's really just waiting for the dust to settle. That's all.

255
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,550
怎么感覺像是你在告訴我
Why does it feel like you're telling me

256
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
我的職業生涯結束了  副總統女士
my career is over, Madam Vice President?

257
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,440
不  我只是說  你得先離開一陣子
No, I'm just saying, you just need to go away for a little while.

258
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,940
稍后我們會召你回來的
And we'll bring you back into the fold at a later date,

259
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,230
不用擔心
and don't worry.

260
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,760
看看莉安  她也離開過  現在她回來了
Look at LeAnn. She left and now she's back.

261
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,040
我們以前一起喝過酒嗎
Have we ever had a drink together?

262
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,830
從來沒有
Never.

263
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,570
我想在您還是總統時  把這個交給您
I wanted to hand this to you while you were still president.

264
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,450
我帶著沉重的心情接受了
I accept this with a heavy heart.

265
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,120
我昨天跟律師們開了一個戰略會議
I had a strategy session with the attorneys yesterday.

266
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,850
希望他們好好對你了
I hope they're treating you well.

267
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,070
你知道
You know...

268
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,130
道格  現在起
Doug, we're not gonna be able

269
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,690
我們將有一陣子不能見面了
to see each other for some time now.

270
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,470
不如你拿點什么東西當紀念吧
So why don't you take something?

271
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,310
-不了  -沒關系  隨意挑吧
- No. - No, no. Go on. Take something.

272
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,560
任何東西  你想要什么都行  即便很小
Anything. Anything you want. Even if it's small.

273
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,040
一個你能握在手里
Something you can hold in your hand

274
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,430
讓你回想起這里的東西  直到你回來
to remind you of this place... until you get back.

275
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,920
隨便選吧
You go on.

276
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,030
離我的正式辭職只有幾小時了
We're a few hours away from my official resignation...

277
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,510
而你還沒答應赦免我
and you still have not agreed to pardon me.

278
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,900
如果你不
And if you don't,

279
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,920
我將不得不撤回辭職的決定
I will be forced to renege on that resignation.

280
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,290
那就太過分了
That would be outrageous.

281
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,540
我遞交了簽字辭呈  才算正式辭職
Well, it isn't official until I submit a signed letter.

282
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,560
這對你余下的總統任期有什么好處
And what would that do to the rest of your presidency?

283
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,330
還能剩下什么
What would be left of it?

284
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,270
克萊爾  如果你不同意
Claire, if you don't do it,

285
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,610
你可能就要與重罪犯是夫妻了
you're gonna risk being married to a felon.

286
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,160
如果我同意  那又置我于何地
And if I do, where does that leave me?

287
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,130
你現在真的想和我談這個嗎
Look, is this really the conversation you want to be having?

288
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,420
你給我設局  弗蘭西斯
You've trapped me, Francis.

289
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,490
不  我不接受害了你的指責
No, I do not accept that I've done something to you.

290
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,450
我給你提供了一個機會
I have provided you with an opportunity.

291
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,810
你之前也說過  這就是你的終局
Now, you have said before, that this is your endgame.

292
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,080
眼下你的終極目標唾手可得
And now, your goal is within spitting distance

293
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,040
而你只看到了背叛  我不信
and all you see is betrayal? I don't buy it.

294
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,370
別再糾結我對你做了什么了
Stop talking about what I've done to you.

295
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,110
承認吧
Admit it.

296
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,580
這就是你想要的
This is what you want.

297
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,270
你愿意為之殺人
You were willing to kill for it.

298
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,760
那么克萊爾  接受吧
So, Claire, come and take it...

299
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,670
不然我就要收回了
before I take it back.

300
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,360
我們要挑選最合適的時機和地點
We'll find the most strategic time and place.

301
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,830
但我會特赦你  弗蘭西斯
But I will pardon you, Francis.

302
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,810
為了國家利益  我們也應該解散委員會
For the good of the nation, we need to disband this committee,

303
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,500
把這一頁翻過去
and put this behind us.

304
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,670
總統很可能撐不過聽證會
The president most likely would not have survived the hearings.

305
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,870
你也可以說他是被迫辭職
You could argue that he had no choice but to resign.

306
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,900
但我們也不能否認他的證詞引起很大反響
But we can't deny that his testimony struck a chord.

307
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,480
就算是這樣
Well, that may be true.

308
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,280
那你  羅梅洛議員
But how is it that you, Congressman Romero,

309
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,100
他最主要的批評者  怎么轉而支持他了呢
his biggest critic, are supporting him now?

310
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,540
歷史
History.

311
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,030
今天結束時
By the end of the day,

312
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,690
我們國家會第一次有位女總統
the country will have its first woman president.

313
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,200
我一直支持有一位女性
Look, I've always been a supporter of the idea

314
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,580
能入主白宮
of a woman in the Oval Office.

315
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,430
但是說到底
But when all is said and done,

316
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,370
您應該清楚弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
you do realize that Francis Underwood

317
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,330
今晚還是會在白宮過夜的吧
will still be sleeping in the White House tonight?

318
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,740
你不是該收拾東西了嗎
Isn't this when you pack everything up?

319
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,700
至少帶走個人物品
Or at least take the personal things?

320
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,800
我什么都不拿了
I'm not taking anything.

321
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,960
任你處置吧
You can do what you want with it.

322
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,730
-你什么時候見聯邦檢察官  -后天
- When do you meet with the US attorney? - Day after tomorrow.

323
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,550
我從沒想過弗蘭克·安德伍德會下臺
I never thought that Frank Underwood would not be president.

324
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,480
真沒想過
Not really.

325
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,040
你可以逃跑
You could just run away.

326
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,940
那我有什么好處
What does that get me?

327
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,810
你很擅長照顧自己
You're good at taking care of yourself.

328
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
真好笑
That's funny.

329
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,900
我希望你知道我關心你
Look, I want you to know that I care for you,

330
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,820
但恐怕我也幫不上你什么了
but I don't know how much I can be there.

331
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,530
我想就在這里坐一會兒
I think I'm gonna just sit here for a while.

332
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,100
嗯  坐吧
Yeah, you should.

333
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,490
副總統希望你在她宣誓就職之前
Uh, the vice president would like you to leave the White House

334
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,240
離開白宮
before she's sworn in.

335
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,510
她認為最好不要傳出什么她就職時
She doesn't think it would be a good idea for word to get out

336
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,240
你還在白宮的消息
that you were here when it happened.

337
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,690
本人莊嚴宣誓  我必忠實執行
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute

338
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,140
合眾國總統職務
the office of President of the United States,

339
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,160
忠于職守  竭盡全力  恪守  維護
and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect

340
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,670
和捍衛合眾國憲法
and defend the Constitution of the United States.

341
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,030
-愿上帝助我  -又是這熟悉的一幕
- So help me God. - Here we are again.

342
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,340
知道嗎  如果你忽略盛大的儀式和場合
You know, if you ignore all the pomp and circumstance,

343
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,660
最反常的事就是我真的相信總統之位
the most perverse thing is I actually believe in the presidency.

344
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,700
其重要性
Its importance.

345
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,530
對世界的重大意義  哪怕只是象征性的
What it means around the world, even symbolically.

346
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,530
但我更相信權力  信它本身
But I believe in power even more. For its own sake.

347
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,890
戈爾·維達爾[作家]曾寫道
Gore Vidal once wrote

348
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,540
權力的目的是權力
that power is an end to itself,

349
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,710
而奪取勝利的本能沖動
and the instinctive urge to prevail...

350
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
是人類最為重要的特性
the most important single human trait.

351
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,560
我總是告訴我自己  我做的一切都是為了她
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.

352
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,480
但也許并不是  也許我更愛權力
But maybe it wasn't. Maybe I love power more.

353
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,630
為你  和你親愛的人
For you, and for any dear to you,

354
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,460
我愿做任何事
I would do anything.

355
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,470
如果有幸  我的生涯中
If my career were of that better kind

356
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,310
有做出犧牲的機會或是能力
that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it,

357
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,320
我愿抓住一切機會  為你和你親愛的人犧牲
I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.

358
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,220
在寧靜的時候  請記得我
Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times,

359
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,720
記得我這番熱情而真摯的話
as ardent and sincere in this one thing.

360
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,870
那一天終會到來
The time will come,

361
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,030
那一天已經不遠
the time will not be long in coming,

362
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,960
你將建立起新的關系
when new ties will be formed about you.

363
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,910
那關系將會更加溫情而有力地把你
The ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly

364
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,580
跟你悉心經營的家連結在一起
to the home you so adorn.

365
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,970
那是永遠為你增光  令你幸福的最親密的關系
The dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.

366
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,740
馬內特小姐
Oh, Miss Manette,

367
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,160
等一個長得
when the little picture

368
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,420
和他幸福的父親一樣的小家伙仰起臉看你時
of a happy father's face looks up in yours...

369
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,300
晚上好
Good evening.

370
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,470
晚上好  女士們先生們  我叫肖恩·杰弗瑞斯
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sean Jeffries.

371
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,010
我是新新聞部副主任
I'm the new deputy director of communications.

372
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,950
賽斯去哪了
Where's Seth?

373
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,710
格雷森先生上臺前被叫走了
Mr. Grayson got called away last minute,

374
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,570
所以我臨時替代一下他
so I'm temporarily filling his shoes.

375
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,610
我不回答問題
I won't be taking any questions.

376
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,720
我要讀一份擬好的聲明
Instead, I'll be reading from a prepared statement.

377
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,190
幾小時前
A few hours ago,

378
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,510
安德伍德總統
President Underwood resigned

379
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,940
辭去了美國總統一職
the office of President of the United States.

380
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,550
在有白宮人員參加的私密儀式上
And in a private ceremony attended by staff,

381
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,380
克萊爾·安德伍德總統宣誓就職
President Claire Underwood was sworn in.

382
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,130
即刻生效  她將擔任
Effective immediately, she will be assuming the office

383
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,740
美國總統一職
of President of the United States.

384
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,620
稍后會具體公布將由
Details will be coming shortly on who will

385
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,920
-誰來接任  -你一定很為他驕傲
- be stepping into the office as - You must be so proud of him.

386
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,550
副總統
vice president.

387
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,430
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德總統今天雖無法親自前來
And while President Francis Underwood couldn't be here today...

388
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,900
三小時前進行了權力交接
Transfer of power happened three hours ago,

389
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,800
過程"私密而低調"
quote, "privately and quietly."

390
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
頭版頭條就是它了
And that's above the fold.

391
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,400
-司法部有什么消息嗎  -還沒有
- Anything from DOJ? - Nothing yet.

392
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,550
馬克·厄舍沒有正式頭銜
No official title to him,

393
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,820
但權力交接是他主持的
but it's Mark Usher running the transition.

394
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,840
好  我們來看看誰進誰出
Okay. Let's find out who's in and who's out.

395
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,790
多米諾骨牌在不斷倒下
The dominoes are falling.

396
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,760
-誰負責調查羅梅洛  -我
- Now, who's on Romero? - Here.

397
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,110
-我們想讓議員公開發聲  -好的
- We want the congressman on the record. - I've got it.

398
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,510
留著麥卡倫周末再爆料
And let's save Macallan for the weekend.

399
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,160
湯姆  道格·斯坦普怎么樣了
Tom, where are we with Doug Stamper?

400
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,730
我得去核查點東西
There's, uh, something I need to check on.

401
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,980
頭條網  消息網
Slugline, BuzzFeed,

402
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,470
全市一半的新聞渠道都等著這則大新聞呢
half the outlets in this city are ready to jump on this.

403
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,440
你跟他一對一談過
You spoke to him. One on one.

404
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,550
-他沒說是他干的  -他不用說
- He didn't actually say he did it. - He doesn't have to.

405
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,510
有人知道賽斯·格雷森對聯邦檢察官說了什么嗎
Does anyone know what Seth Grayson said to the US attorney?

406
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,970
湯姆
Tom?

407
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,340
你寫這屆政府寫了兩年了
Two years you've been writing about this administration.

408
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,250
-機會來了  -我想繼續追查而已
- This is it. - I want to follow up, that's all.

409
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,110
我看見一座美麗的城市
I see a beautiful city

410
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,500
和一個燦爛的民族從這深淵中升起
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.

411
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,460
在他們爭取真正的自由的奮斗中
And in their struggles to be truly free,

412
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,150
在他們的勝利與失敗中
in their triumphs and defeats,

413
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,250
在未來的漫長歲月中
through long years to come,

414
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,310
我看見這一時代的邪惡和前一時代的邪惡
I see the evil of this time and of the previous time

415
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,290
前者是后者的自然結果
of which this is the natural birth,

416
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,290
逐漸贖去自己的罪孽  慢慢消失
gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

417
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
華盛頓時間今天凌晨三點左右
Surface-to-surface missiles delivered sarin

418
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,590
地對地沙林毒氣導彈
at about three o'clock in the morning, our time.

419
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,680
莫斯科已經發出聲明  譴責反政府軍
Moscow has already issued a statement condemning the rebels

420
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,540
策劃了這場苦肉計襲擊
for orchestrating the attack on themselves.

421
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,970
-真是嗎  -當然不是
- And did they? - Of course not.

422
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,170
佩特羅夫是想利用它發動正當空襲
Petrov will use this to justify air strikes.

423
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,430
我給你看張照片
I'd like to show you an image.

424
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,660
這張是路透社的
This one is coming out of Reuters.

425
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,560
我有預感  上午大多數媒體都會發這張
The feeling is most of the press will be using it by the a.m.

426
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
依我的經驗
Experience tells me

427
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,280
這件事會回響個三五天
this will resonate for about three to five days...

428
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,770
也就給了我們機會
which gives us our window.

429
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,400
我們可以準備一份聲明
Well, we can ready a statement.

430
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,890
出兵才是真正的聲明
Troops on the ground is the statement.

431
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,280
不  我想等找到艾哈邁迪再行動
No, I don't want to do anything until we find Ahmadi's location.

432
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,840
我不確定這件事我們應該選擇等待  總統女士
I'm not sure we should wait on this, Madam President.

433
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,670
我想提醒你發出最后通牒的
I'd like to remind you that it was this administration

434
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,510
正是這個政府
that introduced the ultimatum.

435
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,880
你該有所行動
You should act on it.

436
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,780
是  但我都沒有像樣的團隊
Yes, but I barely have a team in place.

437
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,430
你可以用前總統的團隊
Well, you can run it by the former president...

438
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,280
前總統就是前總統
The former president is just that.

439
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,110
機會就在眼前
An opportunity has presented itself.

440
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,510
而我想把握住機會
And I'm trying to take advantage of it.

441
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,370
-大家都在戰況室了嗎  -20分鐘前都齊了
- Is everyone in the Situation Room? - As of 20 minutes ago.

442
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,770
時機不對
So, the timing is bad.

443
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,950
如果現在赦免他  會顯得你跟他的罪行有關
If you pardon him now, you're associated with his crimes.

444
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,780
共和黨人會咬著你不放
Republicans will have a field day.

445
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,690
我們需要掩護
We need some cover.

446
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,930
那就是抓捕艾哈邁迪
Well, that would be Ahmadi's capture.

447
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,810
合適的副總統對我們有好處
The right VP would help all this.

448
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,060
你有更多想法嗎
Have you had any further thoughts?

449
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,630
最終名單沒變
My short list is the same.

450
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,650
韋斯特維爾特  克拉克  克萊因
Westervelt, Clark, Klein.

451
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,010
克萊因最有可能
Klein would be the strongest bulwark

452
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,070
抵抗對你的彈劾
against calls for your impeachment.

453
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,080
-這是剜肉補瘡  -補瘡是關鍵
- Swallowing poison to stay alive. - Alive is good.

454
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,370
我覺得我受不了克萊因
I don't think I can stomach Klein.

455
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,550
他稱我為賤人  不如克拉克
He called me a bitch. I prefer Clark.

456
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,930
告訴我  搬走尸體前
Tell me. Before you moved the body,

457
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,360
你幫他合上雙眼了嗎
were you able to close his eyes?

458
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,190
合上了
Yes.

459
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,380
我知道你很重視他的想法
Look... I know his opinion means a lot to you.

460
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,560
弗蘭西斯
Francis.

461
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,610
但讓他待在白宮  即便在東廂
But having him here, in the White House, even in the East Wing,

462
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,750
也會干擾我們處理事情
while we're trying to figure this out, it's hard.

463
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,200
總會有人暗示
At some point, someone is going to imply

464
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,410
仍是他在做決定
that he is still making the decisions.

465
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,380
那可不妙
That wouldn't be good.

466
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,140
-我會給她建議  她會想通的  -但愿吧
- I'll advise her. She'll come around. - I hope so.

467
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,790
敘利亞的事  如果她現在不行動
Because if she doesn't act now, when it comes to Syria,

468
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,270
她的總統位子就坐不穩
her presidency could be in danger.

469
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,640
你的未來也有變數
And your future in doubt.

470
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,040
別威脅我  戴維斯女士
Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.

471
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,720
我不威脅別人
I don't threaten.

472
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,680
我只是想盡量說清楚
I just try to remain as clear as possible.

473
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,690
你幫我做事  我也幫你做事
You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.

474
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,720
要知道
You know...

475
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,020
我比你早來  也會比你晚走
I was here before you and I'll be here after you.

476
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,280
即便如此  讓我提醒你
And regardless of that, let me remind you...

477
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,090
沒有比我更危險的東西
that nothing is more dangerous than me.

478
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,570
你現在得務實  戴維斯沒說錯
You need to be practical now. Davis isn't wrong.

479
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,010
我們已經想抓捕艾哈邁迪一年了  弗蘭西斯
We've been trying to get our hands on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.

480
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,200
-她還沒有實現  -沒錯  但關鍵不是她
- She hasn't delivered. - Yes, but this isn't about her.

481
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,790
而是你  還有第一次向全國發表講話
This is about you and coming out with a strong message

482
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,060
傳達出來的有力信息
in your first address to the nation.

483
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,110
關鍵是為你的任期定下基調
This is about setting the course for your presidency.

484
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,830
要強大  克萊爾
Be strong, Claire.

485
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,320
開戰吧
Go to war.

486
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
但我需要你離開
But I need you to leave.

487
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,210
離開白宮
Leave the White House.

488
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,800
是  我懂
Yes, I see.

489
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,120
為了能成功赦免你  弗蘭西斯
For this pardon to succeed, Francis,

490
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,550
我們得表現得有所疏遠
we need to appear to be estranged.

491
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,690
這只是策略
I'm just being strategic.

492
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,630
你建議我去哪
And where do you suggest I go?

493
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,650
我不確定
I'm not sure.

494
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,800
海軍天文臺
The Naval Observatory?

495
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,110
我覺得副總統府邸還是太近了
I think the vice president's residence is still too close.

496
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,610
抱歉  我只是...
I'm sorry, I just...

497
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,310
我們不能讓別人認為你還在干政
We can't have anyone think you're still involved in policy.

498
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,700
如果你動搖了
Look, if you're having second thoughts,

499
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,830
-你現在就該告訴我  -不
- you should tell me now. - No.

500
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,170
-我完全同意  -因為這可不是猶豫的時候
- No. I'm in full agreement. - 'Cause this is no time to hesitate.

501
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,770
我沒在猶豫
I am not hesitating.

502
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,000
我只是覺得如果我們不妥當處理
I just believe if we don't play this correctly,

503
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,660
那對公眾而言
as far as the public,

504
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,600
我的任期不過就是我倆茍且偷生
my term will be nothing but survival for both of us.

505
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,190
好吧
All right.

506
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,760
我希望你知道我會幫助你
I want you to know I'm here

507
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,170
如果你需要政策或其他事情的建議
if you need any advice on policy or anything else you might need.

508
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,240
謝謝你  我去睡了
Thank you. I'm going to bed.

509
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,300
沒有人會像我一樣愛你
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

510
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,300
我希望你知道
I hope you know that.

511
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,110
就像我知道沒有人會像你一樣愛我
Just as I know that no one will ever love me... like you.

512
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,840
"在陶瓷青蛙下面"
"Under the porcelain frog."

513
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,010
答案必須準確  包括大小寫
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.

514
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,900
只有一次機會
You won't get a second chance.

515
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,000
-第二個問題  -我最喜歡的棒球運動員嗎
- And the middle one? - My favorite baseball player?

516
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,710
"韋德·博格斯"  兩個G
"Wade Boggs." Two G's.

517
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,830
最后一個
And the last?

518
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,850
"你在奧斯丁的酒店房間留了什么"
"What did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?"

519
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,870
我的槍在哪
Where is my gun?

520
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,710
給
Here you go.

521
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,100
你能給我什么保證
What guarantees do I have?

522
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,210
我把槍還給你了
I gave you your gun back.

523
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,190
但你為什么給他  我很好奇
But what made you give it to him? I'm curious.

524
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,410
我覺得他有危險
I thought he was in danger.

525
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,680
那你現在怎么覺得
And now you think what?

526
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,270
我想問的就是這個
That is what I'm asking.

527
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,130
只要我在  你會一直是本屆政府的成員
As long as I'm around, you'll be a part of this administration.

528
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,910
我們都知道艾丹太多事
We both know too much about Aidan.

529
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,780
克萊爾知道你有多忠誠  我很確定
And Claire knows how loyal you are. I'm sure of it.

530
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,730
所以  你在奧斯丁的酒店房間留了什么
So, what did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?

531
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,590
一條手鏈
A bracelet.

532
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,190
真糟糕
That's too bad.

533
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,660
我終于看到了
You know, I finally got a look

534
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,230
麥卡倫留給哈維小姐的東西
at what Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.

535
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,580
你和你丈夫偷走了這場大選
I was shocked to realize the degree

536
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,120
程度之深  真是讓我震驚了
to which you and your husband stole this election.

537
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,940
我得對你實話實說
I need to be honest with you.

538
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
我和他談過
I've been in talks with him about

539
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,480
幫他發起一個基金會
helping him start a foundation of some kind.

540
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,280
換取對你的影響
In exchange for influence over you.

541
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,690
有意思
Interesting.

542
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,860
我想幫你度過這個過渡期
I'm trying to help you navigate this transition.

543
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,620
你對于我是什么人
Who are you to me?

544
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
你希望我是什么人
Who do you want me to be?

545
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,830
這個回答不好
That's not a good answer.

546
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,930
你是美國第一任女總統
You're the first woman President of the United States.

547
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,260
你忍了那么多  做了那么多犧牲和妥協
All you've had to swallow, the sacrifices, the compromises.

548
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,400
你會想要自我隔離
You're gonna want to isolate yourself.

549
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,440
不去相信任何人
Not trust anyone.

550
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,900
但你需要的正是這個
But that's exactly what you're gonna need.

551
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,240
需要有人告訴你真相
Someone to tell you what's what.

552
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,230
你就是這個人嗎
And is that person you?

553
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,060
是嗎
Is it?

554
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,320
我覺得不論我說什么都沒法讓你相信
I don't think there's anything i could say that would convince you

555
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,150
除非你已經感覺到了
if you don't already feel it.

556
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,890
戴維斯女士  你在要求我發動戰爭
Ms. Davis, you are asking me to start a war.

557
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,980
而你似乎只在你樂意時兌現諾言
And you seem to deliver on promises when it suits you.

558
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,730
所以  原諒我懷疑你的意圖
So forgive me if I question your intentions.

559
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,740
我喜歡你
I like you.

560
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,180
我喜歡在你身邊
I like being around you.

561
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,300
有時這讓我失去了應有的效率
And sometimes that makes me less effective than I should be.

562
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,750
不論是否赦免你丈夫
Pardoning or not pardoning your husband,

563
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,880
他都是個不利因素
in either case, he's a liability.

564
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,950
如果治療不當
If it's not treated properly...

565
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,170
你丈夫的肝臟隨時可能衰竭
your husband's liver could fail him at any time.

566
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,700
這種事我做不了
It's not the kind of thing I could do.

567
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,660
但我可以找人  或者...
But I could find someone, or...

568
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,180
我...不知你是否知道
I... I don't know if you realize,

569
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,460
即便是胡蔓藤這種藥物
but... even something like gelsemium

570
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,300
劑量太高時  也可能致命
can be lethal in higher doses.

571
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,800
我丈夫的健康狀況沒問題
My husband's health is just fine.

572
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,000
我會繼續和他合作  跟隨你的領導
I'll continue to work with him. Follow your lead.

573
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,700
這是我委托人的護照
Here's my client's passport.

574
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,930
有幾件事我們要再重申一下
There's a few things we want to go over.

575
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,220
還沒重申過的嗎
That we haven't already?

576
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,720
我必須確定  你們帶他出去時不戴手銬
No cuffs, when you walk him out of here. I need to be sure.

577
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,670
拜托  詹姆斯  我們不會這么干的
Oh, come on, James, we aren't gonna play that on this.

578
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,280
你有些很夠意思的朋友  斯坦普先生
You have some very good friends, Mr. Stamper,

579
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,890
沒讓媒體報道這件事
to keep the press out of this.

580
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,940
你會像個紳士一樣走出去
You will walk out of here like a gentleman.

581
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,940
我們要他12小時內面見法官
We want him in front of the judge within 12 hours.

582
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,450
我們還不知道是否會起訴他
We don't even know if we're gonna charge him yet.

583
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,760
是我做的
I did it.

584
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,840
繼續吧
Let's get going.

585
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,060
你在她的內閣里有什么人
Who do you have on her cabinet?

586
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,880
現在還只是建議
Right now, they're just suggestions.

587
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,100
拜托  我們都知道這是怎么回事
Oh, come on. We both know how this works.

588
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,640
你已經做了決定
You've already made your choices.

589
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,570
如果沒有  那就是你沒本事
You wouldn't be worth your salt if you hadn't.

590
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,440
我只是希望你先讓我過目一下
I just want you to run them by me first.

591
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,200
我能讓這個過渡很輕松  也能給你制造麻煩
Look, I can make this transition easy for you or not.

592
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,510
給你一句忠告
And a word of advice.

593
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,860
她會需要
She's gonna need some

594
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,460
桌子那邊坐著一些友好的面孔
friendly faces looking at her across that table.

595
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,800
會有一些人...
There'll be a few...

596
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,270
按要求微笑的
who will smile as required.

597
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,600
你看看這個
Would you look at this?

598
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,690
都是前特種部隊的
Both Special Forces. Former.

599
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,050
他們知道如何忘記  所以你不必擔心
They know how to forget, so you don't have to worry about them.

600
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,890
尸體呢
And the body?

601
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,570
處理好了
It's on ice.

602
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,910
我剛剛和納澤取得了聯系
I just made contact with Nasser.

603
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,290
我們已經拿到了艾哈邁迪的位置
We have secured the location of Ahmadi.

604
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,810
我來召集隊伍
I'll assemble the team.

605
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,280
我已經給戴爾海軍上將打過電話了
I called Admiral Dale already.

606
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,000
那我們現在得做些決定
So we have some decisions to make.

607
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,930
一旦我們派部隊過去
Once we have troops on the ground,

608
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,010
我們需要仔細看一下
we'll need to take a close look

609
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,650
我們為你的內閣考慮的人選
at who we're considering for your cabinet.

610
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,100
你身邊需要有戰時經驗的團隊
You'll need a team around you with wartime experience.

611
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,610
我有些建議  已經傳達給馬克了
I have some suggestions I've passed on to Mark.

612
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,050
我認為中情局的副局長  瑪茜·西格森
I think Deputy Director of the CIA, Marcy Siegerson,

613
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,170
會是極佳的國務卿人選
would make a terrific Secretary of State.

614
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,400
我很容易與其協調聯系
Someone I could easily liaison with.

615
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,190
我還希望
Well, I was hoping that

616
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,540
你會以某種形式加入我的內閣
you would be on my cabinet, in some capacity.

617
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,300
我會在圈外工作
I'll be operating out of the region.

618
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,020
那是我的強項
It's where my strength lies.

619
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,380
我們有更好的能夠接手的人選
There are better people who can take it from here,

620
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
能夠在大后方給你建議
advise you on the home front.

621
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,790
哈維小姐  莉安  我們需要調動一下你的職位
And Ms. Harvey, LeAnn, we need to move you.

622
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,990
當然只是暫時的
Uh, just for now, of course.

623
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,750
我以為...
It was my understanding that...

624
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,650
現在一個更老道的幕僚長
Right now a more seasoned Chief of Staff

625
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,830
會向國會和國家傳遞
would send a strong message

626
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,840
強有力的信息  目前是這樣
to the Congress and to the nation. For now.

627
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,290
她會做的  她會派部隊過去
She'll do it. She'll send in the troops.

628
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,410
明天下午我就會到迪拜了
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.

629
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,130
我們的交易依舊不變
And our deal stays in place.

630
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,910
等一下
Yeah, hold on a second.

631
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,750
-準備好了嗎  -好了
- Ready?  - Go ahead.

632
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,970
是的  哈維女士拿回了她的槍
Yes. Ms. Harvey has her gun back.

633
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,860
麥卡倫的檔案在總統那里
Macallan's files are with the president.

634
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,910
任何能把你和選舉聯系起來的有力證據...
Any hard evidence connecting you to the election...

635
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,770
都在她手上
is in her hands.

636
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,260
那么莉安的工作結束了
Then LeAnn's job is done.

637
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,980
如果你還有什么要說的  現在是時候了
If you have anything to say, now is the time.

638
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,500
你覺得發生了什么
What do you think happened?

639
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,490
我更希望你來告訴我
I'd prefer you tell me that.

640
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,630
遷就我吧  是你要求見面的
Humor me. You asked for this meeting.

641
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,170
你覺得發生了什么
What do you think happened?

642
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,180
我相信佐伊·巴恩斯當時在調查
I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating

643
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,720
你和瑞秋·波斯納的關系
a relationship you were having with Rachel Posner.

644
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,210
不知怎么的  那會危及到
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger

645
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,160
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood,

646
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,720
那個你會為其赴湯蹈火的人
who you would do anything for.

647
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,040
但是有人想過佐伊·巴恩斯的生命嗎
But did anyone think about the life of Zoe Barnes?

648
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,540
你覺得你能抹去一些東西
You know, you think you can erase something.

649
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,600
然后你發現那是不可能的
Then you find out that's not possible.

650
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,480
湯姆  我的律師根本不想讓我和你交談
Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me to speak with you.

651
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,510
抱歉  沒什么好說的了
I'm sorry, there's just nothing more to say here.

652
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,170
我不知道瑞秋·波斯納怎么了
I don't know what happened to Rachel Posner.

653
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,300
但是我不相信是你殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
But I don't believe you killed Zoe Barnes.

654
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,350
錄像里的是你嗎
Is this you in this video?

655
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,040
看起來像是我
Looks like me.

656
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,650
我仔細思考了很久  弗蘭西斯
I've thought long and hard, Francis.

657
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,880
幾乎沒睡
Barely slept.

658
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,420
這份工作就是這樣
That's the job.

659
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,320
我準備派部隊過去
I'm going to send in troops.

660
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,360
我明晚就會宣布
I'll be announcing it tomorrow night.

661
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,710
我覺得你做了正確的事
I think you're doing the right thing.

662
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,350
你討厭這兒嗎
Do you hate it here?

663
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,350
你知道的  我不喜歡賓館
Oh, you know I don't like hotels.

664
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,800
看著像家  但只是提醒你并不在家
An approximation of home just to remind you you're not there.

665
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,590
我們不是有家的人
Well, we don't live in a home.

666
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,830
我們有一座白宮  借來暫住
We live in a house, borrowed and temporary.

667
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,720
你的眼睛里有什么  有種眼神
Something in your eye. A look.

668
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,980
不一樣了
It's changed.

669
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,900
你和我  現在是一樣的了
We're the same now, you and I.

670
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,160
-怎么說  -你明白的
- How so? - You know how.

671
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,870
我很久沒讓我自己感到驚奇了
It's been a long time since I surprised myself.

672
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,840
你會恢復的
You'll recover.

673
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,330
你是世界上權力最大的女人  克萊爾
You're the most powerful woman in the world, Claire.

674
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,910
任何慰藉都難與匹敵
Comfort pales by comparison.

675
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
我會在宣布出兵之后宣布這條消息
I'll announce it during the speech, after the troops.

676
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,330
將全面無條件地赦免
A full and unconditional pardon...

677
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,180
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德在擔任美國總統期間
for Francis Underwood and any crimes he might have committed

678
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,780
可能犯下的任何罪行
against the United States while president.

679
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,760
我很高興知道這一點
I'm glad to hear that.

680
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,810
我從沒動搖過  我只是需要考慮一下方式
It was never in doubt. I just needed to think about how.

681
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,220
那這個安排要維持多久
So how long does this arrangement last?

682
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,180
暫時先這樣吧
For the time being.

683
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,630
我們是怎么到這一步的  弗蘭西斯
How did we get here, Francis?

684
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,790
別糾結了  已經過去了
Oh, let it go. It's done.

685
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,340
對了  再給你個建議
Oh, and one word of advice.

686
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,120
不管厄舍向你推薦誰做副總統
Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president,

687
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,010
這個人就是你真正應該小心的人
that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.

688
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,240
我應付不了的人  我是不會選的
I won't choose anyone I can't manage.

689
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,360
在樓的西南角  繼續觀察
Southwest corner of the building. Maintain visual.

690
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,610
收到
Copy that.

691
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,530
扔雷
Frag out!

692
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,210
艾哈邁迪在那兒  我看到艾哈邁迪了
There's Ahmadi. I have visual on Ahmadi.

693
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,610
-我看到他了  -沖  開火
- I see him. - Go, go! Fire!

694
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,850
我犯了個大錯
I made a terrible mistake.

695
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,280
你做了什么
What did you do?

696
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,960
我都不知道我在做什么  我
I don't even know what I'm doing here. I, uh...

697
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,530
早上我開著車就出來了  我怕了
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.

698
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,140
總之我正往回趕  我能去見你嗎
Anyway, I'm on my way back. Can I come see you?

699
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,070
當然
Yes, please.

700
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,530
有時候看電影  你并不一定要看到最后
Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie

701
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,230
才知道結局
to know how it ends.

702
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,400
兩黨對演講的反應應該會都不錯
The speech is gonna play well with both parties.

703
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,690
和共和黨人談得怎么樣了
Where are we with the Republicans?

704
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,600
關于你的內閣  我們正在交換名單
Trading names when it comes to your cabinet.

705
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,360
選了幾個將軍  這會有利
We have our generals, which is good.

706
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,650
有幾個是公司出身  圈外人
Some corporate types, outsiders.

707
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,180
讓你看著像個打破陳規的人
Make you seem like a renegade.

708
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,200
公司  從哪來的
Corporate, from where?

709
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,070
大多數是石油和銀行業  也有搞技術的
Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.

710
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,900
再摻幾個特區的長期議員
Occasional D.C. lifer sprinkled into the mix

711
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,550
好讓你的內閣按時開工
to make sure the trains run on time.

712
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,810
我在看副總統的名單
I was going over our list for vice president.

713
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,220
等等
Yeah. Hold on.

714
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,370
這可能有點意外
this will seem unexpected,

715
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:33,640
但是我問過的許多人都說我最合適
but a lot of the people I spoke to suggested me.

716
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,410
可你不是政客
You're not a politician.

717
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,870
沒錯
Exactly.

718
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,020
但我可以守在你身邊
But I could be by your side.

719
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,760
這樣國會兩院大多數人都傷不到我們
Most of the Hill and the Senate would not come near us.

720
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,720
我會考慮的
I'll take it into consideration.

721
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,770
不能考慮了  你需要我
It's beyond that. You'll need me.

722
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,760
什么
Excuse me?

723
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,310
我能幫你
I can help. Look...

724
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,780
只有這樣才能保住你的位子
It is the way to keep you in power.

725
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,890
和你的秘密
And keep your secrets.

726
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,470
晚上好
Good evening.

727
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,870
我在此向全體美國人民和全世界鄭重宣布
I'm here to report to the American people and the world

728
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,380
在今天上午

轟然崩塌
to die a fiery death.

756
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,870
我們決不能讓他們得逞

757
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,520
我們不能再等待國會了

我們給國會的機會已經夠多了

759

她是不打算說了

803

該我了
My turn.

805
00:54:18,520 --> 00:55:18,520
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}在過去幾年中  美國對敘利亞的政策一直是外交事務的中心
而奧巴馬和特朗普兩任總統在這一事務中采取了截然不同的立場
2012年8月20日  奧巴馬宣布"阿薩德政權如果使用化武便越過了'紅線'"
2013年8月21日  媒體報道敘利亞境內大量平民遭到化武襲擊
1429人罹難  包括426名兒童
全世界都以為奧巴馬將對敘動武  美軍軍艦也部署完畢
但奧巴馬臨時改了主意  決定暫停武裝打擊計劃  而尋求國會授權
最終不了了之  許多評論認為  此后普京在東歐放手東擴
也是覺得奧巴馬外交上比較軟弱  不會干涉克里姆林宮的行為

807
00:55:18,520 --> 00:56:18,520
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}特朗普上任后  也遇到了阿薩德使用化武的事件
由于競選時他反對過度干預國際事務  所以白宮雖發表了嚴厲聲明
但媒體和美國公眾  都沒預料到特朗普真的會有決心進行武力打擊
4月6日晚  白宮和五角大樓向媒體宣布
特朗普下令讓部署在地中海的兩艘美國海軍軍艦
向敘利亞政府軍的一個空軍基地  發射了60枚戰斧導彈
摧毀了該基地的一些設施和戰斗機
特朗普上任后  屢屢受到批評  媒體也多次爆出他的丑聞
但敘利亞打擊后  不僅參眾兩院的民主黨領袖都公開發表聲明
對此舉表示肯定和認可  媒體也破天荒地交口稱贊
打擊敘利亞成了特朗普總統生涯中  迄今為止最閃光的時刻
