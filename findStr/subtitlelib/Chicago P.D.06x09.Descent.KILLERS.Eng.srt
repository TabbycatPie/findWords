1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,746
All right, so that's
two bedrooms upstairs...

2
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:03,695
both the guest and the master.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,154
That master bedroom is incredible.

4
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:07,890
Right? It's like a...
a king lives in there.

5
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,126
Guest bathroom for all the guests

6
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:12,461
that one would have

7
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:16,610
over for dinner in
your sweet, sweet kitchen.

8
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:17,845
It's nice.

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,079
This is, like, bigger than any
house I've ever lived in before.

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,137
- It's really nice.
- This is what they call

11
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,906
a "waterfall" countertop.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,994
Look at it, it's glorious.

13
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,708
You should get it. It's really nice.

14
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:28,487
It better be nice for
the price that they're asking,

15
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,746
which I'm hoping maybe
someday you'll split with me.

16
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,347
- What?
- I'm playing with you.

17
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:34,994
- I'm playing with you.
- That's not funny.

18
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,662
I'm playing, I'm playing,
I'm playing, I'm playing.

19
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,487
- But seriously, you like it?
- I like it.

20
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,223
Okay, 'cause I would hope
that you'd spend

21
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,825
a little bit of time with me over here.

22
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,760
- We'll see.
- We'll see?

23
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,280
All right.

24
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,665
Mm, I'm pretty sure that this is illegal.

25
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,166
I'm pretty sure I know a few cops

26
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,112
that can help us out
just in case we get in trouble.

27
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,414
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's good.

28
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,184
No.

29
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,138
Hold on.

30
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,289
- We gotta go.
- Unfortunately, yes.

31
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,391
Okay.

32
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,896
- You got that?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,858
All right.

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,220
Well?

35
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,655
Everything looks good, Antonio.

36
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,291
There's no tears,
no fractures, no arthritis.

37
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,994
All right, then, why does
my shoulder still hurt so much?

38
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,061
I'm not sure.

39
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,563
So when you say "pain,"

40
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,598
what type of discomfort
are you experiencing?

41
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,066
Is it stiffness, soreness?

42
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:00,168
I don't know. Uh, pain.

43
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,438
You probably just need
to give it some more rest.

44
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,983
Yeah.

45
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,478
Hey, uh, I'm gonna need
a refill on that prescription.

46
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:10,812
Another one?

47
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,081
I need something
to help with the pain, so.

48
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,350
It's been three months since the injury.

49
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,752
There's no structural damage.

50
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,620
It's the only thing
that helps with the pain.

51
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,423
I get it, but this would be
your fourth refill.

52
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,925
I mean, that's a lot of Oxycodone,

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,860
especially for an injury like this.

54
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,996
- Like I said, it still hurts.
- I understand, but...

55
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,608
You know what, look, I'm not some junkie

56
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,267
looking to hustle my doc for some pills.

57
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,607
I'm a cop.

58
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,353
I just need help with the pain
so I can do my job.

59
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,847
Look, I'm sorry. I could lose my license.

60
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,649
If you need any help, anything at all...

61
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,351
I don't need any help, Doc. I'm fine.

62
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,867
What happened?

63
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,705
- Nothing, I...
- Your hand is bleeding.

64
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,006
I'm okay, sweetie.

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,208
I was just... I was fooling around.

66
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,411
I was shadow-boxing and I...
I hit the stupid mirror.

67
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,846
You sure you're okay?

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,949
Yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing home, anyway?

69
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,054
- I thought you had mid-terms?
- I forgot my notebook.

70
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:58,864
Well, I suggest you find your notebook

71
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,682
and get back to the library.

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,125
Go.

73
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,270
Not right now.

74
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,574
Where's Antonio?
He's not picking up his phone.

75
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,977
- Huh.
- So what's going on?

76
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,812
Jay busts some punk this morning with

77
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,758
an ounce of heroin in his car,
gave up the drug house.

78
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,226
Supposed to be moving a lot of Fentanyl.

79
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,794
We're gonna hit it,
and see what we can find.

80
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,719
Yeah, and who we can flip.

81
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,331
Yeah, so I want you
to bust them all, too.

82
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,557
Junkies, dealers, girlfriends, everyone.

83
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,392
Hey, you know where Antonio is?

84
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,960
No, I've been calling him but...

85
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,430
Huh.

86
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,076
Right, so Hailey, Burgess,
and I will take the front.

87
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,511
Ruzek, Atwater, you guys take the back.

88
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,802
All right, hit it.

89
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,737
I'll see you all back at the district.

90
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,439
Do we have any names or pictures?

91
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,807
No, we're flying blind.

92
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,775
- But that makes it fun, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,112
Chicago PD, nobody move!

94
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,580
Cops! Cops!

95
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,948
- Go, go-go-go-go!
- Damn it.

96
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,650
Nobody move! Hands in the air, now!

97
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,762
- Runners to the right!
- I said hands in the air, now!

98
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,097
- Get up against the wall.
- Get your hands up!

99
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,765
This has gotta be
some kind of mistake, man.

100
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,590
- Hands where I can see them!
- Turn around!

101
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,258
This must be some kind of mistake.

102
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,095
This is a mistake? What is this, aspirin?

103
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,133
What's all this, man?

104
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,770
- Look at the wall.
- Hey! Chicago PD!

105
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,644
Face the wall,
put your hands behind your back.

106
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,545
Adam, I got four coming out the back!

107
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,013
Hey, hey, hey! Put your hands up!

108
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,482
- Put your hands up!
- Come here!

109
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,960
- I want to see hands!
- It's cool. It's cool.

110
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,284
- Hands up!
- Get on the ground!

111
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,663
- Come here.
- It's cool. I'm cool.

112
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:38,787
- Oh, my hand, man!
- Hey...

113
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,122
You, look... look at the wall.

114
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't look at me,
just get on the wall, okay?

115
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,068
Put your hands behind
your back right now.

116
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,659
- Hands behind your back...
- Damn!

117
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:45,804
- Damn it.
- Burgess, you got her?

118
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,295
Go, go, go! I got her.

119
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,141
Hey, you got anything
that could hurt me in there?

120
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,409
- No, I don't know those guys.
- Hey! Do not...

121
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,633
You do not turn around.

122
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,135
- I didn't do anything.
- Hey.

123
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,337
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
- I got him, I got him!

124
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,638
Chicago PD!

125
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,378
Police! Freeze!

126
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,604
Chicago PD! Get down!

127
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,439
Get down right now or I will shoot you!

128
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,707
Put your hands up.

129
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,409
Hands in the air!

130
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:36,344
Now turn around real slow.

131
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,079
Real slow.

132
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,685
What the hell?

133
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,889
Don't shoot. It's me.

134
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,517
Antonio?

135
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:54,157
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

136
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,198
Antonio, what the hell happened?

137
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:57,876
You were... you were
doing a buy in the house?

138
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,378
It's not that hard to understand, Adam.

139
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,702
I got a tip from a CI.

140
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,204
Came to check it out so I did a buy.

141
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,415
You didn't want
to tell anybody you were here?

142
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,739
We could have covered you.

143
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,408
Oh, I got the tip 20 minutes ago.

144
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,120
I was in the area,
figured I'd come check it out.

145
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,912
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah, it is a big deal, man.

146
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,874
I almost shot you.

147
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,150
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,587
I should have identified myself earlier.

149
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,389
Antonio, look.

150
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:23,225
- I don't mean to pry but, uh...
- Then don't.

151
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,293
But we all called you
like a bunch of times.

152
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,128
I came here to do some undercover work.

153
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,764
Things got screwed up. End of story.

154
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,433
You break protocol, it's end of story.

155
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,568
One of us does it,
bro, you would want our badge.

156
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,003
I swear to God, Adam...

157
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,448
Antonio, it's a little
out of character, man.

158
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,340
- She almost shot you.
- Hey, listen, listen.

159
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,941
Nobody got hurt.

160
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,743
There's a lot of eyes around

161
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,780
so let's just leave it alone for now.

162
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,984
Okay.

163
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,540
You okay?

164
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,859
No.

165
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,686
Hey. Can I get a ride?

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,187
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

167
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,290
I, uh, drove here with Jay
but he's stuck doing

168
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:31,286
the paper work so he's gonna be
like another hour or so.

169
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,463
Are these yours, or...

170
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,667
No, I did a buy, remember?

171
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,336
Right. Okay.

172
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,848
So I'll just take them
and lock them with the other...

173
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,839
No, no, no, that's okay. I can do it.

174
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,175
Uh, no. I almost killed you.

175
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,977
I mean, it's the last I can do.

176
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm good.

177
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,984
Look... hey... uh,

178
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,020
I mean, I'm your partner...
and your friend.

179
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,316
If something's going on...

180
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm fine.

181
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,168
All right, Patrick Carter.

182
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,904
He's a mid-level player
according to Narcotics.

183
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,672
All his priors are cocaine-related,

184
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,175
so he must have just started
pushing synthetic opioids.

185
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,910
Controls on legit oxy are getting tight,

186
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,511
so this fake stuff, it's everywhere.

187
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,213
Yeah, killing a lot of people, too.

188
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,759
11 overdoses last month
in that neighborhood.

189
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,185
Hey, why don't I take a run at this guy,

190
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,030
see if I can get him
to flip up to his supplier?

191
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,589
Uh, too late. He lawyered up

192
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,391
the second they brought him
into interrogation.

193
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,065
All right, let's dig into Carter's phone,

194
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,028
digital footprint, known associates.

195
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:42,315
See if we can ID
who's supplying the pills.

196
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,933
Hey, give me a sec, will you, Antonio?

197
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,945
- Yeah.
- Help me out.

198
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,490
Why you flying solo at that drug house?

199
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,417
Well, it's like I told the other guys.

200
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,409
I got a tip from a CI. I was in the area.

201
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,329
- I figured I'd act on it.
- Huh.

202
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,913
Why'd you run?

203
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,750
Man. I thought it was a rip.

204
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:05,653
Guns were coming out,
heard yelling, so I took off.

205
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,722
Hurt your hand?

206
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,391
Oh, yeah, yeah.

207
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,259
Cut it moving some bricks
in the backyard.

208
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,804
It's no big deal.
Didn't even need stitches.

209
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,305
Huh.

210
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,433
That it?

211
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,702
- Thanks.
- You got it.

212
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,109
Come on.

213
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,446
- Hey, hey.
- Shh.

214
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,258
You'd better have a damn good
explanation for this, Antonio.

215
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,426
- I don't, and keep it down.
- Hey, we had a deal.

216
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,251
You keep me safe and I get you pills.

217
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,486
- Instead, you set me up.
- I didn't. It was a mistake.

218
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,798
I didn't know they were gonna be there.

219
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,798
You work with these people.

220
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,367
How did you not know that
they were looking at me?

221
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,092
Man, you must think I'm a idiot.

222
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:46,104
I'm doing everything I can
but it's not gonna be easy.

223
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,328
I don't care if it's easy.

224
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,097
Okay, just get it done,

225
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,776
'cause I ain't going down
for this alone, Antonio.

226
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,801
- I can promise you that.
- Look, look, look.

227
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,703
The only way I can make a deal is
if you offer up your supplier.

228
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,439
You want me to flip?

229
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,451
Get my family killed?
What the hell are you thinking?

230
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,102
You gonna cooperate? Yes or no.

231
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,229
Yes or no?

232
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,347
Fine. But no jail time.

233
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,683
I'm 47 years old.
I can't go back to prison.

234
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,952
I won't go back.

235
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:13,698
I'm gonna walk. I want full immunity.

236
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,890
All right, I'll see what I can do.

237
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,461
You just keep your mouth shut
or I'll bury you behind this.

238
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,175
Good news, Sarge.
I just talked to Carter.

239
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,311
- I told you he lawyered up.
- I know.

240
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,823
I had an angle, so I took a run at him.

241
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,147
What are you talking about?

242
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,216
Listen, he said he'll flip

243
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,311
if we can work out a good deal.

244
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,220
How good?

245
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,822
- He wants full immunity.
- That's it?

246
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:50,592
What about a beach house
in Malibu? A new Tesla?

247
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,037
Look, I'm just telling you what he said.

248
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,595
He's got two felony priors.

249
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,030
Unless his supplier is Pablo Escobar,

250
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,123
he can forget about it.

251
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,710
There's gotta be
something we can work out.

252
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,538
Antonio, it's an election year.

253
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,071
No one is gonna kick

254
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,739
a known pill dealer with two priors.

255
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,007
The optics are terrible.

256
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,211
Since when do you care about optics?

257
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,946
What the hell is going on?

258
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,383
What do you mean?

259
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,885
You don't look so good, bro.

260
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,719
Something you want to tell me?

261
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,144
I'm fine.

262
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,431
Yeah, listen...
I want you to move Carter.

263
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,200
I don't want Antonio anywhere near him.

264
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,653
You understand?

265
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,916
Thanks, Trudy.

266
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,050
Yo.

267
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:50,718
Looking for some Oxy.

268
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,554
Don't carry that.

269
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,089
- How about Vicodin?
- I got rocks and blow.

270
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,634
That's it, <i>jefe.</i>

271
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:00,995
Give me a dime of H.

272
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,433
My man over there will hook you up.

273
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,421
Give it to me.

274
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,699
Hank, what the hell are you doing?

275
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,190
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

276
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,435
Come on, don't make a jerk out of me.

277
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,593
What are you doing?

278
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,828
Get off of me! Get off of me!

279
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,938
Uh, hey, you should know...

280
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,116
It's all right, it's all right.

281
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,307
- No, wait, look...
- Hey.

282
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,485
I was meeting up with a CI and he...

283
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:48,943
- Don't do that.
- No, I was...

284
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,845
I was meeting with a CI.
Hey, don't do that.

285
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,357
Listen to me.

286
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,049
I'm gonna help get you through this.

287
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,619
I don't need help.

288
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,320
- I don't need any help.
- Come on, hey.

289
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,955
It's all right.

290
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,158
Hey.

291
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,793
Come on.

292
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,464
Come on.

293
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,666
It's gonna be fine.

294
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,334
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.

295
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,303
I don't know what the hell happened.

296
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,522
It's gonna be all right.

297
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,975
No, it... it's not.

298
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,640
- That dealer, Carter...
- Yeah.

299
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,683
- I know him.
- Okay.

300
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,065
He was giving me pills.

301
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,224
I...

302
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:39,112
You promised you'd look out, right?

303
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:40,995
It's okay.

304
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,930
Listen... hey.

305
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,365
We're gonna deal with that, too.

306
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,668
We're gonna deal with that.

307
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,169
Listen to me.

308
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,504
Listen.

309
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,910
Right now we gotta get you clean, okay?

310
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,459
I...

311
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,212
I'm gonna take you home.

312
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:01,182
I'm gonna take care of you. okay?

313
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,584
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

314
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,638
It's okay.

315
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,351
It's okay.

316
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,292
There's nothing there.

317
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,652
Come on, pack your bag.

318
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,554
You're going into rapid detox today.

319
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,222
I don't think that's a good idea.

320
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:44,225
Yeah, well, I'm not asking.

321
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,494
Look, I'll cover for you
while you're gone.

322
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,730
Won't go any further than this room.

323
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,075
It's Eva. She's cooking dinner tonight.

324
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,678
- Hm.
- Hey, sweetie.

325
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,823
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

326
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:07,909
Who is this?

327
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:10,718
What?

328
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,620
What are you... what are you talk...

329
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,255
Put Eva on the phone!

330
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,542
Hey, put her on the phone!

331
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,659
What's going on?

332
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,198
I think someone
just kidnapped my daughter.

333
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,190
Antonio.

334
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,942
All right, the team's here.

335
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,153
Come on.

336
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,532
Just get your head on straight.
Eva needs you.

337
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,201
Yeah.

338
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:53,153
Yeah.

339
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:57,657
So Antonio got a call from Eva at 1:24.

340
00:16:57,691 --> 00:17:00,827
Then the last call from Eva's phone
was from the kidnapper at 2:21.

341
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:02,128
I called OCD Tech Lab

342
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,130
and put an emergency ping on Eva's phone.

343
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:06,132
Already checked all
the outside doors and windows.

344
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,377
There's no sign of forced entry.

345
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,601
There's no sign of struggle

346
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,936
- outside the house either.
- No.

347
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,604
That's because she never made it home.

348
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,806
She always puts her backpack

349
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,841
right here on the kitchen counter.

350
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,010
It's not here, so...

351
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,479
I mean, you sure it's not
something to do with school?

352
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,648
Maybe a boy from school?

353
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,820
The guy on the phone
said I made a mistake.

354
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:28,656
That dealer, Paddy Carter?

355
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,458
He wasn't supposed to get arrested.

356
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:32,793
That's because
I wasn't at that drug house

357
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,246
to do a buy-bust.

358
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:38,249
I was there to score Oxy for me.

359
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,313
Hm.

360
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,676
I'm sorry, guys.

361
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,352
I assume I'm free to go.

362
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,257
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

363
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,426
- Antonio Dawson's daughter.
- "Daughter"?

364
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,704
What the hell are you talking about?

365
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,362
You had a deal with Antonio.

366
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:11,665
You think he screwed you so you
had someone grab his daughter.

367
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,701
You think I'm stupid?

368
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:15,035
I'm trying to get out of jail.

369
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,837
Why would I kidnap a cop's daughter?

370
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,874
You better be telling the truth, Paddy.

371
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:21,876
Or you and me?

372
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,211
We're gonna have a problem.

373
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:33,053
No, no. Antonio, wait.

374
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:34,855
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

375
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,390
I told you, stay upstairs.

376
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:37,858
What'd he say, Hank?

377
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,460
Nothing.

378
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,562
He said he had no idea
what we were talking about.

379
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:43,364
- He's lying.
- Maybe not.

380
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:45,366
I checked the logs.
He hasn't had any visitors

381
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,234
or phone calls since he's been in lockup.

382
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:48,602
You check the security cameras?

383
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:50,237
I did. Until now, the only person

384
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:52,139
he talked to was you,
and we should probably

385
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,075
make sure that conversation
is accidentally erased.

386
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,244
Okay, we'll take care of that later.

387
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,954
Come on, let's go.

388
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,875
Okay, so the question is...

389
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,920
do we want to do this off the books,

390
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,955
or do we want to involve CPD and FBI?

391
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:09,390
But if we go big,

392
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,935
you're gonna have to
come clean about everything.

393
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,103
I don't care about any of that.

394
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,594
I just want to find Eva.

395
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,929
I'll do whatever you want,

396
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,430
whatever gives us the best chances.

397
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,811
Jay, what do you got?

398
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:25,306
Good. Chase it down.

399
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,841
Jay and Hailey just found a witness.

400
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,280
I heard somebody screaming.

401
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,649
I looked out my window,
I saw a man and a woman

402
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:36,817
up near the alley.

403
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:38,118
Why didn't you call it in?

404
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:39,787
It looked like they were in an argument.

405
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:40,965
You don't call the cops every time

406
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:42,923
somebody gets into a beef.

407
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,625
It was right here.

408
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,427
They went up the alley.

409
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,805
I didn't see what happened after that.

410
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,597
Can you describe the man?

411
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,366
White guy, blue jacket.

412
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,968
I've seen her around the neighborhood

413
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,469
but I've never seen him before.

414
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:56,887
Jay?

415
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:08,983
- What do we got?
- We pinged Eva's phone.

416
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,618
It was recovered on the median of I-94

417
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:11,819
near the Damen underpass.

418
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,188
I guess he tossed it out the window.

419
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,499
Fortunately the nearest camera is

420
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,324
- two mile markers up the highway.
- Prints?

421
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,526
Not yet, but we did
hand-deliver it to the lab, so...

422
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,072
We pulled surveillance from an apartment

423
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,030
two blocks from Antonio's house.

424
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:26,000
It matches the timeline
of the kidnapping.

425
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:30,514
Are you sure you want to see this?

426
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,089
Play it.

427
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,027
Okay, right there.

428
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,607
Should be able to pull the plate.

429
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,732
Run that plate.

430
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:04,038
All right, vehicle's
registered to a Jason Rizzo.

431
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,673
Antonio, you recognize this guy?

432
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:07,074
He looks familiar.

433
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:08,352
I think he might have worked with Carter.

434
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:09,720
He's got two priors for possession,

435
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,712
one for aggravated battery, and...

436
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,982
he did two years in Stateville
for statutory rape.

437
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,522
Address is in Uptown. 804 Christopher.

438
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:23,891
All right, listen up,
before we make our first move

439
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:26,393
I'm gonna make something crystal clear.

440
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:28,295
From this moment on,
we are off the books.

441
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,798
You want to walk, walk now.

442
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,067
No one's gonna judge you.

443
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,281
Let's go get Eva.

444
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,749
Clear.

445
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,789
- Show me your hands!
- Okay, okay, okay!

446
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,000
Who are you? What do you want?

447
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,358
- Get up!
- Okay!

448
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,026
Come here. Come here. Where's Rizzo?

449
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,328
Uh, he's not here.

450
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,330
- Where is he?
- I don't know, I swear!

451
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:38,499
- Why were you hiding?
- Because I'm scared of Rizzo!

452
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,767
He's an addict.

453
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,113
I've been trying to kick him out
for a month but he won't leave!

454
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:43,314
When's the last time you seen him?

455
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:44,772
About an hour ago.

456
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,050
I told him that I was
gonna change the locks

457
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,441
and he said that he'd kill me.

458
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:49,376
- Was he with anybody?
- I don't know.

459
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,979
Whenever he's around, I stay
in here with the door locked.

460
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:54,067
Sit down, shut up. Don't move.

461
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,396
Antonio?

462
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,825
There's something in the garage
we need you to take a look at.

463
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:07,763
It's Eva's.

464
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,582
So along with the backpack we found, uh,

465
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:20,692
zip ties, duct tape.

466
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,420
Standard kidnap kit.

467
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:26,123
The blood on the rag is fresh.

468
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:29,459
Okay, so that means
that Eva was just here.

469
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,168
So let's hit the streets,
find some witnesses.

470
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:36,838
Come on, pull it together. Let's go.

471
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,293
Dawson.

472
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:41,009
Hey.

473
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,978
Put it on speaker.

474
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,855
Who am I talking to?

475
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:46,125
<i>You're talking to the guy who's gonna</i>

476
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,116
<i>put a bullet in your daughter's head</i>

477
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:49,885
<i>if Paddy Carter don't walk.</i>

478
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,186
I'm working on it.

479
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,631
It's... it's gonna take a little longer.

480
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:55,190
<i>You got four hours, Detective.</i>

481
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:57,392
Don't... don't hang up.

482
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:59,361
I need proof of life.

483
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:01,129
<i>What's that mean?</i>

484
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:04,032
I need to know my daughter's alive.

485
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:07,702
<i>No, you need to release Paddy Carter.</i>

486
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,538
No, I need to know my daughter's alive.

487
00:25:09,572 --> 00:25:12,707
If I don't hear her voice,
then you got no deal!

488
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,910
<i>Daddy, please help me! Help me!</i>

489
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:16,344
<i>Shut up!</i>

490
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,979
<i>- Let me go!
- Sweetie, don't worry.</i>

491
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,738
<i>- Dad!
- I'm coming for you.</i>

492
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:21,316
<i>- Help! Help me!
- You just be strong.</i>

493
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,151
<i>Shut up! You got four hours,</i>

494
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,220
<i>Detective, or I kill her.</i>

495
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:26,555
Hang on, hang on, hey-hey-hey.

496
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:28,223
Let's... let's figure this out.

497
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:29,891
You and me, let's... come on, man.

498
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,927
Hey, you there?

499
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:33,061
Rizzo?

500
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,196
Hey, you there?

501
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,531
Hey, hey. He hung up.

502
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,678
All right, we're already
up on Antonio's phone.

503
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,068
I want you to trace that call.

504
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:41,436
Let's hit the streets.

505
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,038
We're gonna find some witnesses.

506
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:44,651
Let's go.

507
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,583
- Keep Antonio away.
- Copy that.

508
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:56,418
- I want my lawyer.
- Step back.

509
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:59,120
- Hey, where's my lawyer?
- Jason Rizzo is your cousin!

510
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:02,524
- So?
- So he kidnapped Eva Dawson.

511
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:04,020
Wait, what the hell are you talking...

512
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:06,595
You told him to kidnap Dawson's daughter!

513
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,296
No, I didn't, I swear... ow!

514
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:10,632
His only ask was that you walk.

515
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,434
Why would he do that on his own?

516
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:14,402
Because he's an idiot and an addict,

517
00:26:14,437 --> 00:26:16,582
and every time I try to help him
out, it bites me in the ass.

518
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,473
How does Rizzo know Antonio?

519
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,375
Because he's been helping me out lately.

520
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,054
Okay, he knows the deal
that I have with Antonio.

521
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:24,112
He delivered a package
to his house last week.

522
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:26,781
Look, he probably only
wants me out to get more drugs.

523
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:30,218
He doesn't think
right in the head, this kid.

524
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,254
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

525
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,622
All I can tell you is

526
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:35,790
if you don't do what this monster says,

527
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,292
he'll kill her.

528
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,717
Where you going, boss?

529
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,115
Hey, Sam.

530
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,950
Thank you for meeting me.

531
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:03,285
Listen, I heard you caught

532
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,686
that pill case we just brought in.

533
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,632
Yeah, it's a good one.
I'm looking forward to it.

534
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,824
- Yeah, well, I need a favor.
- Name it.

535
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:13,161
I want you to let Carter walk on this.

536
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,665
Look, there were some
unintended consequences

537
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:19,467
to that bust, and I can't
get into the details right now.

538
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:23,104
But the only way
to fix it is to kick Carter.

539
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,340
Look, maybe I can hold off
the probable cause hearing,

540
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,675
buy you guys some time.

541
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:29,844
It's gotta be within
the next three hours.

542
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,613
It's election season.

543
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,558
Every candidate in Chicago's
stomping on each other

544
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:35,450
trying to prove they're tougher on crime.

545
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:36,862
I'm not sure I can make that happen.

546
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:40,655
Look, one of my guys is jammed up bad.

547
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,124
I need this.

548
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,794
- It's a tough ask.
- I know.

549
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:49,526
But you know I'll make it up
to you down the road.

550
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,534
Okay.

551
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:55,470
Uh, I'll recommend expedited release

552
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:58,493
based off of insufficient evidence, huh?

553
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,165
Thank you.

554
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,317
- Parked in the same place.
- Uh-huh.

555
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:12,354
- Any word yet?
- Nothing yet.

556
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,253
Voight said it was a done deal.
What's taking so long?

557
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,924
I'll make some calls, see what I can do.

558
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,092
Antonio, Antonio.

559
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:18,693
- Antonio.
- Antonio?

560
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,729
Hey. Where the hell's Eva?

561
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:22,197
I've been calling her all afternoon

562
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,478
and she doesn't pick up.
She's not at the house.

563
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,858
What is that?

564
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,575
"Taken."

565
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:35,877
- You... you mean kidnapped?
- Yeah.

566
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,923
It happened right after school,
so... but don't worry.

567
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,748
- We're, you know...
- No, no, no-no-no.

568
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:41,619
You're... you're wrong.
She's just with a friend.

569
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:43,551
She's... did you try
calling Grace or Noa?

570
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:45,063
She's not... she's not at a friend's.

571
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:46,388
Well maybe she's with a boy.

572
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:47,766
She was always afraid
to tell you about boys

573
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,134
because you get
so freaked out all the time...

574
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,125
No! She's not with a boy.

575
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,259
Listen... listen to me.

576
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:52,927
She was kidnapped.

577
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,964
This can't be happening again.

578
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,433
- Look...
- No, no, no, Tony, it can't.

579
00:28:58,467 --> 00:28:59,945
- Listen...
- This can't be happening again.

580
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,903
Listen, I promise I'm gonna find her.

581
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:05,039
I told you to quit this job
when they took Diego.

582
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:07,108
There were a million
other things you could have...

583
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:10,732
We got Diego back
and we're gonna get Eva...

584
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,454
You chose this job over your family.

585
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,233
I hope it was worth it.

586
00:29:35,604 --> 00:29:37,901
Come on in Hank.

587
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:42,417
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Kate...

588
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:44,831
The ASA wants to kick the guy
we just busted

589
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,633
for selling opioids
on your recommendation?

590
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,834
I know what it looks like.

591
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,336
One of the ODs in the neighborhood

592
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,039
is a kid that goes to school
with Brian Kelton's kids.

593
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,807
Listen, I can't get into the details...

594
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,942
His entire campaign is run

595
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,269
on tough on crime, tough on drugs.

596
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:58,738
I get it.

597
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,848
Look, one of my guys has a problem.

598
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,984
I mean, a real problem.

599
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,720
The only way to fix it
is to kick Carter, Kate.

600
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm asking you a favor.

601
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,061
I'm sorry, truly.

602
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,162
My hands are tied.

603
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,564
Kelton just did a press
conference on the Carter bust

604
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,566
an hour ago. He already rang the bell.

605
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,301
There's nothing I can do, Hank.

606
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,522
You got 30 seconds
to give me something good,

607
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:45,076
something that helps me find Rizzo,

608
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
or today's gonna be the day

609
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,330
you end up hanging yourself
with your own shirt.

610
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:51,539
I don't know anything.

611
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,614
I'm the one getting
screwed here, not... not Dawson.

612
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,113
Tell me where Rizzo is,

613
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:07,881
who he runs with,

614
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:12,145
who might help him,
give him money, a car.

615
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,855
Give me something, Paddy,

616
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,290
or I'll choke you out right here and now.

617
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,903
Okay, okay, just let me go.

618
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,969
- Ah... ah...
- Start talking, Paddy.

619
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,871
Okay, okay, let me just catch my breath.

620
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,723
- Start talking!
- There's a... there's a guy.

621
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,030
His name is Gary.

622
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,243
He's got a scrap yard out in Cicero.

623
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,255
They like to go out there
to get drunk and get high.

624
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,746
That's all you got? Nothing else?

625
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,424
No, nothing.

626
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:44,551
They find Dawson's daughter,
that mean I get released?

627
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:49,122
That means you might get to live.

628
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,440
You Gary McCoy?

629
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,008
Yeah?

630
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,353
When was the last time you talked to

631
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:10,954
your friend, Jason Rizzo?

632
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:14,147
- None of your business.
- That's the wrong answer.

633
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,782
I'm gonna look around over here.

634
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,150
You talk to him today?

635
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,819
You got a warrant or something?

636
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,587
I don't need a warrant
to ask you questions.

637
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:22,989
Questions about a kidnapping.
What do you know about that?

638
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,292
I fix cars and I drink beer.

639
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,827
Right.

640
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,638
Yo, check this out.

641
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,831
Rizzo's car back there.

642
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,966
Oh, you'd better start talking fast,

643
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,367
'cause things are gonna go bad.

644
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,544
"Go bad"?

645
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,188
The hell are you gonna do about it?

646
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,506
Rizzo switched out his car here.

647
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,541
- What'd you give him, Gary?
- Make and model.

648
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,009
We need it now.

649
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,054
I don't know what you're talking about.

650
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,278
You're not going anywhere.

651
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:46,279
Do not grab me, lady.

652
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:48,215
Hey! Come here. Come here.

653
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,493
The hell is wrong with you, huh?

654
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:50,684
Say you're sorry.

655
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,185
- Say you're sorry!
- It's fine!

656
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,987
We're talking about
a kidnapping, here, Gary.

657
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,856
That's life in prison
for Rizzo and for you

658
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,990
if you don't cooperate.

659
00:32:57,024 --> 00:32:59,626
What car did you give Rizzo?

660
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,129
Car's out front.

661
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:06,466
- Rizzo's in Room 201.
- Okay, listen up.

662
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,368
We're moving in fast and dark.

663
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:10,470
This offender is armed and dangerous,

664
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,506
so you all have a green light.

665
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,875
Let's hit it. Antonio.

666
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:17,244
I need you to hang back, bro.

667
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:18,989
Hank, there's nothing
you can do or say right now

668
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,848
that's gonna keep me from going in there.
I'm going in first.

669
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,464
Go.

670
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,036
Watch out, watch out.

671
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:53,154
Eva!

672
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:54,680
Eva!

673
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,450
All right, come on. Get up!

674
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:58,795
Get up and put your head on the wall.

675
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,987
- Hands up.
- Okay, all right.

676
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,931
Sweetie?

677
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,768
It's Daddy. It's Daddy.

678
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,736
I'm here, I'm here. Can you hear me?

679
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,807
Can you hear me?

680
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,316
50-21, roll an ambulance

681
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,311
to 1900 Fisher now.

682
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,880
<i>Copy that.</i>

683
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,334
You're gonna be okay. You're safe now.

684
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,637
Just stay strong, sweetie.
I'm gonna take care of you.

685
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,342
Hey.

686
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,594
How's she doing?

687
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,220
- Any serious injuries?
- Not sure.

688
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,554
We need to do more tests,

689
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:45,133
but she appears to be
in stable condition.

690
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:46,724
I saw scratches on her face, and I saw

691
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,493
some down below by her waist and legs.

692
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:51,262
Do you know if...
did she say if the offender...

693
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:52,763
No, she didn't say anything.

694
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:55,099
But when we get to Med,
we'll do a rape kit.

695
00:34:58,337 --> 00:34:59,637
Rizzo is still in the wind.

696
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:01,138
Yeah, but his truck's still here.

697
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:02,517
You know, maybe
he got spooked when we rolled in

698
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,574
and took off on foot.

699
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:04,775
All right, so let's fan out.

700
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,611
Talk to witnesses, look for cameras,

701
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,246
do whatever we gotta do.

702
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,049
Just find this prick.

703
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,969
We're gonna get you
all the help you need.

704
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,961
- Nothing to worry about.
- I'm sorry, Dad, I...

705
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,130
I shouldn't have let him
push me in that car.

706
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:27,598
No, no, no.

707
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:29,267
Don't blame yourself.

708
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,370
It's not your fault. It's his.

709
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:33,838
And we're gonna find him.

710
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:35,783
He's gonna pay for what he did.

711
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:39,810
Do you know, did... did he say anything?

712
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,547
- Was he gonna meet someone or...
- No.

713
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:45,116
No, he just wanted drugs.

714
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,651
He's a loser.

715
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:48,546
He's an addict.

716
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:53,190
He took my ATM card,

717
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:55,326
made me tell him the PIN.

718
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,061
He was gonna buy drugs.

719
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,996
Meth, I think.

720
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,565
Okay.

721
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,311
That's good. That's good.

722
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:07,939
ATM.

723
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,144
- Hey, what's up?
- Not here.

724
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:14,812
CPD, bro. Did this man come in here

725
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,563
and get some cash out the ATM?

726
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:18,416
Yeah, he was here like ten minutes ago.

727
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,818
Okay, did he pull up
in a car or was he on foot?

728
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,186
Uh, he was walking,

729
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,731
and he looked like
he was in bad shape, too.

730
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:25,233
If anybody wanted to score around here,

731
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:26,591
where would they go?

732
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,992
Uh, the old factory.

733
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,927
Lots of drugs, lots of junkies.

734
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:31,829
Looks like one of those zombie movies.

735
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,432
Me and Burgess found the store

736
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:35,866
where Rizzo got his cash.

737
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:38,402
We're going to a drug spot
near the old factory.

738
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:39,837
Ten minutes away.

739
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,402
There he is.

740
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:10,735
Chicago PD!

741
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,452
Stop running!

742
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:34,592
- Put 'em down!
- Get off me!

743
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:37,161
- Get off me!
- Hey!

744
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,796
Come on now!

745
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,765
Make a move. Please.

746
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,266
Come on, you won't do it.

747
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,611
- Then move.
- Come on, I want you to do it!

748
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,269
Reach for something. Hey!

749
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:46,337
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

750
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,605
Whoa, hey, hey.

751
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,006
What are you doing? We got this.

752
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,508
Just give me five minutes with him.

753
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,477
- No, Antonio.
- Five minutes.

754
00:37:55,814 --> 00:37:56,781
Give me your gun.

755
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:58,968
Quit struggling.

756
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,012
Adam.

757
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,121
What's up? You want to talk?

758
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:18,803
Hey, hey, hey!

759
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,371
Hey! Whoa, whoa.

760
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,806
Whoa, whoa, easy.

761
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,140
Come on. That's enough.

762
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,043
That's enough. That's enough, it's over!

763
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:28,846
- Hey, whoa.
- Get up.

764
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,501
How old is Eva anyway?

765
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,819
She 18 yet?

766
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:38,055
She was good.

767
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,196
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

768
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:50,812
Whoa, what the hell just happened?

769
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:54,171
Antonio.

770
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,750
- He got what he deserved.
- Hey, hey...

771
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:57,575
- He took my daughter.
- Hey, Antonio.

772
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:58,853
You gotta shut up and listen to me.

773
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,077
Are you clean right now?

774
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:02,079
- What?
- Hey, look at me.

775
00:39:02,114 --> 00:39:03,179
Be honest.

776
00:39:03,214 --> 00:39:04,682
I don't have time to play games.

777
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:07,585
- Antonio!
- Today.

778
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,819
It was a few hours ago.

779
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,832
I needed a little energy so I...

780
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:12,857
Whoa, stop talking.

781
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,465
What the hell are we gonna do?

782
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:43,748
