1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,710
Okay, I've fed you.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,780
Now, who's ready to watch some basketball?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,830
Why am I looking at you?

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,610
I don't know.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,560
Unlike you, I don't need a reason

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,370
to watch a bunch of guys run around in shorts.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,600
Don't ruin this for me like you did

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,800
with Olympic diving.

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,160
- Cam?   - Recording it.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,570
Mitch and I are taking Alex and Manny to an art exhibit.

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,630
But, of course, everybody is welcome to join.

12
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,950
It's a retrospective on post-war abstract expressionism.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,950
Wait. For school?

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,070
No, for life.

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,110
Oh, thank God.

16
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,110
I don't even know who we fought

17
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,330
in the post war.

18
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,180
Told you one car was enough.

19
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,860
Looks like it's just the two amigos.

20
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,500
Haley?

21
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,070
Oh, sorry to brunch and bail, grandpa,

22
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,310
but I've got a date.

23
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,560
Uh, with whom?

24
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,370
A gorgeous guy I met at school.

25
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,020
Ooh, goes there or cleans there?

26
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,710
Mom.

27
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,550
Answer the question.

28
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,560
So everyone's leaving?

29
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,530
No, I'm -- I'm not.

30
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,150
I wish I had known this before I served the good bacon.

31
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,820
You did not serve the good bacon.

32
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,830
Don't you have a tiny dress to buy?

33
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,880
Yes, we do!

34
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,150
We asked Gloria to take Lily

35
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,850
to pick out her flower-girl dress.

36
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,450
Yeah, we're clearly not following every wedding tradition,

37
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,530
but there will damn sure be one dress

38
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,300
the grooms don't see until the big day.

39
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,600
And we also asked Claire to go

40
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,950
because we thought her sensible style

41
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,170
nicely complements Gloria's flair.

42
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
That way Lily doesn't end up looking too...

43
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,730
or too...

48
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,720
There's my boy.

49
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I know you're talking to Joe,

50
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,310
but that still feels really good to hear.

51
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,390
Okay, clocking out.

52
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,070
You know, Andy, if you want,

53
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,590
you can stay and watch the game.

54
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,470
Otherwise, I'll just be here by myself.

55
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,060
I'm right here.

56
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,350
I-I'd love to, Mr. P,

57
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,890
but I got to come up with an anniversary gift for my girlfriend.

58
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,240
I make her something different every year,

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,690
like a scrapbook or a nice scarf.

60
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,300
This year,

61
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,750
I was thinking maybe I could bake her some banana bread.

62
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,350
Ohh, I am the king of banana bread.

63
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,500
You know my secret?

64
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,610
No nuts.

65
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,300
Not such a secret.

66
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,390
I used to make stuff for Claire all the time.

67
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,400
Pretty sure my artistry is what locked her down.

68
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,780
I got to make this year's special.

69
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,590
With her in the coast guard,

70
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,670
I, like, hardly ever get to see her.

71
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,840
Well, this is just off the dome,

72
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,290
but, uh, maybe send her a fun video?

73
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,100
Ooh, she does love "Rock of Ages."

74
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,130
Or you could make your own video --

75
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,670
something romantic and personal

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,010
with real production value.

77
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,950
I got some pretty choice equipment back at the house.

78
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,030
I'd be happy to help.

79
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,570
- Would you really? - Yeah!

80
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,760
Yes!

81
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,110
Great! Let's do it!

82
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,590
Luke, buddy, I'll pick you up later.

83
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,870
We can go check out some wheels.

84
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,100
I thought you were gonna stay and watch the game.

85
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,220
I knew you loved me.

86
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,790
Get out!

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,920
Come on.

88
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,600
Wheels? What, are you looking at cars already?

89
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Pottery wheels.

90
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,660
I have to pick a spring elective,

91
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,890
and dad thinks I should take ceramics

92
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,060
'cause lots of girls do.

93
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,700
You know what a lot of girls don't do?

94
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,320
Guys who take ceramics.

95
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,090
You got a wood shop at your school?

96
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,460
I can't really build stuff.

97
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,280
I mostly take apart and apologize.

98
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,870
You got to know how to build things.

99
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,170
I can build suspense.

100
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,850
How?

101
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,210
Well, get this.

102
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,450
Garage. Now.

103
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,030
What's a bridal store?

104
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,970
It's a place with the most wonderful dresses that you have ever seen.

105
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,270
We're gonna get you the perfect one

106
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,650
even if it takes us all day.

107
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,450
Found it.

108
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,920
Oh, no, sweetie. That's a costume.

109
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
You can't wear a costume to a wedding.

110
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,000
Why not? Belle's a princess.

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,020
She faced the beast.

112
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,670
She stood up to the townspeople.

113
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,480
What have you done?

114
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,860
I...got us into that tiny,

115
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,430
little parking spot.

116
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,690
Princess dresses are not the only pretty dresses.

117
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,140
I want to be a princess.

118
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,330
I want to be a princess!

119
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,690
Stop that right now.

120
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,230
Your dads want you to have a flower-girl dress,

121
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,590
and that's what we're going to get you.

122
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,720
So march.

123
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,340
It was...it was marked "Compact" and --

124
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,820
and we're driving a minivan, so...

125
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,330
Hey, thanks for inviting us to this.

126
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,350
Oh, no problem.

127
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,030
You know, I'm surprised that this particular foursome

128
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,890
doesn't hang out more often, considering --

129
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,380
We're the cultured ones in the family?

130
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,480
I wouldn't say that.

131
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Outside of this group.

132
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,870
Did you know your father

133
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,070
actually goes to the grocery store to buy books?

134
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,450
I did know that, yeah.

135
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,470
I also know that the best way

136
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,060
to get my sister to fall asleep is to --

137
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,640
Show her a movie with subtitles.

138
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,530
Bonne nuit, mama.

139
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,990
We should be nice and grateful

140
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,540
that we have this day to spend together

141
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,210
in our own private salon.

142
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't tell my mom that.

143
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,320
She'll show up and ask to get her roots done.

144
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,680
- Manny! - That's true. It's true.

145
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,090
Thanks, manny.

146
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,080
I am so excited for this exhibit.

147
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm such an admirer of Kandinsky.

148
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,150
You know, he was credited

149
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,010
with painting the first truly abstract work.

150
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,010
Is that so?

151
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,780
To be honest, I was a little nervous

152
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,080
about holding my own with those three,

153
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,490
so I did a little boning up on Kandinsky.

154
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,250
Figured it couldn't hurt to have a few facts in my pocket.

155
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,190
My backup plan was to touch a painting and get thrown out.

156
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,640
Miss, hi. Excuse me.

157
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
Can you tell us where the Kandinsky exhibit is?

158
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,310
You know, Wassily Kandinsky?

159
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,120
Born in Moscow, son of a tea merchant?

160
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,150
I'm sorry. That exhibit was temporary.

161
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,980
It's closed.

162
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,900
What?

163
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,810
No.

164
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,810
Oh, I love this Matisse.

165
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,370
You know this is one of his final works.

166
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,680
His failing health led to his exploration of paper cutouts.

167
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,330
Ah, yes. I believe he called it "Painting with scissors."

168
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,380
And he was also a contemporary of Picasso.

169
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,160
You can definitely see how they influenced each other.

170
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,220
Right, Cam?

171
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Uh, well, you know, it really reminds me...

172
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,230
Of, uh, Kandinsky.

173
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,690
How so?

174
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,730
Well, not so much in look, more in texture.

175
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,680
No, no, Cam!

176
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,690
No, please, sir, don't touch the art.

177
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm sorry. I'll leave the premises.

178
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,850
No, it's -- it's fine.

179
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,840
Just take a few steps back.

180
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,500
Beth, I would swim the deepest, sharkiest oceans

181
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,820
to be with you.

182
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,730
What are you doing?

183
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,910
Cut!

184
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,840
Well, now we have a blooper reel.

185
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,440
We're making a video love letter for Andy's girlfriend.

186
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,980
Your dad uses his computer to put in cool backgrounds

187
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,720
while I act out all the things that

188
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,640
I would do to be with her,

189
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,260
like swim an ocean or climb a mountain.

190
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,000
Ooh, how about you buy a plane ticket

191
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,620
and visit her like a normal person?

192
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,610
I would, but the coast guard keeps her really busy.

193
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,530
Eyes. Does she like it?

194
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,760
She's probably so lonely with only two other women

195
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,970
to talk to in her whole 40-person unit.

196
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,740
So you're saying it's just your girlfriend

197
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,640
and 36 super in-shape dudes?

198
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,650
37. And it's not what you think.

199
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,170
The coast guard seriously frowns on fraternizing.

200
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,930
It's forbidden.

201
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,310
That doesn't make it hot.

202
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,360
Oh, I got some on your face.

203
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,970
You're gonna shine.

204
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,170
I'll go get some of my -- Claire's powder.

205
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,760
My Claire. She's my wife.

206
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,190
I thought you had a date to go on.

207
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,460
I do.

208
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,150
When's he gonna get here?

209
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,110
Whenever he does.

210
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,200
He's just, like, a few minutes late.

211
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,770
I'm sorry.

212
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,540
That is so rude.

213
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,510
A real man would be more considerate of your time.

214
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,660
You're right.

215
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,460
That's why every year People magazine

216
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,900
names the "Consideratest" man alive.

217
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,730
Oh, man, you can make fun of me all you want,

218
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,020
but when you grow up,

219
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,920
you'll see what qualities make up a real man.

220
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,030
Someone say "Makeup"?

221
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,140
I did.

222
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,330
All right, here we go.

223
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,590
Oh, yeah. Much better.

224
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,590
You know what? I think I'm gonna shadow down here.

225
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,310
Gloria, you are gonna love this one.

226
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,110
I think we have finally found the perfect dress.

227
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,340
Ta-da.

228
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,690
It's nice, but I don't like the bow.

229
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,980
Let's try more.

230
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,330
We've tried on six dresses already.

231
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,830
She's fine with this. Right, Lily?

232
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,930
I don't care.

233
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,660
See? She loves it. Done.

234
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,350
Go try the lace one.

235
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,640
Seriously?

236
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,360
This is endless.

237
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,110
Why are you dragging this out?

238
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,990
Because we haven't found the right dress.

239
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,890
You have got to be a better shopper than this.

240
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,420
I have seen you buy three outfits while driving a car.

241
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
Come on. It's fun.

242
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,550
I don't have any daughters.

243
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,620
All I get to buy is tuxedos,

244
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,960
and they all look the same.

245
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,040
But don't tell Manny that

246
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,310
because I don't want to hear another lecture.

247
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,810
It's funny.

248
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,320
I have never cared about any of this stuff.

249
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,220
I didn't even wear a wedding dress when I married Phil.

250
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,600
Never even tried one on.

251
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,660
Easy. That is the reaction

252
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,340
for when there's a man behind me with a gun.

253
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,350
All I said is I don't care about wedding dresses.

254
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,500
Because you've never been in one.

255
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,170
I'm gonna pick some for you to try.

256
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,750
Okay, no, no. No need.

257
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,520
Come on, you'll feel beautiful.

258
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,010
Then you can go back to your...boy clothes.

259
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,870
I bought this shirt for Luke and I couldn't return it.

260
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,820
And I don't have all day to try on dresses.

261
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, and I do?

262
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,660
It'll be fun for me.

263
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,480
You're my stepdaughter.

264
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm older than you.

265
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,110
You see? It's already fun.

266
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,160
We're gonna start by building a simple toolbox.

267
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,310
First, I'm gonna show you how to cut the wood.

268
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,340
I know you're a little young for this, goober.

269
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,630
Try to soak it all up.

270
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,500
What's this thing?

271
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,390
A table vise.

272
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,820
Table vise, ta--

273
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,760
No.

274
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,520
I already went through this with Mitchell.

275
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,270
That's what we're here to prevent.

276
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,400
Didn't your dad teach you any of this stuff?

277
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,600
He says the only tool you need is a sense of humor.

278
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,860
'Cause who needs the jaws of life

279
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,630
if you have a good knock-knock joke?

280
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,080
Luke, grab the goggles over there, please.

281
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,010
And try to pay attention.

282
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,720
We measure twice,

283
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,140
and we cut once.

284
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,490
Hey, grandpa, can you bench 180 pounds?

285
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,090
I just said pay attention.

286
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,860
And that's actually 205 with the bar.

287
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,330
I'll lift that for you later.

288
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,850
I can see you're not gonna let up about that.

289
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,700
Eh, I'm okay.

290
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,770
Spot me.

291
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,310
Now, if this thing goes south,

292
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,230
I want you to call 911

293
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,760
and tell Joe his old man died as he lived --

294
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,620
saving a trainload of people.

295
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,010
All right. That's enough for now.

296
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,750
Tell me everything you know about women.

297
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,990
Yeah, that last thing.

298
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,250
Funny. Funny. Funny.

299
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,260
I must be a little behind you guys.

300
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,350
His words.

301
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,990
Do you feel what's happening here?

302
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,580
- I feel pinching. - No.

303
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,590
I'm the weak link of this super group.

304
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,010
They know it and I know it.

305
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,370
It's fine when we're all in a big group,

306
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,690
but once we're separated from the herd,

307
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,950
the hooves come out.

308
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't you mean "Claws"?

309
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,010
Clawed animals don't travel in herds, Mitchell.

310
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,610
Packs, flocks, and prides.

311
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,730
Why can't we be on a farm?

312
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,940
I'd make you all look like such idiots.

313
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,000
You know what?

314
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm just gonna wait outside.

315
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,280
Wh-- no. Cam, come on.

316
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,650
You're being silly.

317
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,590
To be perfectly honest,

318
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,630
I-I really needed Cam to stay.

319
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,430
The minute he goes,

320
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,710
I'm the dumb one.

321
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,740
I-I took an art history class once,

322
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,600
but that was just to look at naked Italian dudes, so...

323
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,510
Remember now,

324
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,970
you're in subzero temperatures.

325
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,470
The only thing keeping you warm

326
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,950
is the heat of your fiery passion.

327
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,330
And...go!

328
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,460
My beautiful Beth --

329
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,900
- Colder! - My b-b-beautiful B-Beth.

330
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,280
- Colder! - B-B-B-B--

331
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,500
That's too cold.

332
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,090
That's too cold.

333
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,160
B-B-Beth!

334
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,660
Now we're talking!

335
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,250
You're so beautiful to me!

336
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,450
Yes!

337
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,690
Why am I so intent on helping Andy?

338
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,480
I love filmmaking and I love love.

339
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,370
I guess you could say I enjoy making love on film,

340
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,380
and now I don't have to do it by myself.

341
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,710
Beth, this is my long way of saying I miss you.

342
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,740
Th-- uh. You know, this is weird.

343
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,880
I don't really know where to look.

344
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,670
No, it's not weird.

345
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,510
J-just look deep into my eyes and sweep me off my feet.

346
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,770
All right.

347
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,390
Honey...

348
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,100
Yeah, that's weird.

349
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,740
It is. Yeah.

350
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,170
Haley, honey, can you help us?

351
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,410
I don't think anyone can.

352
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,750
Just let Andy hold you "Officer and a gentleman" style,

353
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,390
and I'll superimpose Beth's face over yours on the computer.

354
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,390
That's insane.

355
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,080
I know. I can do anything with this.

356
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,190
If she's not comfortable

357
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,910
You know what, guys?

358
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,120
This whole thing is really sad and pathetic.

359
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,700
No girl wants a guy that tries this hard.

360
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,840
If I got this video,

361
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,190
I'd call the police.

362
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,730
Some girls actually like guys who are nice to them.

363
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,300
Some girls like 36 of them.

364
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,440
There's 37 of them!

365
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,450
Okay, this is passion.

366
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,080
We can use it.

367
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,430
Andy, pick her up.

368
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,460
All right, let's just get this over with.

369
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh, my gosh, he's actually picking me up! Dad!

370
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,340
It's just for a minute.

371
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,360
Now lock eyes and...

372
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,500
Action.

373
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,490
Honey, this is my long way of saying I miss you.

374
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,400
I don't have to climb a mountain

375
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,880
or swim an ocean to be with you,

376
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,440
'cause you're always with me--

377
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,720
in my thoughts,

378
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,520
my dreams...

379
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,720
my heart.

380
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,850
You deserve more than I could possibly ever give you,

381
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,850
but everything I have is yours.

382
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,210
I love you.

383
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,220
Cut!

384
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,460
That was beautiful.

385
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,140
I really felt that one.

386
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,050
Did you feel that one?

387
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,560
No, I didn't feel anything.

388
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,810
I was talking to Andy.

389
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,950
I know! Put me down, freak!

390
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,070
That really takes me back to my cheerleading days.

391
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,410
How could a guy with so much pain

392
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,910
create such hopeful imagery?

393
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,150
I certainly couldn't paint like that

394
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,220
if my mother was dying of consumption.

395
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,270
The last time she had a cold,

396
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,520
I could barely arrange the flowers on the front table.

397
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,000
You know what I found so interesting?

398
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,610
Was that the first painting and the last painting

399
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,530
were so similar,

400
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,200
and I think that that was intentional,

401
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,590
a comment on the perpetual motion of life.

402
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,030
The first painting was the last painting.

403
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,530
We walked in a circle.

404
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,360
Are you sure?

405
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,130
So...you know, I'm gonna go check on Cam

406
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,060
because he's been alone f-for quite some time.

407
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,370
And, you know, he's probably touching a painting.

408
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,840
N-no, don't go!

409
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,200
We're having such a good time.

410
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,900
I guess it's just you and me now.

411
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,290
It was okay when Cam left

412
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,000
and passed the dunce cap to Mitchell,

413
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,550
but with him gone,

414
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,690
it went to me.

415
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,390
What I would've given to have Luke there.

416
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,560
Ah, Luke.

417
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,820
Sweet as custard and just as smart.

418
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,520
And presto.

419
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,420
Thank you so much, Mr. Dunphy.

420
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,960
I wish I could repay you somehow.

421
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,750
Nah. Next time you're with your girlfriend,

422
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,830
just think of me.

423
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,810
Done.

424
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,480
Later.

425
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
Who's that?

426
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,830
My date.

427
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,650
Your lunch date? It's 5:00.

428
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,620
He fell asleep.

429
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,530
But he texted me right when he woke up.

430
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,120
Well, then, you'd think he'd be well-rested enough

431
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,220
to walk to the front door.

432
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,270
Yeah, a gentleman honks to support the troops,

433
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,690
not summon his girlfriend.

434
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,290
Although my girlfriend is a troop,

435
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,770
so in my case, it's a little confusing.

436
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,730
Oh, my god, it's still talking.

437
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,560
Because it knows you're not being respected.

438
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
- Thank you.  - You bet.

439
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,830
Ugh. You guys don't understand how dating works

440
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,850
in the real world.

441
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,200
What are you talking about?

442
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,490
Look at everything Andy did for Beth today.

443
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,760
I just live my life to make her happy.

444
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,170
I'm gonna give this to the mailman

445
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,480
who's gonna give it to the coast guard,

446
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,890
and by this time tomorrow,

447
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,610
someone in the coast guard's

448
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,570
gonna be giving it to my girlfriend.

449
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,240
Can you imagine the smile on her face

450
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,780
when she takes it all in?

451
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,660
Okay, I'm gonna go while you two replay that in your minds.

452
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,770
Oh, my gosh.

453
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,850
Would you like to re-enact "Gravity"?

454
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,060
Yes. Sandra Bullock!

455
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,790
Dang it!

456
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,390
Good call. That was quick.

457
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,770
That's what I get after I waited for you all afternoon?

458
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,670
Uh...you look good?

459
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,830
I know that.

460
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,940
You were supposed to pick me up hours ago.

461
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,170
You were, like, the first or second person

462
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,580
I texted after I woke up.

463
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,980
Aww! That's so sweet.

464
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,270
Did it even occur to you who comes to the door?

465
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,180
Comes to the door?

466
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,490
A gentleman.

467
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,170
Could you at least open the car door for me?

468
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,950
Now can we go?

469
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,380
You know what?

470
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,460
Go take another nap.

471
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,400
I'd rather wait for someone

472
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,740
who'd walk through a blizzard for me

473
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,130
and only honks to support the troops!

474
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,780
I don't understand you.

475
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,280
Neither do i!

476
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,860
Claire, you look beautiful.

477
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,270
You're glowing.

478
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,960
I'm not glowing.

479
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm sweating.

480
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
Come on.

481
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,510
Look at yourself in the mirror.

482
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,640
Don't tell me that you don't feel gorgeous and special.

483
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,630
You're right.

484
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,820
I am radiant.

485
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,930
Oh, it's like I'm in a...

486
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,780
in a fairy tale or a dream.

487
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,430
Lies!

488
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,800
You're faking it.

489
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,360
Well, I'm sorry!

490
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Look who raised me.

491
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,850
I am my father's daughter...

492
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,720
and also kind of his son.

493
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
And I lied about that being Luke's shirt.

494
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,090
I bought it for myself in three colors.

495
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,870
I am trying to help you out here, Gloria,

496
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,910
But this just isn't me.

497
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,410
You did help me.

498
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,360
I am glad I didn't have daughters.

499
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,110
You know, at least when I take Manny shopping,

500
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,570
we make a day of it.

501
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,960
I don't even have to ask him to twirl

502
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,060
because he just does it.

503
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,600
Vamos, Lily!

504
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,660
Lily?

505
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,880
- Lily? - Lily?

506
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,000
Is she-- no.

507
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,390
No? She's gone. She's gone.

508
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:09,990
- Lily! - Wait. Wait.

509
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,710
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

510
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,390
No, the dress!

511
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
- Lily? - Lily?

512
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

513
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,840
I can't run in these shoes!

514
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,890
I bet you wish you had boy shoes now, huh?

515
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,110
Lily?

516
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,230
- Claire, stop! - What?

517
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,280
- Look! - Oh, my god.

518
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,280
Okay, run, run. Come on. Come on!

519
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,750
She looks so happy.

520
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,830
She does.

521
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,600
Oh, she really does.

522
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,270
They're gonna kill us.

523
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,030
What sort of princess?

524
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,430
The kind that dances with beasts

525
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,630
and won't marry Gaston.

526
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,770
- Really? - What?

527
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,550
It's the only dress she likes.

528
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,890
Lily wants to come to the wedding as Belle.

529
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,470
Makes sense.

530
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,920
She went to Pepper's Seder as Dora the explorer.

531
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,730
I-it's fine.

532
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,890
Are you sure?

533
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,310
Yes. Yes.

534
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,790
A-As long as she's happy.

535
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,610
A gay wedding is hardly the place to stop someone

536
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,380
from being who they want to be.

537
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,240
They said it's fine.

538
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,800
Yay! I'm finally happy!

539
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,280
What?

540
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,780
I saw you twirl.

541
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,870
Oh, I did not.

542
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,540
Yes, you did.

543
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
Such a pretty girl.

544
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Shut up.

545
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,670
You're a girl.

546
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,540
How about that daughter of ours?

547
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,600
She marches to the beat of her own drum, huh?

548
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,460
Yeah. Exactly.

549
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,660
S-so, why are we so concerned

550
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,040
what two nerdy teenagers think of us?

551
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,510
Isn't the true mark of intelligence

552
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,030
being able to admit what you don't know?

553
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,760
Shh. Here comes Manny.

554
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,870
Oh, my god. Did he hear me?

555
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,570
Hey, guys.

556
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,430
Nothin'.

557
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,900
Hey, what are you doing out here?

558
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,130
You guys invited us so we could spend the day together.

559
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,860
It felt wrong that you two are out here

560
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,380
and I was in there all alone with Alex.

561
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
Couldn't keep up, could you?

562
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,250
She knows everything.

563
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,340
She made a docent cry.

564
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,760
It's okay. We're faking it, too.

565
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
Well, duh.

566
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
There you guys are.

567
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,460
Nothin'.

568
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,060
Uh, we were just headed back in.

569
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,380
Yeah, I'm getting a second wind.

570
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,710
Oh, no, no, no. That's okay.

571
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,570
Uh, what do you say we go check out some food trucks?

572
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,390
Really?

573
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
I'll go back in if you guys want,

574
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,060
but I'm actually really hungry.

575
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,750
- Yeah, whatever you want.  - Okay, well, whatever you need,

576
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,280
Yeah.Thanks, guys.

577
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,110
If I'm being honest,

578
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,510
I had to get out of there.

579
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,310
I was exhausted from having to dumb it down all day.

580
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,900
Really? The neck?

581
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,920
Yeah, a kiss on the neck opens all kinds of doors.

582
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,040
Last one.

583
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,780
Great job, champ.

584
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,350
Who said you can't build anything?

585
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,390
My dad, the police, a doctor.

586
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,300
You got a gift.

587
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,020
Trust me. Take shop.

588
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,710
I think I'm gonna.

589
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,390
Hey, how'd you get to know so much about everything?

590
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,570
From my dad, mostly.

591
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,330
He taught me how to use a drill,

592
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,640
change a tire,

593
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,340
fake an injury when a buddy asks you to help him move.

594
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,180
Everything a man needs to get by.

595
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,370
I'm just glad I have someone to pass it on to.

596
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,720
You've got Manny.

597
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,430
Manny came to me kind of fully cooked.

598
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,730
And I was an idiot with Mitchell,

599
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,270
and by the time this guy gets old enough,

600
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,750
who knows how much I'll remember?

601
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,820
These are my prime wisdom-giving years.

602
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,530
You got any more questions, Luke?

603
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,670
Just one --

604
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,710
can I have a sip?

605
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,100
The beer? Sure. What the hell.

606
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,340
Awesome. My first drink of beer.

607
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,090
I remember the day I gave Mitchell

608
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,830
his first taste of beer.

609
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,290
He winced and carried on

610
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,910
like someone was digging a bullet out of his leg.

611
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,260
I couldn't take that moment away from Phil.

612
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,340
Hang on. Wait a second.

613
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,490
Let me see that.

614
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,280
No, this beer's skunked.

615
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,080
It's no good.

616
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,420
Damn fridge must be on the fritz again.

617
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,580
Aw, man.

618
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,320
Really?

619
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Sorry, buddy.

620
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,580
It's probably time to call your dad anyway, right?

621
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,220
Okay.

622
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,830
Wait a second.

623
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,160
I want to give you something.

624
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,400
But those are yours.

625
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,530
What's a grandfather for

626
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,950
if he can't give his grandson a couple of tools?

627
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,270
Thanks, grandpa.

628
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,840
Good job!

629
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,360
Joe...

630
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,920
I know you're all about the boobs right now,

631
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,180
but trust me...

632
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
The neck.

633
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,790
Don't let go!

634
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,600
Don't worry, George Clooney, I won't!

635
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,370
You're too handsome!

636
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,470
Watch out for incoming space junk!

637
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,300
From where?

638
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,390
Your zipper's down!

639
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,980
Oh, is it?

640
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,140
- Yeah, it is. - Just... sorry.

641
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,500
What's Andy doing here?

642
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
They're making a video for his girlfriend.

643
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah? What's it called, "Dorks in space"?

644
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
Oh, it was actually sweet.

645
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,660
It's weird.

646
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,710
There's something about him.

647
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,430
You know what I mean?

648
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,340
Yeah, he's just like dad.

649
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,970
In space, no one can hear you scream.

650
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,950
What?!

651
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,400
In space, no one can hear you scream!

652
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,890
I can't hear you!

653
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,740
In spa--

654
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,530
Oh, I just got it.

655
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,230
That's good. That's good.

656
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,220
Thank you.

657
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,280
There's no denying it is original,

658
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,430
but you can see the influence of Pollock.

659
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,050
While the pattern seems haphazard and random,

660
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,960
it belies a purposefulness -- a-an intentionality.

661
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,500
You know, I think what I'm responding to

662
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,440
is the clashing juxtaposition of color --

663
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,050
The bright yellow against the dark background.

664
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,280
It's like a ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak world.

665
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,460
If I may take a contrary position...

666
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,440
...I think it speaks to the absurdity

667
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,470
and folly of human endeavor.

668
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,130
Like our futile struggle for perfection.

669
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,700
I get it.

670
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,690
I got mustard on my shirt.

671
