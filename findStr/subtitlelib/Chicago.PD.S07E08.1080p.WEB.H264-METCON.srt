1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,876
- Wait until I tell Kev,
"The movie you've been

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,139
raving about is the worst movie
I've seen in my entire life."

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,968
I grinned and I beared it,
you know?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,535
- Oh, well.

5
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,798
I hate to tell you this, like
it pains me to tell you this,

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,278
but you snore.

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,628
- See, I'm never watching
a movie on your couch again.

8
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,325
God forbid, I nod off.

9
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,284
- No, man. I think it's called
passing out

10
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:25,025
when you've had more than,
what?

11
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,592
Four Pilsners?

12
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,333
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

13
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,031
Gimme.

14
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,034
- Okay, heads-up, everyone.

15
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,600
Source is coming your way.

16
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,689
Plates are confirmed.
Truck's double loaded.

17
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,995
- Copy that.
We're in position

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,344
Shutting down.

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,220
- Good to see you boys.

20
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,786
- Yeah, glad we can make
this happen.

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,310
Y'all got what we ordered?

22
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:57,057
- Yeah, three bricks.
It's perfect.

23
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,582
As long as the product
is right.

24
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,584
It's right.

25
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,107
- Okay, no offense,

26
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,891
but the last cat
who told us that it was right

27
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,589
sold us 50% sham,

28
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,113
and we don't need no heroin
that's already stepped on.

29
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,204
Is that pure?

30
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,081
It's pure.
- Hmm.

31
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:23,083
- Hey!

32
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,606
Don't step any closer, homie.

33
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,086
I don't see no paper.

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,178
I wanna make sure
you're for real.

35
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,309
- Okay.

36
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,705
Chicago PD.

37
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,361
- Hey,
don't even think about it!

38
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,579
Put your hands up.

39
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,233
- We got one going out
the back.

40
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,366
Green jacket, dark jeans.
He's taking off with the dope.

41
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,237
- We're on it.

42
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,157
- Chicago PD!

43
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,221
- Stop.

44
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,788
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up!

45
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,573
Drop the bag.

46
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,401
Put your arms through the gate.

47
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,810
- 5021 Eddie, roll the Crime
Lab to Calumet Corridor.

48
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,378
We have a female DOA,
possible homicide.

49
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,119
Make all the appropriate
notifications,

50
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,948
and advise our supervisor
we are securing the scene.

51
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,168
- 10-4, 5021 Eddie.

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,347
- All right, what do we got?

53
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,350
- No ID on the vic,
not in the system.

54
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,395
- There's a park
a few blocks east of here.

55
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,875
It's popular
with working girls.

56
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:03,183
They use this area as a place
to conduct their business.

57
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,445
- She wasn't here too long.

58
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,837
The M.E. framed
the time of death

59
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,056
within the last 12 hours.

60
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,623
No signs of fresh blood
on the scene.

61
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,973
- It's a dump site.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,540
And if she was a prostitute,

63
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,020
we're assuming the offender
probably killed her in the car

64
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,544
and brought her here.

65
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,676
- All right, scour the area
for PODs, security cameras.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,113
Circulate her photo,
check all missings,

67
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,332
look for any witnesses,

68
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,508
and we start talking
to prostitutes.

69
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,554
- We're gonna take it?
Not Homicide?

70
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:29,557
- We found her.
Let's find her killer.

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,776
- Okay.

72
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,125
- Hey.

73
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,388
- Hey.
- What happened to you?

74
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,259
- Uh, snagged it on a gate
back there.

75
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll live.
- I'm sure you will.

76
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,654
All the same, I want you
to head over to Med,

77
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,395
get it checked out,
document it.

78
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,266
These guys can handle
the canvassing.

79
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,399
- Okay, copy.

80
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,533
- You're all set.
- I am?

81
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:51,143
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh.

82
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,362
Thank you.

83
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,237
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,238
- Doctor.

85
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,414
- Hmm.

86
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,895
Ah.

87
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,375
- Is something wrong?

88
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,768
- I ran a standard blood panel.

89
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,378
No infections,
nothing to worry about.

90
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:09,858
- Oh, okay.
I was, like, worried.

91
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,557
- But due to your elevated
levels of beta HCG,

92
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,907
you should be more careful
on the job.

93
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,170
- Elevated H-B-what?

94
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,476
- It means you're pregnant.

95
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,652
Probably around four weeks.

96
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,702
- Are you sure?
- 100%.

97
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,007
Maybe don't
go squeezing through

98
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,531
any more fences for a while,

99
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,750
and congratulations.

100
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,242
- Hey, how's it going?
Are you okay?

101
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,157
- Good as new.

102
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,898
- You're cool?
- Yeah.

103
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,247
- Where we at?

104
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,988
- So our Jane Doe

105
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,772
had a distinctive birthmark
on her thigh.

106
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,252
We ran that through
Missing Persons

107
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,253
and we got a hit.

108
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,428
Her name is Ally Larson.

109
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,951
- Ally ran away from home
eight years ago

110
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,475
when she was 16.

111
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,520
Since then, she's been a ghost.
No address, no workplace.

112
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,696
- All right, which might make
sense if she was a prostitute.

113
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,045
- Maybe.

114
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,308
She's got no arrest record,

115
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,787
and I just spoke to
some of the working girls.

116
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,398
None of them
recognize her photo.

117
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,617
- So maybe not.

118
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,315
- All right,
anything from the M.E.?

119
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,968
- No signs of sexual assault.

120
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,841
He said Ally was hit repeatedly
with a blunt object.

121
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:22,365
- Yeah, no surprise there.
Defensive wounds?

122
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:23,758
- No.

123
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,455
- Huh, so she didn't
see it coming.

124
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,674
- But there were signs
of scarring

125
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,066
around the wrists and ankles,

126
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,155
which apparently restraints
would have to be left on

127
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,158
for an extended period of time
to leave those marks.

128
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,551
- Hmm.

129
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,032
So maybe she was being held
against her will.

130
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,382
- Yeah, it's a possibility.

131
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,775
- Anything else?

132
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,777
- There was a strand of hair
lodged in her necklace.

133
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,475
Not hersthey're testing it
now for DNA.

134
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,998
- Okay, anything from PODs
or surveillance?

135
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,392
- Uh, waiting for digital files
on Townshend Auto Parts.

136
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,524
They had a cam set up
pretty close

137
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,655
to where we found
Ally's body.

138
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,265
- Okay, so let's keep digging.

139
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,225
See what we can find in Ally's
missing persons report.

140
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,531
Kim and Adam?

141
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,794
Make the notification
to the parents.

142
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:06,017
- We both dreaded this day.

143
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:08,890
I told myself
it would never happen.

144
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:12,589
- You pray every night
your baby will come home.

145
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,375
Will walk through that door
and not the police.

146
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,986
- We're so extremely sorry
for your loss.

147
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,554
We're here to try and find
the person responsible.

148
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,254
Our records indicate Ally
ran away eight years ago.

149
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,082
- She didn't run away.

150
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,823
- Okay.

151
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,609
- We had a fight
and she ran out.

152
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,524
It was just a fight.

153
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,397
We had lot of fights.
She always came back.

154
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:44,099
We looked for her afterwards,
couldn't find her.

155
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,451
Somebody took my daughter.

156
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,455
- Okay, do you have any idea
who that might be?

157
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,631
Like a boyfriend or someone

158
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:59,070
- I've asked myself that
a thousand times,

159
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,550
but no.

160
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,422
She got along with everyone.

161
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,077
It had to have been a stranger.

162
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,691
About a year ago,

163
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,824
we were headed to the flower
show at Garfield Park.

164
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,133
And we drove past a playground,

165
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:21,441
and there she was, Ally.

166
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,577
It was seven years
since I saw her,

167
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,797
but it was my baby.

168
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,322
She was sitting next to a man,

169
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,498
and I begged Robert
to turn around.

170
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,892
- But I didn't.

171
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,416
I, uh...

172
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,201
I got upset instead.

173
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,595
I thought Anne was delusional.

174
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,467
That's why I didn't call
the cops.

175
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,121
- On the man,
what did he look like?

176
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,341
- I wish I could tell you.

177
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,952
I was fixated on my daughter.

178
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:58,173
It was December; he had
a hat on and was bundled up.

179
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,696
I was in shock.

180
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,311
If only we'd turned around.

181
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,537
- Hey, I just got surveillance
back from the auto parts shop.

182
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,147
So check it out.
- All right.

183
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,063
- We got a male in a red camo
jacket dragging Ally's body.

184
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,414
This is eight hours
before we found her.

185
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,504
So then the guy runs off,

186
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,723
and then headlights.

187
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,813
So I check traffic cams
leaving in and out of the area.

188
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,162
Two minutes later, same guy.

189
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,077
Street POD caught him
at Cicero and 6th.

190
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,818
Got a hit on facial rec.

191
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,298
Say hi to Ramiro Lopez.

192
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,343
He's a mid-level dealer
with the Insane Players,

193
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,520
runs a corner a few blocks from
where we found Ally's body.

194
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,131
He's out on parole for distro,
has one prior for domestic.

195
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,046
He's been staying with
his cousin in Archer Heights,

196
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,527
low-income apartments
on Pulaski.

197
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,573
- Let's get some cuffs
on this guy.

198
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,534
Jay and I just pulled up.

199
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,579
You in place, Kev?

200
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:57,841
- Yup.

201
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,843
We got eyes on the front
and Lopez's car.

202
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,497
He should be in the house.

203
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,194
- All right, copy.

204
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,287
- Wait, hold on.

205
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,293
That's him.

206
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,295
- We got eyes on the offender
approaching the vehicle.

207
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,605
Ramiro Lopez?

208
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,693
Chicago PD.

209
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,567
- Hey!
- Damn!

210
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,747
- 5021 Frank, in pursuit
of a silver Cadillac,

211
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,097
Illinois plate
Tom Charlie Sam 232.

212
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,909
Hey!

213
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:10,348
- Get off me, bitch!
- Shut up and stop moving!

214
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,698
- Call her a bitch again.

215
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,835
Ramiro Lopez, you're
getting sloppy, ain't you?

216
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,881
We found a kilo of heroin
in your trunk.

217
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,405
- That ain't mine.
I'm out the game.

218
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,625
- Oh, that's why you ran, huh?

219
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,062
- Where were you last night?

220
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,324
- I was out.

221
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,760
- Out where?

222
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,457
- Hanging with some of my boys.

223
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,635
- Hmm, you know a woman
named Ally Larson?

224
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,333
- Never heard of her.
- No?

225
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:42,685
Maybe that'll
refresh your memory.

226
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,645
I'll give you a hint.
Ally's the dead one.

227
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,038
Ramiro...

228
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,389
You come clean to me right now,
I can help you.

229
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,915
- That ain't me.
- No?

230
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,920
- That's clearly you,

231
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,922
six blocks away from the body.

232
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,838
Ramiro, it's over.

233
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,493
- All right, for real.

234
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,626
Yeah, I'm back in business.

235
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,323
I was looking
for one of my crew

236
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,891
when I see that white dude
standing over the girl.

237
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,241
He sees me, he jumps in
his car, and he takes off.

238
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,765
- What did that white dude
look like?

239
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,723
- Uh, he was short.

240
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,246
Uh, brown hair, maybe.

241
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,466
- What kind of car
was he driving?

242
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,076
- Uh...

243
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,732
aa blue SUV
with a big dent on the side.

244
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,038
It was a Nissan, I think.

245
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,909
- Then what happened?

246
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,955
- Listen, I don't know
if dude was raping

247
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,086
or robbing that lady.

248
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,740
I thought she was knocked
the hell out.

249
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,699
So I dragged her
into the light.

250
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,311
I wanted to help her.

251
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,617
But then I saw her head
smashed in like a baby seal,

252
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,881
and I got the hell up
out of there.

253
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,583
- Hell of a story.

254
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,541
- So crazy,
I damn near believe it.

255
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,718
- Sarge, lab results came in.

256
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,545
DNA from the hair
in Ally's necklace

257
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,069
matched a name in the system.

258
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,592
- Lopez?

259
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,202
- No, Claire Meyers,
open cold case.

260
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:07,727
Abducted seven years ago
when she was 17,

261
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,903
but the lab confirmed
the DNA was fresh.

262
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,469
- So Claire might still
be alive?

263
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,734
- That hair didn't
just magically appear.

264
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,344
- Sarge.
- Huh?

265
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:18,912
- We know that Ally Larson had
restraint marks on her body.

266
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,740
Her parents are convinced
that she was abducted.

267
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,089
I mean, what if they're right?

268
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,048
What if both girls were taken
but by the same guy?

269
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,224
- You're thinking
Claire Meyers and Ally Larson

270
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,313
were being held together
this whole time?

271
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,794
- I do, and Claire
is out there somewhere.

272
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,407
- Then we need to find her.

273
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:41,543
.

274
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,371
- This is Claire Meyers.

275
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,938
She was a good student,
aspiring musician,

276
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,243
only daughter of a single mom.

277
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,811
Abducted seven years ago
when she was only 17.

278
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,073
The offender broke
into her house,

279
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,596
dragged her out of bed.

280
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,642
There have been no arrests
and the case has gone cold.

281
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,165
- All right, Ramiro Lopez,

282
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,080
was he listed as a person
of interest in that file?

283
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,342
- Uh, he shouldn't be.

284
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,953
He was locked up
at Stateville for two years

285
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,258
on a possession charge.

286
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,782
- Platt talked to
the original detectives

287
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,087
who were on Claire's case.

288
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,307
- Yeah, they didn't
even have to open the file.

289
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,396
It's one of those cases
that stays with you.

290
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,921
They told us they pressed hard,
but leads went dead fast.

291
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,401
There wasn't a strand
of evidence,

292
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,403
and no visual
or digital trace of her

293
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,317
after that night.

294
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,709
- So she just disappeared.

295
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,711
- Which is why they assumed
whoever abducted Claire

296
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,104
killed her too.

297
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,020
The case shifted from
a locate to a recovery.

298
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,935
- All right,
appreciate it, Trudy.

299
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,371
- We've got
a person of interest here.

300
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,157
John Waddell,
he's Claire's piano teacher.

301
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,160
Claire told her mom
that he was stalking her

302
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,335
and tried to kiss her.

303
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,902
It was enough
for a restraining order.

304
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,207
Two weeks later,
she was abducted.

305
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,469
- Waddell didn't have an alibi,

306
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,080
but because they never
recovered a body,

307
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,864
then they didn't have anything
to connect him

308
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,257
to her disappearance.

309
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,519
- Looks like Waddell
stayed busy.

310
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,260
He got probation
on a Peeping Tom allegation,

311
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,392
and a woman just filed
an assault complaint.

312
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,047
Claims Waddell dropped a roofie
in her drink at a bar.

313
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,050
- Address?
- LKA is 1350 Waycrest.

314
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,878
- Wait,
that's by Garfield Park.

315
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,749
Same park that Ally's mother

316
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,099
swore that she saw
her daughter at.

317
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,666
- All right, Kim,
you and Adam go grab Waddell.

318
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,235
The rest of you, keep digging
into that cold case.

319
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,324
Go over every single piece
of evidence.

320
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:09,718
These two women who went
missing are connected.

321
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,373
I mean, one of them
may still be alive.

322
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,331
So we move heaven and earth.

323
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,639
- Sarge, we did
a little sneak-and-peek

324
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,901
on Waddell's apartment.

325
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,642
No sign of him or anybody else.

326
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,906
- Keep eyes on the apartment.
We need to find this guy.

327
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,560
- Copy that.

328
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,519
- What?

329
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:31,044
- My nephew just saw
"Back to the Future"

330
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,436
for the first time,

331
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,134
so he's been trying
to skateboard behind cars

332
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,787
all week long.

333
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,398
I love that kid.

334
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:40,618
My sister got a lot more than
she bargained for with him.

335
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,229
- I'm pregnant.

336
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,978
- What?

337
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,457
- Yeah, the, um,
the doctor,

338
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,719
she ran some tests

339
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,547
while I was getting
stitched up this morning.

340
00:14:56,591 --> 00:15:00,464
So I am pregnant.

341
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,209
- Is it
- Yes.

342
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,037
- From the night after
- Yeah, after that night.

343
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,604
- Okay.

344
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,693
You're sure that
- I don't need this.

345
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:12,955
- Okay.
Sorry.

346
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,739
- I'm sure.

347
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,481
Huh.

348
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,483
- Yeah.
- Okay, what do you wanna do?

349
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,094
- I don't know, Adam.
What do you wanna do?

350
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,356
- I don't know.

351
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,835
I'm kind of playing
catch-up over here.

352
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,882
Um...

353
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,449
I mean, do you want a kid?

354
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,625
I know when we were together,
you said you wanted kids.

355
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,583
- I do want kids.

356
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,152
Someday.

357
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,067
- Well...

358
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,764
Okay, well, listen.

359
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,027
You know, whatever you decide,

360
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,681
I'm gonna be there
and I'll support you.

361
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:44,987
- There he is.

362
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,176
- John.
Hey, it's Waddell, right?

363
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,525
- Yeah.
- Hey.

364
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,831
- Hey.
- Chicago PD.

365
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,225
- We're gonna need you
to come with us, pal.

366
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,053
- You guys don't ever quit,
do you?

367
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,098
- What an incredibly keen
observation, John.

368
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,927
- Let's go.

369
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,538
- Look...

370
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,323
I don't know what else
you people want.

371
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,542
You've already made my life
a living hell.

372
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,283
- Yeah, you know whose life
is a living hell?

373
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,676
It's Claire Meyers' mother.

374
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,766
She hired you as a piano
teacher for her daughter,

375
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,637
found out you were a predator,

376
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,944
and then her daughter
went missing forever.

377
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,078
- I have told you three times,

378
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,689
I had nothing to do with it.

379
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,430
Cops interrogated me.

380
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:39,476
- Yeah, they never proved
you were innocent.

381
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,739
They just couldn't prove
you were guilty.

382
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,350
- Just for the record,

383
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,656
Claire was the one who
initiated our relationship.

384
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,441
She came onto me.

385
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:48,746
- Do you recognize this girl?

386
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,273
- No.
- Take another look.

387
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,623
- I can look all day,
but I still don't know her.

388
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,365
- Where were you yesterday
at 9:00 p.m.?

389
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:01,194
- I was with my mother.
We went to Second City.

390
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,978
It's not as funny
as it used to be.

391
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,285
- According
to the restraining order,

392
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:08,679
you, uh, stalked Claire
all over the city

393
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,377
before she disappeared.

394
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,813
Maybe you saw her
with someone else,

395
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,728
someone who didn't belong.

396
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,773
- You mean the dude who
was at her soccer games.

397
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,341
- What dude?

398
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,821
- He used to watch
from the parking lot.

399
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,997
Always had a cigarette going,
never talked to anybody.

400
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,087
- Describe him.

401
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,569
- He was white,
older than me.

402
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,092
He had one of
those beat-up panel vans,

403
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,702
like for plumbers
or electricians.

404
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,010
- Why the hell didn't
you tell the cops

405
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,794
about this in the first place?

406
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:40,276
- I did, but they thought
I was making it up.

407
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,149
Those cops had a vendetta.

408
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,108
They wanted to punish me
because Claire and I

409
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,676
had genuine feelings
for each other.

410
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,636
Why is that so hard
for you people to understand?

411
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:06,389
- Because she was a 17-year-old
girl, you stupid prick.

412
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,445
- Mm-hmm.

413
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,534
- Sarge,
Waddell's alibi checks out.

414
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,666
He was at a damn comedy club
the night Ally was murdered.

415
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,841
- We got it.

416
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,843
Sarge, we reached out to
the Larson family

417
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,194
to see if they could recall
anybody that had done plumbing

418
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,631
or electrical work at their
house before Ally disappeared.

419
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,067
- Okay.

420
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,156
- They went through
their records.

421
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,158
JBS Electrical did some work
at their house

422
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,986
about a year before
Ally went missing.

423
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,205
- Uh-huh?

424
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,511
- JBS also installed
an air conditioning unit

425
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,557
at Claire Meyers' house
eight years ago.

426
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,040
- We got the nexus.

427
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,695
Look, if this guy
was stalking Claire

428
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,088
for over a year,

429
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,003
there's a good chance
he was stalking Ally too.

430
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,135
He might've even been there

431
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,397
the night she fought
with her parents.

432
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,225
She runs out, upset.

433
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,879
- It was the perfect time
to snatch her up.

434
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,925
- We got the employment records
for JBS?

435
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,231
- We do.

436
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,710
There were two technicians
on the payroll

437
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:08,016
at the time that
Ally goes missing.

438
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,801
- And one of them owns
a blue Nissan SUV.

439
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,890
- That is Ray Lambert.
He's 40 years old.

440
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,371
He was fired about a year
after Ally went missing.

441
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:17,504
- Any priors?
- He's squeaky clean

442
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,549
except for one big
social media red flag.

443
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,595
He identifies as an incel.

444
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,249
- What the hell is an incel?

445
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,641
- It's an involuntary celibate.

446
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:25,860
It's a black hole
on the internet.

447
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,383
It's like white guys
who can't get laid

448
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,298
and think that women
owe them sex.

449
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,735
- Male supremacists.

450
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:35,217
- Okay, we got an address
for this winner?

451
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,393
- Lambert owns a house
in Forest Park.

452
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,221
- Call CPIC,
get a round-robin.

453
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,483
Let's gear up.

454
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,572
- This is Detective Upton
of Intelligence.

455
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,357
I need real-time information
on a Ray Lambert.

456
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,576
40 years of age,
resides in Forest Park.

457
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,188
He's wanted for abduction
and murder.

458
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,885
- Take it off the hinges.

459
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,321
- Chicago PD!

460
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,559
- Sarge?

461
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,048
- Boss.

462
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,994
- Do you hear that?

463
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,562
Behind the wall.
It sounds like a motor.

464
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,002
- Clear it.

465
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,104
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

466
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,721
- Claire?

467
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,332
Claire, can you look at me?

468
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,120
- I'm putting this gun down,
okay?

469
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,909
Okay?

470
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,390
- I'm Kim.

471
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,349
I know how scared you must be.

472
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,571
I'd like to walk towards you.

473
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,530
If you feel frightened,
you just say "stop," okay?

474
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,184
Can you do that?

475
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,751
Okay.

476
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,276
Can you hand me that, Claire?

477
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,799
It's okay.

478
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,366
I'm just gonna put it
right there.

479
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,889
Does that sound good?

480
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,282
Okay.

481
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,026
Thank you.

482
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,508
I'm gonna sit down now, okay?

483
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,947
Now me and my friends,

484
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,731
we'd like to take you out
of this room.

485
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,167
Do you think you're ready
to do that?

486
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,039
- Where's Henry?

487
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,867
- Who's Henry, Claire?

488
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,957
- He's my son.
Is he with you?

489
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,393
- Your son.

490
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:34,004
No, he's not, Claire.

491
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,790
- No, wait.
Wait, he took my son.

492
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,400
- Who took your son, Claire?
- He took my son.

493
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:39,575
- Who took your son?
- Ray.

494
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:40,837
Ray, he took my son.

495
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,448
- I understand that.
We're gonna get him back.

496
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,014
It's okay.
Take a deep breath, Claire.

497
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,581
- He took my son.

498
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,278
- We're gonna find your son,
Claire.

499
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,410
I'm gonna find your son.

500
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,151
I'm gonna find your son.

501
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:54,068
.

502
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,765
- Two rooms, one bathroom,
soundproof walls,

503
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,679
and no way out.

504
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:57,854
Lambert's a good electrician.

505
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,203
The whole place
is a well-ventilated

506
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,683
house of horrors.
- Three beds suggest

507
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:01,858
he was holding three victims

508
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:02,859
Claire Meyers, Ally Larson,

509
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,208
and Claire's son, Henry.

510
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,558
- And that boy was living
down there too?

511
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,516
- You saw the stuffed animals
and the kid's toys.

512
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,344
- Sarge?
- Yeah.

513
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,215
- Just talked to a neighbor.
He's freaked out.

514
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,043
He thought Lambert
seemed like a stand-up guy.

515
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,219
- He ever see the boy?
- Yeah, all the time.

516
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,004
Lambert said the boy
was his nephew.

517
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,354
- All right, I want
an endangered child AMBER alert

518
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,487
on that boy
immediately... - Henry?

519
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,314
- And a BOLO out
on Lambert now.

520
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,229
- All right.
Yes, sir.

521
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,144
- II need to find my son.

522
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:28,450
I need to find him.
- I've got her...

523
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,886
- I need to find him.
- Claire, look at me.

524
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,061
You're safe now, okay?

525
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,454
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

526
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,195
- I need you to help me
find Henry.

527
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:35,326
- I will.
Tell me about your son.

528
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,415
How old is he?
- He's four.

529
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,851
- Okay, and you said
that Ray took him?

530
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:38,982
- Yes.
- When did he take him?

531
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,375
- Today, right before
you got here,

532
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,246
but Ray doesn't know
how to take care of him.

533
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,248
- Do you have any idea where
Ray might've taken your son?

534
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,641
- No.
But Ray is watching.

535
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:46,816
He's always watching.

536
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,470
- Claire,
he's not watching right now.

537
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,125
- I need to go find my son,
Henry!

538
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,649
I need to go find
my son, Henry!

539
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,129
Henry!
Henry!

540
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,261
I need to find him!

541
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,046
- Henry is four years old,

542
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,482
and Claire was abducted
seven years ago,

543
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,484
which means that monster
is the boy's father.

544
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,007
- All right,
you stay with Claire.

545
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,618
See what else
you can find out.

546
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,054
- Yeah.

547
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,577
- Sarge, we found
a livesteaming camera

548
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:09,752
mounted in the basement.

549
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,493
This thing can
be controlled remotely.

550
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,843
- So he liked to keep tabs
on his captives.

551
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:17,368
Also means there's a good
chance he's already onto us.

552
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,718
- Right.

553
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,154
- All right, get the OCD techs
down here right now.

554
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,851
Triangulate this guy.

555
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,462
Whatever it takes
to get him in pocket.

556
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,680
- Copy that.

557
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,290
- All right,
I got into Lambert's computer.

558
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,076
He made a Skype call
two hours before we got here

559
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,469
to this guy, Brad Snyder.

560
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,296
Now judging by the pictures
and the messages

561
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,950
and the Skype link,

562
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,735
they know each other
from the local 542.

563
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,606
And now, this photo...

564
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,436
Brad Snyder has definitely
been in here, boss.

565
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,917
He could be an accomplice.

566
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,006
- Let's go grab him.

567
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,728
- Hey, little homie.

568
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,861
What's up, man?

569
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,037
We're the police.

570
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,605
Everything's okay.
Can you open the door?

571
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,737
Yeah, man.

572
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,482
What's up, little man?

573
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,571
Everything's okay.
Come here.

574
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,138
Sit down, little homie.

575
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,662
What's your name, bro?

576
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,185
- Kevin.

577
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,449
- Kevin.
That's my name too.

578
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,451
That's a real good name, Kevin.

579
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:41,801
Pound me on that.
Yeah, bro.

580
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,151
Where's your dad?

581
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,632
- I don't know.
I was sleeping.

582
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:02,648
- Brad Snyder.

583
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,346
- Yeah, my son.
Is my son okay?

584
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,869
- Yeah, he's okay.
He's downstairs.

585
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,392
What happened?

586
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,264
- Ray Lambert happened.

587
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:14,137
- Get up.
- Oh!

588
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,228
- Sit your ass down.

589
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:20,317
- Okay, okay.
- Sit down!

590
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,929
Where's Ray Lambert?
- I don't know, sir.

591
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,626
- He did this to you?
- Yeah.

592
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,715
Hehe called me,
said he wanted to come over.

593
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,935
I'd just put my son down
for a nap; I invited him.

594
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,371
- Look at me.

595
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:31,633
Was he with anyone?

596
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,940
- No.
- You know this kid?

597
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,290
- Yes, that's, uh,
Ray's nephew.

598
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,161
II met him a year ago.

599
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,685
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

600
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:40,903
- It's not his nephew.

601
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,078
That's the child he fathered

602
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:43,514
from a woman he abducted
seven years ago.

603
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:44,777
We know you've been
to his house.

604
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,995
There isn't a chance in hell

605
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,475
you didn't know what
we was doing in there.

606
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,433
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

607
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,784
I swear!
- This kid's life is in danger.

608
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,829
- If you don't start talking,
Brad,

609
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,962
we're gonna charge you
with accessory.

610
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,529
- All I know is he came over
and he asked for money.

611
00:26:58,573 --> 00:26:59,661
I refused.

612
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,532
Next thing I know,
he pulls out his Glock

613
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,578
and he beats me with it.
He took my ATM card.

614
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,928
He made me gave him
the pin number.

615
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:09,062
He said he was gonna kill
my son if I went to the police.

616
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,762
- What was he driving?

617
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,285
- Aa black truck.

618
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,462
Aaa Honda, I think.

619
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:20,203
It was like he was possessed.

620
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:23,206
- Call it in.

621
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,643
- 5021 Henry...

622
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,688
- She'll be all right.
- Okay, thank you, Doctor.

623
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,777
- Yeah.

624
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,694
- Hi.

625
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,217
How are you feeling?

626
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,742
- I don't know.
I just wanna find my son.

627
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,483
- I know.
We're still looking for him.

628
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,485
You don't have any idea
where they might've gone?

629
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,966
- No, but you need
to find him soon.

630
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,490
Henry needs insulin.

631
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,231
- Henry's diabetic?
- Yeah.

632
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,843
And he needs an injection twice
a day or he goes into shock,

633
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,888
and Ray didn't take
his insulin and

634
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,673
- Okay, that's very helpful.

635
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:57,937
- What's gonna happen to Ray?

636
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,722
I mean, he's not gonna
get Henry, right?

637
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:01,984
Henry stays with me.

638
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:04,508
- Ray is going to prison
for a very long time.

639
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,729
Okay?

640
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,558
- Would you?
- Yeah.

641
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:20,220
I have to ask you
what happened to Ally.

642
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,875
- Ray killed her.

643
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,703
- Why?

644
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,357
- Because she
was hurting Henry.

645
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,664
She just hated Ray so much.

646
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,669
- And Ray defended Henry
because Henry is Ray's son.

647
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,369
Yeah.

648
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,545
- Ray loves Henry.

649
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,852
He wants to keep him.

650
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,376
He'd say he'd kill him
before he let him go.

651
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,378
- Well, we're not gonna
let that happen.

652
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,207
We're gonna bring him back
to you safe, okay?

653
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,383
You don't have to worry.

654
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:56,169
- You don't have kids, do you?

655
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,910
- No, I don't.

656
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,521
- When you do, you'll know.

657
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,352
There's no such thing
as not worrying.

658
00:29:13,099 --> 00:58:27,306
.

659
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,231
- Sarge?
- What do you got?

660
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:16,972
- Followed up on what Burgess
got from Claire,

661
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,452
but no luck with
any of the pharmacies.

662
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,976
No incidents reported,
no Ray Lambert in any system.

663
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,804
- But we have confirmation
of Brad's story.

664
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,719
All right,
this was taken three hours ago

665
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,155
at an ATM on Belmont.

666
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,809
This is Ray Lambert
withdrawing 500 bucks

667
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:28,984
from Brad Snyder's account,

668
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,507
and that's the car
that Brad described.

669
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,553
We can't see inside, so we
don't know if Henry's in there.

670
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:33,989
- Plates came back as stolen.

671
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,425
Got an AMBER alert
across the state,

672
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,471
All Call messages being
broadcasted on all the zones,

673
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:38,559
and it's burned.

674
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:39,516
We got a lot of eyes on this.

675
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,648
Anyone who spots it

676
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,171
will contact Intelligence
immediately.

677
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,912
- All right, Adam,
pick up Kim at Med,

678
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:45,348
head over to that Belmont ATM.

679
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:48,308
See if any witnesses saw Henry
or heard anything.

680
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,397
- You got it.

681
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,666
- Hey.
- Hi.

682
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,189
How's Claire holding up?

683
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,321
- She's tough.

684
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:02,801
Doctors practically had
to restrain her

685
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,628
to keep her from looking
for Henry.

686
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:05,847
- How about you?
You doing all right?

687
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,109
You okay?

688
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:10,199
- I'm good, man,
but I wanna catch this animal.

689
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,071
- That's not really
what I was talking about.

690
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,077
- I made an appointment
for tomorrow morning.

691
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,602
- Okay.

692
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:24,344
All right, um...

693
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,433
Well
- 5021 Ida, you on the air?

694
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,871
- Yeah, go for 5021 Ida.

695
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,831
- 935 Charlie has located
your targeted BOLO vehicle.

696
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:33,875
It just pulled into
Cook Brothers

697
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,398
on Belmont and Broadway.

698
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,357
They're sitting down the
street, but have eyes on it.

699
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,880
- All right,
we're five minutes out.

700
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:39,968
- We just got word on the zone.

701
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,579
Patrol has spotted our Honda.

702
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,769
- It doesn't look occupied.

703
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,510
- Sarge, we got eyes
on Ray's vehicle

704
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,034
on the Cook Brothers lot.

705
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,949
No sign of him or Henry.
I think maybe they're inside.

706
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,907
- Okay,
confirm the vehicle's empty.

707
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,866
I'm pulling into
the parking lot now.

708
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,780
- Copy you.
- Careful.

709
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,273
The vehicle's empty.

710
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,971
- All right, head inside,
get eyes on him.

711
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:26,972
Be careful.

712
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,887
- Copy you.

713
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,636
I'm still looking.
I don't have eyes.

714
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,653
Sorry.

715
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,829
- That's all right.

716
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,833
- We've got the scumbag.

717
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,966
He just bought a toy train,
which means Henry's alive.

718
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,186
- All right,
so let's follow him.

719
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,970
Hopefully he'll lead us
to the kid.

720
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,668
- Copy.

721
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:15,759
- All right, Adam,
you and Kim take the point.

722
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,937
I'll contact Hailey and Jay.
They'll stay wide with me.

723
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,895
- Copy that.

724
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,550
- Hold on a second.
What is this?

725
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,030
Hold it.
Hold it.

726
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,293
Hey, hey!
Get rid of this guy.

727
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,731
- Officer, officer!
Hey!

728
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:31,993
Kill your lights.

729
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,386
Ruzek, Intelligence.
What's going on?

730
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,040
- This car is hot,
and there's a BOLO out on it.

731
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,606
- Yeah,
we're aware it's stolen.

732
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,218
We got it under control, okay?
We need you guys to move on.

733
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,264
- Okay, Lambert's heading out
the front door.

734
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,483
I'm going out the east door.

735
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,137
I can't risk him
spotting me again.

736
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,008
- No, we got this undercover
right now.

737
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,836
We need you to move on
down the road.

738
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,142
Get down!

739
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,885
- Kim, he's heading back
in the store!

740
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,322
- Everybody, down!
Everybody, down!

741
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,192
Chicago PD!

742
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,237
Get down!
Get down, move!

743
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,455
Come on!
Move, move, move!

744
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,762
- 5021 Adam,
shots fired at the police.

745
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,024
Belmont and Broadway.

746
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:06,767
- Lambert's fleeing towards
the rear!

747
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,342
- Talk to me, people.
Did you see him?

748
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,821
If you're too scared to talk,
just point.

749
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:20,041
- Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Officer Ruzek.

750
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,477
I need you to stay calm,
stay low,

751
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,044
and get the hell out
of the store right now.

752
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,525
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move!

753
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,963
Officer, go left.
Go left.

754
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,357
- Adam, watch yourself.

755
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,402
- Ladies, please,
out of the store.

756
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:34,447
Move, now.

757
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,926
Out of the store.
Out of the store.

758
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,583
- I got him!

759
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,200
- Hey, hey!
He's in there!

760
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:51,246
He's in there!
- He's in the store!

761
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,163
- Try to relax...
- Hey!

762
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,513
Drop your weapon!

763
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,732
Ray!

764
00:33:58,775 --> 00:33:59,950
Listen to me.

765
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,474
Ray, drop the gun.

766
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,954
- Drop your gun now!
- Officer, stand down.

767
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,608
Listen to my voice, Ray.

768
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:06,870
Just turn around, okay?

769
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,089
Ray, come on.

770
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,612
Turn around,
drop that weapon, all right?

771
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,527
- Hands in the air...
- Officer, I gave you an order!

772
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:12,615
Stand down!

773
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,095
Ray, listen to me.
This is about Henry.

774
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,879
This isn't about you or me.
Think about Henry.

775
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,664
Just turn around slow.
Drop that weapon.

776
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,844
- Sir,
put your weapon down now.

777
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:26,107
- No, no, no, no, no!

778
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:28,979
- Ray, where is he?

779
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,198
Where's Henry?

780
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,591
Where is he?
Tell me where he is, okay?

781
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,071
Don't let him die.
Don't let Henry die.

782
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,115
Tell me where he is.

783
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,725
You've got to tell me
where Henry is.

784
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:36,944
Please don't let him die!

785
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,641
Where is Henry?
Tell me where Henry is!

786
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,121
Come on!

787
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,472
- Kim...

788
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:55,919
.

789
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,660
- Okay, we got anything useful?

790
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:58,705
- There's nothing
in the wallet

791
00:34:58,748 --> 00:34:59,967
and the phone
is password protected,

792
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,708
so it's gonna take
the techs time to crack it.

793
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,101
- Found an insulin pen
in his pocket

794
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,363
from the pharmacy inside.

795
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,886
Sarge, Henry hasn't
had insulin in hours.

796
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,888
If we don't find that kid soon,
he's going into shock.

797
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,411
- All right, let's get
some extra pens on hand

798
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:10,978
just to be safe.

799
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,414
- Sarge, you got your ears on?

800
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,720
- Yeah, I'm here.
Go ahead, Hailey.

801
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:15,765
- Just went through Ray's car.

802
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:19,073
There's propane tanks,
canned goods, and a lantern.

803
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,814
- 10-4.

804
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:23,208
Camping gear.
It makes sense.

805
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,384
You lay low for a few weeks
until the heat dies off,

806
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:26,776
then head out of town.

807
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,343
- Not a lot of traffic around
camping sites

808
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:29,779
this time of year.

809
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,564
He could've stashed the kid
there this morning,

810
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,348
planned to go back later.

811
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:37,135
- Platt said patrol found his
blue Nissan out on Route 57.

812
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:41,226
- Okay, we know that Ray
left his house this morning

813
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,618
in that SUV.

814
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:44,098
By the time he gets
to Brad Snyder's place

815
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,579
an hour later, he has a new car
and he has no kid.

816
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:47,928
- He couldn't have
ditched them both

817
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,670
unless he ditched them
in the same place.

818
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,498
- All right, get patrol,
get some bodies.

819
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,326
Let's start looking
at camp sites in the area.

820
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,979
Let's move.

821
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:08,992
- Henry!

822
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:14,259
- No, I haven't.
- No.

823
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,696
- Anything?
- Henry!

824
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,438
Henry, Henry, where are you?
- Sorry.

825
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,788
- I got nothing over here.

826
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,138
Henry!
- Hey, Adam, no luck.

827
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,922
- Thanks for the update.

828
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:28,055
All right, that was Hailey.

829
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,622
We checked five camp grounds
so far.

830
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,884
No sign of Henry.

831
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,494
- So maybe we got the winner.
Hey.

832
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,192
You the manager?
- Yeah.

833
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,629
- Thanks for meeting with us.
- Whatever I can do to help.

834
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,196
- You recognize this guy?

835
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,416
- Yeah, I saw him earlier.

836
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,679
He was lugging a travel
trailer, real piece of crap.

837
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:44,898
Quiet guy.
Paid in cash.

838
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,943
- Great, great.
Where is the camper parked?

839
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:51,992
- Site 49, near the pond.
- Thank you.

840
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,126
- Henry!

841
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,738
It's locked!
Adam, it's locked!

842
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,175
Henry, can you hear me?
Can you come to the window?

843
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,177
Henry, can you hear us?
Can you open it from inside?

844
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,570
Henry!

845
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:05,875
- All right,
let me get the pry bar.

846
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:08,704
- Yeah.

847
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,363
Come on!

848
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,019
Call an ambo!

849
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,500
Henry, listen to me.
I'm a police officer, okay?

850
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,675
I'm going to help you.

851
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:23,763
Henry, can you hear my voice?

852
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,199
I need you to stay with me,
all right?

853
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,331
I'm here to help you.

854
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,202
I'm gonna give you
some medicine, buddy.

855
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,423
Stay with me, please.
Please, please, Henry.

856
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,686
Henry, please!
Stay with me!

857
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:34,817
Talk to me, Henry.
Talk to me.

858
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,819
- Mommy.
I want my mommy.

859
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,038
- Oh, good.
Okay.

860
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,518
We're gonna find your mommy,
all right?

861
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:40,693
Just hold out.

862
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,129
- He's stabilizing.

863
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:45,437
- Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

864
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,222
Hold on.
Hang on, buddy, hang on.

865
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:55,708
- Where is she?
- She'll be here soon, buddy.

866
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,100
I promise.

867
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,537
- Henry?

868
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,715
Hi!

869
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,370
Hi, buddy!
I missed you!

870
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,023
- I was in the forest.

871
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,112
- You were?

872
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,418
Thank you.

873
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,159
Thank you for finding him.

874
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,814
- Yeah.
I'm glad he's okay.

875
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,388
Claire...

876
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,520
Um...

877
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,130
good luck.

878
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,485
- Thank you.

879
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,747
- Yeah.

880
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,140
- I'll be okay.

881
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:38,533
I have Henry.

882
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,582
He's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

883
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,282
That must sound crazy, right?

884
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,631
- No, no.
It's

885
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,808
- I didn't want to be there,
obviously.

886
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,987
I hate him for what he did.

887
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,165
I'm glad he's dead.

888
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,215
But...

889
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:11,827
I wouldn't trade Henry
for the world.

890
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,980
- Kim, you in here?
- Yeah.

891
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,335
- Oh, that was a tough day,
you know?

892
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,339
- Yeah, it's a bit
of a tough day.

893
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,950
- I don't want you to be alone
in all of this.

894
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,909
I think you should let me drive
you to the appointment.

895
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,519
- Yeah, that's not necessary.

896
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,956
- I know that you're a strong
independent woman and all that,

897
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,481
but I care about you,
and I want to be there for you.

898
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,396
- Having this baby
would be so hard, Adam.

899
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,441
- I'm not trying
to influence you either way.

900
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,356
- Yeah, let me finish then.

901
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,230
Maybe it's selfish of me,

902
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,537
with this job

903
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,497
and being single,

904
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,195
but...

905
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:19,329
I don't want to miss
the opportunity to be a mom.

906
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:23,464
And I don't want to make
a decision I might regret.

907
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:27,860
- Okay, what does that mean?

908
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:34,040
- I don't know what it means...

909
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,260
Other than I...

910
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,393
I cancelled
the appointment.

911
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,658
- Okay.
All right.

912
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,540
It'll be okay.
