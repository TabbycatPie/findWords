1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,641
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:06,355
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:09,424
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:12,461
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,997
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,099
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,336
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:24,740
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,843
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,644
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,381
How many more terrible things
are you gonna do to protect me?

12
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,115
That's my job. That's all that matters.

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,950
It's my turn to go out on my own.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,218
Don't come looking for me.

15
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,720
Everything seems to be telling me

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,589
that Barry and I are
meant to be together.

17
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,156
Somebody please help!

18
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,622
There's only one person
who can help you now.

19
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:45,984
YOUR SPEED FOR WALLY

20
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,485
The Flash.

21
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,031
Barry, I know you can't give
up your speed to that monster.

22
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,199
That's not your decision.

23
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,101
Hand him over and it's yours.

24
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:56,112
- He's slowing down.
- He's becoming human again.

25
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:01,009
I know some piece of
you did care for me.

26
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,852
Please let him go.

27
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,089
Caitlin!

28
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,986
It's a regular day in Central City.

29
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,563
Nothing out of the ordinary.

30
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,692
People wake up.

31
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,328
Roll out of bed.

32
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:22,271
Suit up for the day.

33
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:25,274
Get to work as fast as they can.

34
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:28,711
Make sure they get a
caffeine fix along the way

35
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,669
so they can make it through the
mountain of work that awaits them.

36
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,019
Yup, it's just a regular day.

37
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,256
And I'm just a regular guy.

38
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,126
I really wish we didn't have
to keep Jay's helmet around.

39
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,295
- I hate this thing.
- Well...

40
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,764
Just want to put a dent in it.

41
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,209
Cisco, did you see Caitlin in your vibe?

42
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,304
Zoom's got her in his lair.

43
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,206
She's scared, but she's okay.

44
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:39,608
Oh, thank God.

45
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,984
All right, we need to get her back.

46
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:42,443
I know.

47
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,278
But without your speed,
there's no way any of us

48
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,681
can get through that breach that
Cisco found at the hospital.

49
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,850
I just don't think there's
anything we can do right now.

50
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,218
He's right.

51
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,586
And it's thanks to you, Al.

52
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,121
Enough. We're all suffering here.

53
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,789
That's right. That's right, Detective.

54
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,357
We're all suffering. We've lost Snow,

55
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,126
you've lost your speed, and now...

56
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,631
now Zoom can come through
that breach anytime he wants.

57
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,833
And that, Allen...

58
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:06,401
that's on you.

59
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,802
Hey, that's on all of us, okay?

60
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,080
We made these decisions as a team.

61
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,544
No we didn't.

62
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,746
Where are you going?

63
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,414
I'm gonna go find Jesse

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,683
before Zoom does... again.

65
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,351
Wait, you found her? How?

66
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,987
Cellular dead zones, remote...

67
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,658
people from my Earth vibrate at a different
frequency than people from your Earth.

68
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,160
They leave cellular dead
zones wherever they go.

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,228
That's why I'm always
dropping calls around you?

70
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:36,031
Okay, so... so wait, how did that help?

71
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:40,268
I track the dead zones created
by Jesse since she got here

72
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,302
and I follow the trail.

73
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,905
It's easy.

74
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:48,109
What, so you think you're gonna need that
gun to convince her to leave with you?

75
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,579
You're full of questions
today, aren't you, West?

76
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,113
The gun is not for my daughter.

77
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:55,416
She's not the only person from a
different Earth, hiding out on this one.

78
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,219
If I run into them, I'm gonna need this.

79
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,255
Okay, but you're also
gonna need some help.

80
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,224
Really?

81
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:06,035
You know anyone with the
speed to help me, Ramon?

82
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,975
Great. I'll be in my workshop.

83
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:15,937
Don't listen to Wells, Barry.

84
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:18,840
This ain't all on you.

85
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,743
Yeah, I know.

86
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,211
You need a ride back to the station?

87
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,445
No, I'm good.

88
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:26,114
I'm gonna stick around, actually.

89
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:28,182
Finished all my cases this morning.

90
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,151
Damn, that was fast.

91
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,686
That was a poor choice of words.

92
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,022
You do know it's okay to ease back into

93
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,724
the way you used to do things, right?

94
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,327
Well, this is the only
way I can fight crime.

95
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:43,372
If I'm not The Flash,
that's what I got to do.

96
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,396
You need to eat.

97
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:12,360
Caitlin.

98
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,639
If you want to speak to me,
then take off that mask.

99
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,268
Does this make you feel better?

100
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,238
Nothing you could ever do
would make me feel better.

101
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,941
You don't need to be afraid.

102
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,751
I'm not gonna hurt you.

103
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,947
I care too much about you to do that.

104
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,818
You only care about yourself...

105
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,319
Hunter.

106
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,328
Hunter.

107
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,256
You're gonna want to see this, son.

108
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,725
No!

109
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:46,795
I know you think that I'm a monster.

110
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,270
I understand why.

111
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,976
But that'll change.

112
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:59,540
- Please, Cait...
- Do not call me that.

113
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,042
Why are you keeping me here?

114
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:02,310
You're cured.

115
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,745
You don't need me for anything.

116
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:07,456
You're here because I love you.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,620
It may take a while, but
someday, you'll start

118
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,664
feeling that way about me again, too.

119
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:22,197
Make yourself at home.

120
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,431
You're gonna be here a while.

121
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:26,209
Okay?

122
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:06,440
I-I don't understand.

123
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,345
Well, hello, doppelganger of mine.

124
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,314
What do you know?

125
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:16,025
I can still pull off brunette.

126
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,205
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

127
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,757
Dad.

128
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,192
Oh, hey, son. What a surprise.

129
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,837
What's up?

130
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,830
I wanted to ask you about something.

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,174
Someone, actually.

132
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,835
The Flash.

133
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,770
What about him?

134
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,808
Well, he showed up at my street
race when Iris got hurt.

135
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:43,344
Then, when that man-shark
thing attacked our house.

136
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,047
And when Zoom took me, he said,

137
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,717
"Someone The Flash knew cared about me""

138
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:54,155
Yeah, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that that's you.

139
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,724
You want me to tell you who he is?

140
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:57,625
I can't do that.

141
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:59,460
No, I know. I know.

142
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,030
I was actually hoping that you
could set up a meeting for me.

143
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,166
A meeting? Between you and him?

144
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,901
I... I don't know if I can
do that either, Wally.

145
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,636
Well, why not?

146
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:09,670
Joe?

147
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,005
Singh wants to see you.

148
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,241
Okay.

149
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:18,012
Look, maybe one day,
but, I mean, not now.

150
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,248
I got to get to work.

151
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,549
See you at home?

152
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,059
All right.

153
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,030
The laser tag club's in 2D.

154
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,974
The...? Oh, no.

155
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,701
I'm looking for Jesse.

156
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,204
Come on in.

157
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,707
Thanks.

158
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,177
Jesse!

159
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,646
You're, like, the first person
who's ever come to visit her.

160
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:57,651
- What?
- How'd you find me?

161
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,061
Jess...

162
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,389
Cellular dead zone.

163
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,457
I told you, I'd find
you wherever you went.

164
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:06,427
Wait, so you're a runaway?

165
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,396
So you're her dad?

166
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,240
Great, let me know if I need
to find a new roommate.

167
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,138
Listen.

168
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,639
We need to go.

169
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,241
So, what?

170
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,510
You think I'll be safer with you?

171
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,048
Yes.

172
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,582
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass.

173
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:29,784
Jesse.

174
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:32,287
We need to leave.

175
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:33,721
No, okay?

176
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,823
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you ever again.

177
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,459
You are...

178
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,628
you are in danger.

179
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:42,430
Do you understand? You
are in grave danger.

180
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,631
I know!

181
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,833
I'm in danger because of you.

182
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:48,169
- Because of me?
- Yeah!

183
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,638
Okay, everything that's
happened, it's your fault.

184
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,673
Zoom hunting us, the metas...

185
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,175
moving here.

186
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:55,410
I'm done with it.

187
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,945
Okay, you wanted me to start a new life,

188
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,779
and that is exactly
what I'm trying to do.

189
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:02,450
- No, Jess... Jess...
- You killed a man!

190
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,087
I can't just forgive you for that.

191
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,622
And I may be afraid of Zoom, but...

192
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,359
but I am just as afraid of you.

193
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,602
Please, just... just go.

194
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,352
CRIME RATE CLIMBS HIGHER

195
00:10:57,362 --> 00:11:00,304
And a new report shows that petty
crimes have risen slightly this month,

196
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:02,647
sparking concerns that The Flash...

197
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,338
Don't watch that.

198
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:07,898
Cisco, everybody's gonna realize sooner
or later that I don't have my speed.

199
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,780
The later the better. The
last thing we need is

200
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,247
every criminal in the city thinking
they're untouchable, right?

201
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,248
What is that?

202
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,583
Case in point.

203
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,418
What?

204
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,560
What is that?

205
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,255
It's Harry.

206
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,723
What about Harry?

207
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,592
The camera in the lab van
recorded an accident.

208
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,527
See, this is my version of crash assist.

209
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:28,629
It's like those Russian
dash cams, but, you know,

210
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,374
without attack helicopters and
bad pop music on the radio.

211
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,083
That does not look like an accident.

212
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,986
First Caitlin's taken, now Wells.

213
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,216
- CRASH ASSIST ACTIVATED
- This is where he got taken,

214
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,025
but there aren't any
traffic cams in that area.

215
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,657
I'm gonna head out there,
see what I can find.

216
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,823
I'll analyze this footage and see
if we can figure out who this is.

217
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,224
All right.

218
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,427
Wait, what was the last
place the van stopped?

219
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,328
Woodmen and Shore for about 15 minutes

220
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:02,730
before heading back to Central City.

221
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,465
- Why?
- That's where Jesse must be.

222
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,468
She should know if something's
happened to her dad.

223
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,569
Iris, hey.

224
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,905
I need your help with something.

225
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,808
You're... Killer Frost.

226
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,143
And you're Caitlin Snow.

227
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,613
Your little friend, Cisco,
wouldn't shut up about you.

228
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,483
Made you out to be some kind of a saint.

229
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,786
So tell me, why hide the girls?

230
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,697
I mean, you've seen our body, right?

231
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:33,761
If I could get my powers to
work through this carbine wall,

232
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:37,731
the first thing I would
do is shut him up!

233
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:38,833
Who is he?

234
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,034
Don't know, don't care.

235
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:43,537
But if he's here, Zoom must need

236
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:47,441
something from him.

237
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,877
So what does Zoom need you for?

238
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:53,547
That is an excellent question, Caity.

239
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:56,083
You know, I've been asking
myself the same thing.

240
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:59,186
But doesn't matter now.

241
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,155
I'm not gonna stick around much longer.

242
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:05,526
Wait, I... I thought you said your
powers don't work inside this cell?

243
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,995
They don't. You're right.

244
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:10,631
So you're gonna help me get out of here.

245
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,466
Why would I help you?

246
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:14,334
Listen, honey, there's no way you are

247
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:17,404
making it down that
cliff all by yourself.

248
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,673
So let's make a deal.

249
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:23,243
You get me out of this box,

250
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,178
and I'll help you get home.

251
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:29,550
Might even throw in some
wardrobe tips for free.

252
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,887
So what do you say, Caitlin?

253
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,630
Do we have a deal?

254
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,100
I don't understand.

255
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,403
There's nothing around here.

256
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,072
What did the van hit?

257
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,715
I don't know.

258
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,521
Something strong enough to exert an
equal amount of force back on the van.

259
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,818
Someone was definitely here, though.

260
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:07,755
You think maybe a meta-human?

261
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,757
Yeah.

262
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,959
And if it's a meta that's after Wells...

263
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,994
Then they could be from Earth-2.

264
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,096
Probably.

265
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,731
We got to get Jesse.

266
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,340
Find Wells. Fast.

267
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,627
Dr. Harrison Wells.

268
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,730
Yup. And who are you?

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,165
Name's Griffin Grey.

270
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,835
Griffin Grey?

271
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:56,269
Do I know you?

272
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,006
Nope. But you should.

273
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,775
I'm one of your mistakes.

274
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:05,779
One of your sins coming home to roost.

275
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,881
All right, you think I...

276
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,382
I'm from...

277
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,184
I'm not... I'm not who you think I am.

278
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:14,254
I know exactly who you are.

279
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:18,826
And you're gonna fix what your
particle accelerator did to me.

280
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,669
What did the accelerator do to you?

281
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,009
That.

282
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,410
Well, that's impressive.

283
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,446
And all things considered,
I don't know that having

284
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:42,415
that kind of strength is the worst
thing you could have been given.

285
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,252
Yeah, that's what I thought at first.

286
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:48,522
And it was a lot of fun.

287
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,733
Till I learned it did
something else to me, too.

288
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,829
That's me.

289
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,765
Last year.

290
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,067
You're...

291
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,735
you're ageing.

292
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,472
If this keeps happening, I'll
be dead in a few months.

293
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,683
How old are you, Griffin?

294
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm 18.

295
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:19,519
Look.

296
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,656
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

297
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,325
But there's nothing I can do to fix it.

298
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,028
Well, that sucks.

299
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:31,439
'Cause if you can't figure out
a way to help me, Dr. Wells...

300
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,077
You're gonna die soon, too.

301
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,895
I never should have left.

302
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,931
No, this isn't your fault.

303
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,266
Do we know what took him?

304
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,867
That's where things get interesting.

305
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,470
That fingerprint that
you guys brought in,

306
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,671
the one from the van, I mean.

307
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,539
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,542
Belongs to this guy.

309
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,877
Griffin Grey.

310
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,912
A senior at Central City High School?

311
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,781
No, wait, I've seen this
kid's picture before.

312
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,483
He went missing, like, six months ago.

313
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,684
That's right.

314
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,052
That doesn't make any sense.

315
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,520
An 18-year-old didn't kidnap Wells.

316
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,821
That's what I thought at first,

317
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,498
but feast your eyes on this.

318
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,486
It's the same guy.

319
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,832
Yeah, the blood sample confirms it.

320
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,967
How is that even possible?

321
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,635
I'm not sure yet.

322
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,710
Without Caitlin here, I can't
really analyze the cells

323
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,307
on a molecular level to see
what we're dealing with here.

324
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,075
You know, I might
actually be able to help.

325
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,510
How?

326
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,145
Bio-chem was one of
my majors in college.

327
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,146
One of your majors?

328
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,180
How many did you have?

329
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,682
Five.

330
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,251
What, is that not common here?

331
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,420
Girl, no, that is not common anywhere.

332
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,022
All right, let's search for that Grey,

333
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,523
see what we come up with.

334
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,358
I'll see if facial
recognition brings him up

335
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,827
and I'll have Joe check CCPD's database.

336
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,462
Cool.

337
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,339
See what you can do.

338
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,537
I'm going as fast as I can.

339
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,339
Well, you better go faster.

340
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,107
Zoom will be back any minute.

341
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,051
I could just leave you
in there, you know.

342
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,082
But you want to go home so badly.

343
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,817
So how did this happen to you?

344
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:19,156
Woke up one day, cold, pale.

345
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,191
Thought I was sick.

346
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,994
Turns out it was
something else entirely.

347
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,596
You got hit by the dark matter from

348
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,131
the particle accelerator explosion?

349
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,499
Yes.

350
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,603
Right after I flunked out of med school.

351
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,273
Had to move back in with my mother.

352
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,075
That couldn't have been fun.

353
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,643
If she's anything like mine, I mean.

354
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,844
Why?

355
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,714
Is yours a frigid narcnasist, too?

356
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,982
Cold as ice.

357
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,484
Yeah.

358
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,520
Mom was like that ever
since Charlie died.

359
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,122
Who's Charlie?

360
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,290
My brother.

361
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,959
- I never had a brother.
- No?

362
00:18:55,969 --> 00:19:00,130
Then why was Mom such a
bitch on your Earth?

363
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Honestly, I couldn't say.

364
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,169
So...

365
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,240
how is this going to get me out of here?

366
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,176
The electrical current in
the cable should heat up

367
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,846
the carbine, which in turn
should speed up the electrons

368
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,248
and the faster they go...

369
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,351
The weaker its molecular
structure becomes.

370
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,686
Exactly.

371
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,923
I studied every once in a while.

372
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,026
Well, when it gets hot enough,
it should make the carbine

373
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,961
as fragile as glass.

374
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,273
And then we can both get out of here.

375
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,777
- Wally.
- Hey, Joe.

376
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,279
What's up?

377
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,714
You look like you got
something on your mind.

378
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,084
Yeah, I do.

379
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,354
Please don't tell me you
drove all the way over here

380
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,023
to ask about The Flash again.

381
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,724
It's...

382
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,560
it's not happening, Wally.

383
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,062
But... it's just one time.
That's all I'm asking.

384
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,764
It's impossible.

385
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,300
He saved my life, Joe.

386
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,478
I owe him a thank you.

387
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,208
Look.

388
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,279
I've been reckless my whole life.

389
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,347
Racing cars, pushing limits.

390
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,425
I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

391
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,823
But it wasn't until Zoom took me that...

392
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,993
that I really thought I was gonna die.

393
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,462
And I was going to die,

394
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:44,466
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

395
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,870
He gave up his powers to save me.

396
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,472
A guy he didn't even know.

397
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,249
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

398
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,355
I need to tell him how
much that means to me.

399
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,663
Well, all right.

400
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,493
Just give me a little while.

401
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,837
I'll see what I can do.

402
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,440
I got to go.

403
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,210
Hey, Dad.

404
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,820
Thanks.

405
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,188
- Yo!
- In here.

406
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,456
I got your text. What's up?

407
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,992
All right, facial recognition

408
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,361
just picked up Grey breaking into
Ace Chemical down on Newbury Road.

409
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,097
- Is my dad with him?
- I don't know yet.

410
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,398
- But we have to go.
- You sure about that?

411
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,334
Yeah, I'm sure. Look...
we can't just sit here.

412
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,069
Regardless of whether I
have my speed or not,

413
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,013
I have to try to help.
That's never gonna change.

414
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,341
Okay. I'm with you, but we're
gonna need some backup.

415
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,809
- Joe's on his way.
- I'm coming with.

416
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,477
No, look, please just stay here.

417
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,146
We don't know what we're
dealing with yet.

418
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,181
Just finish running the
test on the blood sample.

419
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,692
I'm sorry. Thank you, Jesse.

420
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,242
Griffin Grey, CCPD!

421
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,244
Stay right there.

422
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,682
The man that you
kidnapped, Harrison Wells,

423
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,050
you need to let him go.

424
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,418
I can't do that. Not yet.

425
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,028
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

426
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,963
I guess so.

427
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,973
Okay, He-Man's got some power.

428
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,237
And accuracy.

429
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,772
All right, keep him distracted, okay?

430
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:04,841
What?

431
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,809
Barry! Barry!

432
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,551
I can do this all night.

433
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,614
We just want Wells. Just let him go.

434
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,624
Not until I'm done with him!

435
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,777
Too slow.

436
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,256
- Barry!
- Hey.

437
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,091
Oh, I think I need some
medical attention.

438
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,820
So his genes have actually mutated.

439
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,023
I ran the DNA from the
blood sample Barry found,

440
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:04,260
and the functional myostatin in
his cells is essentially gone.

441
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,062
I mean, giving him super-strength.

442
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,405
Guys, there's something else.

443
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,066
I saw him age.

444
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,434
Right in front of me.

445
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:14,670
He's suffering from oxidated stress.

446
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,574
It means the protein in the DNA in
his body are being ravaged by oxidants.

447
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,052
So, what, he needs to up
his blueberry intake?

448
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:25,848
No, it means... the
more he exerts himself,

449
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,950
the faster he ages.

450
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,154
So if we can get him to
exert too much energy...

451
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:33,089
Then he'll become old and weak.

452
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:35,691
And how do you think
we're gonna do that?

453
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:39,695
I can't watch you be a human punching
bag until he turns into Grandpa Simpson.

454
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,697
I think we can fix that.

455
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:44,767
Jesse, I'm gonna need some of
that quick thinking of yours.

456
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:47,736
Iris.

457
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,746
I got to get back to the station.

458
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:58,789
You okay?

459
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:04,653
No, not really.

460
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:07,857
You know, you were the first
person I saved after I got my powers?

461
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:14,597
We were out on a walk

462
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,932
and we were talking about Eddie

463
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:20,503
and how you were with him,
and I was thinking to myself

464
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:25,040
how I missed a lot while
I was in that coma.

465
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,844
And then all of a sudden,
those cars came at us.

466
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,914
And it was like the world froze.

467
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:35,536
Like... you and I were the only
two people in the world.

468
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,722
I didn't even know what I could do yet,

469
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:42,925
but I knew that I could save you.

470
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,503
And I did.

471
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,630
And now, I don't know.

472
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,031
I don't...

473
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,668
I just don't even know who I am anymore

474
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,445
or who I'm supposed to be.

475
00:25:57,316 --> 00:26:00,193
Barry, you're supposed to be the
same guy that you've always been.

476
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:05,781
Suit or no suit...

477
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:08,091
that guy is a hero.

478
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:15,791
That's everything you asked for.

479
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,161
How do you sleep at night?

480
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:21,864
Knowing you've destroyed
so many people's lives?

481
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:24,041
I don't.

482
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:29,639
Do you have anyone in your
life that you care about?

483
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,874
I have a daughter.

484
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,152
I used to have someone in
my life that I cared about.

485
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,216
My girlfriend, Jenny.

486
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:43,827
We were gonna get married,
have kids someday.

487
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:52,828
But after I got hit by that wave
from the particle accelerator,

488
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:55,030
all my dreams ended.

489
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,133
You know, I see her sometimes,
walking down the street.

490
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:00,069
She doesn't even recognize me.

491
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,637
But why would she?

492
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:03,947
I look as old as her dad.

493
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:07,910
- You robbed me of her.
- Griffin.

494
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,545
Stop talking.

495
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:11,013
So I can concentrate.

496
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,781
Wake up, man.

497
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:16,419
This city is screwed up because of you.

498
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:19,855
It was quiet and normal.

499
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:21,724
Until you rode in on your high horse,

500
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,760
talking about science and
changing the future.

501
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,163
You didn't stop to think about
what your particle accelerator

502
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:30,233
could do to others. You
only thought about

503
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,567
what it could do for you.

504
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,244
Enough!

505
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:37,172
Enough.

506
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:39,742
I hope it was worth it.

507
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:41,452
Doc.

508
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:49,818
Stay away from the wall.

509
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:52,162
Let's give it a whirl.

510
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,580
Well...

511
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,924
looks like you have a little
badass in you, after all.

512
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:29,358
What are we gonna do about this guy?

513
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,893
Oh, Caity.

514
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:33,929
I don't think he's ever going home.

515
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:35,972
And neither are you.

516
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:40,344
What are you doing? I
thought we had a deal.

517
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:44,147
Is everyone on your Earth this gullible?

518
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:56,752
Heels aren't the best on ice, are they?

519
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:58,187
You know, once I saw you,

520
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:01,624
I realized why Zoom didn't kill me.

521
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:04,960
Because I look just like you.

522
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,771
Now he won't need me anymore.

523
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,047
No.

524
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:26,923
I don't.

525
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,057
Try that with him...

526
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,734
he dies, too.

527
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:45,501
Not picking up anything
from facial recognition.

528
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:48,337
The only cellular dead zone I
can find is the one in here.

529
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,005
No offense.

530
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:53,041
No, wait a second, was he wearing
his watch when he left to get me?

531
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,610
Already tried that. GPS isn't working.

532
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,979
Okay, no, but the meta-human
activity would be.

533
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:59,047
I mean, the watch is designed
to track metas, right?

534
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:01,417
And since Griffin Grey is one,
it'll keep sending a message

535
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:02,918
to a server till it goes through.

536
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,788
But since we're on a different
Earth, it'll never go through.

537
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:08,284
So it just keeps sending
the same signal.

538
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:09,925
DEVICE LOCATION

539
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,627
There he is, Central
City Amusement Park.

540
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:13,328
Yeah, and I'm coming with this time.

541
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:14,764
Okay, great, we've found Harry,

542
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:16,164
but how are we gonna stop Grey?

543
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:18,033
I'm so glad that you asked.

544
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:21,103
Jesse and I upgraded the
internal lining of the suit.

545
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,806
Felicity hooked us up with
some dwarfstar alloy.

546
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:25,207
Wait, dwarfstar alloy?

547
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,943
It's the same compound that's used
to protect Ray's A.T.O.M. suit.

548
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,111
That's right.

549
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,013
Super strong, super lightweight.

550
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:33,181
Only thing is, we
couldn't get much of it.

551
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,150
All right, what does that mean?

552
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,288
We could only cover the
chest portion of the suit.

553
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,423
Yeah, sorry.

554
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,469
Here's the other thing...

555
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,560
probably not a big deal...
I'm guessing the suit

556
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,029
will only absorb one of Grey's punches.

557
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,397
Anything more than that,

558
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,998
you'll be like a piñata.

559
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:51,199
Only it won't be candy
coming out, it'll be...

560
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,268
- Me.
- You're... yeah, you.

561
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:54,703
Yeah.

562
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,204
All right.

563
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:59,783
Hopefully, one gimme
punch is all I'll need.

564
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:10,884
Finished.

565
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,281
This is gonna cure me?

566
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,260
As we say in science, I'm
cautiously optimistic.

567
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,990
You know, I learned a
lot about chemistry

568
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,992
in the past two years.

569
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:29,194
Is that right?

570
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:32,197
And I know all you've been doing
is diluting that compound

571
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:35,768
for the past half hour.

572
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:37,377
You don't know how to help me, do you?

573
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,717
There is no helping you.

574
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:49,322
I told you you were gonna
fix me or you were dead!

575
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:14,940
Why is it that bad guys always insist
on having the creepiest hideouts?

576
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,909
'Cause they crazy.

577
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:17,884
Right.

578
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,014
Hey, Barry.

579
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,816
Grey's headed your way.

580
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:24,858
Come on. Hey, come on.

581
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,358
You ready?

582
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,994
Okay, Iris.

583
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:37,162
On my mark.

584
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,497
Three...

585
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:40,365
two...

586
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,333
one.

587
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:42,876
Now!

588
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,908
That all you got, Flash?

589
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:51,076
I just want Dr. Wells.

590
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,711
And I wanted him to fix me.

591
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,079
But he can't.

592
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,949
So once I finish you,
I'm gonna finish him.

593
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,924
Freeze!

594
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:12,139
Come on!

595
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,439
Okay.

596
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:23,475
I think one more punch, and
we get this guy a walker.

597
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,777
Hey, guys, we got him.

598
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,119
He's over by the Ferris Wheel.

599
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,052
Look.

600
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,186
We can help you.

601
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:37,089
It's too late for that.

602
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,893
Not everyone got the
powers you did, Flash.

603
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:42,869
Some of us weren't so lucky.

604
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,805
That was the gimme.

605
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,472
Griffin.

606
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,809
Please stop.

607
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:59,178
I might be getting older,

608
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,454
but I'm stronger than ever.

609
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,569
Barry!

610
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,174
You okay?

611
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:30,575
Yeah, I'm good.

612
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,153
Could've used more of
that dwarfstar alloy.

613
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,619
I'm so sorry.

614
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,396
I'm sorry, too.

615
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:38,069
Home sweet home.

616
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,938
Yeah, well...

617
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:42,908
to be honest, it hasn't felt
much like a home in a while.

618
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:45,658
At least, certainly not since you left.

619
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,326
Yeah.

620
00:35:47,336 --> 00:35:51,698
Look, I'm sorry, Dad, for
just leaving like that.

621
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,132
But...

622
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:54,500
I mean, you have to understand,

623
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,805
I'm the reason you killed that man.

624
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:02,750
And that's a really
heavy burden to bear.

625
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,746
I know.

626
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:11,317
I know... I also know
that what I've done,

627
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,659
it's unforgivable.

628
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,430
When you're mother died, honey...

629
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,700
something inside me broke.

630
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,636
I couldn't protect her.

631
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:34,440
And I swore... I swore
on her grave, no less,

632
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,809
that I would protect you,
and then Zoom took you,

633
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,746
and I snapped.

634
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:42,014
I just snapped.

635
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:45,251
I couldn't breathe, I...

636
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:49,122
I couldn't lose the only other person

637
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:51,139
that I love.

638
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:54,475
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

639
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:57,178
I understand why you did everything

640
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,280
you did to protect me.

641
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,115
I mean, you were only missing one day,

642
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,226
and I would have done
anything to find you.

643
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:07,622
But, I mean...

644
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:10,491
I need to know that that's
never gonna happen again.

645
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,959
Okay?

646
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:14,495
Every time I stay out
late or get in trouble,

647
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:17,131
you can't track me down or hurt someone

648
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:18,566
'cause you're trying to save me.

649
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:20,268
Yeah, but you're in danger.

650
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,211
- I know.
- Okay.

651
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,677
I will make you a promise.

652
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:35,049
I promise you, I will be the kind
of father that you will be proud of.

653
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:39,395
If you promise me you will
never run away from me again.

654
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:41,589
Okay.

655
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,892
Okay, deal.

656
00:37:44,902 --> 00:37:46,294
I love you, Dad.

657
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:48,404
I love you, too.

658
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,641
My little Jesse Quick.

659
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,741
Relax, he'll be here.

660
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,109
What should I say?

661
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,078
I don't even know where to start.

662
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:05,779
Just be honest.

663
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,582
Speak from your heart.

664
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,049
Okay.

665
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,052
Wally West.

666
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:13,629
I'll see you at home.

667
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,624
You wanted to see me.

668
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:18,192
Yes. I did.

669
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:20,135
I mean, I... I do.

670
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:27,167
I just wanted to thank
you for saving my life.

671
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:32,139
And I know that that came
at a huge price for you.

672
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:37,010
And I don't know how
I'll ever repay that.

673
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,582
I guess, what I wanted
to say was that...

674
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:43,284
I'm not gonna waste this chance

675
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:46,254
that you've given me.

676
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:50,324
Thank you.

677
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,301
You're welcome, Wally.

678
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,781
You okay?

679
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:17,217
Stay away from me.

680
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:20,588
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

681
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:24,224
I saved your life.

682
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,693
You should thank me.

683
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,495
I just want to go home.

684
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:29,430
No.

685
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,233
Stay.

686
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:35,210
I want to leave!

687
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,338
Stay, boy!

688
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,247
No!

689
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:43,177
Please.

690
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,487
Take me back to my Earth.

691
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:50,685
You know...

692
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:52,286
I've always measured my success

693
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:55,323
by counting the number
of victims I've had.

694
00:39:55,333 --> 00:40:00,260
But now I think I'm going
to widen my scope.

695
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,540
Start counting the number of
Earths I conquer, instead.

696
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,935
You want to go home?

697
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,937
Let's go.

698
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:11,806
After all, this Earth has already

699
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:13,749
been brought to its knees.

700
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,296
You're here early.

701
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:37,598
Yeah.

702
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:40,534
- I couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.

703
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:46,240
I know that we just took down
Grey without my powers, but...

704
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,710
I have no idea how to get
Caitlin back without them.

705
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,346
We can't, Allen.

706
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:55,257
Then what are we gonna do?

707
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:59,553
You know, Grey...

708
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:03,724
Grey kidnapped me because

709
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:08,195
he thought I was the Harrison
Wells from this Earth,

710
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:10,431
and I know he was talking
about another guy,

711
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,867
but I just...

712
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:16,470
I can't help but think...

713
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,407
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

714
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:20,716
What does that mean?

715
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:27,615
I thought, you know, when you...

716
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,317
when we closed the breaches,

717
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:33,487
I could just forget about
everything I've done,

718
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:36,490
but I can't.

719
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,868
I realize what I can do.

720
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:45,098
You are gonna get your
speed back, Allen.

721
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:48,969
And I'm gonna help you do that.

722
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:50,612
How?

723
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:56,051
By creating another particle
accelerator explosion.
