20
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,560
Morning, roomie.

21
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,550
Morning, roomie.

22
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm going to the market later. You need more apples?

23
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,940
No, but we need more toilet paper.

24
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,210
No prob.

25
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,780
May I?

26
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,890
No prob.

27
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,590
Angel Fluff Plus, two-ply,

28
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,150
unscented, ultra-wide, extra soft.

29
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,840
Two-ply. No prob.

30
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,450
Y-you have to hang the toilet paper

31
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,550
on the dispenser the correct way.

32
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,870
The paper goes over on the top,

33
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,420
not under hanging against the wall.

34
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,240
Sorry, I forgot you like it like that.

35
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,340
I don't "Like it like that."

36
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,090
It's "Right" like that.

37
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,570
NBD
NBD.

38
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,960
It's no big deal.

39
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,300
I got to run.

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,470
Ms. Kohl?

41
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,490
Hi, I'm Dr. Melendez.

42
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,860
Sorry. I have to practice whenever I can.

43
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,290
I practice whenever I can, too.

44
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,970
We heard you hurt your finger.

45
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,220
Can we take a look?

46
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,120
I got a crappy manicure a couple days ago,

47
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,630
and now my nail looks disgusting.

48
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,420
Paronychia -- it's an abscess caused by a common bacterial infection.

49
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,140
We'll drain it, pack it, and send you home.

50
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,480
In 72 hours, the pain and swelling will be much better,

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
and you'll be back to Paganini.

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,950
Apologize already.

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,680
- I did nothing wrong. ‭- So?

54
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,830
You don't want to be iced out by the future Chief of Surgery forever.

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Lim could be Chief, too. Andrews hasn't decided yet.

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,610
Hey, Brown, Park. Hustle in.

57
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,190
EMTs are less than a minute out.

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,340
Park, make sure Bay 3's good to go.

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,530
13-year-old female.

60
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,610
Progressively worsening epistaxis.

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,880
Bolus on the bus. BP 86/51.

62
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,030
It won't stop! I can't get it to stop!

63
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,980
I got home, and she was calling 911.

64
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,940
Not your first nosebleed, huh, Dad?

65
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,760
Well, these things usually go away on their own,

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,580
but Riley claims she's been like this for over an hour.

67
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,160
It's not a claim, it's a fact!

68
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,850
Gonna need to get her on a monitor right away

69
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,890
and apply 4% phenylephrine solution.

70
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
Gonna need to cauterize the bleed.

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,630
It's not my first nosebleed either.

72
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,160
I have my premiere at Davies this weekend,

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,210
hence the manicure.

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,730
Rosin, beeswax -- that stuff is tough to get off.

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,730
You play?

76
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,220
I know my way around bow strings.

77
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,810
I dabbled in archery when I was in high school.

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
I started when I was 5.

79
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,990
I used to hum melodies doing my homework,

80
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,840
eating dinner, taking out the trash.

81
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,400
I wanted to be a train conductor.

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,990
There's still time.

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,030
She's numbed up.

84
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,040
She shouldn't have any pain in her finger.

85
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,440
It's not my finger.

86
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,870
It's further up, by my knuckle.

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,420
No fever.

88
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,030
Any body aches?

89
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,750
Uh, a little.

90
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,540
Playing violin all day stresses out my neck and shoulders.

91
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,560
It's likely tendonitis or mild arthritic pain.

92
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Or it might be flesh-eating bacteria

93
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,900
and we have may have to cut off your finger.

94
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,120
There's the bleeder,

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,500
at the posterior rim of Kiesselbach's plexus.

96
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,460
You called 911?

97
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,810
She did.

98
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,030
How you feeling, baby?

99
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,880
Peachy.

100
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,710
It's a nosebleed. I'm handling it.

101
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,090
She's my kid, too, Bruce.

102
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,060
Bet you couldn't tell they're divorced.

103
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, why don't I take Riley's parents

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,180
to the waiting room so we can --

105
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,290
Talk about me.

106
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,770
Adiós.

107
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,970
We need to know.

108
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,510
Shaun, what do we need to do to know for sure?

109
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,120
We need to cut deeper and get a swab.

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,320
Fingers have thousands of nerve endings.

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,420
Clipping off even the tiniest portion of Jas' finger

112
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,880
could cause permanent damage and be career-ending.

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,930
But if it is necrotizing fasciitis

114
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,290
and we do nothing, she could die.

115
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,190
That would also end her career.

116
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,010
True.

117
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,480
But the numbers, Shaun, the data.

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,830
There's almost no chance that it's nec fasc.

119
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,610
On the other hand, if we test for it,

120
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,370
we will definitely do damage.

121
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,950
Anything else?

122
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,310
Do you hang your toilet paper going over or under?

123
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,390
Doesn't matter.

124
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,250
Before the nosebleeds, it was tummy aches,

125
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,050
insomnia, breathing pain.

126
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,340
Every time, we'd rush her to the pediatrician,

127
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,280
but they couldn't find anything,

128
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,080
so we stopped taking her.

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,400
You think she's faking it?

130
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,450
A therapist said it was likely her subconscious way

131
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,570
of trying to get her family back together.

132
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,590
Well, divorce isn't easy for adults.

133
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,850
Why should kids be able to deal with it any better?

134
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,370
She disengaged,

135
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,660
not just from us, but her friends, school.

136
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,950
It's been five years.

137
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,240
She should have found her new normal by now.

138
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,870
Looks like someone's doing better.

139
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,500
Nosebleed stopped,

140
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,820
but Riley's nasal membranes are pretty thin.

141
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,810
You should be on the lookout for future bleeds.

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,660
Riley, have you been sniffing or snorting any drugs lately?

143
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,660
What? No way. I wouldn't do that.

144
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,610
There's a lot of stuff out there that looks harmless,

145
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,070
- but -- - ‭She said no.

146
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,940
Does FLONASE count?

147
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,680
I was coughing.

148
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,990
I had a stuffy nose, itchy throat.

149
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,530
I looked up my symptoms,

150
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,780
because what the hell else was I supposed to do?

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,120
Vasomotor rhinitis fit.

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,720
So I went to the drug store, and I got some FLONASE.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,010
Misuse of steroid sprays can thin out nasal membranes,

154
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,680
causing terrible nosebleeds.

155
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,860
Quit the FLONASE, you're good to go.

156
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,470
Thank you.

157
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,110
Uh, I need you to take her tonight.

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,890
I had to skip a pitch to an important V.C. to get here.

159
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,630
Sorry, didn't mean to take you away

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,910
from anything important.

161
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,930
You're provoking her. You know she's an anxious kid.

162
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,750
I'm not anxious, I'm sick.

163
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,050
Could you for once have my back?

164
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,480
- What? - ‭This is your fault.

165
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,550
She's playing us against each other.

166
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,410
What's wrong?

167
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
My breathing, I-it hurts.

168
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,460
Just relax, sweetie.

169
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,150
Just stop, both of you.

170
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,540
Vasomotor rhinitis.

171
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,180
That is a pretty unique diagnosis

172
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,260
for an 8th grader.

173
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,690
You'll be numb in a minute.

174
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,750
7th.

175
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,260
And I was wrong.

176
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,640
Doesn't matter.

177
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,820
I get what you're going through.

178
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,350
You were smart, popular.

179
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,740
We don't have anything in common.

180
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,870
I was never popular.

181
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,390
I wore hand-me-downs from Goodwill.

182
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,940
I never knew my dad.

183
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,400
My mom was sick. I couldn't rely on her.

184
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,140
You know, kids at that age can be total...

185
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,070
jerks.

186
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,500
Asshats. Turds.

187
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,700
I wouldn't send my worst enemy back to junior high.

188
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,270
I got so many D's on my report card last year,

189
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,530
I got held back.

190
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,600
Now everyone treats me like I'm stupid.

191
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,260
It's humiliating.

192
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,880
How'd you deal with it?

193
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,710
I said screw it.

194
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,700
They already think I'm bad.

195
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,500
I mess around in class, leave campus,

196
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,680
do whatever the hell I want.

197
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,580
But you're still angry.

198
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,410
I didn't let my past define me...

199
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,940
and yours doesn't have to define you.

200
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,600
Repeating a grade doesn't make you...

201
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,130
What?

202
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,670
What's wrong?

203
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,730
Nothing.

204
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,310
There doesn't seem to be any active bleeding.

205
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,140
But I coughed up blood. That was real.

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,060
It's possible it's just post-nasal aspiration --

207
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,850
that the blood you coughed up was from the initial nosebleed,

208
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,220
and it went down your throat, into your lungs.

209
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,930
But my chest, it really hurts.

210
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,570
Hey, Shaun. What's up?

211
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,840
You forgot to put your coffee cup

212
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,060
in the dishwasher before you left.

213
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,330
Sorry, I was in a rush.

214
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,370
And remember, rinse it out

215
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,430
before you put it in the dishwasher.

216
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,710
- Noted. - ‭And on the top rack.

217
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,090
- I got to go. - ‭Me too.

218
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,440
Morgan doesn't want to know what's wrong with our patient.

219
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,120
I find that hard to believe.

220
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,130
They talk about bow strings.

221
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,790
I don't know anything about bow strings.

222
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,650
They should be talking about what's wrong with her.

223
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,380
You can't always know, Shaun.

224
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,710
Sometimes tests aren't worth it.

225
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Sometimes we don't have the right tests.

227
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,750
What are you doing in here?

228
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,430
Lea and I disagree about toilet paper.

229
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,490
And you made a good point about finding the right test.

230
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,700
Thanks?

231
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,630
I just did a test.

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,760
On toilet paper?

233
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,260
Every toilet paper roll in this restroom

234
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,930
has the paper hanging over, not under,

235
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,140
and they were installed by professionals.

236
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,280
Does it matter?

237
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,460
I-D-G-A...

238
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,390
I think it's an acronym

239
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,120
or maybe even an anagram.

240
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,210
I don't think Lea cares about the toilet paper debate.

241
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,950
It's not a debate. I'm right.

242
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,030
I think you should talk to Lea.

243
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,270
Not text, talk.

244
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,870
Did you talk to Dr. Melendez

245
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,770
after you got in trouble with him?

246
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,460
No.

247
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,620
Why not?

248
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,720
Because I did nothing wrong.

249
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,820
Because you were right.

250
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,330
- Yeah. - ‭So am I.

251
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,070
Make sure all four tips are touching the ground

252
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,750
before you take a step.

253
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, thank you, Iris.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
I never would have figured that out.

255
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,110
I'm required to show you how to use all medical equipment.

256
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,570
Well, I'm not gonna use it. You want to know why?

257
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,890
Because I'm not gonna use it.

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,870
You remind me of my Grandpa Eddie.

259
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,820
So grumpy, so adorable.

260
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,920
See? Look -- no hands.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,890
I'm fine.

262
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,220
Uh, chicken soup -- heard it's good for the soul.

263
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,420
I wasn't expecting you. Thank you.

264
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,180
That's very thoughtful.

265
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,190
It's -- really, it's no big deal.

266
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,990
I signed up to bring you food at the hospital,

267
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,630
the Meal Train that they set up.

268
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,570
- The Meal Train. - Yeah. ‭Yeah.

269
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,600
How -- how are you doing today?

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,550
Well, today is actually looking up.

271
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,240
Good.

272
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,280
You want to come in and have some soup?

273
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,290
I have other plans.

274
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,260
Ah, yeah.

275
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,190
But, um...

276
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm actually free tomorrow.

277
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,050
Do you like lasagna?

278
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,950
I kind of love lasagna.

279
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,140
Great.

280
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
Finally get that second date.

281
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,740
- You know, you don't have to -- - ‭No, Aaron.

282
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,300
I want to.

283
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, then, I want too.

284
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,290
Okay. Great.

285
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,260
Then, um...

286
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,530
I will see you, then, tomorrow.

287
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,640
I'll see you tomorrow.

288
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,910
No one dabbles in archery unless they're at summer camp.

289
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,560
How long did you do it?

290
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,630
Seven days a week for seven years.

291
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,030
Why'd you stop?

292
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,360
It was just time to go to college, medical school,

293
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,530
be a grown-up.

294
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,810
It was that easy to just quit?

295
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,590
Archery doesn't fill concert halls or pay the bills.

296
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,250
She has a slight fever,

297
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,340
her rash is spreading, and she has edema.

298
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,970
This is definitely not paronychia.

300
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,050
I know. I've moved on to MRSA.

301
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,050
That's possible, but you should want proof.

302
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,860
If we do an open, deep-tissue biopsy,

303
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,880
we will know for sure if you have flesh-eating --

304
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,590
Shaun.

305
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,310
Part of being a good doctor

306
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,140
is knowing when to not scare the crap out of a patient.

307
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,170
I don't think so.

308
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,360
This is your problem, not hers --

309
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,990
your need to be sure, your obsession, y--

310
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,130
We need to cut off a small piece of her finger

311
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,920
so we know if we have to cut off a larger --

312
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,020
Shaun, you're acting like you want to amputate her hand.

313
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,820
No. You're acting like you don't want to amputate her hand.

314
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,060
I don't.

315
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,870
But that's not medically relevant.

316
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,230
Her temperature is 102.

317
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,070
It's gone up two degrees since we've been arguing.

318
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,900
Okay. We'll test her.

319
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,840
That tissue has begun to die.

320
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,390
Or it's inflammatory infiltration.

321
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,620
Find anything?

322
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,860
W-we're at an impasse.

323
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,000
Look here, at the margin.

324
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,930
Subcutaneous fat and fascial necrosis.

325
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,180
Shaun was right.

326
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,130
Let's go try to save her hand.

327
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,270
She is a young girl with a lot going on.

328
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,750
Well, we agree on that much.

329
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,570
That's why she needs to see a shrink.

330
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,910
This...

331
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,450
this feels different.

332
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,570
What, you don't believe in emotional intelligence?

333
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,340
If I have to choose between the battery of tests we've done

334
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,660
and your gut, it's an easy choice.

335
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,010
No. You don't relate to her,

336
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,000
and if you don't relate to her, you can't understand her.

337
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,430
You're probably right.

338
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,990
You think you do relate.

339
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, do you have a kid?

340
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,360
My opinion about Riley is medical.

341
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,220
Why haven't you told any of us you have a kid?

342
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,590
That is a huge chunk of your life you've been hiding.

343
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,530
I don't feel the need to share everything

344
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,110
about my personal life with the people I work with.

345
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,630
Oh, that's your passive-aggressive way

346
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,140
of saying I'm an over-sharer?

347
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,040
Yeah.

348
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,180
Your opinion on Riley is clearly skewed

349
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,460
because you're looking at her through a parental lens.

350
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,080
I've been in her shoes.

351
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm better equipped to evaluate her situation.

352
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,830
You're the poster child of skewed.

353
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,080
You're too emotionally involved

354
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,330
and are overreacting because you had a crappy mom

355
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,490
who didn't care about you.

356
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,150
And why do I know all that?

357
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,410
Because you're an over-sharer.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
The scan's clean.

359
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,880
Is it time to send her home?

360
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,230
Clamp.

361
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,040
That is not good.

362
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,070
Muscle's weak. Clamp slid right through the fascia.

363
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,610
Murphy, pull the skin back.

364
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,630
Smells like rotten eggs.

365
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,680
There's only tissue damage.

366
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,070
If we debride her hand carefully,

367
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,410
we can preserve some mobility and dexterity.

368
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,010
She's gonna need close monitoring post-op tonight.

369
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,290
Scissors.

370
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,210
We need to talk.

371
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,290
Can it wait? I'm late for an all-night coding session.

372
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,510
You hung the toilet paper incorrectly.

373
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,240
Right. Did you flip it?

374
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,030
Great, we're done.

375
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,850
You left the TV remote on the couch.

376
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,270
Shaun, I'm running late.

377
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,350
You have to put it on the tray on the coffee table.

378
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,970
That is where it belongs.

379
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,640
If it doesn't have a set place,

380
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,860
then it will be in many places and then it will get lost

381
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,700
and if I can't find it, I can't watch the Weather Channel --

382
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,940
Okay, enough about the damn remote!

383
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,230
Everything in this place has to be your way.

384
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,440
We have to make sure to use two pods in the washing machine,

385
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,130
we have to keep the cups to the left of the plate,

386
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,810
we have to keep the air conditioner at exactly 74,

387
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,650
and we have to use one very specific,

388
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,280
very hard-to-find toilet paper.

389
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,720
And I'm trying to be accommodating,

390
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,100
but you are not cutting me any slack.

391
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,810
Oh, God.

392
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,350
Shaun.

393
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,290
Shaun, I am sorry. I'm -- Are you okay?

394
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,690
You have a ruptured Achilles.

395
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm afraid your weekend warrior days are over --

396
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,980
Help! Can we get some help here?

397
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,820
Right there.

398
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,750
What happened?

399
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,600
She couldn't sleep, uh, she spiked a fever.

400
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,820
It's only getting worse.

401
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,580
I can't breathe.

402
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,160
Take a deep breath, in, out.

403
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,970
40.3°
‭104.6.

404
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,090
I need IV acetaminophen and cooling blankets ASAP.

405
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,110
She's tachypneic with an O2 SAT of 87.

406
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,730
Is this -- is this something new or --

407
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,180
Did -- I mean, did she do this to herself?

408
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,250
She has an infection.

409
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,540
I think she's developed pneumonia

410
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,100
due to an underlying condition.

411
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,250
What underlying condition?

412
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,650
I have no idea. Page Park and Lim.

413
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,050
No signs of PE or pneumonia.

414
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,490
CFTR was negative for cystic fibrosis.

415
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,320
I think we may have missed something on her CT.

416
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,580
There -- that slight shadow on the bronchus.

417
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,580
A slow-growing carcinoid tumor

418
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,560
could cause chronic airway inflammation.

419
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,660
As the tumor grows, symptoms worsen,

420
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,180
leading to airway obstruction and infection.

421
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,580
Or it's just a shadow,

422
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,950
a slight shadow.

423
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,160
It is pretty subtle.

424
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,790
I would like to do exploratory VATS.

425
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,280
You want to poke holes in her chest

426
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,750
and go rooting around in her lungs?

427
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,470
Riley's body's already compromised.

428
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,980
There are no obvious lesions,

429
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,580
and her symptoms are more likely indicators

430
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,090
of a simple sinus infection.

431
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,840
The safer, better plan is to treat with antibiotics.

432
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,580
If she has a progressing tumor,

433
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,880
we can't just send her home with medication.

434
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,360
Pitch the surgery to the parents and Riley.

435
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,440
Okay.

436
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,390
Don't touch those. Those are vintage.

437
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,840
Well, I'm just scooting your toys over

438
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,950
so it's easier to get to your medication.

439
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,640
Toys. Toys?

440
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,550
These are not toys.

441
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,430
That's Reggie Jackson.

442
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,880
Well, when that timer goes off,

443
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,750
Roger Johnson can give you your medicine.

444
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,530
Reggie Jackson.

445
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,830
Hey, guess what.

446
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,650
Quitting time.

447
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,030
Okay. Have fun.

448
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,740
- Take your pills. - ‭Yeah.

449
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,640
I think I broke Shaun.

450
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,970
We got into a big fight, huge,

451
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,720
and I was yelling and he just fell apart.

452
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,690
It was awful.

453
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,420
And he pushes and pushes and pushes. I pushed back.

454
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,220
Well, Shaun's not easy, but you knew that.

455
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,480
I knew it was gonna be hard, but living with him is a lot.

456
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,470
- I know. - ‭I mean, there's stuff I've never even thought about.

457
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,860
And I know he has idiosyncrasies,

458
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,340
but there's a lot of them. I mean, a lot.

459
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,800
I know. Is Shaun okay?

460
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,250
Yes. No. I don't know.

461
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,210
He's at work.

462
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,420
Glassy, you know him,

463
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,250
like really know him.

464
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,090
How do I deal with Shaun?

465
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,090
Well, it's been 12 years, and I'm still learning.

466
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,590
He just always has to be right.

467
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,720
I mean, do you -- do you know how many calls and texts

468
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,760
and notes he's left me about how I'm doing stuff wrong?

469
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,140
I have a pretty good idea, yeah.

470
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,610
Yeah, well, it's exhausting.

471
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,600
You know what? We all have quirks.

472
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,140
We can all be a pain in the ass from time to time.

473
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,400
Okay, admittedly Shaun a little more so.

474
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,860
That is not helpful.

475
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,250
- Sit down. - ‭What?

476
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,260
- Sit down. ‭- Why?

477
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,920
Why? Because you're agitated and you're annoying me

478
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,430
and I can't give you good advice in that state.

479
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,620
Sit.

480
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,400
Thank you.

481
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,250
Do you like Shaun?

482
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,440
- Of course. ‭- Why?

483
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,060
He's sweet, kind, honest, sometimes brutally honest,

484
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,390
there's never an agenda with him.

485
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,460
He's just Shaun.

486
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,410
So?

487
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,060
So I want him to change...

488
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,380
a little.

489
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,090
You moved in expecting him to change?

490
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,590
He doesn't want you to change.

491
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,750
I know that.

492
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,990
And if I made the wrong decision?

493
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,950
Then you move out and you do it right now.

494
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,770
It'll devastate him, but the longer you wait, the more...

495
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,290
the worse it will be for him.

496
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,950
If Riley has a tumor,

497
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,470
we need to open her up to find out what we're dealing with.

498
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,760
Why do you think she has a tumor?

499
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,010
It's consistent with her symptoms.

500
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,270
The same symptoms she's been having for years?

501
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,350
Yes.

502
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,970
The same symptoms we've been told are psychological,

503
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,000
the same symptoms a dozen doctors have run

504
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,470
a hundred tests for and found nothing?

505
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,770
There is a shadow on her CT image.

506
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,770
A shadow?

507
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,790
And it's risky surgery?

508
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,420
Opening her up in a weakened state could be dangerous.

509
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,550
Look, I know Riley frustrates you,

510
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,540
drives you crazy,

511
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,030
but I also know you love her.

512
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,980
You have a chance to show her that.

513
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,860
So you want to do this as a statement?

514
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,280
We want you to believe in your daughter,

515
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,260
because that's what a parent does.

516
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,840
When she was little

517
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,730
and had a bad dream,

518
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,080
she used to come into our room and snuggle up under your arm,

519
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,770
just like she's doing to me.

520
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,180
You would stroke her face

521
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,060
until she was finally at peace and fell asleep.

522
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,470
She's in so much pain,

523
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,630
and I don't know how to make it go away.

524
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,100
Riley?

525
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,830
The doctors,

526
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,140
t-they want to see what's going on in your lungs.

527
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,780
They think you might have a tumor.

528
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,050
And we want them to operate.

529
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,810
You think I have a real tumor?

530
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,970
It's scary, I know, but...

531
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,730
Yes, we do.

532
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,050
Her BP's dropping out -- 73/51.

533
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,760
Heart rate is spiking to 137.

534
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,920
- Hang an IV saline bolus. - I need a 12-lead.

535
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,780
The necrosis has migrated.

536
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,080
She's septic.

537
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,060
There's definite infiltration to the bone.

538
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,090
We're gonna have to amputate her arm.

539
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,060
Polish the bone to help stump healing.

540
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,630
Rasp.

541
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,110
The margins appear to be clean.

542
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,680
There's still a small chance microbes

543
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,760
may have spread to her organs.

544
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,260
If they did, then her mortality rate

545
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,110
just increased exponentially.

546
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,660
What if we put her in hyperbaric oxygen therapy now?

547
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,840
Oxygen's toxic to bacteria.

548
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,430
There's a lot of things that could go wrong in there.

549
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,590
We wouldn't be able to decompress the chamber in time to help her.

550
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,240
We wouldn't have to wait to help her

551
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,140
if someone goes in with her.

552
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,730
I'll do it.

553
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,270
Okay. Get the chamber ready.

554
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,080
Lung tissue looks normal.

555
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,340
And there are healthy-appearing bronchi.

556
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,190
Nothing...yet.

557
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,040
Damn it. Tore a lobar artery.

558
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,230
BP is 81/49, oxygen SATS 93,

559
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,490
heart rate is going up. She is tanking.

560
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,950
Park, I need more suction. I can't see a thing in here.

561
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,490
We need to do an open thoracotomy now.

562
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,340
Browne, crack her chest.

563
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,380
10 blade and a rib spreader.

564
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,580
There are only 7.18 cubic meters in there.

565
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,850
How does it feel?

566
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,520
It's fine.

567
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,410
I thought it might feel claustrophobic

568
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,240
for someone neurotypical.

569
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,520
It is.

570
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,110
Got it.

571
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,560
It's still bleeding.

572
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,140
Stroke volume just bottomed out.

573
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,350
Rapid infuse 4 liters of whole blood.

574
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,890
Get ready to start cardiac massage.

575
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,390
Wait. I think I have an anchor in the arterial wall.

576
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,740
Stroke volume is rising,

577
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,940
BP increasing, 90/60.

578
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,690
Pulse is 90 and regular.

579
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,540
She's stable for now.

580
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,030
This was a mistake.

581
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,480
We need to close her up as soon as possible.

582
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,040
It doesn't make any sense.

583
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,700
Her arterial wall shouldn't be this fragile.

584
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,440
Something else has caused it to thin out.

585
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,560
What else is going on in here?

586
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,810
Browne, I need more light.

587
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,810
Yeah. See that?

588
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,330
A localized granuloma on the right lower lobe.

589
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,390
You think it's cancer?

590
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,960
Not sure but something's in there.

591
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,360
Park, retract the lung.

592
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,640
It's a LEGO.

593
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,190
Riley must've inhaled it years ago.

594
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,400
It settled in your lung

595
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,100
and became encased in inflammatory tissue.

596
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,890
Your body's immune response attacked it,

597
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,140
making you progressively more sick over the years.

598
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,480
It's small, thin, and made of plastic.

599
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,730
There was no way of seeing it on any of the imaging.

600
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,920
Ugh. This is so gross.

601
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm gonna make it into a necklace.

602
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,270
Good luck. Excuse me.

603
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,520
We're sorry that we didn't believe in you.

604
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,410
We're sorry that we put you through all this.

605
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,980
We're sorry that we got divorced.

606
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,500
You guys are way better off apart.

607
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,340
W-we always thought you were upset because we split up.

608
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,010
I was upset because you fought all the time.

609
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,020
You still do.

610
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,570
It freaked me out.

611
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,970
So I'd hide in my princess tent,

612
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,310
bite my nails, gnaw on crayons...

613
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,980
chew on LEGOs.

614
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,620
We screwed up,

615
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,120
and we promise we can do better.

616
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,360
I am not saying that "Ordinary People"

617
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,450
is not a good movie. I'm --

618
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,810
It's a good -- it's a great movie.

619
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,990
It's a great movie.

620
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,970
Okay, but I'm saying is that "Raging Bull"

621
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,520
is a superior cinematic experience.

622
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,290
It is raw. It's, like, romantic.

623
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,630
It's romantic?

624
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,220
It pummels you from start to finish.

625
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,040
Exactly. Exactly.

626
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,600
It's like adrenaline is pulsing through your veins.

627
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,570
It leaves me breathless every time I watch it.

628
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,090
Do you -- do you want to, like, go for a walk?

629
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,600
Well, it's a little cold outside.

630
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,900
- I'm gonna kiss you. - ‭You are?

631
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,040
‭Okay.

632
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,880
- Maybe we'll walk upstairs? - ‭Okay.

633
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,500
This way?

634
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,170
- C-can -- can I help? - No. Thank you.

635
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,800
I'll get there. I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm okay.

636
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,710
Is my hand okay?

637
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,530
Your biopsy was positive for necrotizing fasciitis.

638
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,420
We had to do multiple surgeries

639
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,330
to remove the infected muscle and bone.

640
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,600
Bone?

641
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm so sorry, Jas.

642
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,610
We had to amputate your arm.

643
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,010
No.

644
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,430
No, my -- my arm still hurts.

645
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,170
I can -- I can feel it. It's still there.

646
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,590
What you're experiencing is "Phantom pain."

647
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,870
Your arm is gone.

648
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,170
H-he told you.

649
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,710
My arm.

650
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,550
My arm is gone.

651
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,940
It's gone and --

652
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,410
and it's -- it's your fault.

653
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,190
Get out.

654
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,100
Get the hell out.

655
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,100
I can't.

656
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,700
Neither of us can.

657
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,530
You called it.

658
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,060
Well done.

659
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,700
Thanks for your help.

660
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,810
Finally a believer in the power of emotional intelligence?

661
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,300
Oh, it did get her parents on board,

662
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,290
even if it's only for a little while.

663
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
They believe their kid,

664
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,320
and they're working on their family relationships.

665
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,920
It's pretty big steps.

666
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,790
It was a nice moment.

667
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,280
But if you think you changed them, that they'll be

668
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,560
different people tomorrow than they were yesterday,

669
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,750
then you're kidding yourself.

670
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,090
Right now, my emotional intelligence is telling me

671
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,950
even you don't believe that.

672
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,400
Kitchen's clean,

673
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,280
leftovers are in the fridge.

674
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,210
How you doing?

675
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,770
Fine.

676
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,210
I just got a little lightheaded.

677
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,510
Balance isn't quite back to normal.

678
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,420
Well, now that you're feeling a little better,

679
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,130
you want to watch "Raging Bull"?

680
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,080
No.

681
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,680
Okay. Another time.

682
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,550
No.

683
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,700
I can't do this.

684
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,550
We can take it slow.

685
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,350
I'm -- I'm happy to just be here with you, like this.

686
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,690
No. I can't -- I can't be here like this.

687
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,090
I-I-I don't want you to f...

688
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,480
I just... I don't want to...

689
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,530
I'm sorry. I just -- I need you to go, please.

690
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,770
Jas practiced violin every day since she was 5.

691
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
She put all her faith in me to do the right thing, and...

692
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,120
I thought I did. I --

693
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,970
Shaun didn't care. He --

694
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,540
He didn't see her dreams. He just saw her symptoms.

695
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,130
Sometimes that'll be the wrong choice.

696
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,680
My second year in the program, there was this resident.

697
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,860
She was kind of weird.

698
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,140
She wore comic book T-shirts,

699
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,910
always ate the exact same lunch.

700
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,940
But she was smart.

701
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,280
She would get surgeries and knock 'em out of the park

702
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,020
over and over again.

703
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,020
Couldn't stand her.

704
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,660
And one day I realized I was competing against her,

705
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,340
but she wasn't competing against me.

706
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,840
She spent her time observing, asking questions,

707
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,760
preparing herself to be a great surgeon.

708
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,230
Is she?

709
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,530
Dr. Lim is one of the best trauma surgeons in the country.

710
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,920
- Dr. Melendez. ‭- Dr. Browne.

711
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,130
Dr. Lim.

712
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,670
Nice save today.

713
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,680
I heard. Yes, good work, Dr. Browne.

714
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,720
Thank you.

715
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,480
Good night.

716
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,830
You know she showed bad judgment.

717
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,380
You got something to say, just say it.

718
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,700
Want to grab a beer?

719
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,640
Yes.

720
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,920
Are you okay?

721
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes.

722
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,050
I'm so sorry for my outburst yesterday.

723
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,150
I'm fine now.

724
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,020
I'm not, Shaun.

725
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,180
Coming back to California and starting a new job

726
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,840
and moving in with you --

727
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,380
it's been so stressful,

728
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,850
harder than I anticipated.

729
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,990
You're moving out.

730
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,730
No, I'm not moving out.

731
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,750
We are still figuring out each other's quirks.

732
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,040
Oh, yes.

733
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,950
You're very difficult to live with.

734
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,940
I know I forget stuff a lot,

735
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,530
and sometimes I snap and yell.

736
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,640
I promise to work on that.

737
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,820
And I don't need you to change,

738
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,080
but I do need to know that you know

739
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,640
you're annoying as hell.

740
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:47,010
I need to know that you'll try to compromise.

741
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,310
I don't think I can use one-ply toilet paper.

742
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,860
Oh, no, you were so right about two-ply.

743
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,040
Totally worth the extra $1.50.

744
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,370
But maybe the cups can go to the right of the plates.

745
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,620
Sometimes.

746
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,310
Well, everything's unpacked.

747
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,960
We're officially moved in together.

748
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,190
I'm gonna take these down to the recycling.

749
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,140
And I know I probably didn't put everything in the right place,

750
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,420
but maybe we can rearrange it together.

751
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,590
I like that idea very much.
