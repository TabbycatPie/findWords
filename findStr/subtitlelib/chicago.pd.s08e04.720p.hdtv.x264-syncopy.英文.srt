18
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,370
I don't wanna go to work today.

19
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,390
Just tell the bad guys to take a week off.

20
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,730
I like this plan.

21
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,840
Don't get it.

22
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,310
I have to.

23
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,520
- Dude, I have to. - No. Don't do it.

24
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,940
- Don't do it! - I have to.

26
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,860
What's up?

27
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,720
Looks like my dad collapsed.

28
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,240
He had a heart attack. He's at Med right now.

29
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,040
What?

30
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,970
Is this out of the blue? Is he not feeling well?

31
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,930
Uh, no--I don't really talk to him anymore, but...

32
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,080
my mom said he's doing better.

33
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,180
I don't know, not drinking, exercising,

34
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,370
you know, "Changed." Whatever.

35
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,520
Let's go. I'll take you to Med.

36
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,340
Okay.

37
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,300
I'll let you out when we get there,

38
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,500
and I'll look for parking.

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,970
That's okay. You don't have to come in.

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,130
You sure?

41
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,980
Yeah. Thank you.

42
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,110
Units on the city-wide.

43
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,970
We got a call of a man down in an alley,

44
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,870
possible homicide. 4220 West Maypole.

45
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,940
That's five blocks away. Come on, let's roll.

46
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,210
Roll? What about your dad?

47
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,380
I'll go later.

48
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,230
5021 Henry, plainclothes officers responding.

49
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,690
Halstead and Upton, intelligence.

50
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,920
- What do we have, officer? - Homeless guy found him.

51
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,150
Notified a store owner who called 911.

52
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,810
Two gunshot wounds to the back.

53
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,620
What is this?

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,930
He's ice cold.

55
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,560
Oh, man, he's a cop.

57
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,810
Patrol Officer Mike Blaine. He's got 22 years on the job--

58
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,420
- You gotta be kidding me. - What?

59
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,020
Man, I knew him.

60
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,480
We worked together four years in Vice.

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,230
- Like, I knew him well. - I'm so sorry, Sarge.

62
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,950
- All right, what else? - Two shots in the back.

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,930
We found two .45 caliber casings

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,520
about ten feet from the body.

65
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,410
- Time of death? - Around 11:00 P.M. last night.

66
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,540
- Robbery? - Don't think so.

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,470
Watch, wallet, cash-- all found on him.

68
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,050
There's no sign of a struggle, either.

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,430
- Sounds like an ambush. - Yeah.

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,170
We know what he was doing over here?

71
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,800
No, sir.

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,230
Doesn't sound like he was on the clock.

73
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,830
You telling me he wasn't on OT?

74
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,340
His sergeant said he turned in his squad keys at 10:00 P.M.

75
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,820
Checked his car.

76
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,280
Saber radio, duty rig, vest--all packed.

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,660
Everything indicates he was done with his tour.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,500
Right, I don't have to tell you there's gonna be a lot of eyes on this,

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,690
so we do it by the numbers, understand?

80
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,900
PODs, cameras, witnesses. Let's go.

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,010
I'll see you on the other side, Mike.

82
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,720
- Any word on your dad? - Uh, yeah.

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,570
Doctors confirmed it was a heart attack.

84
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,110
But he's in stable condition, so...

85
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,920
If you gotta take off, I totally get it.

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,150
Nah, they're doing tests.

87
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,860
Can't do anything for him, anyway.

88
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,850
Okay--I mean, are you sure?

89
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,460
It might be nice to just go see him.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,910
A cop just got shot. Let's focus on that, 'kay?

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,020
- All right. - Sergeant!

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,190
- Look, he's my partner. - Hey, it's okay!

93
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,250
Let him through.

94
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,660
Had to see it with my own eyes.

95
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,680
- Rodriguez. - Hank Voight.

96
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,510
You're Sergeant Voight?

97
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,520
Mike spoke highly of you. I'm glad you're on this.

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,360
Listen, you guys got anything on the books over here?

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,950
No, sir. Been working a burglary detail.

100
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,350
Gold Coast, all year.

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,550
I assume everything's good with Dana, right?

102
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah, happily married. 18 years.

103
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,490
Listen, man, this is a rough neighborhood.

104
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,060
You got any idea why Mike would be over here?

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,850
No.

106
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,330
Shift ended, said he was going straight home to Dana.

107
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,870
Said she made lasagna.

108
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,730
Anything unusual the past few weeks?

109
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,570
Not really.

110
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,460
The only thing I can think of is, he went off-book

111
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,010
two days ago for a couple of hours.

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,480
Said he had a doctor's appointment.

113
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,650
Didn't ring true.

114
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,210
Tom?

115
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,280
There's Dana.

116
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,340
- Look, I have to go... - No, no.

117
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,560
Let me talk to her.

118
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,640
Here, just remember it's an active crime scene.

119
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,730
- Thanks, Sarge. - Dana...

120
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Hank...

121
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
I'm sorry, ma'am.

122
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,180
I'm so sorry.

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,120
Sarge.

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,920
So techs found faint tire impressions near Blaine's body.

125
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,300
It all points to a small model vehicle.

126
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,590
Corroborates what a witness saw,

127
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,640
a compact vehicle speeding away with...

128
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,540
lightning bolts for taillights.

129
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,480
That adds up to a 2017-to-19 Prius model.

130
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,700
Problem is, no Priuses are registered

131
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,650
- to anyone in the area. - Okay, keep chasing it.

132
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,500
Yes...

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,660
What?

134
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,690
We also got some suspicious texts

135
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,360
from Blaine's phone to a burner phone a couple days ago.

136
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,250
Blaine says, "You got it?"

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,900
Five minutes later, he gets a text back--

138
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,560
"Wilson Park, 2:00 p.M."

139
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,920
So we pulled security footage from the park,

140
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,690
and, uh, we got Blaine here walking at 2:05 p.M., same day.

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,350
Then this dude with the tats walks up.

142
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,730
There's a hand-to-hand exchange.

143
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,390
So we ran him through facial rec.

144
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,860
It's Marco Perez.

145
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,780
He is a shot caller for the Latin Jokers.

146
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,520
This Perez, he's got a long sheet,

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,460
including an armed robbery with a .45

148
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,870
that was never recovered.

149
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,160
Kevin's waiting for his LKA.

150
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,390
He did three years in Stateville

151
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,600
on a distribution charge.

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,030
The arresting officer on that pinch was Mike Blaine.

153
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,850
So we got Blaine, on-duty, receiving a suspicious envelope

154
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,650
from a known banger that he arrested.

155
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,150
Two days later, he's shot with a .45 while he's off-duty.

156
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,010
None of this looks good.

157
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,230
Doesn't matter.

158
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,260
We follow the leads wherever they take us.

159
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,310
According to narcotics,

160
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,190
they're taking us to 2321 Holden Street.

161
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,010
He's got a stash house in Little Village.

162
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,620
Okay, good. Let's roll.

163
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,960
All right, listen.

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,220
Until we know more, I wanna keep this video

165
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,010
of Blain and Perez off-book.

166
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,130
You got it, Sarge.

168
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,530
Jay, you set?

169
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
In position, ready when you are.

170
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,390
Copy that. We're moving in.

171
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
Clear. I'll take the right.

172
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,270
We got a runner!

173
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,540
- Don't do it, Marco! - Hands up!

174
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,630
You know the drill! Show me, now!

175
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,050
- Hands up! - Hands up.

176
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,930
Get your ass down.

177
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,540
Stand up. Walk back towards me.

178
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,680
Back just real slow.

179
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,710
Well, business must be good.

180
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,280
Recovered 20 grand at your stash.

181
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,190
I don't know what you're talking about, bro.

182
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,660
We found your gun, too. Sig Sauer .45.

183
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,870
Slugs are a match to a gun used in a cop murder.

184
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,010
That's a lie.

185
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,390
Two days ago. That's you.

186
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,450
Talking to the dead cop.

187
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,480
I didn't kill Mike!

188
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,220
I was in Gary last night. I had my gun with me, too.

189
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,180
- But you knew Mike Blaine? - Yeah.

190
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,950
He busted me four years ago.

191
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,040
After I got out, we crossed paths from time to time.

192
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,740
Said hello, that sort of thing. Became friends, kind of.

193
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,460
When's the last time you saw him?

194
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,120
That day.

195
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,890
Tell me what's in that envelope.

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,540
Money.

197
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,600
Three grand.

198
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,520
He needed a loan, so I took care of him.

199
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,410
Gave him a good deal, too.

200
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,710
Mike tell you what he needed the money for?

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,730
No, just said he needed it quick

202
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,130
to help out a friend.

203
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,130
Anything else?

204
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,440
He was driving away...

205
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,270
Some white boy pulled up, though.

206
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,910
Started taking pictures with his phone.

207
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,330
- Okay. - Mike lost it.

208
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,500
Started screaming at him.

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,060
This white boy just flipped him off and drove away.

210
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,420
You think he knew this kid?

211
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,830
I don't know, man, it looked that way.

212
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
You get a good look at him?

213
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
White, brown hair, 20s.

214
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,170
Drove one of those electric cars,

215
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,370
like a Prius or something. That's all I know.

216
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,600
That's all I know.

217
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,210
Hey, Sarge. Perez's alibi checks out.

218
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,370
There's video of him at a gas station in Gary.

219
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Same time Blaine was shot.

220
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,620
So we eliminated Perez, but take a look at this.

221
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,630
We dug into his story about the angry kid in the Prius.

222
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,860
Led us to this guy, Zach Phillips.

223
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,890
I found traffic cams

224
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,410
four blocks away from the crime scene.

225
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,930
Silver Prius registered to that same Zach Phillips.

226
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,950
11:19 P.M.

227
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,380
That's the same night Blaine was shot.

228
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,840
On top of that, he filed an excessive force complaint

229
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,250
against Blaine a few weeks back.

230
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,330
We showed Perez a six-pack.

231
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,410
He confirmed Zach is the guy taking photos.

232
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,250
Okay, so what do we know about Zach?

233
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,960
He's 25 years old. He owns a graphic design firm.

234
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,720
No priors.

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
His only blemish is a disorderly conduct pinch

236
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,900
at a recent protest,

237
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,660
where Blaine was the arresting officer.

238
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,380
Two days after that bust,

239
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
Zach started posting on an anti-police website.

240
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,150
Goes by the name FTPNow.

241
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,900
We got him saying, "Copaganda must end.

242
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,330
"If CPD won't punish Officer Blaine,

243
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,930
"Perhaps someone else will.

244
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,770
Remember, Mike, karma's a bitch."

246
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,130
And this is three days ago?

247
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,400
All right, split up.

248
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,290
Check all possibilities. Track him down now.

249
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,860
- He's in apartment 3G. - Yeah, I just don't know if...

250
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,040
- Yeah, okay. - Zach Phillips?

251
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,420
Yeah? What's going on?

252
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,090
Chicago PD. We need to talk to you.

253
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,740
Ma'am, can you give us a few minutes, please?

254
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,770
It's okay, babe. I'll call you later.

255
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,860
What's going on? What is this?

256
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,980
It's about the murder of a Chicago police officer.

257
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,340
We need you to come down to the district,

258
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,780
help us clear up a few things.

259
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Am I under arrest?

260
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,940
We wanna talk to you about Mike Blaine--

261
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,120
I said, am I under arrest?

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,920
She just told you, we need to--

263
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,570
I don't have to go anywhere.

264
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,120
I know my rights.

265
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,930
Okay, now you're under arrest.

266
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,210
Put your hands out to the side.

267
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,730
Since you know so much, you probably know that

268
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,710
your latest post about Mike Blaine is in violation

269
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,850
of Section 20-12-9 of the Illinois Criminal Code--

270
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,970
That's aggravated assault.

271
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,300
You have the right to remain silent.

272
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,220
Anything you say or do can and will be used

273
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,420
against you in a court of law.

274
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,390
You have the right to an attorney.

275
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,920
Where were you last night around 11:00 p.M.?

276
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,510
On my way to my girlfriend's apartment.

277
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,200
Does she live on 109th Street?

278
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,210
No.

279
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,100
Were you driving on 109th Street at that time?

280
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,530
Possibly.

281
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,780
Let me refresh your memory, Zach.

282
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,320
That's you, caught on a traffic cam at 11:19 p.M.

283
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,850
on 109th Street.

284
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,460
That's four blocks from where Officer Blaine was shot.

285
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,750
Guessing I wasn't the only one on the road at that time.

286
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,870
No, you weren't.

287
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,600
But you were the only person on the road at that time

288
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,120
who filed an official complaint against Officer Blaine,

289
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,960
who made online threats against Officer Blaine.

290
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,940
He practically broke my kneecap with his nightstick.

291
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,830
Then the bastard handcuffed me

292
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,410
and put me into the back of a police car

293
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,720
for three hours.

294
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,060
I told him I had asthma. He didn't care.

295
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,230
Left me there to die.

296
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,620
You threw a rock at him, Zach.

297
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,390
I didn't throw a damn thing.

298
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,700
I swear to God.

299
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,970
He thought I did, so he stopped me

300
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,200
and started bullying me.

301
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,900
So that's why you shot him, for revenge?

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
No, I didn't shoot anyone.

303
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,170
Okay.

304
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,310
So what were you doing on 109th Street?

305
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,110
All right, Zach's apartment was pretty clean.

306
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,510
I gotta show you something.

307
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,530
He had pictures that he took of Blaine

308
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,480
the night before the murder.

309
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,430
He was definitely following him and stalking him...

310
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,730
That doesn't mean he killed Mike.

311
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,700
I mean, this kid seems more like a choir boy

312
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,860
than a cop killer.

313
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,730
Either way, he dug up some dirt.

314
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,770
Digital footprint puts Blaine at South Bishop Street at 9:00 p.M.

315
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,130
Now I know you know it's a high crime area--

316
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,470
drugs, hookers...

317
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,160
Blaine waits by his car.

318
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
An unknown woman approaches.

319
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,670
They share a quick hello.

320
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,650
He then slips her an envelope--

321
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm guessing it's the envelope

322
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,810
he got from Perez with the three grand in it.

323
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,550
She proceeds to get into his car.

324
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,160
They stay there for ten minutes...before she exits.

325
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,060
Don't know what happened inside,

326
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,590
but obviously, that doesn't look great.

327
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,850
Were you able to ID the woman?

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,610
No, it's just...it's not enough for facial rec.

329
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,570
Blaine got any CIs that match her description?

330
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,650
No.

331
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,010
- So I'm guessing - Well, you don't get to guess, not on this one.

332
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,790
Show the photos to his partner. Maybe he can help.

333
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,590
All right.

334
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,530
You got it, boss.

335
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,400
Sarge.

336
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,620
Hank, you got a visitor.

337
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,560
- Dana. - Hank.

338
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,450
- You okay? - No.

339
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm trying to keep it together, but...

340
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,550
I'm getting the runaround from Mike's district.

341
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm hearing that because Mike might've been off-book,

342
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,730
that the city won't pay a full pension

343
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,640
- for a line-of duty death. - Look, it's gonna be okay.

344
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm gonna look into it. I'll see what's going on.

345
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,510
My kids need to know that their dad died a hero.

346
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,960
I know it doesn't sound like much, but--

347
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,570
Hey, I understand.

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,830
And we need the benefits, Hank.

349
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,900
We're low on cash. Real low.

350
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,910
I'm gonna take care of it.

351
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,220
Thank you.

352
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,970
Come on.

353
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,110
Hey, take her home.

354
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,890
Sure.

355
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,240
Mike was a good man, and a good cop.

356
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,680
I know he was.

357
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,810
You should know, IAD is looking into Blaine's murder.

358
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,450
Rather than send him off with a salute and a pension,

359
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,960
they wanna catch him dirty.

360
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Thanks, Trudy.

361
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,980
Did you open an IAD investigation into Mike Blaine?

362
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,770
I did.

363
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,020
This how we treat dead cops now?

364
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,750
Open an IAD investigation?

365
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,880
What, we gotta make sure they're squeaky clean

366
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,380
before we console the widow, pay their benefits?

367
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,820
I was just doing my job.

368
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,060
Come on, what's going on? What am I missing?

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,820
The press is all over this. I'm getting a lot of heat

370
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,540
from FOP to give a "slain hero" speech.

371
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,110
But before I do that, I need to know who he was.

372
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,520
And who he wasn't.

373
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,510
Then you should probably hold off

374
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,680
on giving that hero speech for now.

375
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,610
We still can't explain some of his movements.

376
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,190
So just...let me do a little more digging

377
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,170
before you put yourself out there.

378
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,040
So what's the word with your dad?

379
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,730
Yeah, he's okay.

380
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,250
He's got two clogged arteries,

381
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,240
so they need to do a bypass surgery.

382
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,450
- When? - Two days.

383
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,740
What, are you gonna go see him?

384
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,360
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.

385
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,900
Hailey--

386
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,010
Look, I know who your dad was, and I know what he did.

387
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,340
But if something happens... and you don't go see him,

388
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,620
then you're gonna carry this for the rest of your life.

389
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,200
So don't do it for him, just do it for you.

390
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,510
What do we know about the woman

391
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,750
- in the photo with Blaine? - Not a damn thing.

392
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,120
Rodriguez didn't recognize her, so I've gotta keep digging.

393
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,290
I got an email from forensics--

394
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,550
they said the mud on Zach's tires is a match

395
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,250
to the mud and rocks at the crime scene.

396
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,210
Okay, great, so Zach was there.

397
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,690
But we got no evidence that he actually did the murder.

398
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,630
I checked surveillance cams in the area,

399
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,720
came up with nothing.

400
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,070
I mean, do we really think this dude did this?

401
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,150
Two in the back?

402
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,230
That's pretty hardcore for a graphic designer.

403
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,740
We know he was there,

404
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,250
and he's still our only suspect.

405
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,000
All right, so let's go back,

406
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,630
try talking to Zach one more time. Just...

407
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,070
play nice.

408
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,440
Let's see if we can get this kid to open up.

409
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,850
All right, Zach.

410
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,110
The evidence is piling up.

411
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,010
The mud and rocks on your tires are an exact match

412
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,680
to the mud and rocks at the crime scene.

413
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,080
So we know you were there.

414
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,140
We also know that you've been following Blaine,

415
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,440
taking pictures.

416
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,590
You're right, I was.

417
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,190
I wanted to prove that he was a bad person, a bad cop.

418
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,760
Because I know you guys - the Chicago Police Department--

419
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,440
would never look into him,

420
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,640
investigate the misconduct report that I filed.

421
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,560
Well, it's not a perfect system.

422
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,410
You know, we get hundreds of complaints every month.

423
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,180
It takes time to sort this stuff out.

424
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,700
But I do understand how that level of frustration

425
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,340
could lead to a confrontation.

426
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,740
What are you saying?

427
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,180
I'm saying maybe you confronted Blaine.

428
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,290
You wanted to get some things off your chest.

429
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,320
Maybe he didn't like what you had to say so he got aggressive.

430
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,120
Maybe he reached for his gun.

431
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,050
You just did what you had to do because you were afraid

432
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,070
he might cause you serious bodily harm.

433
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,420
That would be self-defense.

434
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,090
You wouldn't be responsible for his death.

435
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,030
Nice try.

436
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,150
- But that's not what happened. - Zach...

437
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,430
Right now, you're our only suspect.

438
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,880
This would be your opportunity to prove us wrong.

439
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,910
I did not kill Officer Blaine.

440
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,960
I'll take a polygraph.

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,220
Swear on a Bible, my mother's grave.

442
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,930
You name it, I'll do it.

443
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,880
Was Blaine with this woman the night of the murder?

444
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,540
I'm not doing this. Sorry.

445
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,550
If you're not the guy that killed him,

446
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,240
why not help us find the person that did?

447
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,850
Because I'm not a hypocrite.

448
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,150
What the hell are you talking about?

449
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,090
I don't like the police. Never have.

450
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,390
And that was before Officer Blaine attacked me,

451
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,730
wrongfully imprisoned me,

452
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,310
and none of you did anything about it.

453
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,600
He thought that you threw a rock at him.

454
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,310
- But I didn't! - Okay, so he made a mistake.

455
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,890
Just like every other human being on this planet.

456
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,990
So can we rise above this petty anger?

457
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,210
- Maybe see the bigger picture? - Why would I want to do that?

458
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,970
'cause that's what good people do.

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,780
They realize that people are flawed.

460
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,710
They do stupid things, sometimes.

461
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,360
What he did to me was not just stupid.

462
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,010
It was an abuse of power

463
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,910
and a violation of my civil rights.

464
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,590
This guy is unbelievable.

465
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,670
What?

466
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
Your speech.

467
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,830
"Good people know that people are flawed,

468
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,740
that they do stupid things sometimes"?

469
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,370
Hailey, I wasn't talking about you.

470
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,710
I was talking about Zach.

471
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,500
I know who your father is and that he was abusive.

472
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,980
You don't know the half of it.

473
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,290
No, you're right, I don't. I'm sorry.

474
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,190
You know I'm on your side.

475
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,360
- I'm just trying to help. - I don't want your help.

476
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Not with this.

477
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,770
How'd it go with Zach?

478
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,210
He's not talking.

479
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,760
All right, take him home.

480
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,860
All right, Zach.

481
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,960
You're officially released from police custody.

482
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,740
Don't leave town.

483
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,210
We're probably gonna have some follow-up questions.

484
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,200
I told you, I'm not cooperating.

485
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,730
Yeah, you made that very clear.

486
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,970
Hey, there he is.

487
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,680
Zach, Zach--were you questioned about the murder

488
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,910
of Officer Mike Blaine?

489
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,540
Have you been charged with a crime?

490
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,630
Oh, that's Platt.

491
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,450
A witness just called in, saw a car pull into an alley

492
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,570
two blocks from the crime scene.

493
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,380
Driver ran in, and then, 30 seconds later, ran out.

494
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
Witness'll meet us there.

495
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,830
Two blocks? If we're lucky, that's our offender dumping a gun.

496
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,430
Yeah, makes sense to me. Let's go.

497
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,030
- Anything? - No gun.

498
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,880
But it's disgusting.

499
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,040
It's almost been an hour.

500
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,580
Is this witness ever gonna show up?

501
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,810
I don't know. Maybe he got nervous.

502
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,860
Or maybe someone told him there's a new law

503
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,420
that prohibits good people from cooperating with the police.

504
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,760
Yeah, God forbid.

505
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,860
Used to be, a cop got shot,

506
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,610
people'd come outta the woodwork to help.

507
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,420
Gun!

508
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,740
Ballistics confirmed the gun is the same gun

509
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,370
used to murder Officer Blaine.

510
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,860
They weren't able to pull any prints,

511
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,410
but they did trace the weapon to a...Maria Guerra.

512
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,190
Female Hispanic, 25, no priors.

513
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,690
She got any connection to Zach Phillips?

514
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,500
No, none that I could find, anyway.

515
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,320
I also tracked down that no-show witness.

516
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,700
He's letting CPIC in now to look at the security footage.

517
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,390
- Yo, Sarge. - Yeah?

518
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,520
Maria's the woman in the photo with Blaine.

519
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,130
- You got an address on her? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,770
A two-flight in Pilsen, moved out two months ago.

521
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,220
Looks like she's been off the radar ever since.

522
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,810
Let's track her down.

523
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,740
Cell phone GPS puts Maria on this block.

524
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,830
All right, well, we find her car, find where she's hiding.

525
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
Here.

526
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,370
Blue Dodge.

527
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,260
Plate matches.

528
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay, I'm gonna hold down the front

529
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,350
just in case this ain't it.

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,290
Yo, Sarge, if you got ears,

531
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,900
we got eyes on Maria's car.

532
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,160
Copy that. Keep me posted.

533
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,190
Chicago PD! Open up!

534
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,980
What's going on? How can I help you?

535
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,780
We're looking for Maria Guerra.

536
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,940
- She's--she's not here. - You sure about that?

537
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,630
We're investigating the murder of a Chicago police officer.

538
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,080
You wanna get wrapped up in this?

539
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,710
Ruz!

540
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,500
Get back. Step back.

541
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,370
Maria?

542
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,370
Maria, come on. Easy.

543
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,000
Put that down. Chicago PD.

544
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,850
- Why are you here? - To talk.

545
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,510
But not if you got that knife in your hand.

546
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,140
- You gotta put that down. - No.

547
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,640
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Okay?

548
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,010
Put the knife down.

549
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,120
Maria, put it down. You wanna drop that.

550
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,630
So put the knife down.

551
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,090
All right?

552
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,160
There you go.

553
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,280
There you go.

554
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,450
Thank you.

555
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,490
What? What are you doing?

556
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,670
Your gun was used to kill Officer Mike Blaine.

557
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,870
We just gotta take you to the station--

558
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,610
You think--no, I'd never hurt Mike!

559
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,390
- Why's that? - Because he saved my life.

560
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,770
I told you, I didn't kill Mike.

561
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,440
I get it, you liked him; he saved your life.

562
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,890
The problem is, Maria...

563
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,550
the murder weapon is registered in your name.

564
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,910
I know.

565
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,130
But that's because...

566
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,570
That's because of what?

567
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,270
If I tell you,

568
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,620
you need to protect me and my family.

569
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,990
Protect you from who?

570
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,130
My ex-boyfriend.

571
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,890
Who's your ex-boyfriend?

572
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,400
His name is Jose Torres.

573
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,220
He took my gun,

574
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,710
and used it to kill Mike.

575
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,540
Okay, why do you think Jose killed Mike?

576
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,610
Because Mike was trying to help me.

577
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,490
I broke up with Jose about a month ago,

578
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,530
but he was angry.

579
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,040
He kept showing up at my house, wanting to have sex.

580
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,530
When I say no, he gets violent.

581
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,530
So I finally called 911.

582
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,570
- And that's when you met Mike? - Yeah.

583
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,720
Mike came to my house, he talked to Jose...

584
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,850
He had a bat in his hands, but Mike talked him down.

585
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,800
- Mike arrest Jose? - No.

586
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,010
He put him in handcuffs, but...

587
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,040
I didn't want to press charges.

588
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,540
I pleaded with Mike not to arrest him.

589
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,700
I still don't understand why you think Jose did the murder.

590
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,020
A few days ago... Jose found me at my cousin's.

591
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,570
I told him to get out, but he went crazy,

592
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,570
started punching walls and breaking dishes.

593
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,170
I was terrified, so I pulled out my gun.

594
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,710
I told him to leave, but he took it out of my hands,

595
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,310
started hitting me. So I called Mike.

596
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,150
Is that the last time you saw him?

597
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,460
Yeah.

598
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,050
He showed up with some money, three grand,

599
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,870
told me to stay in a hotel for a few weeks.

600
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,410
He said he was gonna talk to Jose,

601
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,510
tell him to leave me alone.

602
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,210
Why didn't you come to the police?

603
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,790
I was scared.

604
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,290
Jose said that if I ever talked to the police about him,

605
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,380
that he was gonna kill my daughter.

606
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,990
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

607
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,130
That's not on you.

608
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,020
It's on Jose.

609
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,240
- Jose Torres. - Maria's story checks out?

610
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,980
It seems legit.

611
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,890
The 911 tape confirms her call from last month,

612
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,610
and a neighbor said he's heard lots of fights over the years.

613
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,000
All right, Torres got a sheet?

614
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,220
Yeah, he's got two DUIs

615
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,420
and an assault with a deadly weapon.

616
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,620
It was a bar fight that got out of hand.

617
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,310
Okay, what about the night of the murder?

618
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,090
So the best lead that we have right now is

619
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,500
a hit on Torres's credit card.

620
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,670
He was at a bar two blocks away from the murder.

621
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,950
He paid his tab at 10:45.

622
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,800
He must've met up with Blaine right after that.

623
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,700
I mean, we could put Maria in play.

624
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,270
Wire her up, get her talking to Torres--

625
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,370
No, that's too dangerous.

626
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,890
Can't put Maria and Torres in the same room.

627
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,030
I agree.

628
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,370
All right, we gotta find another way to nail this prick.

629
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,900
What about Zach Phillips?

630
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,320
He was there the night of the murder.

631
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,510
- Maybe he saw Torres. - Yeah, she's right.

632
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,110
Give it a shot. Let's go.

633
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,520
That's him pulling up.

634
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,040
Zach, we need to talk to you one more time.

635
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,030
I'm not talking to you.

636
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,150
Look, we know you didn't kill Mike Blaine.

637
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,230
We just want you to look at some photos, okay?

638
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,340
Did you see any of these men

639
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,740
the night you were following him?

640
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,220
I told you, I'm not getting involved.

641
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,100
Get down!

642
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,130
5021 Georgia, got shots fired at the police.

643
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,790
It's a black Audi traveling westbound on 19th street.

644
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,140
- Hailey, you good? - Yeah.

645
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,550
- Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, he missed.

646
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,650
- You okay? - Thank you.

647
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,850
You saved my life. Thank you.

648
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,810
Can we get you something to drink?

649
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,960
- Coffee, water? - No, thanks.

650
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
I'd offer you food, but we don't have much.

651
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,250
Maybe the odd candy bar--

652
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm not hungry, but thank you.

653
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,150
Okay.

654
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,840
Well, now that you've had some time to calm down--

655
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,340
I refuse to answer.

656
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,230
Okay.

657
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,380
Zach, we believe the offender saw you on the news,

658
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,090
talking to reporters, so he knows you were there,

659
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,120
that you saw him arguing with Blaine,

660
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,200
maybe even shooting him.

661
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,420
Okay, that makes you a witness. It also makes you a target.

662
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,050
He's not gonna stop coming after you.

663
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,390
That's my problem.

664
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,760
I'll move out of state

665
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,140
until all this nonsense blows over.

666
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,390
It's not nonsense, and it's not gonna blow over,

667
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,920
not without your help.

668
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,800
Zach, she just saved your life.

669
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,100
Without this woman, without this evil cop right here...

670
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,390
you'd be dead.

671
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,630
You get that, right?

672
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,790
I do, and I'm very appreciative.

673
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,560
- But that doesn't change-- - Yes, it does!

674
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,660
It does.

675
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,150
You need to quit hating.

676
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,840
And if not for yourself, then do it for Blaine's family,

677
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,930
- and help them get justice. - Justice?

678
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,080
W-we don't know what he was doing with this guy.

679
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,380
He could've been dealing drugs--

680
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,820
We do know what he was doing!

681
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,870
He was trying to save a young woman's life,

682
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,610
to stop this guy from continuing to abuse her.

683
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,280
That's what he was doing there.

684
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
That very well may be true, but--

685
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,070
No, it is true! That's a fact!

686
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,870
And what he did to me is a fact.

687
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,780
And if I choose to hate him for that, that's up to me,

688
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,140
not you.

689
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,460
Zach, let it go. Just let it go.

690
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,000
Accept the fact that he made a mistake.

691
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,850
No, that was not a mistake. That's who he was.

692
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,510
I could see it in his eyes.

693
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,990
He was a mean, violent man.

694
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,640
What he did was unforgivable.

695
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,990
Okay, that's it.

696
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,250
Sarge. Patrol found the stolen Audi.

697
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,240
- Yeah? - Yeah.

698
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
There's blood in it. It's a match for Torres.

699
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,250
He got caught in the crossfire?

700
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,340
It would make sense, I mean,

701
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,760
Jay said he got off five or six rounds.

702
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,410
Good. That puts him at the scene.

703
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,440
We know where this guy is?

704
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,490
He's on the run right now.

705
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,540
All right, get a BOLO out on him and his vehicle--

706
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,640
Already done. It's a gold Dodge pickup.

707
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,380
- 'Kay. - We'll follow up.

708
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,940
All right, this is the spot.

709
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah, patrol got it right. That's Torres's truck.

710
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,110
Gold Dodge Ram.

711
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,120
Sarge, you got your ears on?

712
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,830
Yeah, Hailey, go with your traffic.

713
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,770
Torres is here; he's parked in a lot off Whipple and 26th.

714
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,330
Right by the hot dog spot.

715
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,050
All right, keep eyes and an anchor down.

716
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,510
Everybody on the air, start heading that way.

717
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,570
That's him.

718
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,520
Sarge, Torres just stepped out.

719
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,100
Take him.

720
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,820
- I'll block the entrance. - Wait for my signal.

721
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,480
- I'm gonna cover the other side. - All right.

722
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,280
Listen, I gotta go.

723
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,920
Damn it.

724
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,630
Jay, I gotta move!

725
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,200
Chicago PD, get your hands up!

726
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,220
Hands up! Hey--

727
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,660
I'll shoot her.

728
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,480
Just take it easy, man. No one's gotta get hurt.

729
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,140
- Just let her go. - I'll shoot her.

730
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,680
- Let me go, please! - Take it easy, take it easy!

731
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,900
Put the gun down. Just let her go!

732
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,020
Get back in your car and out of my way...

733
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,420
- No! - Or I'll kill her!

734
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,910
Get back in your car!

735
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,740
- Drop the gun! - I said get back in your car!

736
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,580
- Torres-- - Or I'll shoot her!

737
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,730
Get back!

738
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,850
- Ma'am, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

739
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,000
Jose Torres, you're under arrest for the attempted murder

740
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,110
of Zach Phillips,

741
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,720
and for the murder

742
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,990
of Chicago Police Officer Mike Blaine.

743
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,570
I got some really good news for you.

744
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,780
Yeah, I'll take it.

745
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,460
We got a hit off a security cam near

746
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,740
- where Torres dumped the gun. - Okay.

747
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,890
That's Torres right there, holding the murder weapon

748
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,690
two blocks away from the crime scene

749
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,470
three minutes after the shooting.

750
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,690
That should seal it.

751
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,750
Best movie I've seen in a while.

752
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,620
All right, I'll talk to state's attorney's office,

753
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,200
get the paperwork going. Nice work.

754
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,470
Um, boss, about the file.

755
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
You remember we left some stuff out?

756
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,600
I want everything you got, good and bad.

757
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,900
- I'll take it from there. - All right.

758
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,620
You've been saying you wanted transparency.

759
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,320
Well, this is me being transparent.

760
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,540
That's--that's everything I got.

761
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,330
You loop in the state's attorney's office?

762
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,140
Writing up charges as we speak, first degree murder.

763
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,710
The only thing left to talk about

764
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,640
is the legacy of Mike Blaine.

765
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,270
Yeah, well, it doesn't look good.

766
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,750
I guess that depends on your point of view.

767
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,940
Excuse me?

768
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,630
Sam, everything he did,

769
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,340
he did to help protect a victim of domestic abuse.

770
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,120
He borrowed $3,000 from a convicted felon,

771
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,360
failed to report the domestic abuse incident,

772
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,670
and violated countless rules and regulations.

773
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,710
Okay?

774
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,490
What's your point?

775
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,440
- Blaine was far from perfect. - You're right.

776
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,200
But he was a good man.

777
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,030
He died trying to protect

778
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,540
a scared, vulnerable young mother.

779
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,430
And how he did it?

780
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,650
I mean, what rules he chose to ignore?

781
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,060
Who cares?

782
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,710
He was trying to do something good.

783
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,060
That's what matters.

784
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,860
You know, there was a time we actually forgave people

785
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,140
for their mistakes.

786
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,620
We understood that human beings are fallible.

787
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,680
So you look at the sum of the parts.

788
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,220
Does the good outweigh the bad?

789
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,780
I mean, Mike Blaine--

790
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:40,050
he gave his life doing something good...

791
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,470
brave...

792
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,050
Noble.

793
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,070
And that makes him a hero.

794
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,660
I don't have to hide anymore?

795
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,900
He's actually in jail?

796
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,280
Yeah, and he will be for a long time.

797
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,860
You just have to testify.

798
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,550
Tell the jury that he took your gun.

799
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,450
Yes, I will.

800
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,350
What he did to me... I can't forget, but...

801
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,450
knowing that he's out of my life forever--

802
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,920
that's good enough.

803
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,230
Gives me what I need to move on.

804
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,640
If you ever need anything...

805
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,170
Come on.

807
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
All good?

808
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,860
Yeah, they moved my dad's surgery to tonight.

809
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,290
I'm not gonna tell you what to do--

810
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,750
I'm going to the hospital right now.

811
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,730
I'll see you later?

812
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,800
Today, we apprehended the man we believe murdered

813
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,630
Officer Michael R. Blaine, a 22-year veteran

814
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,750
of the Chicago Police Department.

815
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,730
Officer Blaine died the same way he lived his life:

816
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,140
trying to do what was right,

817
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,000
trying to serve this city with dignity.

818
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,930
And like most of us,

819
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,980
Officer Blaine was not perfect.

820
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,560
But when you look at the sum of the parts...

821
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,760
at the man in full,

822
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,320
it's clear that the good offset the bad,

823
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,100
that he was a brave and decent police officer

824
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,990
who died on the job trying to save

825
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,550
a young woman, who was tragically stuck

826
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,870
in a violent and abusive relationship.

827
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,990
To me, that makes Mike Blaine a hero.

828
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,010
He represented the best

829
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,040
of what the Chicago Police Department is all about.

830
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,250
That being said, it's important to acknowledge

831
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,140
that we don't always get it right.

832
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,780
The Chicago Police Department is not flawless.

833
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,420
We've made some mistakes.

834
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,980
We've committed certain unforgivable acts.

835
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,590
But those misdeeds, no matter how egregious,

836
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,180
should not define us,

837
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,510
but rather motivate us to do better,

838
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,310
to be more complete and compassionate

839
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,840
human beings and police officers.

840
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,960
- Beer? - Yeah, sure.

841
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,380
So how'd it go?

842
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,200
Good.

843
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,010
Glad I talked to him.
