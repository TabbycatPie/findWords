20
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,880
This is Andrews' fault.

21
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,400
Agreed.

22
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,060
The bourbon may also bear some responsibility.

23
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,320
Agreed.

24
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,240
You said "Fault."

25
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,780
You don't regret that we --

26
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,700
No, not at all.

27
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,790
Seriously.

28
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,720
It was...

29
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,530
pretty great.

30
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,340
Yeah.

31
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,380
And definitely shouldn't happen again.

32
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,170
No, it shouldn't.

33
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,690
It'd make things too complicated at work.

34
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
Let's chalk it up to, uh,

35
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,000
"Andrews screwed us, so we screwed each other" impulse.

36
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,170
I gotta get going.

37
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,430
I'm covering the E.R. today.

38
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,380
Ooh, right before Christmas?

39
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,680
Gonna be a madhouse.

40
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,240
Yeah.

41
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,000
{\an1}BGM: Jingle Bells by Frank Sinatra

"Jingle Bells"?

52
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,520
Two ambulances coming in, back-to-back.

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
I need you on your game today, Murphy.

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay.

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
Male, mid-30s,

56
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,390
found unresponsive in Arrivals.

57
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,960
Restarted his heart on site. Low O2,

58
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,810
wheezing, significant airway resistance to the bag mask --

59
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,040
We need more hands on deck -- STAT --

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,010
I've been calling -- everyone's left town for the holidays.

61
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,120
Reznick's around.

62
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Weird you know that, but glad you do.

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
- Get Reznick in here. - On it.

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,220
Take him to Bay 4. Murphy, I need you with me.

65
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,980
What do we got?

66
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,530
This is Marianne Southam -- she collapsed in Baggage Claim --

67
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,990
Both patients came from the airport?

68
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,540
It's that time of year. Everyone's traveling.

69
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,280
Right leg is red and swollen.

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,250
She's complaining of chest pains, shortness of breath,

71
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,380
and she has a low-grade fever.

72
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,290
Did you just get off a long flight?

73
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,550
20 hours, from Malaysia.

74
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,390
Deep vein thrombosis formed while she was seated --

75
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,110
that explains the red leg and the fever.

76
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,200
Part of the clot broke off, travelled to her lung.

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,980
That explains the chest pain -- pulmonary embolism.

78
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,610
We lost his pulse again!

79
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,850
Take Marianne to Bay 5.

80
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,630
I'll talk you through managing a pulmonary embolism.

81
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,390
I'm gonna light him up.

82
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,550
Clear.

83
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,670
- Got a rhythm. - Barely.

84
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,890
He can't live on 30 beats a minute.

85
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,580
His lungs are too stiff to pre-oxygenate.

86
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,120
Fiberoptic blade and a 7.5 ET tube.

87
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,550
Murphy, anti-coagulate her with a 5,000 unit heparin bolus.

88
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,910
Set the ventilator to assist control.

89
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,440
- Heparin bolus infused. - His fever is spiking at 103.5.

90
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,280
Could be ARDS from a viral pneumonia.

91
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,710
Get a chest X-ray.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Lost him again.

93
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,210
O2 SAT is 92.

94
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,340
Your chest pain should be getting better.

95
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,380
It is. Thank you.

96
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,170
Peak airway pressure's 50.

97
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,520
Switch the ventilator to PRVC.

98
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,770
Pushing I.V. epinephrine. Now you need to insert a central line

99
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,590
in case we go to thrombolysis.

104
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,260
I need you, Murphy.

106
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Still V. fib.

107
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,310
Push 300 of amiodarone.

108
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,650
Asystole. He's still not responding.

109
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,150
That's over 30 minutes of brain and cardiac hypoxia.

110
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,430
Stop compressions.

111
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,930
Time of death -- 10:07.

112
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,970
Have you had contact with this man?

113
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,760
He was on my flight from Malaysia.

114
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,820
They both have vesicular rashes on their necks.

115
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,720
Whatever infection killed him, she may have it, too.

116
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,490
This is a negative pressure room,

117
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,110
designed so no air flows out --

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
keeps germs from spreading.

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,740
Because whatever I have is gonna kill me,

120
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,060
just like the man from the plane.

121
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,700
Your symptoms are not as severe as his.

122
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,470
Although, yours will probably get worse

123
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,110
as the virus progresses.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,470
We don't know for sure whether you have the same thing.

125
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,660
We know nothing about him, his condition, or his history.

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,780
When did you start feeling sick?

127
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,000
On the plane.

128
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,490
I've never even been outside the U.S. before.

129
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,300
My ex-husband hated to travel and --

130
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,710
Was the man who died sitting near you?

131
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,580
No, he was six or seven rows in front of me.

132
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,340
Were you ever physically close to him?

133
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,220
Say, waiting for the restroom or in line to board?

134
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,080
No, I think he slept almost the entire flight.

135
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,030
That suggests the virus can be transmitted in the air.

136
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,020
Which means everyone in the plane

137
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,380
and this emergency room

138
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,760
has been exposed.

139
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,520
We'll start conditioning tomorrow --

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,260
that's when we use chemo and total body irradiation to --

141
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,190
To wipe out my crappy leukemia-producing bone marrow

142
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,770
- so you can replace it with some good stuff. - Well said.

143
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,270
Looks like your dad is good to go on his marrow donation.

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,210
Please don't call him that.

145
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,450
Bob Cravens walked out on me and my mom when I was four.

146
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,940
His biological material gave me life,

147
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,440
and apparently he's gonna save me,

148
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,780
but he's not my dad.

149
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,740
Any unusual complaints or pain we should know about?

150
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,010
I've been tired.

151
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,770
And the last day, achy,

152
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,580
kind of stiff... standard leukemia woes.

153
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,350
Anywhere in particular?

154
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,180
My neck, left arm.

155
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,670
All right, Chris, you're having a heart attack.

156
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,440
N-no. My chest feels fine.

157
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,540
We need to get you up to radiation right away.

158
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,100
Call and let them know we're coming.

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,500
Get his donor in here.

160
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,590
How is radiation gonna help a heart attack?

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,540
Your blockage is most likely excess blast white cells.

162
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,560
The best way to clear out your heart is to treat your leukemia.

163
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,270
It's what we planned -- just a day early.

164
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,290
Might not be airborne.

165
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,220
Maybe both passengers were already infected

166
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,340
when they got on the plane.

167
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,440
Marianne said she felt fine before the flight.

168
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,010
But even if she did contract it on the plane,

169
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,480
it could've been through a shared water cup or napkin...

170
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,510
Which would make a quarantine unnecessary.

171
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,700
I'll call the Public Health Department,

172
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,590
the CDC --

173
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,930
they may want to track the passengers

174
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,840
and anyone they came into contact with.

175
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,410
- Keep me up to date. - Okay.

176
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,870
Hey. I'm done.

177
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Jill, are you still on?

178
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,630
Get me the CDC and a change of clothes.

179
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,830
I'm coming in.

180
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,060
Thanks for getting me called in, Tyler.

181
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,380
- You're welcome. - That was sarcasm.

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,450
Oh, was it? If this turns into a crisis,

183
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,880
where else would you want to be?

184
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,800
I hear you're having some stomach pain?

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
It hurts a lot.

186
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,860
I figured it was probably the candy canes,

187
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,230
but I took some Pepto.

188
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,120
Didn't help at all.

189
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
How many candy canes we talking?

190
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,660
Three or four dozen.

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,930
Of the littles ones.

192
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,430
They pass them out at the mall where I work.

193
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,510
I like to munch on them. Keeps me in character.

194
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,230
Sounds like you might be overdoing it.

195
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,310
Take off your shirt.

196
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,470
How did you know I was still in town?

197
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,230
Because the holidays are "An obligatory performance

198
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,780
where families buy each other gifts

199
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,090
and pretend everything is perfect."

200
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,110
Which is why you tell yours you have to work every year

201
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,260
even when you don't.

202
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,130
He's a good listener.

203
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,590
What's that scar from?

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,950
Rudolph is an ass.

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,750
It's a minor bowel resection

206
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,980
for diverticulitis eight months ago.

207
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,830
Oh, we need to do a contrast CT.

208
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,350
You need to come with me.

209
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,710
Dr. Lim, he has it, too.

210
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,310
There, on his neck. A rash.

211
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,630
It wasn't there earlier.

212
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,880
It hasn't fully developed, but it could be the same thing.

213
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
It can't be. I had on a mask, gloves...

214
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,060
Did you keep on the mask the whole time?

215
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,720
Not --

216
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,840
With airborne diseases, that's import--

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
It's Marianne.

218
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,280
Her O2 SATs are crashing.

219
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
Get another dose of I.V. Methylprednisolone.

220
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,390
We need to move up the transplant.

221
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,320
No, it doesn't change anything,

222
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,830
you'll be anesthetized, you won't feel a thing,

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,550
and when you wake up,

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,850
your son will be on his way to being healthy.

225
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,570
We'll see you soon.

227
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,950
Sorry I couldn't meet you at the airport.

228
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,000
That's a cool T-shirt.

229
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,380
It probably freaks you out, right?

230
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,530
Like, "Is he gonna - gender-transition or something?"

231
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,980
No, if that's your thing, I'm cool.

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,220
How long am I stuck here?

233
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,770
Just for the rest of this shift.

234
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,370
And then I'm out of here for three days.

235
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,400
There's a new rock-climbing gym we can check out...

236
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,900
and the batting cages.

237
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm good.

238
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,980
I got a season of "Rick and Morty" on my phone.

239
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,250
Clear.

240
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,700
That's six rounds of defib.

241
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,990
And 30 minutes of CPR.

242
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,030
Okay, Dr. Murphy, you can stop.

243
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,810
I just spoke with Dr. Andrews.

244
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,110
We're on soft quarantine

245
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,630
while he consults the Board.

246
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,480
Call dispatch --

247
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,190
put all ambulances on diversion.

248
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,240
Do your best to stop all walk-ins.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,680
Say we're at capacity and send them to County.

250
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,130
Stall all discharges.

251
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,740
Tyler stays in isolation and on antivirals.

252
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,680
Fever is likely the next stage, so keep a close eye.

253
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,770
What else are we dealing with?

254
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,260
I always have lunch by 2:00.

255
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,650
It's 15.

256
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,380
I need to eat.

257
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,310
I got a banana in my bag if you want it.

258
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,830
A banana isn't lunch.

259
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,880
A turkey sandwich and milk is lunch.

260
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,620
Dr. Murphy, patients first,

261
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,350
then we'll work on that sandwich.

262
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,300
- What else? - 60-year-old woman with angina

263
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,350
visiting her family for the holidays

264
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,760
forgot her blood pressure meds.

265
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,900
Came in for a prescription.

266
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,530
Her refill just got delayed.

267
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,400
- What else? - The crib was almost finished

268
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,890
when the screwdriver slipped.

269
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,050
My family doctor is closed for the holidays.

270
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,790
They would've sent you here anyway.

271
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,220
This type of injury can cause permanent damage.

272
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,490
Makes me feel less guilty for bringing my baby into a germ pit.

273
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,820
No offense.

274
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,680
Guessing this is your first?

275
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,650
My husband and I waited a long time.

276
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,650
I want everything to be perfect.

277
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,650
Which, as my husband reminds me, is impossible.

278
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,920
Yet, my birth plan is five pages long.

279
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,900
All closed up.

280
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,760
So I can go home?

281
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,910
Not before we do a nerve study.

282
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,280
I would hate for you to lose feeling in your fingers.

283
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
You can't leave.

284
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,790
I'm sorry. What?

285
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,720
Hospital policy.

286
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,590
Look, I'm -- I'm not a patient.

287
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,710
All right, I just came down here to get some chips.

288
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,470
- My dad's a doctor. - Who's your dad?

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,750
Dr. Alex Park.

290
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,220
Can you call him?

291
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,380
My phone's charging upstairs.

292
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll call him so he knows where to come find you when he's free.

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,660
But for now, you've got to stay put.

294
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,020
- Why? - Because I'm older than you.

295
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,650
Find the employee contact list, call Park.

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,830
- He should know where his son is. - Sure.

297
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,370
I feel so much worse than when I was having a heart attack.

298
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,830
I don't doubt it.

299
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,000
Because of the urgency of your situation,

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,660
we used combined leukapheresis,

301
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,790
chemo, and radiation.

302
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,690
You're no longer at risk for another heart attack or stroke.

303
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,440
And I also no longer have an immune system.

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,270
- My donor's on his way, right? - I spoke with him.

305
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,840
He said he was getting in his car.

306
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,380
When was that?

307
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll follow up.

308
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,320
He's still finding new ways to let me down.

309
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,890
I thought you guys were gonna do a C.T.

310
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,050
We're doing a KUB X-ray instead.

311
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,550
It's almost as good.

312
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,860
Why would you go with "Almost"?

313
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,390
Can you hear that?

314
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,050
Hear what?

315
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,040
Excuse me.

316
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm looking for a patient.

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,290
You'll need to speak with a nurse.

318
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,730
I've been waiting to speak to a nurse.

319
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,160
You must hear that. The light is buzzing.

320
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,790
I don't hear anything.

321
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,350
It's loud and very distracting.

322
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,050
It needs to be fixed.

323
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,250
You like Italian?

324
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,490
La Nostra?

325
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,540
It's great.

326
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,020
Barbecue? Ethiopian?

327
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you talking about?

328
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,130
Where we're going on our date.

329
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,470
You haven't asked me on one, and I haven't said yes.

330
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,750
Who turns down the request of a man trapped in isolation?

331
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,670
What about sushi? Everybody likes it.

332
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,020
Also, I'm pretty good with chopsticks.

333
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,330
Never hurts to display a little manual dexterity.

334
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,930
You know, tends to impress.

335
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,430
I will want a cocktail to soothe my nerves, but --

336
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,130
Why would you be nervous?

337
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,530
Have you seen you?

338
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,170
You are smart as well as beautiful,

339
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,930
and I will need all the tools in my toolkit

340
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,470
to dazzle you, so...

341
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,370
No drink for me.

342
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,540
Have one after the appetizers.

343
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,020
I'll be impressed by then.

344
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,750
You have a fever.

345
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,970
He has a fever,

346
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,880
and the rash is fully materialized.

347
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,620
Okay.

348
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,980
Here we go.

349
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,220
Quarantine has been approved.

350
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,880
Yeah.

351
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,270
Can I have everyone's attention?

352
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,580
This emergency room and everyone in it is now under quarantine.

353
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,060
We're hoping none of you have been exposed,

354
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,110
but a serious respiratory virus has infected three patients.

355
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,180
What? This can't happen.

356
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,340
We're starting everyone

357
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,110
on antivirals just as a precaution.

358
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,280
We'll also be bringing in food and water,

359
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,630
so if any of you have any dietary restrictions,

360
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,650
please let us know now.

361
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,710
- You can't make us stay here. - That's right.

362
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,570
I-I can't -- especially not if someone's seriously ill!

363
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,090
We are legally entitled to keep you --

364
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,260
They locked us in.

365
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,590
- Are we locked in? - Oh, no way.

366
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,610
- I gotta get out. - Sir.

367
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,690
Sorry.

368
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,640
Like it or not, no one's leaving.

371
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,190
The decision to implement the quarantine

373
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,310
was made after consultation with the Board.

374
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,590
The CDC has been kept fully informed,

375
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,450
and we will be proceeding in accordance with all protocol --

376
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,920
Shaun, Morgan, and Lim are in there.

377
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,420
And our patient is out here.

378
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,810
There's still no sign of the donor.

379
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,170
He's not answering my calls.

380
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,970
I asked my contact at San Jose PD

381
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,360
to do a home check-in.

382
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,240
Park.

383
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,990
He's down there?

384
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,450
How -- Yeah, put him on.

385
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,910
It's Security -- Kellan's stuck in the quarantine.

386
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,110
I'll pass along anything I hear from San Jose PD.

387
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,440
Tyler started coughing.

388
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,840
Let's up his antivirals.

389
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
Start high flow oxygen and zosyn

390
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,060
to counter any underlying infection.

391
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,630
Santa Pete has a sigmoid volvulus.

392
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,140
He needs surgery very soon.

393
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,420
My call ended 37 minutes ago.

394
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm supposed to be somewhere else.

395
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,270
- It's important. - No, it's not.

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,420
We need a non-surgical fix to a bowel obstruction.

397
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,380
Anyone?

398
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,340
Murphy.

399
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,750
You got something?

400
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,260
Not really.

401
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,960
Anything at all? Please.

402
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,800
We -- we usually -- we --

403
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,440
We usually make a hole

404
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,980
and -- and come at an obstruction from the side,

405
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,290
but we can't.

406
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,030
We need to use the existing holes.

407
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,730
An endoscope risks tearing right through the bowel.

408
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
A saline enema doesn't...

409
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,890
and it might untwist the bowel.

410
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,720
Simple, but it could work.

411
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,010
Nice.

412
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm fine.

413
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,680
- Do you have your inhaler? - Of course I do.

414
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,820
What were you doing down here?

415
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,960
This isn't my fault.

416
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,360
If you hadn't been working --

417
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,280
Kellan.

418
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,190
I know you must be scared.

419
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,040
I'm fine.

420
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,550
I'm keeping this hat on for luck.

421
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,770
Here we go.

422
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,730
I'm threading the tube into the rectum.

423
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,380
Now, slowly push the saline.

424
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,280
That's --

425
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,010
It's not a pleasant experience.

426
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,490
I'm getting some resistance to flow.

427
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,140
I must've reached the obstruction.

428
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,720
Push harder. Hang in there, Pete.

429
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,200
Call me Santa -- Aah!

430
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,560
Keep pushing the saline.

431
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,250
Okay, I'm sorry, Santa.

432
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
I feel so much better.

433
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,560
We've got you on a pretty high dose of antivirals.

434
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,060
So, what's next?

435
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,420
We're debating nitric oxide --

436
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,700
No, I mean if this doesn't turn around.

437
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,440
What happens to me next?

438
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,690
ARDS.

439
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,440
Then full respiratory failure.

440
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,660
Hey, I've got a new idea for our first date.

441
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,800
Archery.

442
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,120
I used to compete when I was young.

443
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,500
Basically, you'd be showing off.

444
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,940
I can show you some tricks.

445
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,220
Teach you a split-finger hook, how to anchor...

446
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,300
and then proceed to demolish you.

447
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,300
That sounds like a reason to live.

448
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,390
I'm here to take you to your imaging appointment.

449
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,250
Where's Shaun?

450
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,430
Shaun is quarantined in the E.R.

451
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,980
Quarantined? What -- what -- what quarantine?

452
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,760
Apparently for some highly contagious, deadly virus.

453
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,630
But Shaun sounds fine.

454
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,860
Except for some buzzing light

455
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,280
and his concern about lunch

456
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,560
and you missing your appointment at the imaging clinic, so...

457
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,270
- Let's go. - Take me to the hospital.

458
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,700
We are going to your appointment and making sure

459
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,750
your think-melon remains tumor-free.

460
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,580
Take me to the hospital please.

461
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,360
- I'd like to help. - How?

462
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,290
By taking your old job back and saving the day?

463
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,110
Putting on an "Outbreak" suit and rescuing Shaun?

464
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,640
Some people may find your sassy attitude appealing.

465
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,870
I'm not one of them.

466
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
And I am crushed.

467
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,900
Sir, I'm sorry. You can't --

468
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,780
I-I-I ne-- My wife's in there.

469
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,910
Viola! Look, that's her. I need to get in there.

470
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,450
They're setting up a room inside for friends and family.

471
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,040
Clifton, what are you doing?

472
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,020
Look, I'm coming in. Stop.

473
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,710
- Let go of me! - Calm down - or you're gonna get hurt.

474
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,710
- Stop. - This is all my fault.

475
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,590
- No. - If I'd put the crib together like you asked --

476
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,240
Forget about the crib.

477
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,740
I need you to take care of yourself

478
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,490
because if something happens to me...

479
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,080
...our son needs someone to take care of him.

480
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,340
It's -- it's a boy?

481
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,470
I'm sorry I'm ruining your surprise.

482
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,180
No.

483
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,730
Baby, I love you so much.

484
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,100
I love you, too.

485
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,110
I love you.

486
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,280
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,860
Shaun?

488
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,660
Why are you answering our donor's phone?

489
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,620
Because he's here in quarantine.

490
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,070
What happened to the CDC getting a team here today?

491
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,130
They confirmed that it started in Malaysia last week.

492
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,800
Between the virologists already there

493
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,420
and the ones grounded on the East Coast

494
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,330
- because of the snowstorm -- -Stay on them.

495
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,120
What do we know about the virus?

496
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,060
Similar symptoms to SARS,

497
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,380
but much faster moving.

498
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,130
Is Bob Cravens infected?

499
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,480
Not so far.

500
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,970
Currently Tyler Durnes, the EMT,

501
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,470
is the only person displaying symptoms.

502
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,990
I need his bone marrow. I'd like to go in and get it.

503
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,110
I'll comply with all protocol.

504
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,220
You're not hot zone certified. None of us are.

505
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,230
My leukemia patient has no immune system.

506
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,250
He'll die soon without a marrow transplant.

507
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,080
Well, then you best find him another donor

508
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,870
because no one, or their bone marrow,

509
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,230
is leaving that quarantine.

510
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
Have you heard from County about taking our PICU transfers?

511
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,430
H-how are my O2 SATs?

512
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,560
Holding steady.

513
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Do you want to call anyone?

514
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,980
I, uh...

515
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,450
I th-- I thought about letting my mom know

516
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,780
what was going on, but...

517
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,330
she'd just worry about me and feel bad she's not here.

518
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,950
So...

519
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,290
Sh-she knows I love her.

520
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,860
How's it going in here?

521
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,240
Dr. Reznick was just telling me

522
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
about some college lesbian experiences...

523
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,930
Was that just my imagination?

524
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,890
Actually, we were talking about your mother.

525
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,230
Interesting.

526
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,190
I don't like the drop in his O2 SATs.

527
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,320
Let's start him on nitric oxide.

528
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,950
I knew you liked me.

529
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,590
He's in this hospital?

530
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,900
Bob actually came through for once.

531
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,800
Unfortunately, we can't wait for him to get out of quarantine.

532
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,570
But we found an alternative donor in the Bay Area.

533
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,100
How compatible are they?

534
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,230
They share five out of eight of your markers.

535
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,520
Bob is a much better match.

536
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,900
I can't handle marrow rejection,

537
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,320
or having to repeat this nightmare.

538
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,430
That's a symptom of the MAC pneumonia.

539
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,080
The antibiotics aren't working.

540
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,720
You need bone marrow,

541
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,500
or this infection is going to kill you soon

542
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,090
days, not weeks.

543
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,760
Seven years I've been battling leukemia.

544
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,100
Been through four full courses of chemo,

545
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,560
so many trips to the hospital I've lost count.

546
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,360
Just knowing my father showed up,

547
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,820
I'm grateful, relieved.

548
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm okay if this is the end.

549
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,580
I'd like to sign a DNR.

550
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,170
Chris, the CDC will be here tomorrow.

551
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,790
If they can identify the virus,

552
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,850
we can test Bob.

553
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,560
- If he's negative, - Whatever you can manage

554
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,800
before my heart stops, go for it.

555
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,720
Please get me the form.

556
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,490
His fever's climbing.

557
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,110
Give the nebulizer time to work.

558
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,120
Cooling blankets, that could help.

559
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,870
I'll go get some from the supply closet.

560
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,580
Put your mask back on.

561
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,960
Why?

562
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
Because I'm infected.

563
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,690
You got it, too?

564
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,900
You guys any closer to figuring this thing out?

565
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,110
Afraid not.

566
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,370
On the bright side,

567
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,080
I think I'm growing on Morgan.

568
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,680
There's got to be a way.

569
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,850
You can't go in.

570
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,650
Bob can't come out. The marrow can't come out.

571
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,400
What if it doesn't?

572
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,530
What if the marrow never leaves?

573
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,760
Are you suggesting we put a man with no immune system

574
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,720
- into the quarantine? - We expand the quarantine,

575
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,540
create a section just for him.

576
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,560
One of the doctors inside can do

577
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,100
the extraction and the transplant.

578
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,690
And then one of two things happens

579
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,630
he stays in isolation till we know he hasn't been infected.

580
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,550
Or it kills him.

581
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,760
There's no way Andrews will let us expand the quarantine.

582
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,850
Wish me luck.

583
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,940
Going to 360 Joules.

584
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:29,980
Clear.

585
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,790
We can crack his chest and do cardiac massage.

586
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,350
- Dr. Reznick. - Have Petringa bring in the internal paddles

587
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,710
- from the trauma bay... - Morgan.

588
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,280
Hey, Doogie.

589
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,360
You didn't hear me talking to you?

590
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,870
My sugar's crazy high, 650.

591
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,210
That doesn't make sense.

592
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,640
I gave you the proper dosage of insulin.

593
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,960
10 units.

594
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,440
10 units?

595
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,940
10 units doesn't even make a dent with me.

596
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,260
You got a doctor around here who knows what he's doing?

597
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,110
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

598
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,470
I'll give you another 10 units.

599
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,410
Waste of time. Make it 20.

600
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,890
I'll give you 10.

601
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,740
What's wrong with you? You sound like an idiot.

602
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
- Don't be a jerk. - Mind your own business.

603
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,020
Doc. Doc, I don't feel so

604
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,070
What the hell?!

605
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,780
Did he just infect me?

606
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,780
Possibly.

607
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,030
I need to examine your abdomen.

608
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,470
Your obstruction has returned.

609
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,540
You need surgery, now.

610
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,120
But we're stuck in here,

611
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,590
and there's no operating room.

612
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,630
We will have to improvise.

613
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,930
There's no Neptune machine

614
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,980
without suction, the surgical field will be filled with blood.

615
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,910
We can use the wall suction, set to continuous.

616
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,820
That'll do.

617
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,910
No electrocautery to control the bleeding.

618
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,200
You'll have to do this combat style.

619
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,580
Tie off each artery before you cut.

620
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,690
Dr. Reznick.

621
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,030
Are you ready? Because I think we are.

622
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,910
I'll go get the patient.

623
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,750
You should lie down.

624
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,700
He's out.

625
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,870
Scalpel.

626
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,760
If we expand the quarantine, I can do the transplant.

627
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,470
The only technical breach will be...

628
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,560
She's infected.

629
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,990
Melendez.

630
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,780
Yeah.

631
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,450
Take down the adhesions on the sigmoid.

632
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,330
How are his vitals?

633
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,090
Holding steady, Doctor.

634
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,880
That's dead bowel.

635
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,780
It's perforated.

636
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,800
Damn it.

637
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,040
I need a doctor!

638
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,400
Petringa needs help.

639
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,370
If I don't secure these clamps,

640
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,860
there will be stool everywhere.

641
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,280
Murphy, go.

642
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,730
He signed a DNR.

643
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,900
He shouldn't have.

644
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,520
This is battery.

645
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,030
He doesn't need to die.

646
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,690
We're gonna get his donor's marrow.

647
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,780
Andrews agreed to the plan?

648
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,280
Not yet.

649
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,740
If he doesn't, we'll think of something else.

650
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,300
He said he was feeling lightheaded.

651
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,520
I hear you, but please, stay back.

652
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,710
- He's... - Is he infected?

653
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,440
From when Santa vomited on him?

654
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,940
He should go to isolation.

655
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,700
He's in hypogly...

656
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,580
...cemic shock.

657
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,620
Give him D50.

658
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,640
- It's spreading. - Kellan!

659
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,430
Kellan!

660
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,150
Kellan!

661
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,570
Kellan! Kellan!!

662
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,070
Kellan!

664
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,080
Dr. Glassman.

665
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,940
We got what we needed for images.

666
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,100
You are okay to go.

667
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,760
We'll send them to Dr. Blaize.

668
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,420
Anything I should be worried about?

669
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,180
You're seeing Dr. Blaize before the holiday?

670
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,890
As a matter of fact, I'm seeing her now.

671
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,770
So, I could just show her the hard copy.

672
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,490
- I'm not supposed to do that. - Oh, no. I know.

673
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,330
I've been a neurosurgeon for, like, 100 years.

674
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,330
I understand protocol. I'm not gonna look at it.

675
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,230
I just want to move things along.

676
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,820
Thank you.

677
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,970
It's back.

678
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,040
Suction.

679
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,150
I must've nicked a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery.

680
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,550
- I can't see where. - Can you feel it?

681
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,350
I think so.

682
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,180
Use your finger to plug the hole.

683
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,060
Now what?

684
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,810
Dr. Lim?

685
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,870
Everyone, calm down.

686
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,180
Hey, Kellan! Kellan!

687
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,640
Look at me! Look at me! Breathe!

688
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,460
Can -- can you hear me? Can you hear me?!

689
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,060
Help my son!
