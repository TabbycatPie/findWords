1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,180
I'm mad for you, Diane.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,780
Roger's dating already?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,410
OMG, I wonder if she's younger than him.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,870
You hold on a second.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,140
Lorraine, how's my favorite client?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,010
I've been on something of a hot streak at work.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,320
I've tapped into a rich vein of new clients --

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,220
recently divorced moms.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,970
You might say I hit the single-mother lode.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,510
How about that master suite, huh?

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,470
Maybe if I had someone to share it with.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,000
Lorraine, you are a beautiful woman with a lot to offer.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,530
Should we make an offer?

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,970
It's a great house, but I'm just gonna be alone.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,160
Diane, you're not gonna be alone.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,010
You're gonna get a loan.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,760
Sodas, snacks -- poker game's in the basement.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,460
Look, I need more sleep than you,

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,880
and ever since they cut down that stupid prune tree,

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,980
the sun has been right in my eyes every morning.

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,210
It's not a prune tree. They pruned the tree.

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,590
And I'm not switching places with you,

23
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,770
so you should just put your head at the other end of the bed.

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,880
Uh, why? So my feet get the pillow?

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,150
And I'm the dumb one.

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,970
Diane, you have got to forget about him.

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,070
Roger's Cheyenne's problem now.

28
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,290
- Honey... - You know what?

29
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,990
You need to talk.

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,220
Starbucks for a little go juice?

31
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,310
What is up?

32
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,280
I need to go into the office.

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
My dad wants me to close out the monthly.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,440
What?

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,030
Monthly. Never mind. Go on.

36
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,690
I'm stretched a little thin today, so I need you

37
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,560
to do the grocery shopping, check in on the kids,

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
and maybe clean up those branches in the front yard.

39
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,100
Done and done.

40
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,910
Is that an expression,

41
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,210
or did you really only remember two of the things I said?

42
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,350
- The second. - I'll leave you a message.

43
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,190
Hello?

44
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,980
Phil.

45
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,220

50
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
YYeTs.com

51
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,750
I have bad news, Jay.

52
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,400
Joe was thrown out of the gymboree.

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,740
Again? What happened?

54
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,570
He pushed Mason. He made him cry.

55
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,260
The teacher said that we cannot go back.

56
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,050
That's ridiculous. Mason's a big baby.

57
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,120
Everybody there is a big baby.

58
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,150
But Joe plays very rough.

59
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,270
And we know why. It's the curse.

60
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,840
Not that I'd ever want to discourage you from whispering,

61
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,450
but that's not a thing.

62
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,240
There is a mark of the devil in my family.

63
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,110
My great-great grandfather

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,040
was given the location of an emerald mine

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,090
in exchange for his soul.

66
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,590
There's, like, paperwork or something that proves this?

67
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,900
And they say that the day of his daughter's wedding,

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,860
a great bird came from the sky

69
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,950
and snatched him with his claws

70
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,170
and took him far, far away.

71
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,710
You're aware that a remarkable number of your stories end

72
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,190
with a family member being carried off by a giant bird.

73
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,740
I only know what I was told, Jay.

74
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm just saying after the third time,

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,420
we might think about moving the party inside.

76
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,640
Okay, maybe it's not the curse,

77
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,320
but you know that my family has a very dark side.

78
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,620
My cousin Aurelio is a horse thief.

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,390
My uncle Carlos fixed soccer games. My aunt --

80
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,710
Did he teach them to pick the ball up

81
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,680
and throw it down the field?

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,230
'Cause that's the only way you fix soccer.

83
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,240
Manny escaped it, but I am not sure about Joe.

84
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,870
Gloria, this is about an uptight teacher.

85
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,960
And so what if Joe's a little boisterous?

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,910
Whatever happened to letting kids be themselves?

87
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,670
- Ready. - Lose the hat.

88
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,040
I guess I'm supposed to see "Sound of Music" in a regular hat.

89
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,250
Nothing against "Sound of Music,"

90
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,340
but there's a lot of other things

91
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,500
we could do this afternoon.

92
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,550
You ever hear of "Death Wish"?

93
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,180
Oh, I love "Death Wish."

94
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,040
Manny, that's the charity where the sick kids go to,

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
like, a concert with Madonna

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,480
or to the super bowl with Justin Bieber, or they --

97
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,020
No, no, no, no, no.

98
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,710
It's a movie -- New York, '70s,

99
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,510
Charles Bronson's a firm family man, and he...

100
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,530
Who's pushed to the limit

101
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,360
until one day he decides to fight back.

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,100
- You've seen it? - It's called "Death Wish."

103
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,680
I doubt it ends with him trading banter

104
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,790
in an apartment with Marsha Mason.

105
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,430
Hey, fiance?

106
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,810
Hello, my intended.

107
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,980
That one sounds a little murdery.

108
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,080
You are my intended.

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,530
Stop it. Stop it!

110
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,490
So, while you're out,

111
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm gonna review our flower options,

112
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,480
and I have to say, so far, i'm partial to Floral and Hardy,

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
but I'm gonna give one last look at Florist Gump.

114
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,860
You love a business with a clever name.

115
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
I do. Guilty.

116
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,370
Can I just say I love how this is going?

117
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,810
Mitchell and I agreed

118
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,760
that I would be in charge of the wedding

119
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,520
after the tragic news last week from the Andys.

120
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,800
Uh, not the mountain range. No.

121
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,170
Our friends Andrew and Andrew --

122
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,870
they broke up.

123
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,410
The stress of planning a wedding was too much.

124
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,820
They were quibbling about...

125
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
Everything.

126
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,270
I mean, uh, which is why I'm just happy

127
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,210
to stay out of his way.

128
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,490
Yeah, I dream big. Then I winnow down.

129
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,050
Dream big. Winnow down.

130
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,230
- Dream big. - Okay, winnow down.

131
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,070
Yep. Stay out of my way. Sorry.

132
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,910
Daddy, where's Larry?

133
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,460
Oh, well, you know how cats are, sweetie.

134
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,140
They're -- they're wanderers.

135
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,350
But I haven't seen him in days.

136
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,420
Well, he'll be back, okay?

137
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,650
Trust daddy on this.

138
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,670
Okay.

139
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
You know, I'm starting to get worried

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
that Larry might not come back.

141
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,460
- Oh, he's definitely dead. - What?!

142
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,890
Yeah, street meat or coyote chow.

143
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,290
We'll wait a couple weeks, and then we'll get a new Larry.

144
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,970
Uh, you're pretty nonchalant about our family pet dying.

145
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,320
And shouldn't we help our daughter process this loss?

146
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,480
Yes, we will, and she'll be fine.

147
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,630
And it's not nonchalant.

148
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,130
It's farm life. Death is everywhere.

149
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,300
You just learn to not get too attached to anything.

150
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,560
Oh, so, what, if I were to die,

151
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
you would just wait a few weeks and then replace me?

152
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,620
Of course not.

153
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,730
Where would I find another gay Mitchell

154
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,260
with your exact markings?

155
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,770
What's happening, big Al?

156
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
Yeah, let's go ahead and veto that nickname.

157
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,600
Hey, Reuben taught me this cool trick.

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,660
Close your eyes.

159
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,230
Oh, my god! What is wrong with you?

160
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,970
You kissed a girl. Now we're even.

161
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,380
Just paying off a poker debt.

162
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,200
Luke's creepy friend just kissed me.

163
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,410
Ew. Reuben? That little weirdo?

164
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,260
I'm still here.

165
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,850
I'm gonna go boil my mouth.

166
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,970
Oh, hey, guys. Game's downstairs.

167
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,700
This little game you dorks play,

168
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,340
we talking milk money or heavy cream?

169
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
A lot of fresh bar mitzvah money down there.

170
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,310
Mind if I sit in?

171
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,450
We kind of got a no-girls policy.

172
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,740
Is it a policy or just something that keeps happening?

173
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,050
The second.

174
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,880
Hey, honey.

175
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,380
I am so excited I can't stand it!

176
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,760
If you're gonna move your hands around like that,

177
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,900
you need to put the phone down.

178
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,010
Okay, okay, okay.

179
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,890
For cocktail hour,

180
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,100
they're creating a running waterfall

181
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,830
onto which they're going to project

182
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,240
a hologram of us embracing.

183
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,890
But we're still winnowing, right?

184
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,800
Already winnowed.

185
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,500
I cut the angel costumes.

186
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,890
Hard choices, Mitchell.

187
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,830
Okay, I got to go. I'm so excited!

188
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,580
Yeah, me too.

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,990
Best thing about my relationship with Cam?

190
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,590
Trust.

191
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,840
Newsflash -- I can be an obsessive person.

192
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
In the past, I've had trouble letting someone else

193
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,000
call the shots.

194
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Giving up control made me crazy.

195
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,600
That's what makes my life with Cam so freeing.

196
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,040
I can turn over big things to him

197
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,220
and never give them a second thought.

198
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,780
Out of sight, out of mind. Bye-bye.

199
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,770
Phil.

200
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,020
This is --

201
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,370
Oh! Oh, my god!

202
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,350
Phil?

203
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,120
- Phil?! - Yeah, I was just sitting there,

204
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,530
and he basically molested me.

205
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,690
Excuse me?

206
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,230
She's talking about Reuben.

207
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,980
Who are you?!

208
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,020
You boys better have money.

209
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,620
I am not doing this for free.

210
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,350
W-w-what's -- what's happening?

211
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,420
Oh, I hear you, Joyce.

212
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,100
His time's important. Your time isn't, right?

213
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,570
Let me buzz you back, superstar.

214
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,470
Okay.

215
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,150
Hey, honey.

216
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,440
Branches are still in the front yard,

217
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,770
I just took a rake to the face,

218
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,720
Reuben is getting really weird on Alex,

219
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,620
And Haley's doing something for money in the basement.

220
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,750
It's all gonna be fine.

221
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,150
Daddy's home, superstar.

222
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,410
No. Don't call me that.

223
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,570
I'm not one of your needy little divorces.

224
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,840
Um, that is work.

225
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,710
Is it?

226
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,880
'Cause I kind of feel like part of you loves

227
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,110
being a hero to those women.

228
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm a helper of people.

229
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,640
Hey, you knew what you signed up for

230
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,030
when you hitched your wagon to a realtor man.

231
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,050
Honey, when I met you,

232
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,620
you were a wedding deejay.

233
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
By the way, Spinderfella,

234
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
looks like you still need to hit the grocery store.

235
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,860
I think someone's feeling neglected.

236
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes, I deal with a lot of lonely women,

237
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,870
but there's only one I'm married to.

238
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,100
You're getting too involved, Phil.

239
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,620
You are juggling these women,

240
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,440
and you're not that good a juggler.

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,190
Now you're just lashing out!

242
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Hey, come here.

243
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,460
I didn't tell Jay,

244
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,060
but sometimes Joe even scares me.

245
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
Lucky for me, there are professionals

246
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,550
that are trained to deal with such problems.

247
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,340
Ay, thank you for coming, padre.

248
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,750
Oh, of course, Gloria.

249
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,080
And this must be Fulgencio.

250
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,200
What a beautiful little boy.

251
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,160
He's such a sweet nature.

252
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,570
I can tell he's a gentle soul.

253
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
Ah! Hey, Fulgencio, no, no.

254
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,030
Sorry, padre.

255
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,910
Ay, that's why I called you, Father.

256
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,040
I think he's bad.

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,810
There is evil in my family.

258
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,340
Ah, Gloria, he's just a little baby.

259
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,390
Last week, his eyes got red,

260
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,040
and the dog backed away.

261
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,020
He probably just had a cold.

262
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,700
All mothers worry.

263
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,360
Look at him -- rosy cheeks, he's playing with his blocks.

264
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,780
The six again.

265
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,050
So, Joe knocks one kid down, he's out.

266
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,430
All kids do that.

267
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,990
Why do you think your whole building is made out of nerf?

268
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, you see where he gets it from.

269
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
Hey, listen, I'm not afraid of you, Miss Debbie.

270
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,630
You're not the -- damn it.

271
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,220
Sounds like someone needs a relaxing trip

272
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,520
to nazi-occupied Austria.

273
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,730
Can't believe she hung up on me.

274
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,800
Well, you were yelling at her.

275
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,490
Standing up for yourself is not the same thing as, uh --

276
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,420
Excuse me.

277
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,930
Uh, come on, Jay.

278
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,880
So no one ever taught you manners, huh?

279
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,660
Whatever, dude.

280
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,930
No, you bump into somebody, you apologize.

281
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,410
And since I'm teaching you something here,

282
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,350
here's a little class called "Intro to pants."

283
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,240
Jay, stop!

284
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,240
Get off me!

285
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,920
I go to school with those kids.

286
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
You know how embarrassing that was?

287
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,230
- Manny. - No.

288
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,140
Why do you always got to be like this --

289
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,250
judgmental, hot-tempered, loud?

290
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,060
These are a few of my least-favorite things.

291
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,780
Well, I can see that the house speaks to you, Diane.

292
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,720
"Buy me."

293
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,290
Not now, house.

294
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,770
Ah, the open floor plan, the spacious kitchen.

295
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,970
I do love it.

296
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,620
That's -- that's the office.

297
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,480
Why don't you take one last look at the backyard?

298
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,690
Did someone say barbecue?

299
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,710
"I did."

300
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,520
Lorraine, what is up?

301
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,460
Nothing. Just kicking it at the office.

302
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,240
Slow down, now.

303
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,710
Tell Phil what happened.

304
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,060
Phil, can I go in the garage?

305
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,100
Make yourself at home, sister.

306
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,470
That was my sister who is visiting town

307
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,300
-- and my office,

308
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,960
which is where I am calling you from.

309
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,060
You called me.

310
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,680
I'm worried about Larry.

311
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,090
Oh, honey, I know.

312
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,070
Where is he?

313
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,950
Um, Lily, there's probably something I should tell you.

314
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,820
Larry's not coming back home.

315
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,700
Why? Is he dead?

316
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,290
Nope. Um, not dead.

317
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,420
Larry, uh, met someone, fell in love,

318
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,990
and he got married.

319
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,290
Are they ever going to visit?

320
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,270
I'm afraid not because when cats get married,

321
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,080
they have to move to, um, the forest,

322
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,660
and so then they're not tempted by other cats in the city.

323
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,280
- It's Larry. - I know.

324
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,000
Even people that you would never expect

325
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,960
- have moments of weakness. - No, over there.

326
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
But where's his wife?

327
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,310
Hello, Larry.

328
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,600
Larry's back.

329
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,830
Yeah, uh, well, you know what?

330
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,920
I think they probably, uh, didn't work out,

331
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,910
and they broke up.

332
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,500
People get married and then break up?

333
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,490
What if that happens to you and daddy?

334
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,610
Oh, y-you know what? Daddy made a mistake.

335
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,420
Uh, Larry and his wife didn't break up.

336
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,510
Larry's wife...died.

337
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,020
Oh, no.

338
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,780
Yeah.

339
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,560
That's why we're gonna give him the closure he needs

340
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,070
by throwing, um, a funeral

341
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,980
to celebrate the remarkable life of Larry's wife.

342
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,420
It's gonna be great. You know what?

343
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,650
We're gonna have music, we're gonna get a shoe box...

344
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,880
...we're gonna have candles.

345
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Yes. Hi, Florist Gump. It's me again.

346
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,360
It felt good to handle that crisis on my own.

347
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,520
In the past, I would have had to run to Mitchell,

348
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,120
but he's been trusting me more and more.

349
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,030
I'm so proud of him.

350
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,430
He's really learned to let things go.

351
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,190
Oh, no! God, no, no, no!

352
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,810
What?

353
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,220
It's a bloodbath down there.

354
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,400
We lost everything.

355
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,410
I thought you were good.

356
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,890
I always beat Dylan.

357
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,040
Come on. We need your help.

358
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,570
You're the best card player in this family.

359
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,630
What's in it for me?

360
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,100
- A chance to be a good sister. - Pass.

361
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,410
Reuben's been telling everyone

362
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,590
you slipped him the tongue.

363
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,400
Move.

364
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,100
I thought cats had nine lives.

365
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,790
Yeah, and they do,

366
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,560
but Larry's wife was older than he was,

367
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,850
and she'd been married eight times before.

368
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,220
Like Elizabeth Taylor?

369
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,470
Oh, you remember our bedtime stories.

370
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,760
Oh, Dylan, thank you for coming on such short notice.

371
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,430
I just need you to dig a hole right over here.

372
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,950
- Thank you. - Oh, no problem.

373
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,190
So, Lily, I'm really sorry.

374
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,090
How's Larry doing?

375
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,710
Fine. He's a happy cat.

376
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,540
Oh, they're cats.

377
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,080
That's gonna make my job a lot easier.

378
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,630
Okay, everyone, thank you for coming.

379
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,530
It means a lot to Lily, and it means a lot to me.

380
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,620
Angus?

381
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,240
So, Larry's wife -- what can I say?

382
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,760
She loved Larry.

383
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,220
And, um, you know, like all cat marriages,

384
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,830
they had their ups and their downs,

385
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,320
but they always landed on their feet.

386
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,160
Oh, hit a rock.

387
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,230
Oh! Not a rock!

388
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,060
Okay, everybody!

389
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,090
Please stay calm! Please stay calm!

390
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,490
No running! It's slippery!

391
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,940
Angus, keep playing!

392
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,700
Okay.

393
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,900
- Randall! - Yeah?

394
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,210
I'm up here.

395
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,580
Mr. Pritchett?

396
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,680
This is all intern work.

397
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,050
It isn't for my band.

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,970
Need me to do a coffee run?

399
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,100
No.

400
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,380
No, uh, listen, I was -- I was cleaning,

401
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,220
and I got stuck up here,

402
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,780
and I need you to go into my office

403
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,750
and stand up the ladder that fell.

404
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,680
Got it.

405
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,490
And I'm sorry about lying before.

406
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,020
Those are flyers for my band,

407
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,150
the Interns.

408
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,090
Uh-oh. Your door's locked.

409
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,250
Oh, no.

410
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,770
But, hey, I-I think, if you keep going forward,

411
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,380
then back your legs out through the vent,

412
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,300
I can grab them to help you down.

413
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,430
Oh, I don't know.

414
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,600
That makes me a little nervous.

415
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,120
Just think about something else.

416
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,050
I heard you're getting married. How's that going?

417
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,460
Oh, yeah, yeah.

418
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,730
It's -- it's good. It's good.

419
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,840
You know, we're planning it right now.

420
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,200
Actually, it's being planned for me.

421
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,930
That's nice. No stress.

422
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,080
Oh, you'd think, huh?

423
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,590
But it's getting a little bit out of hand.

424
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,250
Oh, that happens with weddings.

425
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,100
Does it?

426
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,010
I mean, how many weddings have you been to

427
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,170
that have something called a dove cannon?

428
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,260
You know, I think I should have a say

429
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,470
in something like that.

430
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,090
You need to let go, Mr. Pritchett.

431
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,370
I-I can't.

432
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,740
I-I wish I could, but I can't.

433
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,250
I just -- it's freaking me out.

434
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,840
No, I've got you already.

435
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,060
Okay.

436
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,170
Yeah.

437
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,690
Thank you.

438
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,400
You know, I'm pretty good at reading people,

439
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,830
and it sounds like you and your lady

440
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,510
really need to talk this out.

441
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,690
Yeah, maybe you're right.

442
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,120
So I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

443
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,870
- I'm gay. - Oh, my god.

444
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,710
Does she know?

445
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,430
Got to save something for the wedding night, huh?

446
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,190
Okay.

447
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,690
Riley, no! Buster, please sit!

448
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,330
Dylan, help!

449
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,620
I can't!

450
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,470
These cats and dogs are fighting like -- oh!

451
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,690
Okay, everybody, I'm sorry.

452
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,900
This was supposed to be a small service,

453
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,610
but I don't winnow down.

454
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,780
I overdo.

455
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,650
And if I let a simple fake cat funeral get out of hand,

456
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,110
how am I supposed to plan an entire wedding?

457
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,340
You're late.

458
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,250
Okay, I need Mitchell.

459
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,020
Good news.

460
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,140
He just pulled up.

461
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,450
Damn it.

462
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,160
Okay, in. In, in.

463
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
Yes. Okay.

464
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,940
And, please, can somebody catch that thing?

465
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,270
Okay, all right, stay.

466
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,400
Everyone just...

467
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,910
Hey! How was the gym?

468
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,220
I never made it.

469
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,550
Listen, Cam, I got to talk about something.

470
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,540
I do, too.

471
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,930
What would you think about being more involved with the wedding?

472
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,440
That's what I wanted to talk about.

473
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,450
I would love to.

474
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,090
Thank god.

475
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,230
You know, I just think we're -- we're better together.

476
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,050
"Better together." Mm, I like that.

477
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,610
I cannot be in a house with snakes.

478
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,010
How bad is it?

479
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,290
Gonna need about an hour.

480
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,260
Here you go.

481
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,110
I got you Sno-caps,

482
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,760
'cause, you know, at the end, they escape across the alps.

483
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,070
Thanks for ruining it.

484
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,370
Calm down. The movie's 50 years old.

485
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,580
Making friends everywhere, aren't you?

486
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,220
Listen, you always say, "Express your feelings."

487
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,140
When I get mad, that's what I do.

488
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,570
Hello? Yeah, I can talk.

489
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,580
My parents dragged me into this stupid movie.

490
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,700
Go ahead, Jay. Feed him his phone.

491
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,720
You're telling me that doesn't bother you?

492
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,150
I can't hear you. Talk louder.

493
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,900
I'm just saying...

494
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,480
...if we give in to every impulse,

495
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,140
we're no better than wild animals.

496
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,640
But if we push it down, it eats you alive.

497
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,900
Not if you just let it go.

498
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,260
The chick from that crapfest "Mary Poppins."

499
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,200
That's it.

500
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,950
A lot of cold, lonely nights in that apartment by myself

501
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,640
while my mom was driving a taxi,

502
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,490
and only one thing kept me company.

503
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,370
So, you got a problem with poppins,

504
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,800
you got a problem with me.

505
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,740
Ay, Father, I am so sorry.

506
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,120
I didn't even know that he could hold a fork.

507
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,740
No, no, no, I blame myself.

508
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,980
I probably shouldn't have taken his nose.

509
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,830
No, it's my family.

510
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,940
The girls are very chesty,

511
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,640
but the men, they're kissed by the devil.

512
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,070
Gloria, the fact that you are so concerned

513
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,380
is only proof that you are a loving and caring mother.

514
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,320
It's the parents who shape the child.

515
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,110
And your son is growing up in a wonderful home.

516
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,030
Die, scum!

517
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,030
No, no, no!

518
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,800
Louder, like you did

519
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,780
at the drive-through.

520
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,670
Mom, Jay and I saw "Death Wish."

521
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,370
Amazing.

522
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,260
Manny got in a fight at "The Sound of Music,"

523
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,400
got kicked out.

524
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,010
I've never been so proud.

525
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,680
Well, I guess every household

526
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,290
could use a little fine-tuning, huh?

527
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,550
Let me give you my card

528
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,910
- with my cell number on it. - Please.

529
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,480
And what did I do with my wallet? I...

530
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,090
I had yelled at Phil for not helping out,

531
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,090
and there he was, doing exactly what I had asked him to do...

532
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,180
Here's our zucchini.

533
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,020
Up top, buddy.

534
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,900
...for some other family.

535
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,250
You are so sweet for helping me with this.

536
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,930
How hurt you've been, Lorraine --

537
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,910
This is sweet. This is...normal.

538
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,750
Phil?

539
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,410
Diane?

540
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,640
Hey, superstar.

541
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,980
I thought I was superstar.

542
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,030
Oh, your husband has been so wonderful to me.

543
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,720
He's not my husband. He's my realtor.

544
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,960
Oh, he's my realtor.

545
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm both your realtors.

546
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,990
I-I'm just lucky to have such a --

547
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,110
We're on our way to an open house.

548
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,500
Oh, is that why you couldn't

549
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,570
show me the colonial later?

550
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,090
I made that corn bread that you like.

551
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,030
W-we're gonna make it to that.

552
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,480
I just have to finish up with Lorraine.

553
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,270
Oh, you mean, like, "Get it over with"?

554
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,130
No, I-I don't mean that.

555
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,720
And I thought zucchini bread was your favorite.

556
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,490
Why -- why am I buying zucchini?

557
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,330
Hey, can't a guy like zucchini bread

558
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,370
and corn bread?

559
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,290
- Phil? - Damn it.

560
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,190
Ronnie!

561
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,120
I thought you had a doctor's appointment.

562
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,950
That's why you had to miss Darrell's swim meet.

563
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,960
Who's she?

564
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,030
Just another client.

565
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,160
"Just another client"?

566
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,770
No, that's -- what is this?

567
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,250
Uh-oh, it is. It's my office.

568
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,320
Got to take it.

569
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,070
- Hello? - Phil?

570
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,440
Claire?

571
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,700
World's greatest realtor.

572
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,040
What are you doing here?

573
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,490
Your hair is sweating.

574
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,710
That's 'cause I'm excited to see my friends.

575
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,020
Let's go, buddy.

576
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,890
Are you all clients of Phil's?

577
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,970
Apparently.

578
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,790
Well, you could not be in better hands.

579
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,180
I met Phil when I was at such a rocky place in my life.

580
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,960
He was available to me morning, noon, and night.

581
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,800
Of course he found me my dream house,

582
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,660
but that wasn't the best part.

583
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,880
Phil taught me how to trust a man again,

584
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,390
and I think that was always his plan.

585
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,870
That was always my plan.

586
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,360
And it was not easy for me to trust a man

587
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
after the husband that I'd had.

588
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,280
This guys left tools in the yard,

589
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,730
let the kids run wild.

590
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,870
Well, great to see you, Claire.

591
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,800
He was always interrupting me.

592
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,620
And he wore the most ridiculous sleep-mask thing.

593
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,710
Oh, god, sounds like such a diva.

594
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,170
Or he's photosensitive,

595
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,830
which is a real condition.

596
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,920
Never took my advice.

597
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,840
You know, that's the worst part.

598
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,830
He never -- he never said he was sorry just one time.

599
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,460
I would kill to have heard,

600
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,700
"Claire, you were right."

601
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,970
She was right.

602
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,810
Louder.

603
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,160
I do not love this side of you.

604
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,120
Thanks for winning my computer back.

605
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,680
And getting me all my money. That was awesome.

606
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah, if only I had stopped there,

607
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
but I had to go back down.

608
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,790
I got greedy, and I was careless.

609
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,450
There's a story about that I remember from school.

610
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,850
Icarus flew too close to his son.

611
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,190
I think their wings bumped.

612
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,490
One of them fell. They might have been ducks.

613
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,870
Anyway, the lesson is, is that you have to pay attention.

614
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,610
Or pay the ultimate price.

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
Shall we, my dear?

616
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,400
Don't wait up.

617
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Wait up.
