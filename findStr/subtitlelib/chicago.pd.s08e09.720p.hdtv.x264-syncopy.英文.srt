9
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,830
So imagine this neighborhood

10
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,300
is restored to glory, dawg.

11
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,260
Imagine this block right here.

12
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,130
Masks are just a bad memory. Imagine the crowds,

13
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,100
the dope restaurants, the powerful bars--

14
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,780
I'm imagining the rats too.

15
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,030
Imagine not interrupting me.

16
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,020
And imagine the cash flow in your pocket.

17
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,430
Ah, Kev, what? Because I'm the bartender?

18
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,480
No, 'cause you own the building, Ruz, damn.

19
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,610
I got an "In," okay?

20
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,300
A couple smart as hell business guys, they owe me a favor.

21
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,030
They said as soon as the zone clears,

22
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,400
- we can turn this thing around. - I don't know, buddy.

23
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,650
I think we're gonna be dead and buried

24
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,630
by the time this neighborhood comes up.

25
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,930
Come on, bro. Think about the West Loop.

26
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,240
I mean, we'd be rolling in cash right now

27
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,910
if we would've thought about the West Loop.

28
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,240
I just know what this place used to be, dawg,

29
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,870
and I feel like we could bring it back.

30
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,580
I feel like I'm wondering about the beer

31
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,060
that you promised me. What's happening here?

32
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,310
I feel a little hoodwinked. I want my beer, man.

33
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,390
Come on, bro. I got you.

34
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,600
Units on the Citywide.

35
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,720
We're getting multiple calls of shots fired.

36
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,510
34th and Wilson. Caller states

37
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,600
the shots are coming from inside a hardware store.

38
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,930
5021 David. Squad, repeat that address.

39
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,990
34th and Wilson. Southeast corner.

40
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,700
5021 David. Squad, we're five blocks away.

41
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,950
- What? You know the place? - No, the owner.

42
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,740
Copy that. We'll show you en route.

44
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,330
Ma'am, can you move on down the way, please?

45
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,050
You ready?

46
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,940
Mr. Roy!

47
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,330
Chicago PD. Anybody in here?

48
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,230
Mr. Roy...

49
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,520
Squad, roll an ambo. We got one down.

50
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,100
GSW to the chest. Male. 60s.

51
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,970
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

52
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,400
I can't leave him. Go. Go.

53
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,160
Don't go anywhere, Mr. Roy. I got you.

54
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,010
I got you. Just hold on, OG.

55
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,610
All right? Or Mama Claire will kill us both.

56
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,840
Come on, Mr. Roy.

57
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,750
Come on. Look at me. Look at me.

58
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,710
Look at me.

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,950
- Ruz, you good? - Yeah.

60
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,760
5021 Ida, shots fired at the police.

61
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,990
Offender's fleeing out the back door.

62
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,100
- Black jacket, blue jeans. - Copy that.

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,970
Backup en route.

64
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,260
Stop! Police!

65
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,490
Police! Freeze!

67
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,460
You knew him?

68
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,880
You know, Englewood was my first beat.

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,990
Me and Mr. Roy hit it off from the jump.

70
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,570
He was real good people, Sarge.

71
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,280
He cared about his family, the community.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,830
Okay.

73
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,200
All right, what are we thinking?

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
- Armed robbery? - The register was cleared out,

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,630
but his wallet was still on him.

76
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,050
The M.E. said there was fresh contusions

77
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,520
and abrasion on Roy's face.

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,800
He was beaten and shot at close range.

79
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,850
Oh, yeah. This was personal.

80
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,530
All right, what do we know about the offender?

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,340
I didn't get a good look at all.

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
5'10". 170.

83
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,780
Masked up. Ruzek said he was fast as hell.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,990
Surveillance?

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
No security cameras inside, Sarge.

86
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,350
I told him to put those things in years ago.

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,420
He didn't like the message they sent.

88
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,990
Well, let's get him the justice he deserves.

89
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,630
Okay, check PODs, talk to witnesses.

90
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,290
- Hit the streets hard. - No! No! No!

91
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,800
- No! No! - All right, let's go.

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,300
Mr. Roy's wife. I'ma talk to her.

93
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Yeah. Okay.

94
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,960
- Kev! Kevin, is my Roy... - Ms. Claire.

95
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,330
Sergeant?

96
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,430
I heard about the murder. Any leads?

97
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,490
Chasing a few. Nothing to report yet.

98
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,160
You're kind of far from the Tower.

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,380
I gather this isn't a random inspection.

100
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,410
It's not.

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,370
I want to talk about Andre Cooper.

102
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,370
You know, the young man whose partner shot and killed--

103
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,420
Yeah, I know who he is.

104
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,920
The kid's having a rough time.

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,150
Black cops are shunning him for not doing more.

106
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,940
The white cops are calling him out

107
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,680
for not backing up his partner.

108
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,810
Cooper was the valedictorian of his academy class.

109
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,970
I don't want his career to end before it starts.

110
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,190
Yeah. I get that.

111
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,310
Just don't know what you want me to do here.

112
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,830
Bring him into Intelligence.

113
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,990
I would think of it as a personal favor, Hank.

114
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,520
My team's handpicked by me.

115
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,200
You realize I could just assign him to Intelligence, right?

116
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,110
I do.

117
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,570
But you didn't.

118
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,170
Well, he's sitting in my SUV right now.

119
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,980
Least you could do is introduce yourself.

120
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,290
Look, I don't know what the deputy super told you,

121
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,380
but Intelligence is pretty unique.

122
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,020
I mean, there's only six or seven cops in the whole unit.

123
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,500
There's just not a lot of open positions.

124
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,540
Can I be blunt, sir?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,450
This wasn't my idea.

126
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,270
She told me to jump in the car and take a ride.

127
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,890
So if she put you in a awkward position,

128
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,270
I apologize.

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,630
And as much as it would be an honor

130
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,130
to work in Intelligence,

131
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,810
I don't want any special favors.

132
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,140
What do you want?

133
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,160
To be in the game.

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,940
In the middle of it.

135
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,920
If you want to make a difference, do some good,

136
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,850
you gotta be on the streets,

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
in the community, talking to people.

138
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,950
It was nice talking to you, Andre.

139
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,160
For what it's worth, Sergeant,

140
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
I checked that pizza joint across the street.

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,330
- Okay. - Saw a guy duck back in

142
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,820
when he saw patrol coming.

143
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,820
Place went from open to closed real quick.

144
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,480
What did he look like?

145
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,800
Black. 40s.

146
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,570
6'5". Slender build.

147
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,640
Had on blue jeans, brown steel-toe boots,

148
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,410
a vintage Bulls Jordan jacket.

149
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,010
Vintage?

150
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,830
The red leather sleeves. They don't make those anymore.

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,950
Appreciate the heads-up.

152
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,950
Yes, sir.

153
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,410
Witness?

154
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,170
No. Grown man bitching about parking restrictions.

155
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,700
Listen, I want you to grab Kevin.

156
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,710
Check out that pizza joint on the corner.

157
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,720
I think the owner might know something.

158
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,620
All right.

160
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,750
Sorry, we're closed.

161
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,750
I'm not here for the pie, Bob.

162
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,300
I want to talk to you about the homicide across the street.

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,610
It's a damn shame about Roy.

164
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,290
What a world.

165
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,900
- You catch the guy? - No, sir, not yet.

166
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,230
That's exactly why we're here.

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,890
Did you see anything suspicious before or after the gunshots?

168
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,820
No, I was in the back.

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
We noticed gang tags on your doors.

170
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,080
That a problem for you? They've been harassing you?

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,030
- They're good customers. - Really?

172
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,020
Because three months ago, you filed a police report that

173
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,980
said two gangbangers roughed up one of your employees

174
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,370
and smashed out windows.

175
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,140
That was just... just a misunderstanding.

176
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,970
Bob, Mr. Roy was a good friend to me,

177
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,680
so if you know anything, you need to tell me now

178
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,870
because I'm not going to sleep until I find his killer.

179
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,300
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

180
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,330
I ain't no hero, brother.

181
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
I got a wife and two little kids.

182
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,490
You think of anything, call me.

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,280
My CI told me that Quincy Barrett

184
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,740
runs that neighborhood. He's got a strong sheet.

186
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,170
Distro, agg assault, armed robbery, intimidation.

187
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,430
- Whose flag does he fly? - Nobody's.

188
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,960
He's a lone wolf. From what I understand,

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
he recruits unaffiliated kids to deal dope

190
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,480
and shake down good business owners for protection money.

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,830
- All right. Anybody talking? - No one so far.

192
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,430
But it's pretty clear that pizza guy is getting harassed

193
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,160
or saw something.

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,030
He just doesn't want to get involved.

195
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,030
Well, we also know Roy was getting harassed.

196
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,370
OCD Lab dumped his phone,

197
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,100
and he's been getting threatening text messages

198
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,630
for about a month from a burner.

199
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,200
These are the most recent.

201
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,110
Two weeks ago, "Tick tock, old man."

202
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,250
Last week, "Time to pay."

203
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,990
And yesterday, "My gun's untucked."

204
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,750
All the messages are coming within the vicinity

205
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,040
of the hardware store.

206
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,240
And after Roy's murder, the phone was turned off.

207
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,850
Sounds like Roy didn't want to play the game,

208
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,290
so Quincy decided to make an example out of him,

209
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,630
send a message.

210
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,020
All right, so what else we got?

211
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,820
During our canvass, a witness told us

212
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,250
that they saw a beige SUV patrolling the block

213
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,970
for about 20 minutes before the shooting.

214
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,690
Had tinted windows. We did our homework.

215
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,950
Quincy drives a beige Escalade.

216
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,780
Okay. We catch it on any security cams?

217
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,860
No, he got lucky.

218
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,710
Well, it looks like his luck just ran out.

219
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,360
I'm gonna pull something up.

220
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,580
So this was captured on POD footage

221
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,650
across the streets from a car wash on Jackson

222
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,430
two hours after Roy was killed.

223
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,590
That Escalade's registered to Quincy Barrett.

224
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,590
And that guy, it looks like

225
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,210
he's only cleaning the driver's side.

226
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,530
All right. Anybody recognize him?

227
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,140
No, he doesn't look like Quincy Barrett to me.

228
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,720
- Too far for a facial rec. - Yeah.

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,310
Okay, so let's ID this car washer.

230
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,840
We gotta figure out a way to get inside that Escalade.

231
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,160
You find Roy's blood in there, it's game over.

232
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,450
No Escalade.

233
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,410
Hey, Jay, we're all set back here.

234
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,000
Copy.

235
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,880
Chicago PD. Open up.

236
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,160
Guy inside just dropped a gun into a red backpack.

237
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,090
- Not Quincy. - Guys, heads up.

238
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,110
Guy inside just hid a gun. Stay frosty.

239
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,260
Copy that.

240
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,310
Quincy Barrett.

241
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,070
The hell is this?

242
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,550
We got a report that your car was used in a hit and run.

243
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,060
We'd like to look at your vehicle.

244
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,700
Yeah. Well, good luck with that.

245
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,720
- What's that mean? - Someone stole it.

246
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,860
I don't know. Maybe whoever stole it

247
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,290
did that hit and run.

248
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,260
- Did you report the theft? - Nah, not yet.

249
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,960
But you know what? Maybe y'all can help me out.

250
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,350
You know, start looking.

251
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
Where were you yesterday afternoon, Quincy?

252
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,990
Y'all hear that phone ringing?

253
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,670
That's my lawyer calling,

254
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,700
telling me to keep my damn mouth shut.

255
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,710
Nice day, Officers.

256
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,030
Hailey. Hey, I got a male, Black, 20s,

257
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,660
exiting the building with a red backpack.

258
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,350
Yeah, that's him.

259
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,070
Could be the murder weapon in there. Take him.

260
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,580
- Copy that. - Hey, man.

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Chicago PD. Can I talk to you for--

262
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,890
Slow down. Slow down.

263
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,290
- Yo, I haven't done anything. - Okay. Hands low.

264
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,500
Hands high.

265
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,480
Why you running?

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,100
- White cops scare me. - Yeah. What color am I?

267
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,370
Blue. Just as dangerous.

268
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,230
- What you got in here, man? - Nothing.

269
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,100
- Nothing, huh? - I know you leaving Quincy's.

270
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,220
What you doing? Washing cars again?

271
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,590
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

272
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,850
We were just playing video games.

273
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,560
Kev, yeah. It's just a gaming controller.

274
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,560
Like I say.

275
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,720
Can I have it back?

276
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,390
Off the car. What's your name?

277
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,120
- Damari Evans. - You got a license?

278
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,940
Where were you yesterday at 3:00 P.M., and why?

279
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,310
Midway Hospital.

280
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,670
My little brother had a seizure.

281
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,250
- Can I go now? - Go for it.

282
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,720
Damari, if I find out you had anything to do

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,620
with the murder of Roy Hill,

284
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,280
we'll see each other again, okay?

285
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,550
Okay, so that's Damari Evans and his younger brother, Theo,

286
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,860
at Midway Hospital.

287
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,950
This is the same day that Roy Hill is murdered,

288
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,440
and they are in that waiting room from 2:30 to 4:00 P.M.

289
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,010
And what time was Roy shot?

290
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,010
Shots fired call came in at 3:15.

291
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,920
All right, so Damari's his cleaner,

292
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,600
- not his killer. - Which would suggest

293
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,390
- Quincy did his own dirty work. - All right.

294
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,670
Were we ever able to track down this Escalade?

295
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,160
No. There's probably too much blood in there,

296
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,280
and he's hidden it somewhere.

297
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,530
All right. What else do we know about Damari?

298
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah, he's got one bust for distro, two agg assaults.

299
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,010
He's been in the gang database since he's 15,

300
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,600
and he lives with his little brother, Theo.

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,750
Okay, so Theo is a straight-A student,

302
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,830
one B-plus.

303
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,400
He has a severe form of epilepsy,

304
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,230
which requires a ton of medical attention,

305
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,130
and both parents are out of the picture.

306
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,680
Right, so he's the mother, father, brother,

307
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,250
- breadwinner wrapped in one. - Yeah, and that's good for us.

308
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,350
It means Damari's vulnerable.

309
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Right, we jam him up,

310
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,980
get him to flip on Quincy to protect Theo.

311
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,710
We need to come at him as a big-time buyer.

312
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,640
But how?

313
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,330
Besides me, you guys are all burned,

314
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,860
and I'm pretty sure Damari doesn't want to sell to me.

315
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,140
- Good to see you. - All right. I'll catch you.

316
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,980
What you need, homie?

317
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,220
I'm good.

318
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,640
But you got company.

319
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,080
How's that?

320
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
You see that gray pickup down the block?

321
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,890
You see it? That man, woman?

322
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,150
Whiter than Christmas?

323
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,100
I'll bet a hundo they police.

324
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,840
Chicago PD. Let me see your hands.

325
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,850
- Yo, we ain't do nothing. - Put your hands up.

326
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,940
Shut up, turn around. Face the fence.

327
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,410
Before we pat you down, you got anything on you

328
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,470
- that's gonna stick us? - No, I do not, Officer.

329
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,980
I'm just waiting on my little brother.

330
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,400
Man, y'all can just keep on stepping. I know my rights.

331
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,450
Don't talk to me about rights.

332
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,790
I know you're selling, so where is it?

333
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,670
Back up, man. You ain't got no right to harass--

334
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,580
Calm down.

335
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:22,990
Come on!

336
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,780
He got you pretty good.

337
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,320
I told him to make it look real,

338
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,020
but not that real.

339
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,150
Should we take you to Med?

340
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,400
Good job, Coop.

341
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,210
It usually takes a few days before you land your first deal.

342
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,120
Yeah, well, you know it ain't nothing like running from cops

343
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,660
to bring brothers together, right?

344
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,880
This thing still transmit if I go into a basement?

345
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,100
- Yeah, half a mile radius. - Let me see.

346
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,710
- Let's see. - Here you go.

347
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,540
Okay.

348
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,800
So what does Damari know about you?

349
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,950
Name's Sean Hicks. From Auburn Park.

350
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,470
Went to Taft High School.

351
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,030
By the way, he tested me on the Taft mascot. You were right.

352
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,830
You tell him about your sick mom?

353
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,880
No.

354
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,590
Didn't think I needed to take it that far.

355
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,180
Felt like we were exploiting a private situation.

356
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,520
That's exactly what we're doing.

357
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,460
Damari's got a sick brother.

358
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,740
He's gonna respect you for taking care of your sick mother.

359
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,640
Gotta use any commonality we can find.

360
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,140
Look, stay on point, okay?

361
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,750
We're watching, but not too close.

362
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,500
And the bangers on that block, they got their radar up.

363
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,170
You catch a bad vibe, you walk.

364
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,160
- Right? - Yes, sir.

365
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,530
- All right. - Well, talk to me, man.

366
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,190
What high school did you go to?

367
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,600
I went to Bolingbrook High.

368
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,340
South suburb. A'ight.

369
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,100
You just make sure you take care of yourself in there.

370
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,160
Don't go in there talking about lacrosse or tennis.

371
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,300
You don't have to worry about that.

372
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,400
Why is that?

373
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,390
I was on the golf team.

374
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,330
Ooh, coming to get you, boy.

375
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't think so.

376
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,250
Taste the carbon blaster!

377
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,730
Oh, that's cold.

378
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,030
Yo, you wanna take a run up against this punk?

379
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,630
Nah, man, I can't stay too long.

380
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,860
Gotta take Moms to the hospital.

381
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,290
Yo, what happened?

382
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,620
She got cancer.

383
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,130
In the lungs.

384
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,040
In chemo three times a week.

385
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,450
Yo, that's tough, bro.

386
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm sorry to hear that.

387
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Yeah, it ain't pretty.

388
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,320
Or cheap.

389
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,290
So you...

390
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,620
been holding down all the bills?

391
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,940
Yeah. Ain't got no choice.

392
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,890
I hear you, bro.

393
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,220
So how much you looking to buy?

394
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,960
Theo. Theo!

395
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,650
Theo, come on. Lay on your side for me.

396
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,490
Theo.

397
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,740
Just breathe. Just breathe.

398
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,040
The kid's seizing.

399
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,670
Come on, man. Just breathe.

400
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,070
Come on, man. Just breathe.

401
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,040
- What the hell are you doing? - Calling an ambulance--

402
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,170
No, man! I got product here.

403
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,430
Look, he needs his medicine.

404
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,950
Just go to my room. It's on the dresser.

405
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,080
We're gonna have to call an ambo.

406
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,540
No, no, no. Just give it a minute.

407
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,310
I don't want Cooper to get burned.

408
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,920
Come on, Coop. Hurry up. Hurry up.

409
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,420
Inhale, buddy. You can do it.

410
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,270
Come on now.

411
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,290
Just breathe, T.

412
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,710
There you go. Breathe.

413
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,080
- You all right? - Good.

414
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,410
Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

415
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,740
- Right, Theo? - Yeah, I'm good.

416
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,420
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you guys.

417
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,690
Yeah, well, you did.

418
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,150
Yo, no more of that, okay?

419
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,150
It's scary as hell, man.

420
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,740
Yo...

421
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,360
Yeah, we'll talk some more business tomorrow.

422
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,420
Yeah.

423
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,850
Hit me up if you need anything. For real.

424
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,800
All right, little man.

425
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,990
That was good work last night with Damari.

426
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,510
You kept your cool.

427
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,850
Sir, I thought Theo was gonna die.

428
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,080
Hey, man, we would never let that happen.

429
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,190
- Okay, good. Good to know. - Yeah...

430
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,240
Look, if things didn't stabilize quickly,

431
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,400
we would've stepped in, helped out.

432
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,310
Are you sure it's Quincy Barrett?

433
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,520
Bob, lock the door, stay in the back, and we'll check it out, okay?

434
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,300
All right.

435
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,120
That was Bob Hayes from the pizza joint.

436
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,870
He says Quincy is casing it right now in a silver Camry.

437
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,510
I got Hailey and Jay over there right now

438
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,440
doing follow-ups on Roy's murder.

439
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,680
Head over there, back them up. I'll loop them in.

440
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,060
- Come on. - Okay.

441
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,090
We know Quincy was driving a silver Camry.

442
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah.

443
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,730
It looks okay inside.

444
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,470
Kev told him to lock up, right?

445
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,170
Yeah.

446
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,220
Chicago PD.

447
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,330
Whoa! Chicago PD! Get your hands up.

448
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,020
Who are you? What are you doing here?

449
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,290
I'm Trent.

450
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,900
I just came in 10 seconds ago to get a pizza.

451
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,880
The door was open. I'm looking for Mr. Hayes.

452
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,920
Are you armed?

453
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,920
No! I didn't do anything. I just came to get some food.

454
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,120
- I promise. - Okay.

455
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,710
I'm just gonna search you for a second, all right?

456
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,670
Yeah.

457
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,410
All right. You got him?

458
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,500
Yeah, I got him.

459
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,520
Hang out in that corner for a sec, okay?

460
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,710
Body.

461
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,260
Hailey, it's Bob.

462
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,160
5021 George, I got a bona fide DOA.

463
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,960
3433 Wilson Road.

464
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,090
Hayes' Pizza. Roll a crime lab.

465
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,080
Copy that, 5021 George.

466
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,370
He took two to the chest, center mass.

467
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,020
One insurance round to the face.

468
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,560
- Cash register? - Untouched.

469
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,600
All right, so it was a hit.

470
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,830
Quincy knew he was a witness, tied it off.

471
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,670
All right, listen, we need evidence.

472
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,120
Let's get some boots on the ground now.

473
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,590
- Come on. - You got it.

474
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,120
- Coop. - Sir?

475
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,450
Just got a text.

476
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,480
Looks like Damari wants to meet up and do the deal.

477
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay, good. Let's get it done.

478
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,750
Talk to Atwater. He'll set you up.

479
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,950
Sarge, you got a sec?

480
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,560
What's gonna happen to Damari?

481
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,900
What do you mean?

482
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,530
Say we arrest him.

483
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,500
He agrees to help us take out Quincy.

484
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,300
What kind of deal we talking?

485
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,780
Depends on how helpful he is

486
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,390
and how involved he was in the two murders.

487
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,830
If he does time, what happens to Theo?

488
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,530
DCFS will probably step in.

489
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,020
So we take one criminal off the street

490
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
and just create another?

491
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,310
Not sure that's a victory.

492
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,730
All right, listen to me.

493
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,870
We need to take down Quincy Barrett.

494
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,470
That's our focus.

495
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,840
That's the job.

496
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,600
Yeah. There he is.

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Hey, man. How you doing?

498
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,770
- All good. - How's your mama?

499
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,740
She's good, man. Thanks for asking.

500
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,790
Yo, what kind of cancer she got again?

501
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,520
Lung.

502
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,500
Yeah, my aunt had that.

503
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,450
Yo, dawg, what you think about that investment idea

504
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,910
we talked about earlier?

505
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,790
Aw, Kev. Bro, you know I'm with you all the way,

506
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,370
but I don't like that one.

507
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,690
You don't like it?

508
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,630
Well, I don't think that that neighborhood's on the up.

509
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,680
What do you mean "on the up"? Anything can be on the up

510
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
if you get there at the right time and you put the work in.

511
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,730
So...I was able to get

512
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,350
100 grams, uncut.

513
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,470
Yeah.

514
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,250
It's all there.

515
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,540
Cool. Man, let's do it.

516
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,690
Yo, hold up. Hold up.

517
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,960
Man, it never stops, bro.

518
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,100
- What happened? - Theo's medical stuff.

519
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,120
He just had another seizure.

520
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,510
Principal took him down to the ER.

521
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,240
Sorry to hear that.

522
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,910
No, that's okay. They just cruising.

523
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,770
I spent 13 grand last year on medical bills.

524
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,030
- Can you believe that? - Damn.

525
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,490
No wonder why I gotta sell dope, man.

526
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,700
Yo, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

527
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,860
How about you go to the ER to check on Theo?

528
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,610
We'll do the deal later tonight.

529
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,480
No. What the hell?

530
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,600
- Come on, Coop. - What the hell?

531
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,060
Nah, man. It's cool. We can just bang it--

532
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,070
Nah, man. These cops is making me nervous.

533
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,710
Why risk? You know what I'm saying?

534
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,990
Yeah, let's hook up later, man.

535
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,460
All right. Bet.

536
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,820
What was that?

537
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,030
What was that? What was that?

538
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,180
We're two minutes away from making the arrest--

539
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,460
There was a patrol car out there.

540
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,200
There was a patrol car out there.

541
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,240
If we got harassed,

542
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,120
- if they asked for my license-- - Andre.

543
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,300
That's why you backstopped.

544
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,810
You got a clean license, you got a clean name,

545
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,100
They couldn't blow your cover if they wanted to.

546
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,580
Yo, it just didn't feel right, okay?

547
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,570
So I made a call in the moment.

548
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,240
But we still good.

549
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,890
We're doing the deal later tonight.

550
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,160
Are you sure about that?

551
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,340
The hell does that mean?

552
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,320
That means you gotta worry less about Damari

553
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
and more about the families of the two dead bodies.

554
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,480
Roy Hill. Bob Hayes.

555
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,600
This job is hard.

556
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,350
Especially when you're trying to do right.

557
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,170
The more you care, it actually gets harder.

558
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,930
So if this isn't something that you can do,

559
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,650
if you don't think you can handle it, step aside.

560
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,940
But either way, we got jobs to do, and we gotta get it done.

561
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,990
That was his call, Kevin.

562
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,550
He was the one in play.

563
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,270
And Patrol was in the vicinity.

564
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,720
Okay, well, how about just ducking in the building

565
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,890
and keeping the deal going?

566
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,670
He's new. He's learning.

567
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,680
I understand that, but I think there's more to it.

568
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,580
- Okay. - He got a very soft spot for Damari.

569
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,290
We can't forget about what just happened last week.

570
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,330
He watched his white partner kill an innocent Black man.

571
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,570
He's got a lot on his mind,

572
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,320
and it's starting to worry me a little bit.

573
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,560
Okay, you make the call.

574
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,060
You want to pull him?

575
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,110
Sarge, Kev, I got something.

576
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,060
We picked off Quincy's credit card at a mini mart

577
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,970
20 minutes after Bob Hayes got shot.

578
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,760
We tapped into their security server

579
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,400
for the camera inside and out.

580
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,370
He walks in, buys a pack of cigarettes,

581
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,840
walks out, meets with someone in the parking lot.

582
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,940
Looks like he handed the murder weapon off to Damari.

583
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,690
Guessing his job was to stash it or dump it.

584
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,600
The question is, where?

585
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,850
- And the answer is in that phone. - Yeah, you're right.

586
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,520
We ID that cell number, we find the gun.

587
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,170
So, do you think Cooper can handle it?

588
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,380
All right. Get him up to speed.

589
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,280
Yo, man. You ain't gotta do this.

590
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,560
Nah, I got plenty.

591
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,780
Ding-dong over there, he eats like a bird.

592
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,250
Dig in.

593
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,680
It's the least I could do.

594
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,340
You saved me twice in, like, two days.

595
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,000
You're like a cop-sniffing dog.

596
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,160
All right, is this Damari just playing,

597
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,850
or he getting suspicious?

598
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,010
Twice in two days. That is a lot.

599
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,180
I mean, come on.

600
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,810
What do you think, Sarge?

601
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,170
My vote is suspicious.

602
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,650
Think we should pull him?

603
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,170
All right, we haven't heard the safe word yet.

604
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,060
Let's let it play for now.

605
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,920
Hey, I got good eyes.

606
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,260
Good ears too.

607
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,640
And I don't like police neither,

608
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,660
so I'm always aware of where they are,

609
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,700
who they harassing, so don't even trip.

610
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah, well,

611
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,470
there's plenty of them up in this neighborhood

612
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,860
sweating folks.

613
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,440
Always looking for problems too.

614
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,070
Used to.

615
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,380
I gotta admit, things are a little different now.

616
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,760
I know it's kind of fun, watching cops act all polite and nice.

617
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,320
Yo, they've been catching so much hell

618
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,630
that they scared of their own shadows.

619
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,930
It ain't like they don't deserve it.

620
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,750
I get you bro, but

621
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,250
it's not like we all choir boys.

622
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,160
You know, some of us

623
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,060
actually do break the law.

624
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Hey, uh, you got a bathroom I could use?

625
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,180
Yeah, down the hall, to the left.

626
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,650
The hell you doing, man?

627
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,740
I was going to the bathroom, I saw the poster.

628
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,380
Had to be dude's first poster he ever did.

629
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,220
I ain't ever seen it before. But you know, my bad, man.

630
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,860
- I ain't mean-- - Nah, man, it's all cool.

631
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,670
I ain't uptight like that.

632
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,930
Cool.

633
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,740
Yo, grab your coat, man. We need to bounce.

634
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,450
Where we going?

635
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,920
Meet up with Quincy.

636
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,080
Yo, Coop.

637
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,430
Didn't we talk about this?

638
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,340
Do not travel, dawg.

639
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,780
What's wrong?

640
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,780
It's just, you didn't tell me we was meeting up

641
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,360
- with big boss man. - Yeah, he just texted.

642
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,250
You bring the cash?

643
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,130
Yeah. It's in my coat.

644
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,890
All right. Come on.

645
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,580
Yo, what's the matter?

646
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,340
You don't trust me?

647
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,100
Of course I trust you, man.

648
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,680
When they start asking if you trust them--

649
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,170
Then they don't trust you.

650
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,240
One more thing.

651
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,350
No cell phones.

652
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,200
Hey, Sarge, are we really gonna let them go mobile?

653
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,170
We don't really have a choice.

654
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,310
Copy that.

655
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,040
All right, 10-4.

656
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,950
Sarge, they're getting in Damari's car.

657
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Yo, stuff the cash under the seat.

658
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,300
In case we get stopped.

659
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,910
Man, you is raw.

660
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,010
Man, where are we going?

661
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,910
Yo, stop asking so many questions, bro.

662
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,060
Just chill.

663
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,600
Come on, man. What's going on?

664
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,000
Move on. Move on.

665
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,230
- Come on. - Bro, you gotta get him.

666
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,960
Is this a joke? What the hell, man?

667
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
Come on, bro.

668
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,120
Hey, Sarge, we getting blocked by a garbage truck.

669
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,190
You got eyes?

670
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,800
- That's a negative. - I'll call it in.

671
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,350
Get this truck out of here. Get out of here!

672
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,270
We're losing the feed, Kev.

673
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,930
All right, we'll anticipate Cicero.

674
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,040
Maybe they're getting on the 290.

675
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,330
- All right, here we go. - You ready?

676
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,680
- Yeah. - All right. Let's go.

677
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,250
- Come on. Come on. Come on. - I lost signal.

678
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,080
Well, he's on his own now.

679
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,010
- This kid's on his own. - Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,760
Let's do this.

681
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,340
We got nothing? Nothing at all?

682
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,200
We got nothing. We got the BOLO going out

683
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,640
every five minutes. We got nothing.

684
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,970
- I just--I don't understand. - We told him not to travel.

685
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,320
Didn't we tell him not to travel?

686
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
- I know! - Come on, man!

687
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,310
We're gonna find him. We'll find him.

688
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Damn! Forgot the bread.

689
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,310
Welcome to OnStar Emergency.

690
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,080
- My bad. - All good.

691
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,730
So this a normal thing?

692
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,940
Him wanting to meet up with the people you do business with?

693
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,590
I wouldn't say "Normal," but

694
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,020
he calls the shots.

695
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,270
So when he says meet, we meet.

696
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,660
It's the way it is.

697
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,540
Product in there?

698
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,680
Yeah.

699
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,720
Don't worry.

700
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,170
It's gonna be fine.

701
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Definitely no cops in here.

702
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,800
Man, it kind of spooky, ain't it?

703
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,030
Yeah.

704
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,110
It feels like a place

705
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,460
where one of them horror movies take place.

706
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,930
You and me having fun, then boom.

707
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,360
Crazy dude in a clown suit show up.

708
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,700
Yeah, with a chainsaw.

709
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,220
Okay. Where is this kid?

710
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,530
Units on the Citywide.

711
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,140
We're getting a vehicle SOS distress signal.

712
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,630
Multiple attempts have been made to contact the occupants.

713
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,060
Anyone available to roll over to 420 North Belmont?

714
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,070
- Check it out? - 2322.

715
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,250
We'll roll on that job.

716
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,890
What kind of car are we looking at?

717
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,800
Black Buick LaCrosse. Four-door.

718
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,010
Illinois plate. William-7-Young-527.

719
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,500
- That's Coop. Let's go. - Smart move.

720
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,980
Okay, that means he's in trouble. Hey, hey, hey.

721
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,970
5021. Squad, that's our BOLO vehicle.

722
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,200
We're rolling on it.

723
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,550
5021 David, 10-4.

724
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,040
A few more years, man, and I'm done.

725
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,120
I'll have enough money to go legit.

726
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,660
Start that business I was telling you about.

727
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,800
Yeah.

728
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,160
I'm gonna make it big too.

729
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,480
I'll buy one of those mansions in the suburbs.

730
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,860
You know, on the lake?

731
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah, man. Sounds good to me.

732
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,290
And we'll go water skiing.

733
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,680
Then we'll cook steaks on the grill.

734
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,350
Man--

735
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,780
Sorry I'm late, fellas.

736
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,990
Oh, no worries.

737
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,250
Ah, so this the dude you been telling me about.

738
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,780
Yeah. Sean.

739
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,750
Where you from, Sean?

740
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,180
South Side.

741
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,290
Winter Park Apartment Complex.

742
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,430
- 18th and Woodbridge. - Cool.

743
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,490
Who you stay with over there?

744
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,940
I don't stay there now. Got my own spot.

745
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,420
33rd Street.

746
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,180
Uh-huh, don't it feel good to be on your own?

747
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,900
Independent?

748
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,690
Speaking of which,

749
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,490
you got any affiliations I need to know about?

750
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,520
I ain't linked up with nobody, man.

751
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,680
I always did my own thing.

752
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,640
So tell me, young brother,

753
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,480
how'd you meet my man, Damari, again?

754
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,220
It's kind of funny, actually.

755
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,630
Was walking down King Street.

756
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,650
Saw this white dude, this lady--white lady--

757
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,310
sitting in the car acting all nonchalant.

758
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,580
And I saw my man, Damari, on the corner.

759
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,160
Figured he might be doing some business,

760
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,330
you know?

761
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,410
So I gave him the heads-up. Thought they might be cops.

762
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,430
Sure enough, they were.

763
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,340
That's a good break.

764
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,770
Yeah.

765
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,920
He saved me in a pinch.

766
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,180
Then y'all became, like-- like best friends?

767
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,270
I don't know about all that, but

768
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,360
we cool.

769
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,520
Start talking about doing some business.

770
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,520
You know it's--it's kind of like one of them movies.

771
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,120
Right? You know, where the cute white chick

772
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,730
bump into the handsome dude?

773
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,950
He spilled coffee all over his dumb ass?

774
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,890
You know, they call that, um, serendipity.

775
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,130
Yeah, like a coincidence.

776
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,590
But, you know, the thing is, Sean, um,

777
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,460
I don't believe in serendipity.

778
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,870
You know, serendipity, it--

779
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,140
I don't know, it make me nervous as hell.

780
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,550
Nah, Q. Man, you got it wrong--

781
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,130
I ain't talking to you, boy.

782
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,240
No, so what is it about you?

783
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,730
What? You working off a case? You helping out police? Like--

784
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,080
- It ain't like that-- - Yo, I told you,

785
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,150
- keep your mouth shut! - It's cool.

786
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,440
It's cool.

787
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,790
I understand where you're coming from.

788
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,110
I ain't never been arrested.

789
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,690
So I ain't got no case to work off.

790
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,380
Yo, Q. He's straight, man.

791
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,130
It's all cool. It's not what you think it is, man--

792
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,470
Chicago PD!

793
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,710
Drop the--

794
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,180
Andre, are you good? You hit?

795
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,300
- Yeah, I'm good. - Call it in.

796
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,010
420 North Belmont.

797
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,800
Squad, man shot!

798
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,250
I need a ambo at 420 North Belmont!

799
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,720
Copy that. Ambo on the way.

800
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,600
Come on, Damari. Hang on, man.

801
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,200
Stay strong for Theo.

802
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,460
You're...

803
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,530
you're a cop?

804
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,930
Hang on, man.

805
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,430
- Just hang on. Hang on. - You're a cop.

806
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,920
Hang on.

807
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,980
Stop running!

808
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,220
Stop moving!

809
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,590
Stop! Moving!

810
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,070
Gun's clear.

811
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,210
Quincy Barrett, you're under arrest.

812
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,950
Get up.

813
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,190
Get up.

814
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,690
You okay?

815
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,500
Any word on Damari?

816
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,070
Yeah.

817
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,040
He's dead.

818
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,790
It's not on you.

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,980
Not even a little bit.

820
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,240
He had a hard life. I get that.

821
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,930
But it was his decision to work for Quincy,

822
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,870
to sell drugs,

823
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,700
to shake down honest business owners, and cover up murders.

824
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,720
I mean, when you sign up for that life,

825
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,420
dying's a part of the game.

826
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,360
You done preaching?

827
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,200
Don't do that.

828
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,470
I'm not preaching.

829
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,470
I'm just telling you exactly what it is.

830
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,310
This ain't "Batman," Dawg.

831
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,040
The criminals don't wear masks. They don't act all crazy.

832
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
Some of them are smart, and they're charming.

833
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,610
They take care of their mothers, and their fathers,

834
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,870
and their uncles.

835
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,750
And their little brothers too.

836
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,860
You know, I get that.

837
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,000
But I feel like we could've done better.

838
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,840
I feel like we could've told Damari what was going on

839
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,340
and best thing, he'll cooperate.

840
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,860
We could've took care of Theo.

841
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,390
There's gotta be a better way to do this

842
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,780
without destroying innocent Black lives.

843
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,930
That's all I'm saying.

844
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,370
I mean, we had to put Damari into play

845
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,010
to get justice for Roy Hills and Bob Hayes.

846
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,160
Innocent Black lives.

847
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,430
There's not a easy answer to this problem.

848
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,070
But us being here is part of the solution.
