22
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,950
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...

23
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,590
Sir, you don't really think Aaron's a traitor, do you?

24
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,540
No, I don't.

25
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,180
But until I can prove that definitively,

26
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,430
I have to keep my guard up and so do you.

27
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,860
What happened last night?

28
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,160
We had the shooter contained,

29
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,930
but MacLeish gave the order anyway.

30
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,930
What order?

31
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,820
Shoot to kill. And that's for your ears only.

32
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,860
We need your help.

33
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,350
You want to help me? Find my son!

34
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,580
- It's Joyner. He wants to see you. - Why?

35
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,470
The FBI came to see him again today.

36
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,400
The guy just needs some reassurance.

37
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,220
I can give it to him.

38
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,540
But if it doesn't work, the problem has to be eliminated.

39
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,830
- Someone's gonna find out. - Yes, you lied.

40
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,740
- I lied to Congress. - That's it. Go.

41
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,110
FBI! Freeze! Put your hands on your head.

42
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm the Vice President of the United States.

43
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,120
No!

44
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,310
From ABC7 News, this is a breaking news alert.

46
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,860
Good morning from ABC7.

47
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,940
We have breaking news from Arlington National Cemetery.

48
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,850
The U.S. Army and FBI are investigating a deadly shooting

49
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,280
that occurred last night.

50
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,220
The Washington Post is reporting that two victims are involved...

51
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,230
Emily Rhodes.

52
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,380
Aaron Shore.

53
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,280
Someone's gonna have to explain to me

54
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,050
how the Vice President of the United States of America

55
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,490
was murdered in front of a team of federal agents!

56
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,570
We didn't pick the meeting place, sir. MacLeish did.

57
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,690
We had to take cover where we could.

58
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,550
And MacLeish's security detail was instructed

59
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,320
to give him plenty of buffer so he'd feel secure.

60
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,520
We would've taken him down if it weren't for Beth MacLeish.

61
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,180
I'm sorry. I missed it.

62
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,780
Beth MacLeish was the joker in the deck.

63
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,440
I didn't think she could be involved.

64
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,710
Do we know how she got away from her Secret Service detail?

65
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,570
She said she was going to read to her children,

66
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,800
and that was her routine.

67
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,230
By the time they figured out she was missing, it was too late.

68
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Mr. President, there are only a few scenarios at play here,

69
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,080
but only one rings true -- Beth MacLeish was involved.

70
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,660
She knew we were there to arrest her husband,

71
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,010
and she murdered him before we could interrogate him.

72
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,710
What kind of fanatics are we dealing with here?

73
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,000
Sir, it's only a matter of time before the press pieces together

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,650
their own version of what happened tonight.

75
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,700
I-It's imperative we keep as many details out of the public realm

76
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,830
to protect the integrity of our investigation.

77
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,990
I understand.

78
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,890
So what do we tell the American people?

79
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,020
- Damn it, no cufflinks. - Use paper clips.

80
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,360
- What? - I'm serious.

81
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,990
- Any idea who got shot? - Not a clue.

82
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,000
I know.

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,600
It's shocking, but we need to move past this.

84
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
Does anyone need to take a moment?

85
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,860
Okay, good.

86
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,760
Because we're in a race against the clock.

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
The country is gonna wake up to the news

88
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,150
that their Vice President was murdered by his wife,

89
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,450
who then killed herself.

90
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,860
Do we know why she did it?

91
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,960
No, not really.

92
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,410
Right now, the working theory is problems in the marriage.

93
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,960
A domestic dispute? I don't believe it.

94
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,790
Well, unfortunately, it's the only explanation

95
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,900
investigators are willing to give until they know more.

96
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,180
I will make the announcement.

97
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,710
Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories

98
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,470
is like dropping blood in the water.

99
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,410
And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.

100
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,820
Somebody just tried to kill you,

101
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,050
and now the Vice President gets murdered by his wife?

102
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah, the press will be all over you for more details.

103
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,840
Let me make a statement.

104
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,660
No, this news...

105
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,170
The country needs to hear from their president.

106
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,830
Sir, I have to point out that Speaker Hookstraten's now

107
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,510
- next in line to the presidency. - Right.

108
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I'll talk to Kimble at the appropriate time.

109
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,360
For now, bring her up to speed with what we know.

110
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,720
These next few days are going to be crucial.

111
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,940
I need you to hold yourselves together,

112
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,250
project strength.

113
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,960
The American people deserve nothing less.

114
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,910
- Let's get to work. - Yes, sir.

115
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,790
This is surreal...

116
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,840
MacLeish, Beth.

117
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,290
W... What about their kids?

118
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,390
I mean, what about those poor girls?

119
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,550
I know. I feel awful about the children.

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
You know what happened, don't you?

121
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,810
But you can't tell me, can you?

122
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,700
No.

123
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,580
Not yet. Hopefully soon.

124
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,420
- Dad! - Little pea!

125
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,780
Hey, w... watch out. Mind your dad.

126
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
You okay?

127
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,340
Yeah. I'm all right. What do you got there?

128
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,050
I can't draw a horse. Will you help me?

129
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,920
Of course. But I've got some work to do.

130
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,940
- I'll help you in a minute. - Promise?

131
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,100
Pinky swear.

132
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,900
Come on. Let's get you some breakfast.

133
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,420
Aren't you forgetting something?

134
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,580
- I love you. - I love you, too.

135
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,410
No. No, that's not actually what I said.

136
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,070
I would just refer you back to my original statement, okay?

137
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,080
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

138
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,840
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
Plea... Please, take your seats.

140
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,200
I wish I were here to simply talk to you

141
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,480
about my returning to the White House

142
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,890
and expressing my gratitude to the medical staff

143
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,080
at the George Washington University Hospital

144
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,400
and to the American people for their incredible support.

145
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,430
But unfortunately,

146
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,600
I have a more somber and serious obligation.

147
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,060
There has been a great deal of speculation

148
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,310
surrounding the police activity at Arlington National Cemetery

149
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,340
from last night until this morning.

150
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,340
I am here to tell you that

151
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,640
tragically, at 10:38 p.m.,

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,250
Vice President Peter MacLeish

153
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,610
was shot and killed by his wife, Beth MacLeish.

154
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,440
She then turned the gun upon herself

155
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,900
and committed suicide.

156
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,720
The Vice President was visiting the gravesite of a soldier

157
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,330
who was under his command in Afghanistan.

158
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,130
Why he was there last night specifically,

159
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,440
how often he visited the cemetery,

160
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,750
and what led to this fatal outcome

161
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,640
is still unknown.

162
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,400
I would like to say, I know the American people

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,890
will join me in sending their hopes and prayers

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,640
to the MacLeish family during this time of sorrow.

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,640
Thank you very much.

166
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,330
All right, folks, that's all we have for now, okay?

167
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,280
The President's obviously not taking any questions.

168
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,570
Look, I'm gonna be updating you every hour

169
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,200
as we have new developments.

170
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,690
Yvette...

171
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm so sorry.

172
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
Thank you.

173
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,280
One second.

174
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,310
I don't know what to say.

175
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,660
Thank you for coming.

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,830
He was such an amazing boy, Jason.

177
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,050
And they took him from us.

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,710
What's the press saying about the shooting?

179
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,820
What aren't they saying?

180
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,650
Speculation's everywhere, but Seth has it handled.

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,270
How's the staff holding up?

182
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,660
They're shocked, but pulling through.

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,730
One thing that helps is seeing you on your feet again.

184
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,260
- Welcome back, Mr. President. - Thank you, Hayden.

185
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
See?

186
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,610
We should discuss the rest of your day's agenda.

187
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,020
I thought we canceled everything.

188
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,700
We can't have a bunker mentality.

190
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,010
The world's still spinning.

191
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,160
You're absolutely right. What do you got?

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,450
Well, CEOs are arriving as we speak

193
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,180
to discuss reducing carbon dioxide emissions later today.

194
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,430
You're also set to meet with Senators Choi and Ganesh

195
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,780
regarding criminal justice reform.

196
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,940
Okay. What else?

197
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,000
Jacklyn Ramsey just turned us down for Interior,

198
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,690
said she's happy at the NRDC.

199
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,420
How many people do we have to approach

200
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,030
to get someone to even take a meeting?

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,480
Well, we saw this during the elections.

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,670
People just don't want to be in Washington right now.

203
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,120
Any good news?

204
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,710
Actually, Gary Dwyer's still set to come in tomorrow

205
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,430
to meet with Aaron about resuming his post as Secretary of State.

206
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,560
Dwyer.

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,190
That'll go a long way to shoring up confidence.

208
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,580
Yes, it would. But about their meeting, sir.

209
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,540
I was wondering, in light of recent events,

210
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,900
if you thought I should sit down with Dwyer instead of Aaron.

211
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
Emily, I understand your concern,

212
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,650
but until I find a reason to make a change,

213
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,090
it's business as usual.

214
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,750
Understood.

215
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,630
The MacLeishes leave behind two daughters, Lexi and Blake,

216
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,620
who will be staying with their maternal grandparents.

217
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,760
We ask that you would respect their privacy

218
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,300
in their time of grieving.

219
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,940
The President will address the nation further

220
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,950
when he has more information available, okay?

221
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,350
That's all I have for now,

222
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,570
unless you have questions about something.

223
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,030
Mr. Press Secretary!

224
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,050
Mr. Press Secretary!!

225
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,690
Mr. Leonard.

226
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,470
A pleasure to have you back at the White House.

227
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,200
I hope that's the first lie you told this morning.

228
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,030
May I ask who you're with?

229
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,220
Teen Mode.

230
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
Come on, Abe. I need to know who your credentials are with.

231
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,410
Teen Mode.

232
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,340
They actually do real stories on real issues,

233
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,490
unlike these lemmings.

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,960
All right, Abe.

236
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:58,990
You have a question?

237
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah, it's about Nestor Lozano --

238
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,410
President Kirkman's would-be assassin.

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,810
Sure, the FBI released a statement on Lozano last night.

240
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,360
Which told us virtually nothing.

241
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,530
Now, I have it on good authority that Vice President MacLeish

242
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,120
personally took over the manhunt for Lozano

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,210
and issued a shoot-to-kill order.

244
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,200
Care to comment?

245
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,340
I would refer you back to the FBI comm shop.

246
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm not aware of any such order.

247
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,950
Really? Well, my sources say MacLeish overrode the FBI,

248
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,020
deliberately preventing them from taking Lozano alive.

249
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,500
Why would the Vice President do that?

250
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,030
I mean, why would he go out of his way to silence

251
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,020
the one man who attempted to murder the president?

252
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,230
I mean, it doesn't make sense,

253
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,920
unless MacLeish... wanted him silenced.

254
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,330
I'll have to get back to you on that.

255
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,610
I'd appreciate that.

256
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,830
How did Abe Leonard get the information in the first place?

257
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,220
Wait, it's true?

258
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,390
- MacLeish gave the order? - Yes.

259
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,420
I advised against it, but he didn't listen to me.

260
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,340
Or the FBI.

261
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,300
What was he thinking?

262
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,200
He said he didn't want to put our men at risk.

263
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,560
Okay. Uh, well...

264
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,420
Leonard said - MacLeish was hiding something.

265
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,450
- Was he? - I don't know,

266
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,280
But now I have a room full of White House correspondents

267
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,450
- looking into it. - Look, we need to contain this now,

268
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,840
before paranoia takes over.

269
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,340
And I want to know who's leaking classified information.

270
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,110
Emily, Aaron, you were both in Command Ops

271
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,160
when MacLeish gave the order -- find the leak.

272
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,680
I want them in my office by nightfall.

273
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,660
Yes, sir.

274
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,180
Seth, can I borrow you for a second?

275
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,170
I want to address the nation.

276
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,470
Sir, I'm not sure that's the best idea.

277
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,990
I mean, you just announced

278
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,140
that the vice president was murdered by his wife.

279
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,240
I don't think the country's ready to hear this after that.

280
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
The country deserves to know what's happening.

281
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,720
Sir, no matter what your intent,

282
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,890
I think that anything that you say at this point

283
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,850
could contribute to a sense of chaos.

284
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,760
Why don't you let me buy you some time?

285
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,380
Wait for this news cycle to die down.

286
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,830
That way, when you do say something,

287
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,550
it's proactive instead of just reacting

288
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,860
to some flame-throwing reporter.

289
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,670
Okay, you're right. You're right. Get it done.

290
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,320
Thank you.

291
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,340
So what couldn't wait?

292
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,650
Abe Leonard...

293
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,980
I know you two go way back.

294
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,150
You told him about MacLeish taking out the shooter

295
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,790
in Command Ops -- don't deny it.

296
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,710
Okay, I won't.

297
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,650
- I told you that in confidence. - That was your mistake.

298
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,610
I thought you were working with the President on this.

299
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,530
I am.

300
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,050
He asked me to look into MacLeish,

301
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,820
and that's exactly what I'm doing...

302
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,830
- trying to do my job as best I can. - All right.

303
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,260
You can dress this up however you like, Madam Speaker,

304
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,230
but you just jeopardized national security.

305
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,610
Actually, Aaron...

306
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,810
you did.

307
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Those are NASAMS, ma'am --

308
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,130
surface-to-air missiles.

309
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,950
They were there before. We're just installing more.

310
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,020
And there's more snipers.

311
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,830
It's all part - of the increased security plan.

312
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,480
It's just for the moment.

313
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,180
Just for the moment.

314
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,180
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,350
Anything else?

316
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,870
No. Thanks, Mike.

317
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,230
You're the leak?

318
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,760
Indirectly, sir.

319
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,910
I told Speaker Hookstraten.

320
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,080
She fed the story to Abe Leonard.

321
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,630
I realize, sir, - this couldn't come at a --

322
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,180
at a worse possible time.

323
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,570
It was a lapse in judgment,

324
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,210
and I apologize.

325
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,960
It won't happen again.

326
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,260
- Now, I could put out a statement. - No, no, no.

327
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
That'll only add fuel to the fire.

328
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,610
With all the rumors that are floating around right now,

329
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,170
the last thing we need is the press to find out

330
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,810
that my Chief of Staff leaked classified information.

331
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,120
No, of course not.

332
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,470
Aaron?

333
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,220
When is the last time you slept?

334
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
I-I slept last night, sir.

335
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,810
More than three hours?

336
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,280
You said yourself you made a lapse in judgment.

337
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,240
Exhaustion affects our ability to make decisions.

338
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,530
Maybe you need some personal time.

339
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,250
Sir, are you asking me to step aside?

340
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,870
Absolutely not. I'm asking you to get some rest.

341
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,620
Take maybe a week.

342
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,310
Come back recharged.

343
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,930
Look, sir, I appreciate you looking after me like that,

344
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,610
but with everything that's going on right now,

345
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,600
I really don't think a break is called for.

346
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,280
Aaron, it's because of everything that's going on

347
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
that I need you at your best.

348
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,370
I'm not trying to punish you. I'm trying to protect you.

349
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,120
You're gonna have to trust me.

350
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,490
Take the week.

351
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,340
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

352
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,160
Aaron told me himself.

353
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,000
He shared the information with Speaker Hookstraten --

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,640
She leaked it to Abe Leonard.

355
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,180
Do you think this has anything to do with him

356
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,210
suppressing the threat assessment memo?

357
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,740
No. No, I don't.

358
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,100
But he's gonna take some time off.

359
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,410
You suspended him?

360
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,540
No, I asked him to get some rest and refocus,

361
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,780
give us a chance to figure out what the hell is going on.

362
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,170
In the meantime...

363
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,840
I would like you to be my acting Chief of Staff.

364
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm throwing you in the deep end here.

365
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,720
I won't let you down.

366
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,900
I know.

367
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,150
Thank you, Emily.

368
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,850
Ava will bring you up to speed.

369
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,500
I guess that's all I need for the next briefing.

370
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,550
Thank you, guys.

371
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,950
Hey, Seth.

372
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,180
My mother called me earlier. She asked me two questions.

373
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,120
One -- am I dating anyone?

374
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,020
Two -- was the Vice President involved

375
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,830
with the attempt on Kirkman's life?

376
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,120
- Funny. - I'm serious.

377
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,990
When's the President gonna address this?

378
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,050
He's right, Seth.

379
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,000
The longer we stay silent,

380
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,170
the more it seems like we are hiding something.

381
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,500
Okay. Well, look.

382
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,730
The President is still being briefed by the FBI,

383
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,220
and he should have all the information he needs

384
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,160
before he can address the nation, right?

385
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,540
Thanks for that question.

386
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Yeah.

387
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,770
Laura?

388
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,940
We, um...

389
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,980
We need to shut down Abe Leonard

390
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,730
before his conspiracy rumors get out of hand.

391
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,490
Abe Leonard's a Pulitzer Prize-winner.

392
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,730
Well, he's a disgraced Pulitzer Prize-winner, right?

393
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,250
You know, when firefighters are trying to put out a forest fire,

394
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,740
sometimes they'll...

395
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,290
set a backfire to snuff out the original blaze.

396
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,290
That's what we need to do.

397
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,130
So...you want us to smear him?

398
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,510
No, the President doesn't want that, and neither do I.

399
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,090
What I do want is for the American people to realize that, uh...

400
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,540
Abe Leonard strikes out more than he hits home runs.

401
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,840
Make our friends in the media remember

402
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,520
every correction, retraction he's ever had to publish,

403
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,990
every libel lawsuit and defamation settlement.

404
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,520
I mean, this guy's like a broken watch, right?

405
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,270
He's only right twice a day.

406
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,480
Sweet.

407
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,420
We finally get to spin something.

408
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,600
He-here's a list of pending correspondence and calls to return.

409
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,430
These will catch you up on NSA,

410
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,180
and these are the files for the Dwyer meeting tomorrow.

411
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,610
I'm sorry, Aaron.

412
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,360
Oh, well, there's nothing to be sorry about.

413
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,920
The President's just looking out for me.

414
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,580
And I'm sure you'll be back in no time.

415
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,630
Curtis is the go-to guy for all matters Senate,

416
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,110
and Jamie for the House.

417
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,160
Denise handles military and cabinet.

418
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Aaron...

419
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,190
Good luck.

420
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,930
You sure you don't want me in there with you?

421
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,430
No. Joyner knows me.

422
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,950
Yeah, he knows you're the one who took down MacLeish,

423
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,710
the only guy in the world he trusted.

424
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,200
Look, he's damaged goods. I can reach him.

425
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,220
The story of this conspiracy starts in Afghanistan.

426
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,280
Until we understand that, we don't understand anything.

427
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,050
"And you will know the truth,

428
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,520
and the truth will set you free."

429
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,930
John 8:32.

430
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,140
That's what you quoted to MacLeish

431
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,430
right before he was shot.

432
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,190
So what is the truth, Corporal Joyner?

433
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,560
Tell me about the mission to Kunar --

434
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,270
November 14, 2005.

435
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,690
I ain't talking to you.

436
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,910
The CIA added this to your mission file.

437
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,650
This is total crap.

438
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,260
It didn't happen like this.

439
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,870
This makes us sound like baby killers.

440
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,120
But you did kill civilians, didn't you?

441
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,470
Women? Children?

442
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,790
You weren't there!

443
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,990
You can't understand.

444
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,480
Make me understand.

445
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,810
Listen to your conscience, Alvin.

446
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,620
I can't.

447
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,860
You want to tell someone. I know you do.

448
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,930
No!

449
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,220
- Cap said -- - Captain MacLeish is dead.

450
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,280
And he's going down as a war criminal.

451
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,410
No!

452
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,700
H-He's a hero!

453
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,860
He saved all of us that day.

454
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,300
How? What did he do?

455
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,050
Everything all right?

456
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,590
Yeah.

457
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,990
T-Tom, I'm worried about the kids.

458
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,600
I think we should send them away from the White House.

459
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,520
What?

460
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,020
My mom can help take care of them. I spoke with her.

461
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,010
- With all due respect to your mom -- N-N-No.

462
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,320
J-Just hear me out, okay?

463
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,930
The people who are behind this, they took down the government,

464
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,490
th-they-- th-they killed that FBI agent's little boy,

465
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,910
and they almost killed you.

466
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,320
Slow down. Slow down.

467
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,670
You said yourself that you thought

468
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,450
the White House was the safest place to be.

469
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,340
Well, I was wrong.

470
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,280
Because wherever you are, you are a target.

471
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,790
Well, where do you want to go?

472
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,300
I spoke with Mike about Camp David.

473
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,410
- He says it's more secure. - Of course it is.

474
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,560
It's a compound in the middle of nowhere.

475
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,610
They wouldn't have any friends.

476
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,700
They'd have to be tutored. What kind of a life is that?

477
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,580
What kind of life is this?

478
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,330
You haven't been to their school, you--

479
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,710
Well, we'll boost their security.

480
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,890
- We'll get them tracking bands. We'll-- - No, no, no, no.

481
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,880
Putting more bars on the prison is not the answer.

482
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,830
I want our kids to have a normal life.

483
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,760
And I don't want to be away from them.

484
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,960
Or you, Al--

485
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,770
Alex...

486
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,480
This family, our family,

487
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,010
is the only thing holding me together.

488
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,410
I know. I know that.

489
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,150
And I don't want to be away from you, either.

490
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,300
But... we have to think about what's best for them.

491
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,390
And separating them from their father is the answer?

492
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,110
I'm sorry, sir.

493
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,750
I'll get back as soon as I can.

494
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,710
I'm gonna head home to shower and get a change of clothes.

495
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,800
Please do.

496
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,250
Don't miss me too much.

497
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,680
Don't make a sound!

498
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,450
Okay. Uh... you want my wallet?

499
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,740
No. I want your suit.

500
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,420
Is that a Welsh & Jeffries?

501
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,560
Oh, you guys are sons of bitches, you know that?

502
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,850
And what about me?

503
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,850
You gave birth to these two.

504
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,070
Oh, man. What are you guys doing here?

505
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,260
Well, you haven't answered a single text message

506
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,540
in the past week.

507
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,880
Yeah, well, that's what happens when the President gets shot

508
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,890
and the Vice President gets murdered by his wife.

509
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,020
That's why we're here.

510
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,790
- Call it an intervention. - With alcohol.

511
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,110
I wish I could, guys.

512
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,660
I got to shower and head back to work.

513
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,010
Oh, would you listen to this guy?

514
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,630
You sound like a freshman all over again.

515
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,480
Callie flew in from New York just to see you.

516
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,420
- You did? - If it makes it any easier,

517
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,650
drinks are on you.

518
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,540
All right. I can do one drink.

519
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,520
All right.

520
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,320
I can't believe Callie braved the flight

521
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,260
from New York all the way down to D.C.

522
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,420
Mr. President, what I'm about to tell you

523
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,900
came straight from Corporal Joyner himself.

524
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,890
One the morning of 11/14,

525
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,450
orders came down for MacLeish's unit

526
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,860
to escort an Army major

527
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,370
to a covert meet with an Afghan warlord.

528
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,870
That major's name --

529
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,560
Nestor Lozano, A.K.A. Catalan.

530
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,360
- The man who tried to kill me. - Right.

531
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,740
He was meant to deliver a few duffel bags full of cash.

532
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,590
The meet went south -- warlord took the money

533
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,520
and ordered his men to open fire.

534
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
- It was a bloodbath. - My God.

535
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,650
MacLeish managed to keep his unit together,

536
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,090
and they fought their way out of the compound,

537
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,000
but the warlord pursued.

538
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,910
And they started picking off the unit, one by one.

539
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,340
MacLeish's men went blood-simple.

540
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,460
They shot up everything in their path --

541
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,570
hostiles, friendlies, women, and children.

542
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,440
To MacLeish's men,

543
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,830
the rules of engagement no longer applied.

544
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,300
It was a frenzy --

545
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,640
kill or be killed.

546
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,080
Eventually, Joyner sees Lozano,

547
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,180
shoves a gun in his face, demands to know what happened.

548
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,110
Lozano admits he's a CIA officer

549
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,220
and that the bags were filled with $5 million in cash --

550
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,910
a payoff to fight against the Taliban.

551
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,400
But MacLeish's men decided that

552
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,620
Lozano was going to have to pay for the buddies they lost,

553
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,050
MacLeish jumps in, stops it,

554
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,820
says that he was just following orders.

555
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,210
So, MacLeish saved his life.

556
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,670
If it weren't for MacLeish,

557
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,640
Lozano would've never made it home.

558
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,210
We're worried about you, pal.

559
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,140
Come on. Worried about what? Everything's fine.

560
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,020
Seth, come on. You're working for an amateur.

561
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,300
A nice guy, maybe,

562
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,740
but someone clearly incapable of doing the job.

563
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,740
The nation's not seen this much turmoil since the Civil War.

564
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,820
You're the face of a drowning administration.

565
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,540
The handsome face of a drowning administration,

566
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,860
- I might add. - Thank you.

567
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,830
People think they're not getting the whole story.

568
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,850
They're wondering if there's a connection

569
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,530
between MacLeish and the shooter.

570
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,180
Okay, let me just guess where you're getting that information.

571
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,120
- Teen Mode. - Teen Mode.

572
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,870
Seth, if there is any truth to this Abe Leonard story at all...

573
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,650
You really want to handcuff yourself to a failed presidency?

574
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,950
Guys, enough.

575
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
I don't work at a hedge fund,

576
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,650
I don't work for a white-shoe law firm,

577
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,280
I don't make superhero movies.

578
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,390
I work for the President of the United States.

579
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,290
When your ship's taking on water, you don't jump.

580
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,560
You grab a bucket.

581
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,910
I appreciate the concern.

582
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,930
I love you guys. You know that.

583
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,270
But I have to get back to the White House.

584
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,020
All right? Thanks for flying down.

585
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,530
The mission only explains how Lozano met MacLeish.

586
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,060
And why he owed him.

587
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,230
Right.

588
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,300
My opinion?

589
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,040
This is exactly how MacLeish was radicalized.

590
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,050
The bond with his unit went deeper than even family.

591
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,700
To have his men sent in to slaughter,

592
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,840
on a covert mission with a war criminal,

593
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,500
and then to come back and have their sacrifice...

594
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,840
ignored and erased by a callous government.

595
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,980
The mission that made MacLeish a hero...

596
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,360
turned him into a traitor.

597
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,260
Ward a perimeter around the school before we get there.

598
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,010
We'll be traveling in alone.

599
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,870
Phoenix will not be exiting the vehicle.

600
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,890
Copy that.

601
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,790
Thank you, Mike.

602
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,100
I've seen enough. Let's go back to the White House.

603
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,750
With all that's happened in the past few weeks,

604
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,400
the President is thrilled to have a man of your experience

605
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,590
stepping back into the role of Secretary of State.

606
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,450
Thank you, Ms. Rhodes,

607
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,590
But let me stop you right there.

608
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,720
After discussing it with my advisors,

609
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,260
I'm gonna respectfully take my name out of consideration.

610
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,570
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

611
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,770
Why come in if you had no intention of taking the position?

612
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,400
Out of respect for the President.

613
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,860
I wanted to deliver the news in person.

614
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,040
Well, that won't stop him from being disappointed.

615
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
I'm very sorry.

616
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,640
But I did want to offer a suggestion.

617
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,190
I've spoken to Cornelius Moss,

618
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
and he's willing to make recommendations

619
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,630
on all of your cabinet posts.

620
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,320
President Moss wants to get back into politics?

621
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,490
He just wants to share the benefit of his experience.

622
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,620
Nothing more.

623
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,730
Would President Kirkman be open to that?

624
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,450
So, we'll try it for a month, see how it goes.

625
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,230
Thank you.

626
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,070
What -- What changed your mind?

627
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,990
I went to Penny's school today.

628
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,850
Mike arranged it

629
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,750
so that we could move out of the motorcade a block away

630
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,360
so she wouldn't know we were there.

631
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,620
You know, one of my favorite things to do

632
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,250
before all this happened...

633
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,850
pick her up from school.

634
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,870
I would get there early just to watch her play with her friends.

635
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,050
She doesn't have any anymore.

636
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,230
Other kids aren't allowed near her.

637
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,410
I'm robbing her of her childhood,

638
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,630
and I don't know how to fix that yet,

639
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,670
but anything's got to be better than this.

640
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,210
I agree.

641
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,120
Thank you.

643
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,430
So, where are we at?

644
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,100
Just parsing through the haystack.

645
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,000
Did any ID come back on the guy you took out at Langdon's?

646
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,140
No, I ran it through every database we have --

647
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,770
facial recognition, dental records, fingerprints.

648
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,970
No matches.

649
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,270
Just like the woman who took Luke Atwood.

650
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,750
I mean, to have every shred of your existence

651
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,580
scrubbed from the public record...

652
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,740
these guys are good.

653
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,920
We've got eyes out everywhere for Langdon.

654
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,340
But so far, nothing.

655
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,500
He's out there...

656
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,610
somewhere.

657
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,340
You know, it's like Jason used to say,

658
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,140
we only have to be lucky once.

659
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,370
They have to be lucky all the time.

660
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,750
Hello?

661
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,970
Jason?

662
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,290
Jason, I came to check on you guys.

663
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,490
I hope that's okay.

664
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,850
Where's Yvette?

665
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,010
She's at her sister's in Buffalo.

666
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,840
She said everything about this place reminds her of Luke.

667
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
You know they canned me, right?

668
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,120
They took my badge and my gun.

669
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,070
I'm so sorry, Jason.

670
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,060
I'm an embarrassment to the entire Bureau.

671
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,300
That is not true. Don't even go there.

672
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,670
20-plus years on the job,

673
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,620
and all it took was for her to show me that she had my son.

674
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,440
And all of my training just goes out the window.

675
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,180
Let's make them pay, Jason.

676
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,270
Tell me everything you know about that woman.

677
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,600
We'll find her, and we'll make her pay.

678
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Are you working me?

679
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,220
What are you talking about?

680
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,580
You're working the case.

681
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,220
Jason, no. Come on. Don't. Don't.

682
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,080
No, I want justice for Luke.

683
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,410
Justice?

684
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,270
Justice is not gonna bring my son back.

685
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,000
This is my justice.

686
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,070
I went against everything that I am,

687
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,320
and my son is dead because of it.

688
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,650
You did everything you could. You sacrificed everything.

689
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,930
They did this.

690
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,450
Please leave.

691
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,250
Jason, I want to help.

692
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,840
Get out.

693
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,340
I've had several conversations with Cornelius Moss

694
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,760
since I took office.

695
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,870
He never indicated any desire to get back into politics.

696
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,360
- Not even close. - I know.

697
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,560
After his wife died,

698
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,290
he said he was retiring from public life.

699
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,170
That's why he never ran for a second term.

700
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,740
Great public servant.

701
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,870
And a consummate politician.

702
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,530
I'm just saying, I wouldn't want him

703
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,490
to pull focus from what you're trying to achieve.

704
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,190
No, I appreciate what you're saying.

705
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,950
But he's a president.

706
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,850
Inviting him into the White House could lift the nation,

707
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,740
project a sense of solidarity.

708
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,270
I'll set it up.

709
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,370
Thank you.

710
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,840
Mr. Wright.

711
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,970
Mr. Leonard.

712
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,240
Did you know "Wright" comes from the Old English?

713
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,300
It means "Shaper of wood."

714
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,460
And here I was thinking it meant "Adulterer."

715
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,280
Well, it intrigues me you never knew the meaning

716
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,070
of your last name, considering you picked it.

717
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,490
Is there something I can help you with, Mr. Leonard?

718
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,820
Yeah, I'm curious how the Tribune and the Post

719
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,830
both did stories on my "Return" to journalism

720
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,870
on the exact same day.

721
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,870
You're a Pulitzer winner making a comeback with Teen Mode.

722
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,010
Don't you think that's newsworthy?

723
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,570
And the fact that I lost my credentials from the Herald

724
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,860
due to rogue tactics that border more on extortion

725
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,320
than journalism.

726
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,600
It's public record.

727
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,900
You know that I can't, uh...control what the press pushes out.

728
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,130
No. Of course you can't.

729
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,960
You just read announcements handed to you by the President.

730
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,430
Well, I must say, I-I am actually flattered, so...

731
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,460
To feel somewhat relevant again?

732
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,400
When I was on the debate team at Northwestern,

733
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,880
I learned that discrediting a source

734
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,670
is the oldest trick in the book.

735
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,370
It's bush league, but it's effective

736
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,370
if done properly under two circumstances.

737
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,980
One -- it's a last resort,

738
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,000
and two -- when you're confronted with a truth you can't refute.

739
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,700
Now, I would say "Goodbye" in old English,

740
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,170
but I-I honestly can't pronounce it.

741
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,760
But apparently, it wouldn't matter.

742
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,020
So... adieu, Mr. Wright.

743
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,090
Sir, you really think that's a good idea?

744
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,950
I think the people have every right to know

745
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,150
what MacLeish did with regards to the shooter.

746
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,310
Besides...

747
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,310
I'm not comfortable sitting on the truth anymore.

748
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,510
- Okay, I'll inform the networks. - Thank you.

749
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,230
Do you mind if I take a pass at your remarks?

750
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,780
I was hoping you would.

751
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,500
- Thank you. - Thanks, Seth.

752
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,030
I didn't ask for another one.

753
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,960
Well, it's from the gentleman with the insatiable appetite

754
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,900
for loose women and anything alcoholic.

755
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,190
Hello, Abe.

756
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,710
What do you say, Kimble?

757
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,760
Still drinking that turpentine.

758
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,820
Yeah, read all about it.

759
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,550
I have been.

760
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,050
Rookie move by a dittohead neophyte.

761
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,230
I wouldn't underestimate Seth Wright.

762
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,910
We're dealing with children, Kimble.

763
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,220
Coddled millennials - who wouldn't know a real story

764
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,460
if it bit them in the ass.

765
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,540
Same old Abe.

766
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,860
Well, you must have hit a nerve,

767
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,920
or the White House wouldn't be going to all this trouble

768
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,890
to remind people what a train wreck you are.

769
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,470
I've gotten mocked and ridiculed by better hatchet men than them.

770
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,950
If they think a smear campaign is gonna stop me...

771
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,900
...they got another thing coming.

772
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,730
Still, Kirkman's smart, and he's learning on the job.

773
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,930
I've seen bare-knuckle campaigners

774
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,370
barely make it through a single term as president.

775
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,650
You can't learn on the job. Come on.

776
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,350
It's taken everything in my empty soul

777
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,350
to get back in this game, and there's zero chance

778
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,230
I'm gonna let some amateurs in diapers push me out again.

779
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,660
There's a connection between MacLeish and the shooter,

780
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,520
and I'm gonna find it.

781
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,630
If anything happens, if Penny gets a splinter,

782
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,880
I want to know as soon as possible.

783
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,370
I know. I know.

784
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,490
Listen, we're only an hour away, okay?

785
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,510
I'm gonna get back as often as I can.

786
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,580
Okay.

787
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,430
Leo, you all right with this?

788
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,620
I'll be fine. It's a good call.

789
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
Come here.

790
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,300
I love you.

791
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,570
I love you, too.

792
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,440
And you.

793
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,530
I need you to look after your mom and your brother.

794
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,810
What's this?

795
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,100
The drawing I was working on.

796
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,310
Sweetheart, I was supposed to help you finish it.

797
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm so sorry.

798
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,170
It's okay.

799
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,320
Come here.

800
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,960
I love you so much.

801
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,660
I love you, too.

802
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,520
Okay. Time to get in.

803
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,600
Call me as soon as you get there.

804
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,690
Please.

805
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,390
I love you with all my heart.

806
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,660
Could you take care of yourself, please?

807
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,980
I promise I will.

808
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,150
Bye, guys.

809
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,530
Bye, Daddy.

810
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,990
My fellow Americans...

811
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,710
Due to recent events,

812
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,810
we live in a time of uncertainty,

813
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,930
leaving us with more questions than answers.

814
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,940
Tonight, I hope to put us back on the path

815
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,750
to confidence and strength.

816
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,330
I do not believe that we can survive as a nation

817
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,030
without transparency.

818
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,640
Without truth, there can be no trust.

819
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,500
As your President, I assure you

820
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,530
that I and my administration

821
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,910
will be honest and open on all matters,

822
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,720
regardless of how the truth reflects upon me.

823
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,820
This afternoon, a question was raised by Abe Leonard,

824
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,050
a respected member of our press pool,

825
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,110
which I believe the American people deserve an answer to.

826
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,680
During the search for the man who tried to assassinate me,

827
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,050
Vice President MacLeish

828
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,470
unilaterally issued a shoot-to-kill order

829
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,620
over the strong objections of the FBI

830
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,980
and my Chief of Staff, Aaron Shore.

831
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,360
Because I was in surgery,

832
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,910
I was forced to invoke the 25th Amendment,

833
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,970
giving the Vice President the authority to make such a call.

834
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,680
It's not a call I believe I would have made.

835
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,770
Nonetheless, I respected Peter MacLeish's

836
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,610
experience as a soldier.

837
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,740
He made a split-second decision that he felt protected

838
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,090
not only the federal agents at the scene,

839
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,130
but the general public, as well.

840
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,610
I know this answer will not satisfy everyone.

841
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,170
But this is what happened, and it's how it happened.

842
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,640
In times of crisis,

843
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,640
we must not succumb to cynicism and mistrust.

844
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,510
Instead, we must maintain faith

845
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,620
while embracing reason and truth,

846
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,670
not speculation and rumor.

847
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,240
Again, we can only attain this through transparency.

848
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,960
Believe me,

849
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,720
I know what the American people have been feeling.

850
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,370
I know that there is confusion and fear.

851
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,860
I know that some do not even feel safe leaving their homes.

852
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,510
President Lincoln prophetically cautioned,

853
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,970
"A house divided against itself cannot stand."

854
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,560
We are at a similar crossroads.

855
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,230
But Lincoln did not expect his house to fall,

856
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,910
and neither do I.

857
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,050
The American people must now make the most important decision

858
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,210
they've had to make in generations.

859
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,590
Will we be united in the pursuit of truth and reason?

860
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,870
Or break apart because of conjecture and suspicion?

861
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,370
I trust this nation -- my nation --

862
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,980
to make the right choice.

863
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,900
Thank you, good night,

864
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,650
and God bless America.

865
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,340
And we're clear, Mr. President.

866
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,610
Thank you.

867
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
Aaron.

868
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,980
Langdon.

869
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,250
Not here.

870
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,500
Aaron Shore's made contact with someone.

871
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,560
That's Charles Langdon.
