1
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:03,235
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:07,136
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:10,172
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:13,208
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:16,745
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,847
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:22,084
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:25,487
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:28,891
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,192
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,894
Let me get this straight.

12
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,862
You're the doppelganger
of our Dr. Wells.

13
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,764
Yeah, but that Dr. Wells'
body had been taken over

14
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:38,408
by the Reverse Flash, who
was really Eobard Thawne.

15
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:39,734
Eddie!

16
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:40,969
Stay with me, okay? Stay.

17
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,537
Eddie's his ancestor.

18
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:44,372
If Eddie dies, then Thawne
will never be born.

19
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:46,516
He'll be erased from existence!

20
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,923
Hartley Rathaway. I couldn't have built

21
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,525
the particle accelerator without him.

22
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,760
- Cisco, what did you see?
- I saw Jay.

23
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,236
He's Zoom.

24
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,602
I let it happen again.

25
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,271
I trusted someone I shouldn't have.

26
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,508
Jay Garrick. Zoom.

27
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,177
Just like I trusted Harrison Wells,

28
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,713
or Eobard Thawne.

29
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,682
You see what I mean?

30
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,984
I made the same mistake twice.

31
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,586
I thought they wanted to teach me how

32
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,988
to use my powers, train
me to get faster,

33
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,891
but they didn't come here to help me.

34
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,526
They came to use me

35
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,195
and take everything I love away from me.

36
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:30,697
But no more.

37
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:31,965
I'm gonna crack the code.

38
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:34,100
Figure out how to improve my speed.

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,903
I'm gonna train harder, get
stronger, and run faster

40
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,738
than anyone's ever run before.

41
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:41,707
And then I'm gonna stop Zoom.

42
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,755
Yo.

43
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,975
Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet?

44
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,944
No, sorry. It keeps me motivated.

45
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,555
Well, it's giving me daymares.

46
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,524
This is everything I could find

47
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:05,726
even remotely related
to increasing speed.

48
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,161
How are these supposed to help

49
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,963
apply the speed equation to you?

50
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,699
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

51
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,133
I think I found something interesting.

52
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,735
Good interesting or bad interesting?

53
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,003
'Cause that word could go either way.

54
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,571
After running some comparative data,

55
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,608
it appears that you,
Reverse Flash, and Zoom

56
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:23,544
are moving your legs at
essentially the same speed.

57
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,780
Then why are they so
much faster than him?

58
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,548
Best I can tell, with each stride

59
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,717
their feet spend less
time on the ground,

60
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:31,719
thus propelling them
forward much faster.

61
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:34,955
By almost 30%. Great.

62
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,156
All right, well, I got to make up

63
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,833
that difference somehow.

64
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:42,696
Barry?

65
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:45,666
Look, after what that monster did,

66
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:48,402
I want to stop Jay just
as badly as you do...

67
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:49,970
Right.

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,239
But what if the reason you
haven't been able to run

69
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:56,452
as fast as him yet is
because you just can't?

70
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,052
Barry, you know what happened to
Jay is not your fault, right?

71
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:07,321
Well, I should've known better.

72
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,690
You? With Wells last year,

73
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,024
I should've learned my lesson

74
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:14,929
and dug deeper into
Jay, but... I didn't.

75
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,330
Come on, Joe.

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,299
Point being is nobody saw this coming.

77
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:20,809
Nobody.

78
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:31,345
So I...

79
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:35,248
kind of went on a date.

80
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,350
With who?

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,453
The new editor at CCPN.

82
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,154
Scott Evans.

83
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:42,857
Your boss?

84
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,825
Okay, it wasn't like that.

85
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,027
He's a really nice guy.

86
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:51,507
He's sweet and smart and...

87
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:56,837
What?

88
00:03:56,847 --> 00:04:01,208
It just... it all makes
me think about Eddie.

89
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:04,386
I think about him every day, Barry.

90
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:08,148
It just feels wrong.

91
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,251
I know for a fact that Eddie would
want you to find love again.

92
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,053
Yeah, I know, but...

93
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,263
Look, Iris.

94
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,161
You're the only person who's gonna know

95
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,898
when you're ready to
move on, but until then

96
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:29,102
don't keep yourself completely
closed off, you know?

97
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:32,406
You're gonna miss out
on something great.

98
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,016
Yeah.

99
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,145
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

100
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,821
No, no, you're just in time.

101
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,191
Dad! Mittens!

102
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,721
So... my advisor loved my engine designs

103
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:49,924
and even asked me to
help her out with one

104
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,760
- of her engineering projects.
- Okay, big man on campus.

105
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,361
It's not that big a deal.

106
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,963
It's a great opportunity,
and you should take it

107
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:57,464
because life doesn't give
those out all the time.

108
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,366
Isn't that right, Barry?

109
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:00,601
Yeah.

110
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,235
Yeah. What is the project about?

111
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:03,571
It's trying to push the speed limits

112
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,205
with smaller propulsion systems.

113
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,374
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Where do you even start?

114
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,976
Well, I really like to read the journals

115
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:11,411
of the classic engineers,
so their engine designs,

116
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:13,013
how they increase horsepower,

117
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,215
and learn from the best, I guess.

118
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:16,758
You read their journals?

119
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:20,020
I mean, it's not like I can
just go and talk to Enzo Ferrari

120
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,530
or Ferdinand Porsche
'cause they dead, but...

121
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:28,228
You know, doesn't mean
they can't still teach me.

122
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,563
I got to go.

123
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,198
You haven't even touched your food.

124
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,834
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just...

125
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,936
I just realized the key to a
case I've been working on,

126
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:39,447
so I'm gonna just... thank you, Wally.

127
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,408
Sorry, guys.

128
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:43,811
I'll be... I'll be back later.

129
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,780
That dude gets weirder
every time I see him.

130
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,181
Yeah.

131
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,626
You mean the "old" Harrison Wells?

132
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,252
As in Eobard Thawne?

133
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:54,488
You want him to teach
you how to run faster?

134
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,356
- Oh, that's rich.
- How are you gonna do that?

135
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,525
By running back to a time last year.

136
00:05:58,535 --> 00:05:59,827
And what about the other you,

137
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,261
the one from that other timeline?

138
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:03,130
I'll knock him out with something.

139
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,732
I mean, he's not like
he'll see me coming,

140
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:06,533
and then I'll have Wells teach me.

141
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:08,268
Barry, that's crazy.

142
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,704
Nothing I've read is pointing
me towards a solution,

143
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,640
and if there's anybody
that's figured out

144
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,618
the key to getting faster
without V-9, it's him.

145
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,690
What do you guys think?

146
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,559
Your plan is asinine.

147
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:29,456
Did you find Jesse?

148
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,626
Does it look like I found Jesse?

149
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,728
How many times have you
traveled through time?

150
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,263
- A few.
- Do you have any idea

151
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,765
how many things you could screw up?

152
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:40,067
All I need is one
conversation with Dr. Wells.

153
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,835
- He's not Wells.
- Thawne.

154
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,204
I'm Wells! This man
has been studying you

155
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,940
for 15 years... for 15 years...

156
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,776
and you don't think he's
gonna know who you are?

157
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,678
Barry's pretty good at
impersonating himself.

158
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,245
You should've seen him
over there on Earth-2.

159
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,481
I was like, "Somebody
get this man an Oscar."

160
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,550
He will know, Allen. He will know.

161
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,851
All right, then what
am I supposed to do?

162
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,319
I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?

163
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,854
Do you know the answer to this equation?

164
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,190
If Thawne figures out that it's you,

165
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,025
the timeline will be altered.

166
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:06,660
People can die.

167
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,228
Others could live, and no one will know

168
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:10,297
who or what will be affected,
but I promise you,

169
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:13,433
when you come back,
things will be different.

170
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:16,704
And only you will know what
those differences are.

171
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,572
Well, if that's what I
have to do to stop Zoom,

172
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:20,373
then so be it, because if I don't,

173
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:23,243
and Zoom gets my speed before
I learn how to stop him,

174
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:26,413
everybody I care about,
everybody in this whole city...

175
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:29,124
their world will never
be the same anyway.

176
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,359
Do you really think you can do this?

177
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:41,228
Yeah, I do.

178
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:45,999
When I went back last year
and I saw my mom die,

179
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,601
it didn't affect the timeline.

180
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,737
Yeah, but you haven't
really time traveled

181
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,872
on purpose like this before.

182
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:54,474
I have to do this, you guys.

183
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,810
Okay, let's go for it.

184
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,946
Okay, you're gonna go back to the time

185
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,614
when Wells was distracted by the return

186
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:02,883
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

187
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,152
This is the first time
we found out Wells knew

188
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:08,756
the accelerator might explode,
and we were all angry with him,

189
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,490
so anything that might seem odd

190
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,627
about your behavior Wells
should attribute to that.

191
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:15,428
Also remember:

192
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:18,198
Do not underestimate Hartley.
He almost killed you.

193
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,200
This is a tranq dart that
should knock "old" you out

194
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,803
for about six hours,
which lines up perfectly

195
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:25,105
for when you're going back,
because not much was happening

196
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:28,075
until Hartley attacked the
Cleveland Dam that night,

197
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,978
so that should give you time to
learn what you need and return.

198
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,080
One more thing. You cannot tell us

199
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,816
the truth about Wells, no matter what.

200
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:39,153
You must keep the timeline intact.

201
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:40,821
It's gonna be hard to course correct

202
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,656
if anything gets altered,
so get what you need

203
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,658
and come back, preferably
to this moment,

204
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:47,394
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off some

205
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,671
kind of "12 Monkeys" time
loop you'll never get out of.

206
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:53,267
- No pressure.
- Yeah. Cool.

207
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:57,470
So, we'll see you in, like, two seconds.

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,974
Time travel's so weird.

209
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:04,144
- Godspeed, Barry.
- I'll be fine.

210
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,787
What could go wrong?

211
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,170
Eddie!

212
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,741
Oh, no. I'm too early.

213
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:37,211
You know my name? I know some names too.

214
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,988
This is not a good start.

215
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,583
Caitlyn Snow.

216
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:49,227
Cisco Ramon. Harrison Wells.

217
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:55,955
Something's interfering with his comms.

218
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:56,997
Barry!

219
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,198
Come on! Damn it.

220
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,471
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

221
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,439
Whatever Hartley's using must
be shorting out his comms.

222
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,374
I can hear the radio waves...

223
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,809
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember this.

224
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,243
Emanating from your suit.

225
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:14,612
This could still work.

226
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:16,514
About 1,900 megahertz.

227
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,583
Are they on the other end listening?

228
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:21,318
Will they hear you die?

229
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,220
No. They're gonna hear you...

230
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,897
Get your ass kicked.

231
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,633
Okay.

232
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,810
Is that all it takes to scare you off?

233
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,605
And he chose you over me?

234
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,740
My comms? Who are you?

235
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,651
I don't have time to explain
this to you right now.

236
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,472
I don't understand. You're me.

237
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,801
I'm sorry, but I have to do this.

238
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,178
This'll all make sense eventually.

239
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:25,724
Where are you, oh, chosen one?

240
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,720
Got ya again.

241
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,689
Looks like you're not as
smart as everyone says.

242
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,392
Smart enough to have figured out

243
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,160
who Harrison Wells really is.

244
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,029
You see, I know his secret.

245
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,364
Barry, are you there?

246
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,466
Yeah, yeah, I'm back.

247
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,411
I'm bringing Hartley in.

248
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,113
Scanners picking up foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

249
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,981
- Take 'em out.
- I can't.

250
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,451
I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

251
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,420
My hearing was severely damaged.

252
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,630
Without these, I am in
pain you can only imagine.

253
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,595
Cisco, see if the devices in his ears

254
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:23,367
are generating any low level
electromagnetic pulses.

255
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,769
You want me to scan for E-bombs?

256
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,637
I just... I mean, don't you think

257
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,981
that could've been what was
interfering with the comms?

258
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,112
Well, well.

259
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,147
Trying to go all "Mission:
Impossible" on us?

260
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,711
Use those things to bust out of here?

261
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:41,626
Your silence speaks volumes.

262
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,622
Pump in some sound stimuli
to counteract his tinnitus.

263
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:49,126
Then we'll make some
nonexplosive replacements for him.

264
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,569
Deal with you later.

265
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,110
Take them out, Hartley. Now.

266
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,971
Dr. Wells.

267
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,240
That was quite an observation you had

268
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,976
about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

269
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,222
Yeah, it just seemed too easy
taking him down, you know?

270
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:16,019
Well, the likely reason for that
is you're getting faster.

271
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,955
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

272
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,625
It occurred to me that maybe
we've been going about

273
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,129
improving my speed the wrong way.

274
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,830
How so?

275
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,333
Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved

276
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,935
in running, and I was thinking

277
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,538
that there's just as much
science involved in speed

278
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,573
as anything physical or technical.

279
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,909
I just can't figure out how
to apply it to me when I run.

280
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,913
Thought if anybody could
help me, it'd be you.

281
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:48,352
This is quite the... speed equation

282
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,920
you've concocted here, isn't it, Mr. Al?

283
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,391
Yeah, I've been doing a lot
of reading in my downtime.

284
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:58,728
What on earth inspired
you to adopt such a...

285
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,940
what should we call this...
unorthodox approach?

286
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,171
I just know that I'm not
the fastest man alive,

287
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,706
and I need to be faster, a lot faster,

288
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,584
if I'm ever gonna be able to
take down the Man in Yellow.

289
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,256
So what do you think? Can you help me?

290
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,905
Let me see what I can do.

291
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,311
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

292
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,269
Hey, Joe.

293
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,837
Hey, Eddie.

294
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,206
Must have been a good lunch.

295
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,007
Iris is the first girlfriend
I've ever lived with,

296
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,743
so it's all very new and exciting.

297
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,813
New? Yes. Exciting? No.

298
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,583
Sorry. Somehow I keep
forgetting you're her dad.

299
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,918
Hey, try to remember for both our sakes.

300
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,153
Come here.

301
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,656
I was thinking about what
you said about Wells,

302
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,426
how there's something off about him.

303
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,661
I need you to do something
for me, off the books.

304
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,162
Joe, come on.

305
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,932
Just trust me, Eddie.

306
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,035
Okay. What?

307
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,679
Go back to his house. Search everything.

308
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,756
Someone there?

309
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,423
What the hell?

310
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,094
CCPD.

311
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,498
I'm sure they have it handled, right?

312
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,808
No.

313
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:18,376
You need to go.

314
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,547
Run, Barry.

315
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,942
Is everyone okay?

316
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,642
- Barry.
- Yeah?

317
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:13,186
- You should cover that up.
- Oh, right, yeah.

318
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,515
- Thanks.
- Joe.

319
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,886
No sign of it outside.
It just disappeared.

320
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,388
- Hey, Bar.
- Hey, Eddie.

321
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:27,358
Any idea what that thing could be?

322
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,415
No, I don't know. Not yet.

323
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,317
If I figure it out I'll let you know.

324
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:36,101
Things just keep getting more
and more strange in this city.

325
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,336
Yeah, they do.

326
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,839
I'm gonna check in with Iris,
let her know I'm okay.

327
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,882
- Great.
- All right, see ya, Bar.

328
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,446
What the hell's going on with you?

329
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:50,048
What are you talking about?

330
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,584
Look, I know you told
Iris that you love her,

331
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:57,555
but you said you'd moved past
this whole Eddie and Iris thing.

332
00:17:57,565 --> 00:18:00,892
I have, Joe. I have.

333
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:02,594
Then why are you being
so weird to Eddie?

334
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,562
Okay... look. I'm sorry.

335
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,899
Let me just take care of all this, okay?

336
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,901
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

337
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:12,229
Fine.

338
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,117
But soon.

339
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,685
Soon, yeah.

340
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,084
What's going on?

341
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:28,219
Oh, you know, just trying to figure out

342
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,155
how to find this Dementor
that's apparently

343
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,124
roaming through Central City right now.

344
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:35,360
I assume that was the
cause of the CCPD alarm.

345
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,829
Yeah, actually, it attacked my lab.

346
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,298
- You saw it?
- No, I didn't see it, no.

347
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:42,868
I di... well, I
didn't get there in time,

348
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:45,478
but I have seen it before.

349
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,505
Where?

350
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:50,008
It was earlier today,
actually, when I was running

351
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,951
to take Hartley down.

352
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,846
You're just mentioning this now?

353
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,804
I-I didn't know what it was.

354
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:58,950
I thought it was some sort of illusion.

355
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,451
- I don't know.
- Okay, well, we need to find it

356
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:01,953
before it hurts somebody.

357
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,689
- Can you track it?
- What is it with you guys?

358
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,691
It's like you think I
have ESP or something.

359
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,726
I can't just magically
sense where things are.

360
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:10,128
- What can you do, Cisco?
- I'm thinking I can reconfigure

361
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,503
the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellite to look for it.

362
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,099
it might take some time though.

363
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,466
Do it.

364
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:18,636
In the meantime, Mr.
Allen, come with me.

365
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,138
Have a seat.

366
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:21,973
Is this about the speed equation?

367
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,442
As a matter of fact, it is.

368
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,977
Oh, great. Okay, good.

369
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,469
So you figured it out?

370
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,962
Yes. I've figured it out.

371
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:53,613
Now...

372
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,907
who are you?

373
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:59,945
I mean, who are you really?

374
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:04,216
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

375
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,584
None of it adds up.

376
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:11,322
The interference with the
comms, the speed equation,

377
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,892
the Time Wraith.

378
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:16,561
That's what we call them. Time Wraiths.

379
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:19,364
Scary, aren't they?

380
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:22,234
I thought, "Oh, no, a Time
Wraith has found me."

381
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,202
But then I thought, "No, no, no."

382
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:26,204
You know what you're doing.

383
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:27,773
Now, the Time Wraith is after someone

384
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:32,110
who's travelled through time...

385
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,955
and doesn't know what they're doing.

386
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,886
Dr. Wells, come on. It's me.

387
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,788
It's... it's Barry. I don't...

388
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:44,222
Really?

389
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:47,492
You are good.

390
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,903
You are good, and I would
believe you, except that...

391
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,100
Nothing?

392
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,244
I move like this, you barely flinch.

393
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,716
You know who I am.

394
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:09,355
Don't you?

395
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:14,286
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

396
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:15,854
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen

397
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:18,998
how to phase through objects... yet.

398
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:26,139
Let me out of here, Thawne.

399
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:34,739
I know. You're upset.

400
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:37,508
But it does me good to
hear that name again.

401
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:40,912
Now, onto the bigger question.
Why are you here?

402
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:45,884
Because I want to go faster, and you're
the only one who can teach me.

403
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,753
You're the only one who's
figured out the equation.

404
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,689
The Speed Force.

405
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:54,226
You've manipulated it.

406
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:55,668
How did you do that?

407
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:06,037
No.

408
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:08,874
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

409
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:12,510
No.

410
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,114
You'd only come here if
something went wrong.

411
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:20,793
If you're still alive,
then that means...

412
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:31,329
I haven't beaten you.

413
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,367
If you're still alive...

414
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:40,138
that means my plan fails.

415
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:43,474
And if my plan fails,

416
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:46,477
I don't get to go home, and if
that's the case, well, then...

417
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,413
No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey!
It's the opposite!

418
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:49,781
It's the opposite!

419
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,816
It... you trick me.
You harness my speed.

420
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,851
We turn on the accelerator
to create a path

421
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,287
for you to go home.

422
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:57,522
I go back in time.

423
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,158
You go back to yours.

424
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,068
You won.

425
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:06,398
Yeah.

426
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:10,168
Then why are you here?
Why are you here now?

427
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,371
Because when I got back, a
singularity had formed.

428
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:15,440
And now the only way for me
to learn how to get faster

429
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,177
and stop the singularity from
happening was to come here.

430
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,912
Now.

431
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:22,922
Well, that's good to know.

432
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:32,765
There's just...

433
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:39,572
Just one thing that occurs to me.

434
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,469
I don't need you.

435
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:47,672
Do I?

436
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:50,683
Not this you certainly.

437
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:56,248
You probably should've thought of that...

438
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:58,083
before you came back here.

439
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,051
Shame...

440
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:04,356
You ran all the way back here

441
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,724
just to die.

442
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:10,161
You kill me... Barry...

443
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:12,998
this Barry, your Barry,

444
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:15,533
he learns it all.

445
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:18,536
There's a hidden letter
telling him how it ends,

446
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:22,307
how to beat you, everything.

447
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:26,486
Anything happens to me, you
never make it back home.

448
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,950
Go on.

449
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,686
Kill me, Thawne.

450
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,363
See how this all ends.

451
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:54,364
Now...

452
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:57,315
you're gonna help me get faster.

453
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,358
Please.

454
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:10,855
I want to know how these work.

455
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,865
I'll tell you, just kill the music.

456
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,909
- Thanks.
- The gauntlets, Hartley.

457
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,419
What kind of frequency is this?

458
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,329
Cisco, it's here!

459
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,210
- It's coming!
- Inside the cell, now!

460
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,485
Sorry. What's coming?

461
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:26,044
Holy Harry Potter.

462
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,109
Okay.

463
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,314
Well, isn't this fantastic?

464
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:29,881
Look, we're gonna be safe in here.

465
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:30,924
These cells are...

466
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,687
Impenetrable?

467
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:37,339
Barry! Dr. Wells!

468
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,540
All right. We have to help them.

469
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,976
You let it track you here.

470
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,777
Get me out of here! Come on!

471
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:45,014
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

472
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,282
you're all dead.

473
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,519
- Where are they?
- Okay, let's step back.

474
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,955
- You'll shatter the glass.
- You got a better plan?

475
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,690
As a matter of fact, give me those.

476
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,958
No!

477
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:59,495
- Now, Cisco!
- What are you gonna do?

478
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:01,597
These cells have speakers linked
throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

479
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,599
- Yes, and?
- I rigged these gauntlets

480
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:06,644
to emit a destructive signal
if ever they're disarmed.

481
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,606
If I can just find the right frequency

482
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,908
of whatever the hell that thing
is, well, let's just say

483
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,819
you'll be glad you're in here with me.

484
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:37,099
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

485
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:40,169
It's all right, Inky's gone.
I don't see anything.

486
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,637
You know, we'd be toasted

487
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,305
if wasn't for Hartley
and those gauntlets.

488
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,240
Well, self-preservation is
a very strong motivator,

489
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,409
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

490
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,244
- Okay, I'm just saying.
- So the two places

491
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:51,814
this thing has attacked
are here and CCPD.

492
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:54,316
- The common denominator being...
- Me. Yeah, I know.

493
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:55,885
I just... I don't know why.

494
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:58,253
Well, you must have done
something to piss him off.

495
00:27:58,263 --> 00:28:00,022
- Satellite hasn't found anything.
- We need to find

496
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:01,724
a more permanent solution
to this problem.

497
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:03,693
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

498
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:05,728
That's about as good
a first step as any.

499
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:09,039
- I got some parts for it.
- Let's go for it.

500
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,400
You don't know how to
stop a Time Wraith?

501
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,701
None of us do. That's why we
always try and avoid them in our travels.

502
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,203
"We"?

503
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:15,938
Speedsters... we're not the
only two out there, you know?

504
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:17,606
This isn't the first
time I've time traveled.

505
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,075
How come I've never seen
one of these until now?

506
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:21,310
Because you ran out of luck.

507
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,579
And Time Wraiths hate it when speedsters

508
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:25,781
manipulate the timeline, and
now that thing's gonna do

509
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,958
everything it can to end you.

510
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:31,353
Here's what we're gonna do.

511
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,422
You're gonna go to CCPD.
You're gonna see what you

512
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,524
can find to help us stop this thing...
I'll do the same here.

513
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:37,126
Well, what am I supposed
to be looking for?

514
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:38,594
You're in forensics.
Figure something out.

515
00:28:38,604 --> 00:28:41,230
Hey, what about the equation?
Me getting faster?

516
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,298
If we don't stop this thing,
there's gonna be no point

517
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,875
in me teaching you anything.

518
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:53,075
No trace elements, no prints,

519
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:56,645
no sign that it was ever
here except the whole mess.

520
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:58,355
Any idea what it was looking for?

521
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,449
- Me.
- What, why?

522
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,551
It doesn't like something that I did.

523
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,561
And what exactly would that be?

524
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,963
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

525
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:12,928
Hey, Eddie, do you have a second?

526
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:14,864
I kind of got to go check
out a lead for Joe.

527
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:16,832
Okay, actually this is
for Iris's birthday.

528
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,068
That's two months from now.

529
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:20,636
Yeah, no, I know. You're right.

530
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:23,472
I just... I want to make
a video montage for her,

531
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:26,508
just everybody in her life and
how her being in your life

532
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:29,444
- has made it better.
- That sounds great, yeah.

533
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:32,081
- I'll think of something to say.
- Can we do it now?

534
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,983
Barry, I really got to go do this thing.

535
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:35,384
I-I know. I really...

536
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,186
it's just I kind of
have to get it today.

537
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:38,720
- Sure.
- All right, great.

538
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,323
Just... just speak from the heart.

539
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
Talk as if... talk as if

540
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:47,462
it was the last thing you
could ever say to her.

541
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:48,638
Okay.

542
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:52,668
Go ahead.

543
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:55,250
What does Iris mean to me?

544
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,841
So can these gauntlets be salvaged?

545
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:00,609
Their electron guns are fried.

546
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,011
So it shorted the wave tubes...

547
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,412
And destroyed the amplifiers.

548
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:05,080
Yeah, but to be honest with you,

549
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,683
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

550
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:10,627
Hartley would know. He's
the one who did it.

551
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,891
See if he can help, but
he stays in the cell.

552
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,893
But then what? That
thing's gonna come back.

553
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,896
I don't know.

554
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:24,241
Where is he? Where's the other Flash?

555
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,002
Right here.

556
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:41,553
Okay. Not how I expected
today to turn out.

557
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:42,385
Yeah.

558
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,401
Okay, so I'm... who are... who are you?

559
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,002
Who is he? Who are you?

560
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,472
What do you... I'm Barry. I'm Barry.

561
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,940
- Your Barry. He's...
- Your doppelganger.

562
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,310
No, not yet.

563
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,512
I am you, Barry.

564
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,481
Just... different.

565
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:59,883
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

566
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:03,333
Dude, okay, I've watched
"Wrath of Khan" with you like five times

567
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:04,254
Imposter!

568
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:06,490
Yeah, and every time at the end,
you turn to me and you say,

569
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,000
"I have been and always
shall be your friend."

570
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:12,962
You, imposter!

571
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,665
What is going on here?

572
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,367
Okay, guys, I'm sorry. This
was not supposed to happen.

573
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,535
The tranq dart that Caitlin made

574
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,903
was supposed to last a lot longer.

575
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,172
I did not give him a tranq dart.

576
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,473
Okay, no, yes, not you,

577
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:27,143
the you from the time that I am from.

578
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,612
The time that you are from?

579
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,180
I think what he's trying to say

580
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,981
is he's from the future.

581
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,149
- The future?
- Yeah.

582
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,318
- The future?
- Yes.

583
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:37,137
- Wait, the future?
- Yes.

584
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,963
Are we saying I can time-travel?

585
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:42,490
One day.

586
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,528
Oh, that explains the
white on the symbol.

587
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:45,762
Well, wait a second.

588
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:47,331
Suppose we now change your emblem.

589
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,999
Will it be because we
got the idea from this?

590
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,168
- Or, I mean, that would mean...
- Stop talking.

591
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,770
You stop talking too, all right?

592
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,806
More you say, the more the
timeline is disrupted.

593
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:57,474
Now I'm going to assume
that your presence here

594
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,309
is the reason that
thing is attacking us.

595
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,610
What? What thing?

596
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,346
Have you ever seen "The Frighteners"?

597
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,614
It's sort of like that,
but scarier and faster

598
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:06,216
and it's after you... after him.

599
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,752
Yeah, it's been chasing
me ever since I got here.

600
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,119
Okay, so how do we stop it?

601
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,955
We don't know.

602
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:14,666
- Then what are we gonna do?
- The one thing we can.

603
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,264
What? What are we doing here?

604
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:25,034
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation...

605
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,872
the reason that you
traveled back to this time,

606
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,983
and the key to running faster.

607
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,780
Tachyon enhancement.

608
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,483
This was not the deal.

609
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,051
If you think that I'm
gonna hold your hand

610
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,120
this entire way, you're sadly mistaken.

611
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,289
Everything you need is on this drive.

612
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,558
You follow its instructions,
you will enhance

613
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:52,629
the Speed Force in your
system and run faster...

614
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,305
than you ever thought possible.

615
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:00,682
If this doesn't work...

616
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:01,966
I'm coming back.

617
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,848
Dr. Wells, we need you.

618
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:09,353
Time to go home, Flash.

619
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,751
Okay, our satellite has finally found

620
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:16,586
our floating friend
and it's coming back.

621
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:18,755
- You need to go.
- I need to know how to stop it.

622
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,224
- Barry...
- Not now. When I get back.

623
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,393
You guys have a year to figure it out.

624
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:26,663
Okay. We'll figure something out.

625
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,133
Cisco, come here.

626
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:32,602
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

627
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:33,645
- Okay?
- What?

628
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:36,339
It's coming.

629
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,641
You need to leave now.

630
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:38,650
Yeah.

631
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:57,802
Thank you.

632
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,812
Barry, here it comes.

633
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,926
It's not working. It's slowing him down.

634
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:32,863
Not for long.

635
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:34,105
No! Barry!

636
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,066
Cool.

637
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,670
- It's coming!
- Did you even go?

638
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,772
- The Time Wraith.
- That's a good name.

639
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,973
Looks like that's a yes.

640
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:19,383
Did you figure out how to stop it?

641
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,757
Damn! We thought so!

642
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:33,731
Barry!

643
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,141
I suddenly realized.

644
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,377
Low frequency, high intensity.

645
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,946
I knew that.

646
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:58,623
Oh, hey, Barry. How was your trip?

647
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:09,982
So aside form the fact that a
Time Wraith came over here

648
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,999
and nearly killed us, how did it go?

649
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:13,267
It was interesting.

650
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,802
Good interesting or bad interesting?

651
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:15,870
'Cause that could go either way.

652
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,047
So far so... good.

653
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:21,542
The road from Earth to
the stars is not easy.

654
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:23,110
How many times do we have
to tell you, Hartley?

655
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,045
Ever since Evil Wells got
erased from existence,

656
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:27,482
no one speaks Latin around here anymore.

657
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:29,751
Well, as always, it's
been a pleasure working

658
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:31,853
with you all on this little project.

659
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:34,188
If you need anything in
the future, call me.

660
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:35,322
I'm off to a late dinner.

661
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:37,859
Dinner. Anyone special?

662
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,301
Very.

663
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:41,502
My parents.

664
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,232
So? You got me on pins
and needles over here.

665
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:46,601
What about the speed equation?

666
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:48,068
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

667
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:50,780
Well, let's see.

668
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,989
Maybe it's password protected?

669
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,886
Are you kidding me?

670
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,655
After everything I just went through...

671
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:09,565
this doesn't even work!

672
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:21,610
We got it.

673
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,964
- Hey.
- Hey.

674
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:30,277
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

675
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:31,946
Altough it turns out it's easier to find

676
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:35,424
a two-ton gorilla on this earth
than a teenage daughter.

677
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:40,321
I don't know what I've done.

678
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,557
You did what you thought you had to do.

679
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:43,991
You risked your life to save her.

680
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,761
You brought her here to
protect her from Zoom.

681
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:49,738
You acted like a father.

682
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:52,307
"Like a father."

683
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:55,636
You know, my wife had to...

684
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:57,972
she had to talk me into having kids.

685
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:02,944
Kids, you know, they're...
they're small, loud, run around.

686
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:05,780
All I needed was my science and my job

687
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,616
for my joy and happiness.

688
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:14,188
And then...

689
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,592
the moment we had her...

690
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:21,596
all that I wanted was her love.

691
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:24,799
Now, I don't know if I'll
ever see that again.

692
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:28,302
It seems every decision
I've made lately has...

693
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:30,605
backfired on me.

694
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,507
You just have to trust
that, in the long run,

695
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:34,016
you made the right ones.

696
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,119
- Hey.
- Hey.

697
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:48,155
I put your plate from
dinner in the fridge.

698
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:49,598
Thanks.

699
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,309
It's been almost a year already.

700
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,178
Can you believe that?

701
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:13,956
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

702
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:19,428
Question is, when will you?

703
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:28,495
I don't know, Barry.

704
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:31,632
Well... I found something

705
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:35,335
that I think might help.

706
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:38,906
I was putting together
this little video montage

707
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:44,078
for your birthday last year
with everybody, and...

708
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,353
everything happened.

709
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:48,950
But... take a look.

710
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,753
I think it might help.

711
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,663
Okay.

712
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:00,102
What does Iris mean to me?

713
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,766
You know, a lot of times
I have a hard time

714
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:07,534
figuring out what to say to people,

715
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:11,438
but when it comes to you, Iris, I don't.

716
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:15,810
Because with you, everything
that used to feel tough

717
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,878
just doesn't anymore.

718
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:21,082
It's one of the things I love about you.

719
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,850
You don't need me.

720
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,652
You can handle anything on your own

721
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:29,957
because you're fearless
and independent...

722
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:32,835
loving, kind.

723
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,197
You are without question

724
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:41,035
the best decision I
ever made, Iris West.

725
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:45,006
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me

726
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:49,677
because each day with you is a gift.

727
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,946
So, thank you.

728
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,447
You deserve the world, Iris.

729
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,516
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life,

730
00:40:55,526 --> 00:41:00,354
and no one wants that
more for you than me.

731
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:04,366
Happy birthday, baby. I love you.

732
00:41:07,237 --> 00:41:08,771
I love you too.

733
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:16,170
Sometimes the only way to move forward

734
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,039
is to revisit the things in your past

735
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:20,550
that were holding you back.

736
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,877
You have to deal with them head on,

737
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:25,780
no matter how scary they may be.

738
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,648
Because once we do, you'll see

739
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:30,525
that you can go further
than you ever imagined.

740
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,633
I'm coming for you.
