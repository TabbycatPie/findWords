1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:02,121
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:04,891
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,700
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:11,703
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:14,820
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,209
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,079
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,949
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,265
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,262
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:29,697
I stabbed your mother in the heart

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,232
and I was free.

13
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,667
Eddie is his ancestor.

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,201
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

15
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:36,170
He's being erased from existence.

16
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:37,872
- Gideon?
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

17
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,607
- Where the hell am I?
- I was accepted

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,732
into the forensic science program
at Midway City University.

19
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:43,889
I'm leaving Central City.

20
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,358
Joe, you have a son.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,293
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

22
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,894
These races? That's the only way

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,529
that I can pay for my
mom's hospital bills.

24
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,398
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,633
Daddy? Please help me.

26
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,101
Don't let him take me back there.

27
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,570
I would do anything to get you back.

28
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,742
There are many reasons why we run,

29
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:06,412
but usually it's to avoid
what's right in front of us...

30
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,713
A decision to be made

31
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,815
or a dilemma we have to face.

32
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:14,654
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

33
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:16,222
What you got for me, Cisco?

34
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,257
You've been playing Good
Samaritan all morning.

35
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,625
Take a break.

36
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,661
Are you sure you don't
want to get to CCPD,

37
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:24,015
- give Patty your attention?
- No, I can see her later.

38
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:25,731
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

39
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,066
What, 'cause we've just been

40
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,734
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

41
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,302
I don't know what you been
sipping since I got here,

42
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,271
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

43
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:34,507
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

44
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,941
Oh, I see.

45
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,677
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

46
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,445
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

47
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,880
Don't. Don't.

48
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:44,083
Don't.

49
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,821
Runaway chemical transport
truck heading south on Kester.

50
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,089
On it.

51
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,008
Hey, I can't stop the truck!

52
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,510
Somebody rigged it!

53
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,845
Sorry!

54
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,480
You can't let that truck crash.

55
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,915
If you do, you'll take
out a whole city block.

56
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,116
Great. Thank you.

57
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,385
Thank you for that.

58
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,190
That was close, that was close.

59
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,625
Oh, and the plot thickens.

60
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,993
Dead-end up ahead.

61
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,195
You got to get out of there!

62
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,321
Oh, come on.

63
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,109
Yes!

64
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,352
That one was a little close.

65
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:56,796
Nice! Now can you please,
please take a break?

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,727
- How's that for training?
- Great.

67
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:02,528
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,363
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

69
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,365
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

70
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,268
Zoom's speed and then we'll
get your daughter back.

71
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,570
That might take longer than we thought.

72
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:12,572
Why's that?

73
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,673
Because Turtle's dead.

74
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,979
Barry, we need you back here stat.

75
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,347
All right. I'm on my way.

76
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,486
Gideon.

77
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,523
Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?

78
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,626
I believe it was. I've finally figured
out what time period The Flash is from.

79
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,642
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

80
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,130
- sync and corrections by Caio -
<b><font color="#32a615">WEB-DL resync by</font> kinglouisxx</b>
- www.addic7ed.com -

81
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,481
He better not be pulling a Juliet.

82
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,541
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

83
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,444
- He's dead, Cisco.
- How'd this happen?

84
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:55,514
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

85
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:58,450
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

86
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:01,587
What does that mean? You
think I did this, Garrick?

87
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,023
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom,

88
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,324
the key to me saving my daughter.

89
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,759
Why would I want that?

90
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,727
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

91
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,829
That's fine with me, Garrick.

92
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:13,083
Guys, look.

93
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,434
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.

94
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,336
Everything we've tried so far has failed.

95
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:18,971
We need to start thinking
outside the box.

96
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:20,272
I mean, we haven't even figured out how

97
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:21,573
to close the breaches yet.

98
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,008
Maybe that's where we should start.

99
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,376
That's a good idea.

100
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,278
- I'll get on that.
- I'll help.

101
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,615
I've got to get to the CCPD.

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,606
I'll check in with you guys later.

103
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,631
Okay.

104
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,888
Every time you think that
Wells is on your team,

105
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,568
something happens that
makes you doubt it.

106
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,296
Hey, I just wanted to see if you
could run this trace for me.

107
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,632
Someone messed with an ethanol
transport truck this morning.

108
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,654
They cut the brake line and
tampered with the gear shafts.

109
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,216
Okay, yeah.

110
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,829
Okay.

111
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,746
Wow. Backed up, huh?

112
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,731
I am, yeah.

113
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,612
Yeah, I guess I'll find
out what that's like

114
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,147
once I finish CSI school.

115
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:03,427
Yeah, you will.

116
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,971
- Yeah.
- I guess.

117
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,487
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

118
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:11,075
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

119
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:16,974
What did you think
it was gonna be like?

120
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:21,200
I ju... I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

121
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,102
You're moving. I don't know.

122
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:27,241
I mean, it just doesn't feel like
there's much to talk about now, right?

123
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:29,911
I guess not.

124
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,114
Hi.

125
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,630
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,789
I sort of overheard some of that.

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,627
Patty's going to CSI
school in Midway City.

128
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,929
She's moving in two days.

129
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,965
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

130
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,500
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.

131
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,169
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

132
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:57,837
Hey.

133
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,608
What's wrong?

134
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,341
Just went to see Francine and...

135
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,812
she doesn't have much time.

136
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,575
I already said my good-byes, if...

137
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,841
If you want to do the same.

138
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,021
It's not gonna work.

139
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:27,435
Closing the breaches, that's
like solving Einstein's riddle.

140
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,693
I solved Einstein's
riddle when I was ten.

141
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,303
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein

142
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:32,704
wasn't as clever as ours.

143
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,638
You realize this Earth
is my Earth-2, right?

144
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:38,044
Listen to this.

145
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:42,948
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

146
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,150
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

147
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:47,519
That's a good idea. You
should get on that.

148
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,021
I need your help, Harry.

149
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,789
What you need, Ramon,

150
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,524
is to figure out what
triggers your vibes.

151
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,560
Exactly, and I don't
know what triggers them.

152
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,295
It's completely inconsistent.
Sometimes it's when I touch

153
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:59,464
something that belongs to a breacher,
sometimes it just happens.

154
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,800
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.

155
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,335
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

156
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,604
Okay, so what is the cause?

157
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,139
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,

158
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:10,259
when I tried to vibe you,
took a while to work.

159
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,146
Yes.

160
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:15,915
Yes, it did.

161
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:17,685
Meet me in the Time Vault.

162
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,208
For what?

163
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,861
Hello?

164
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,411
Hello?

165
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,365
Harry?

166
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,542
Of course, now he's gonna make me wait

167
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:46,745
in this freaky-ass braille room.

168
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,383
Hi, Cisco.

169
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:53,452
Stop! Don't do that!

170
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:56,786
I figured out your trigger.

171
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,457
A rush of adrenaline.

172
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,833
Dopamine floods the brain.

173
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,167
And the quickest way to
achieve that result...

174
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,405
Fear!

175
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,442
Do not move!

176
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:18,444
You can't be.

177
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:33,492
What did you see?

178
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:36,561
The Reverse-Flash.

179
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,563
He's here.

180
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,626
Oh, my God!

181
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:52,861
Christina McGee.

182
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,241
Who are you?

183
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,543
You're coming with me.

184
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:58,577
Flash.

185
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,829
Eobard Thawne.

186
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,914
You know who I am?

187
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,916
You died!

188
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,718
Good to know.

189
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,586
And guess what, Flash.

190
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,947
I know what time period you're from.

191
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:15,694
So that means very soon... you will die.

192
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,275
No.

193
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,431
You okay, Bar?

194
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,246
I'm good, yeah. It's just a lot.

195
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,616
Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne

196
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,586
should have been erased
out of existence, right?

197
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:42,205
Not necessarily.

198
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:44,890
It's possible Eobard was
in the Speed Force,

199
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:47,326
protecting him like a bomb shelter,

200
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,061
keeping him alive and
his time line intact.

201
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:51,130
It's what's known as a
"time line remnant"

202
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,631
A what now?

203
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,334
Here, let me... show you.

204
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,136
This?

205
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,006
This... is now.

206
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,775
Here, today.

207
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:06,445
This is the time Thawne comes from.

208
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:10,583
This is the moment you all
erased him from existence,

209
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,985
but since Thawne is from the future,

210
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,121
this is where his time line begins.

211
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,923
That's why he's still alive.

212
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,658
This Thawne has not yet traveled back

213
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,260
in time to kill Barry's mother.

214
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,429
He's here now in this time
period for the first time.

215
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,997
"Time line remnant."

216
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,699
Explains why nothing's changed.

217
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,009
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

218
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,047
or that we have met before.

219
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:33,138
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

220
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,642
If Thawne dies before he
can time travel again,

221
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:38,010
will that save Barry's mother?

222
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,579
No. That's not how it works.

223
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,982
In our time line, Barry's
mother is already dead,

224
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,350
and her death is a fixed point.

225
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,618
Nothing can change that.

226
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,386
All right, well, I'm gonna end this,

227
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:49,488
him, in this time once and for all.

228
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,490
Let's find Dr. McGee,
then we'll figure out

229
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:54,193
what to do about Thawne, okay?

230
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,362
I got to go check on Iris.

231
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:59,689
Ramon.

232
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,604
Caitlin, I know you're
worried about Dr. McGee,

233
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:07,172
but we're gonna get her back.

234
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:09,064
It's not that. It's Jay.

235
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:10,242
What about Jay?

236
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,045
He's sick, and it's getting worse.

237
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,581
When Zoom stole his speed,

238
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,751
it affected him on a cellular level.

239
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,587
We need to do something about it.

240
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:21,987
All right, like what?

241
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,890
I think we should replace his dying cells

242
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,611
with healthy ones
indistinguishable from his.

243
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,662
How do we do that?

244
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:32,097
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

245
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,634
There.

246
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,069
Tachyons?

247
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,905
A man in a yellow suit tried to steal

248
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,475
another tachyon prototype last year.

249
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,477
I must have gotten stuck here once before

250
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,914
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

251
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,215
Tachyons should do it.

252
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,650
I want you to isolate and accelerate

253
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,285
their energetic properties for me.

254
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:54,853
I don't know if I can do that.

255
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:03,429
If you want to stay alive...

256
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,797
learn.

257
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,548
Franny.

258
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,822
Hey.

259
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,180
How you feeling today?

260
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,306
Better now.

261
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,181
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

262
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:29,595
Okay.

263
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,232
Can I get you anything?

264
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,267
Oh, just that brother of yours

265
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,697
so all of us can be together
for the first time.

266
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,853
Yeah, he should be here.

267
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,103
His mother is leaving him.

268
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:55,236
Can't blame him for
being angry about that.

269
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,087
I just wish he'd get all that anger out

270
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:00,040
while I'm here to help.

271
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,251
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

272
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,325
One thing you learn when you're dying

273
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,587
is not to hold anything back.

274
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,606
You want to say something to me?

275
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,169
You need to say it while you can.

276
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,853
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

277
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,485
Now when I think about those memories,

278
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,320
I can only wonder what
it would have been like

279
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,369
if you and Wally would have been there.

280
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm not angry at
you anymore for what happened.

281
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:48,467
I just wish you would have
come back to us a lot sooner.

282
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:52,733
Because I would have forgiven you then...

283
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,545
just like I'm forgiving you now.

284
00:13:58,913 --> 00:13:59,878
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,241
Thank you. Thank you.

286
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,965
I don't know why this is so hard.

287
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,667
I barely even know her.

288
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,109
The facial recognition
software at S.T.A.R. Labs

289
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,611
didn't find anything either.

290
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,646
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

291
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,081
We'll find his doppelganger.

292
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,449
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

293
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,271
Hey. Hi, Caitlin.

294
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,421
Hi.

295
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,755
Can we... talk?

296
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,390
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

297
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,359
I'll let you know what I find.

298
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:48,615
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:50,819
What's up?

300
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:54,299
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

301
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,646
Yeah, um, uh, yeah.

302
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:01,153
Joe and I help out every once in a while.

303
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:02,473
Really?

304
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,576
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,

305
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:08,395
but there's a lot of weird
stuff that happens over there.

306
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,606
Is that what you came to tell me?

307
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,067
You're just rolling with the
whole "me leaving" thing.

308
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,464
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Patty.

309
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,968
Everyone in my life that I
love leaves at some point.

310
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,803
Kind of getting used to it.

311
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,688
You... never told me you loved me.

312
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,645
Yeah, I guess I don't
get that chance now.

313
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,772
I don't understand.

314
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,750
What is it? What's going on with you?

315
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:46,351
Why are you being like this?

316
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:49,254
My life is complicated,
and I don't want you

317
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,589
to have regrets, all right?

318
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:52,391
I don't want you to miss out

319
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,493
on something that you've
always wanted to do.

320
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,897
And I wish that things were different

321
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,507
for both of us.

322
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,858
You know, but they're not.

323
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,205
Sorry.

324
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,375
Me too.

325
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,092
So what did you do to my goggles?

326
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:29,595
I added a wavelength trigger

327
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:33,031
to stimulate the fear
receptors in your brain.

328
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,201
Then I took what you already
had to induce slow-wave sleep,

329
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,370
upgraded it to get you
to stage-four sleep.

330
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,738
No, this is good.

331
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,568
- This will give us more control.
- Okay.

332
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,242
Now I'll be able to dictate
how long you vibe for.

333
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:45,866
Put 'em on.

334
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:47,512
What am I gonna see?

335
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,514
I don't know. Never done this before.

336
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,366
You'll have to tell me so I can
steer you where you need to be.

337
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,038
Ramon, you want to find Reverse-Flash,

338
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,475
put on the goggles.

339
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,882
- Okay.
- Attaboy.

340
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,402
Go ahead.

341
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:20,345
Oh-ho-ho, yeah, man.

342
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,714
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

343
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,983
- What do you see?
- It's hard to explain.

344
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,952
It's different events.

345
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,787
Different events in time.

346
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,490
Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash.

347
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,625
Okay.

348
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,896
I see him.

349
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:40,098
Move toward him.

350
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:44,069
Okay, now what?

351
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:48,674
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

352
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,643
Where the hell am I?

353
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:54,980
It's charged. You can go now.

354
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:57,049
You said you'd release me.

355
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:59,618
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

356
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,496
No!

357
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,285
Well, what is it?

358
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:14,278
She's dead.

359
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:20,593
Dr. McGee is dead?

360
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:26,491
Harry and I were trying to
hone my powers to find Zoom,

361
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,973
and then we ended up using them,
finding The Reverse-Flash,

362
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,726
and that's when I saw him kill her.

363
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,062
And then he left.

364
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:35,864
He left? What do you mean, he left?

365
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,500
McGee built him some
kind of speed machine

366
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:41,269
and he ran into and got
flung back to the future.

367
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,307
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

368
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,576
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

369
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:51,112
We can track their location
once they've been activated.

370
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,117
Anything? Nothing.

371
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,053
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

372
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,654
- I'm positive.
- All right.

373
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:01,156
What else did you see?

374
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:02,958
There was all sorts of
weird tech everywhere.

375
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,292
There was a clock.

376
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:07,963
What time did the clock say?

377
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:09,497
9:52, I think.

378
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,799
How... how is that relevant?

379
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:14,302
It's 6:00 now.

380
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:16,271
Are you telling me I can see the future?

381
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:17,772
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

382
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,608
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

383
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,409
But that means Dr. McGee is alive.

384
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,111
- That's right.
- Yeah, okay.

385
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:26,181
We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to
find her and stop Reverse-Flash.

386
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,449
Let's do it.

387
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,654
- Spivot.
- Hey.

388
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,422
Can't get away from
those case files, huh?

389
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,625
Oh, just following up on a hunch.

390
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,507
You're gonna miss the action, right?

391
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,420
Maybe. A little.

392
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,717
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Miss you too.

393
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:47,936
- It's nice to know someone will.
- Wait, we talking about Barry?

394
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,038
'Cause it sounds like we're
talking about Barry.

395
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,007
He kept telling
me there was stuff

396
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,043
he couldn't share with me and
I've been going a little crazy

397
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,811
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

398
00:19:56,813 --> 00:20:00,085
Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.

399
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,851
- Neither are you.
- What do you mean?

400
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,886
Barry just told me that, you know,

401
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,657
sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R.
Labs stuff.

402
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,259
Yeah, he does when he has
a few extra minutes.

403
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,694
I didn't know that.

404
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,729
I mean, the whole time
I've been working here

405
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:19,668
you never mentioned it to me,
but then I realized why.

406
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,404
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

407
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:25,707
All of them involved The
Flash saving the day

408
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:30,712
with details that Barry couldn't
have possibly even known.

409
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,081
That's weird.

410
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,032
Yeah, it... It is weird.

411
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,607
The only thing that does make sense

412
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,390
is that Barry is The Flash.

413
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:43,661
Have you ever seen Barry run?

414
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,328
He waddles like a slow-ass duck.

415
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,996
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

416
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,531
You know, when I started this job,

417
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:52,467
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

418
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,602
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

419
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:57,974
See you.

420
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,383
Nice nitrous kit.

421
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:09,851
You're gonna get caught
one of these days.

422
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,725
You know that, right? Get thrown in jail?

423
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:15,225
I'll stop racing when these
hospital bills stop coming in.

424
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,879
I saw Mom today. She says you
haven't been by in a while.

425
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,061
Yeah, she knows why.

426
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,863
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

427
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,199
I have every right to be angry.

428
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,601
Nothing for 20 years,
then out of nowhere,

429
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,670
she tells me I have a sister, I have...
I have a father.

430
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:31,072
Yeah, the same thing happened
to me too, remember?

431
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:32,741
But that shouldn't keep
you from seeing her

432
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,077
before you can't anymore.

433
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,845
No. Look... that's not what it is.

434
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,652
Then what is it, Wally?

435
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:40,182
I got to go.

436
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,811
Last year, my fiancé died...

437
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,490
unexpectedly.

438
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:53,178
One moment he was here, the next... gone.

439
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,965
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him,

440
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,873
to tell everything he meant to me,

441
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:00,678
That he was my world...

442
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,420
that he was loved.

443
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,342
But today I got to say
good-bye to your mom.

444
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:08,711
My mom.

445
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,646
And it helped us both find peace

446
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,389
with what happened to our family.

447
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,550
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret

448
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,485
the rest of your life.

449
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:21,022
Go see your mom while you still can.

450
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,833
No sign of tachyon activity.

451
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:34,002
We're running out of time.
We've got to find them.

452
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,037
It'll take a few minutes for
the device to reach full power

453
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,505
once it's activated, but when we find it,

454
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,407
you're gonna have to get there fast.

455
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,101
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah?

456
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,151
Have you found out anything
else about Jay's doppelganger?

457
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,040
There's no Jay Garrick on this Earth.

458
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:50,031
That's so weird. Everyone
has a doppelganger.

459
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,159
Maybe just ask Jay.

460
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:53,996
He's a good guy.

461
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:56,825
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

462
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:58,507
Okay.

463
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,788
Hey. Hold on.

464
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:02,832
What's up?

465
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,102
We got a problem. Patty
knows you're The Flash.

466
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,837
- What?
- She caught me off guard.

467
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,206
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

468
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,507
Anyway, she was going
through some case files

469
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,741
and you were acting all squirrely.

470
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,310
This is my fault now?

471
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,278
- No, it's nobody's fault.
- Oh, my God.

472
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,782
- Maybe you should tell her.
- No.

473
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,983
- Patty's trustworthy.
- It's not even about that, Joe.

474
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,787
I-I don't want another person
that Zoom or Reverse-Flash

475
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,157
or any of these meta-humans
can use against me.

476
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,227
I don't want it. Patty
can't get hurt over this.

477
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,975
Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J.

478
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,837
Must be one of Mercury
Labs' off-site facilities.

479
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,038
Hack into their se...

480
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,607
I've hacked in the security feed.

481
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,675
- And once that...
- I'm one step ahead of you.

482
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,415
Barry, hurry up!

483
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,451
It's charged.

484
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:59,954
You can go now.

485
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:02,624
You said you'd release me.

486
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,426
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

487
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:09,531
He's gonna kill her.

488
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:20,909
- You okay?
- Yeah.

489
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,177
Okay, get out of here, all right?

490
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:23,978
Go! Go!

491
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,938
That was my way home!

492
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,854
You're not going anywhere.

493
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:39,888
You haven't won here, Flash.

494
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,323
I'll find another way back.

495
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,227
You're gonna have to
get through me first.

496
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:46,429
You really think you're
fast enough to stop me?

497
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:48,998
Let's find out.

498
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
Catch me if you can.

499
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:55,205
Oh, it's on.

500
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:12,121
Get him, Bar.

501
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,601
Not fast enough, Thawne.

502
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:26,302
I will never lose to you again.

503
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:36,045
This war between us, it ends now!

504
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:40,450
Bar, you got to stop!

505
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:43,119
Bar, don't kill him! Just bring him in!

506
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,694
Get the cell ready.

507
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:00,568
Hey, he can't...?

508
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:03,273
Phase his way out? No, he can't do that.

509
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,435
It's the same cell we used to hold Dr.
Wells last year.

510
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,110
Barry, where you going?

511
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,930
- I'm going down there.
- No, you're not.

512
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:11,047
The more he learns about you,

513
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,448
the more you will alter the time line.

514
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,117
He killed my mom!

515
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,618
He's from the future. He
hasn't done that yet.

516
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,886
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,

517
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,321
and you need to keep it that way.

518
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,455
You already said that his mother's

519
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:20,957
gonna die no matter what we do.

520
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,192
There's ramifications
any time anybody messes

521
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,994
with the time line, and
it's impossible to predict

522
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:27,130
what those ramifications are going to be.

523
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,198
Barry, you caught him and you stopped him

524
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,734
from killing Dr. McGee.

525
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:33,670
In my book, that's a win.

526
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,338
This doesn't feel like a win.

527
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:39,942
I got to go.

528
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:55,230
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

529
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:00,168
My dad had multiple sclerosis.

530
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,267
Every day for years, I watched

531
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:09,539
this amazingly strong man fight
for his life... and lose.

532
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:14,143
So, I can't sit by and watch
another man I care about

533
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:17,547
fight for his life and not
do something about it.

534
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,549
I tried to find your doppelganger.

535
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,296
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

536
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:27,027
I could replace your dying
cells with his living ones.

537
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,696
But... you don't have a
doppelganger on this Earth.

538
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,371
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

539
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:38,401
Meet me at Hofherr Park
tomorrow and I'll show you.

540
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:39,736
Why can't you just tell me?

541
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,746
Because you need to see for yourself.

542
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,088
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

543
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,224
Who are you?

544
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:02,859
My name is Cisco Ramon.

545
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,294
And we know each other well, don't we?

546
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:06,596
We have a history together.

547
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:07,864
You could say that.

548
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,966
And that's all you want to know?

549
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:12,835
How I got my suit in my ring?

550
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,905
I want you to know that I'm the one

551
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,441
who figured out you were back.

552
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:21,210
I helped stop you.

553
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:23,279
Me.

554
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:24,414
And how'd you do that?

555
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:27,517
I have powers.

556
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,154
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

557
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:36,325
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

558
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:39,729
And here's what's so ironic about it.

559
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,964
You gave me these powers.

560
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:48,037
Have fun thinking about that
while you rot away in this cell

561
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:52,141
that you helped me build.

562
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:53,543
Bye, Felicia.

563
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Hey.

564
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:22,338
Hey.

565
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,706
Got your text.

566
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,775
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

567
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,844
considering you've been
avoiding me lately.

568
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:30,793
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

569
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:34,332
No, just, uh, busy...

570
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:37,535
you know, speeding around Central City.

571
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:42,992
- I know you're The Flash, Barry.
- Patty, come on.

572
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:44,994
Please don't make me feel any more stupid

573
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,429
than I already do.

574
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,097
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

575
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,967
I was just... I was so smitten with you.

576
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,902
Okay, look, what...

577
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,652
What you're saying, it's insane.

578
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,306
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

579
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:01,210
I understand... I understand why
you didn't want to tell me.

580
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:02,712
I understand why you've been distant.

581
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,380
Look, I understand everything.

582
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:06,349
But just tell me the truth now.

583
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,950
Just be honest with me.

584
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:12,788
Just... admit to me you're
The Flash and I'll stay.

585
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,258
I can't do that. I'm not him.

586
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:21,423
It's too bad. It would
have been nice to stay.

587
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,166
Fight crime during the day

588
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:25,968
and be with you at night.

589
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,770
But I was... I was wrong.

590
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:28,971
Take care, Barry.

591
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:45,129
Is that you, Flash?

592
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,863
Why do you hate me so much?

593
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,410
I didn't always.

594
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:56,198
I was obsessed with you.

595
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,409
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

596
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,774
I spent years figuring
out how you came to be.

597
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:08,043
Duplicated the reaction... and it worked.

598
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,323
I became like you.

599
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:13,965
Right, so what happened?

600
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:19,277
This ability to travel through
time revealed a truth.

601
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:23,292
My fate was to become
your greatest enemy.

602
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,800
I was never going to be The Flash,

603
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:28,838
so I became the reverse of
everything that you were.

604
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:33,035
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

605
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:35,104
the more I had to take from you.

606
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,261
That is why you killed my mother?

607
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:41,019
That's why you ruined my life?

608
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,580
Because you couldn't be me?

609
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:46,355
I became better than you!

610
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:53,055
I am the one thing you
cannot stop, Flash!

611
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,658
No, no, no.

612
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,126
Not anymore.

613
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:58,183
Our race is over.

614
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,082
And you lost.

615
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:06,102
I've learned what time
period you're from, Flash.

616
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:10,206
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

617
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,348
We need you in the cortex now!

618
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,053
What's happening?

619
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,287
He's experiencing an
uncontrollable amount

620
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,956
of electrical energy in his brain,

621
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,158
putting him in a prolonged
state of chronic seizing.

622
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,383
What? Can you stop it?

623
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:31,805
I don't know.

624
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,404
- Hold him down!
- We're trying!

625
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:43,372
- Sedate him, Snow, now!
- Come on! Come on!

626
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:45,408
Benzodiazepine. This should do it.

627
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,012
Finally.

628
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:56,316
What? What was that?

629
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:58,451
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

630
00:32:58,453 --> 00:33:00,186
- Cisco!
- It's the time line.

631
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,788
What? What are you talking about?

632
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,090
When you... when you
captured Reverse-Flash,

633
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:05,658
we ruptured the time line.
That's what this...

634
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,161
All the blood and the
seizures and that and all...

635
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:10,864
Cisco is being affected to... to...

636
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,465
By the changes to the time line.

637
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,200
The changes to the past or the
changes to the present...

638
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,668
This is what this is. We
need to do something.

639
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,470
- We need to do it fast.
- Like what?

640
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,805
We need to restore the time line.

641
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,807
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash

642
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,809
and send him back to the
future as quickly as possible.

643
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,344
- What? Are you...
- Barry...

644
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,979
I just caught him! You
want me to let him go?

645
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:28,014
Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

646
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,716
Barry, if this is the
only way we can save him,

647
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,084
you got to do it!

648
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,886
You got to let go of Thawne!
I can't.

649
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,487
Okay, all right, look.

650
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:36,589
I destroyed the tachyon
drive in the speed machine.

651
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:38,191
There's no way it'll
reach a speed necessary

652
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:39,359
to send him back home.

653
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:40,894
- You can.
- What?

654
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,162
Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

655
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,598
that'll be enough to catapult
him through the time continuum.

656
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,966
You can do it.

657
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,037
All right. All right.

658
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,373
Let's do it. Let's do it.

659
00:33:58,613 --> 00:33:59,679
Time to send you home.

660
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:02,082
The time paradox. Yeah.

661
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,957
You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

662
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:07,954
Can you do me a favor and just shut up?

663
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,960
And how exactly are you
going to send me home?

664
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:15,175
Don't worry about it.

665
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:17,527
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device?

666
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,200
No, I came up with a different method.

667
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,438
Is that so?

668
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:28,608
Who are you?

669
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:37,050
No one of consequence.

670
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:39,652
No.

671
00:34:39,654 --> 00:34:40,820
I doubt that.

672
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:48,261
I win again, Flash.

673
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:51,431
All you have to do is provide
him with enough momentum

674
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,099
to get him past the space-time barrier.

675
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,535
- All right.
- Hey, listen to me.

676
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:58,204
Thawne knows about you.

677
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:01,007
Right here, right now.

678
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:03,843
This is where he learns
about you, all of you.

679
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,478
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,

680
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,347
how he knows about me...

681
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:09,148
The Harrison Wells from this Earth.

682
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,584
And there's nothing I can do about it.

683
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:13,186
There's nothing you can do about it.

684
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:17,123
This is his origin story,

685
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,527
and it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

686
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:24,980
But right here, right now...

687
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,996
you can send him back to his time.

688
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,837
You can save your friend.

689
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:35,708
You can save Cisco and then
move on with your life.

690
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,877
This could be a good thing.

691
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,513
You can finally let go of him.

692
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,515
I could throw him three
centuries from now.

693
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,883
He'll always be a part of me.

694
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,422
Time to send you back where you belong.

695
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,964
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

696
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,499
I know.

697
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,301
And every time, I'll be ready for you.

698
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,790
Hurry.

699
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:51,718
He did it.

700
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,640
He's gonna be okay.

701
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:25,403
I don't understand what we're doing here.

702
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,267
Well, just like you, I
thought that if I could find

703
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:29,236
my doppelganger on this Earth,

704
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:32,639
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

705
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,476
And believe me, I was
just as shocked as you

706
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,145
when I couldn't find a
Jay Garrick anywhere

707
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:39,191
on this planet.

708
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:45,308
Took me a while to figure it out...

709
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:47,316
but eventually I found him.

710
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,693
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

711
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,261
Hunter Zolomon?

712
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,029
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

713
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,297
From what I could gather,

714
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,233
his mother died during childbirth.

715
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,235
He bounced around from family to family,

716
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,104
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

717
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:09,418
But why does that mean he can't help you?

718
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:12,754
My DNA was mutated when
I became a speedster.

719
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,551
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

720
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,855
If we can catch Zoom, I
can get my speed back.

721
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:25,626
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

722
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,606
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

723
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,975
Do you want to come in?

724
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,877
No, I-I can't stay. I just...

725
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:46,380
I wanted to tell you that
I'm gonna take your advice

726
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:47,652
and go see my mom.

727
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:49,684
Okay.

728
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:56,023
Iris, I was... I was wondering

729
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,170
if you would come with me.

730
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:01,318
Yeah, yeah, I would... I would love that.

731
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:02,963
- Yeah?
- Okay.

732
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,099
My head feels like it's in a vise.

733
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,349
What happened?

734
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,607
I think you vibed one
too many dimensions.

735
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:24,952
Maybe I should stop doing that.

736
00:39:26,455 --> 00:39:28,021
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

737
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:31,992
How did you... get
the vibing to stop?

738
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,443
We sent Thawne back to his time.

739
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:37,826
You let him go?

740
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,280
I couldn't let him take
another person I cared about.

741
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:46,310
- Thank you.
- Of course.

742
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:51,078
Okay, I think I need a Big Belly burger.

743
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,746
- Anyone?
- I'm good, thank you.

744
00:39:52,748 --> 00:39:55,482
- Yeah, no pickles.
- Two triple triples, please.

745
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:56,817
You got money?

746
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:00,862
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

747
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,494
So, Patty... she's on a train
to Midway City right now, huh?

748
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,230
Mm-hmm, I had to let her go too.

749
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:13,734
Mm-hmm, I was thinking
about what you said,

750
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:18,171
that part of being The Flash
is that you have the ability

751
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:21,141
to do amazing things
that nobody else can do.

752
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:23,176
And we see now that a
hundred years from now,

753
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:24,945
you'll still be doing them.

754
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:26,263
But the other part is,

755
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,975
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

756
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:33,016
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

757
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:36,693
and there's gonna be a lot
of things where eventually

758
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,560
you'll have to let 'em go.

759
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:41,865
You got to be ready for that.

760
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,874
I am. I'm ready.

761
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,404
That's my boy.

762
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:56,773
That's weird.

763
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,681
- Hey.
- Barry, I'm on the train.

764
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,482
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

765
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:05,452
All right, hold on.
I-I-I'll get you help.

766
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:15,498
- Is everyone okay?
- Everyone's fine.

767
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:19,039
It was a false alarm, but...

768
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:22,703
thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

769
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:31,142
Just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

770
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:34,182
Don't worry.

771
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,417
Everything's good.

772
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,203
Good-bye, Barry.

773
00:41:56,242 --> 00:42:01,242
