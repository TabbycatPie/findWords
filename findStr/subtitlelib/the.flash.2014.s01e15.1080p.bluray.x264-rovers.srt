1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,524
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,725
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,366
My father went to
prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,521
Then an accident made
me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,489
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,163
And one day, I'll find who killed my
mother and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,169
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,891
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,970
It's Clyde Mardon. I think
he can control the weather.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,802
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm not like you.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,891
You're a murderer.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,202
I love you, Iris.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,965
He and I are just best friends.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,569
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,845
We can fashion an electronic
barrier to trap the Reverse-Flash.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,850
The super-capacitors, the
containment field is fluctuating.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,807
I don't know why the containment system
failed. I must have missed something.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,010
- You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's
mom? - I don't know yet.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,283
But I do know that
Wells keeps secrets.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,125
And this may be one of them.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,322
I got a plane to catch.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Come on, Clyde.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,406
Damn it.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,360
I think I got one of them.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,645
- Your luck's gonna run out one day.
- You been telling me that since I was 10.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,202
Because I've been taking care
of you since you were 10.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,166
Look, it's gonna get choppy. You
might want to strap yourself in.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,362
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,846
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,323
Clyde.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,129
Clyde!

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,449
I never would've pegged you
as someone who likes to bowl.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,686
This is one of my favorite places in the world.
One of the only sports I can destroy you at.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,689
Okay, you think so, huh?

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,406
I am pretty sure, yeah.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,125
Okay.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,722
Hi, guys.

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,446
Iris. Eddie. Hey.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,971
What are you guys doing here?

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,567
We thought it would be fun.

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,606
Barry and I have been bowling here since
we were kids. Why don't you guys join us?

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,531
Uh...

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,003
- We don't wanna interrupt your date.
- No, it's okay.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,123
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,810
It'll be fun.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,201
So blame it on the night

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,283
Don't blame it on me

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,365
- Ha, ha. Do you smell that?
That's defeat. - You never told me...

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,080
you were such a big fan
of bowling. Sure, I have.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,886
This is one of my favorite
places in the world.

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,805
Don't blame it on me

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,400
Hey-o! Ha, ha!

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,050
I am impressed, Allen.

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,080
I heard the owner is thinking of selling.
Maybe you could write a piece on the place?

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,528
Um, I'm still iffy on whether
bowling is an actual sport.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,210
I've wondered the same.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,371
Well, sport or hobby,
I am still better than you.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,565
Well, I'm serious. With a
little bit of press...

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,964
the lanes could be designated
as, like, a landmark or something.

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,647
- Oh, Eddie, you're up, man.
- Oh, right.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,523
Go get them, babe.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,406
Recording start. Central City
coroner's report, File 28527.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,128
The petechial hemorrhaging in the mucosa of
the lips and the interior of the mouth...

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,001
the strong odor of bleach, and the
presence of a postmortem ligature mark...

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,971
all suggest the decedent's
manner of death is...

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,089
Homicide.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,445
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,483
I wanna know who
killed Clyde Mardon.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,247
He was shot by a cop
little over six months ago.

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,250
- And I want his name.
- That's privileged information.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,249
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,090
Shame.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Please.

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,486
The cop's name. Now.

77
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,887
I perform hundreds
of autopsies a year.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,482
Perhaps this will
jog your memory.

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,647
- Buster Keaton. Guy was a genius.
- Yup.

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,242
- I can't believe you've never seen this.
- Must have been before my time.

81
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,362
I gotta make you
a must-see movie list, pronto.

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,564
Please do. While I am more than
happy to spend an evening...

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,441
watching old movies, Cisco, do you not
have your brother's dinner to attend?

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,208
Yeah, I was gonna ask Caitlin to come with
me, but then I got a much better idea.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,402
- Which was?
- To not go at all.

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,810
Oh.

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,367
- Things are not any better with your
family? - You're missing the movie.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,846
Right.

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,886
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. Things
have actually been pretty fantastic...

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,684
since I stopped
seeing them so much.

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,724
Silent alarm has been tripped
at the Central City Morgue.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,931
Why would anyone
wanna rob a morgue?

93
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,603
I gotta go. Emergency
at the morgue.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
- Bye.
- See you at home.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,044
Hey, Linda. Sorry,
I should go too.

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,722
They're gonna need someone from
the crime lab. I'll see you.

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,610
Well, um, that was fun.

98
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,450
Yeah.

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,002
Taxi! Taxi! Oh, come
on, I'm gonna be late.

100
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,650
- What's going on? What do you see?
- A dead body.

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,287
Barry, you're in a morgue. You're gonna
have to be more specific than that.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,326
The coroner. He's dead.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,646
- Mayor's made this high priority.
- Copy that, captain.

104
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
Allen.

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,566
- My fiancé just bought me this.
- Yeah. I'm so sorry, captain.

106
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,684
- Just help Joe find out who did this.
- Mm-hm.

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,326
What's with all the water?

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,568
Did the sprinkler system go off
or something?

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,849
No, I checked all the
sprinklers. They're all intact.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,849
But look at this.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,041
- What is that, ice?
- Mm-hm.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,005
The coroner has multiple
impact bruises on his torso...

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,089
all the size
of a tennis ball.

114
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,248
Judging by the amount
of ice and water...

115
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,609
I'm guessing he was killed
by hail. Hail. In here?

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,371
- Yeah.
- You think this was Snart?

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,763
No, his cold-gun
couldn't have done this.

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,166
Joe, we got something.

119
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,523
The coroner's office just installed
an automated dictation system.

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,485
Listen to this.

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,250
Please. No more.

122
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,289
I'll stop when you tell me.

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,124
- Stop.
- Who killed him?

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,607
- I know that voice. That's Mardon.
- I want a name.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,650
- Clyde Mardon's dead. - It's not
Clyde. It's his brother, Mark.

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,650
It was Detective
West. He shot him.

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,531
Detective Joe West
killed your brother.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,805
- And he will pay for what he did.
- No.

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,611
- So Clyde Mardon has a brother? - And
both brothers survived the plane crash...

130
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,486
and then the dark matter released from
the particle accelerator explosion...

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,127
affects them both
in virtually the same way.

132
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah, only Mark's powers
seem to be a lot more precise.

133
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,611
To be able to control the
weather like that indoors...

134
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,406
You'd have to be a
Weather Wizard. Ooh.

135
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,325
Been waiting since week one
to use that one. Mm!

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
- Trigeminal headache?
- What?

137
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,486
- Trigeminal headache. Brain freeze.
- Then why didn't you just call it brain freeze?

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,166
Guess running around a twister
in the opposite direction...

139
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,890
isn't gonna do
the trick this time.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,084
I just remembered, during our
run-in with Mardon, Clyde Mardon...

141
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,285
I was tinkering with something to help
attract unbound atmospheric electrons.

142
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,726
Like a grounding mechanism?

143
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,486
Yes. The only way Mardon
can control the weather...

144
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,811
is if he can tap into the
atmosphere's natural electrical circuit.

145
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,803
And if we take away that
circuit, clear skies.

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,085
Singh's checking in. I gotta go.

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,887
- Yeah, I'll meet you at the station.
- Joe. We'll find Mardon. Don't worry.

148
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,804
I'm not worried at all.

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,721
Well, he's taking
being targeted...

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,083
by a revenge-seeking metahuman
rather well, I must say.

151
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,011
Don't worry, Barry.
Joe will be fine. I promise.

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,889
Yeah. No, I know.

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,084
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something else.

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,841
Look, last night, on my
way to the morgue...

155
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,246
I saw something.

156
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,084
- What did you see? - I was running
and I turned and I saw myself.

157
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,530
Or, I don't know, another Flash.
Running beside me.

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,445
- Interesting.
- Yeah. What do you think it was?

159
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,042
Could be an illusion, a mirroring
effect caused by wind shear and light.

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,407
A speed mirage, if you will.

161
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,971
It didn't seem like that.

162
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,571
It was...

163
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,447
He seemed real.

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,364
I'll tell you what...

165
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,360
let's focus on finding Mardon and once
he's safely contained in the pipeline...

166
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,244
we'll investigate this.

167
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,248
- Where we at?
- No one saw anything.

168
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,768
We're canvassing known associates,
seeing if he reached out to anybody.

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,407
- Maybe we can get a lead on where he is.
- Why don't we let Thawne do that?

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,762
Nobody knows the Mardon brothers
better than I do.

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,645
Chyre and I tracked them for
years. I know how they think.

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,811
Which is why you should coordinate
the investigation from here.

173
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,251
H9)'-

174
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,726
If you guys wanna keep that
smile on that pretty face...

175
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,570
she doesn't hear
about any of this.

176
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,091
Mm-hm.

177
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,084
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

179
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,809
So, what are you
guys working on?

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,082
You got any good leads
for an honest reporter?

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,483
Uh, things are actually pretty
quiet around here right now.

182
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
Ah.

183
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
Can you guys give me a minute?

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,488
Yeah, me and Barry
were gonna go grab lunch.

185
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,047
We were? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,680
Duh.

187
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,681
Hey. Ever since last night,
you've barely said a peep.

188
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,331
What is going on?

189
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,690
I didn't like the way I felt
watching you and Barry last night.

190
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,129
Eddie, Barry, he's just...

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,890
Like family. I know.

192
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,011
And I know you two have a long history that
predates me. But, Iris, we live together.

193
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
You're my girlfriend.

194
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,041
And someday, hopefully,
you'll be more.

195
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,170
I don't like feeling like the odd man out
every time you and Barry are together.

196
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,368
- I shouldn't have to.
- Eddie...

197
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,007
Barry's always gonna be
a part of my life. - I get that.

198
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,686
But something's changed
between you two.

199
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,883
Whatever that is, I
am not okay with it.

200
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,246
Mm. I haven't had one of those
in way too long.

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,169
It felt appropriate.

202
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,801
So you want to talk about
what's been going on with you?

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,447
- What do you think is going on with me?
- You seem a bit cavalier...

204
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,843
considering what we're up against.
We aren't up against anything.

205
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,849
- Joe, come on.
- Look, I'm fine.

206
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,044
- Can we just change the
subject, please? - Sure.

207
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,921
- Actually, I could use some advice.
- About what?

208
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,210
- Uh, you know, just relationship stuff.
- Oh, you mean like with that girl Linda?

209
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,365
No, actually. Um, with Iris.

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,282
Because things between us have
gotten a little complicated. Again.

211
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,491
You're asking your adopted father for advice
about being in love with his daughter...

212
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,371
who just so happens
to be dating his partner?

213
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,207
- I know. I know.
- Things have gone way past complicated.

214
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,807
Sometimes me and Iris
have these moments...

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,923
and when I'm looking
into her eyes...

216
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,841
it's hard not to think that
she's feeling the same way I do.

217
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,727
Look, you already told
Iris how you feel.

218
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,402
So unless she comes out and
says she feels the same way...

219
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,844
all you can do is hold on to those
moments. Man, it is coming down.

220
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,320
Yeah.

221
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,488
It's another beautiful day here
in Central City. Not a cloud...

222
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,250
Mardon.

223
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,206
You're confined to the precinct
until Mardon's caught.

224
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,085
David, you said it, that son
of a bitch killed my partner.

225
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,726
And I'm not gonna lose you
the way I lost Fred Chyre.

226
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,208
Look, I can't stop you from being
pissed, Joe. But I can keep you safe.

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,202
Maybe your daughter
can contact the Flash.

228
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,368
I'm not getting her
involved in this.

229
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,200
Allen, make sure he
doesn't go anywhere.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,484
I need to be out there.

231
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,486
Joe, you're always the first one to
tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.

232
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,530
I took down Clyde. I can take
down his dirtbag brother too.

233
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,961
You didn't do that
alone, remember?

234
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,564
You're right.

235
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,721
How are any of these guys
gonna protect me?

236
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,605
They don't know. They don't
know what Mardon's capable of.

237
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,247
All right, well, lucky for you,
your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.

238
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,161
"The Flash. Speeding
his way into our lives"?

239
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,006
That's a little on the
nose, don't you think?

240
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,162
I wanna show you something.

241
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,160
Simon Stagg. Remember him? Hasn't
been seen in, like, six months?

242
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,160
I thought the rumor was he was a recluse.
You know, went all Howard Hughes.

243
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,845
This was taken the night Stagg went missing.
The last person to leave Stagg Industries...

244
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,487
the night Stagg disappeared
was Harrison Wells.

245
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,967
- This doesn't prove anything, Mason.
- It's enough to develop a theory.

246
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,881
Every trail in this file leads
to one person: Harrison Wells.

247
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,051
Which is why I need for you to ask your
friends who know him some questions, Iris.

248
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,849
Linda.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,690
Hi.

250
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,531
- Last night was fun.
- Mm-hm.

251
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,725
Oh, yeah.

252
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,804
Uh, look, I just
wanted to apologize.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,604
Ap0logize...?

254
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,089
Well, for interrupting your date with
Barry. I shouldn't have done that.

255
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,404
And I'm sorry.

256
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,684
You know, Iris...

257
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,400
when you told me that
Barry had feelings for you...

258
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,764
I thought it was just the typical
weird crap that women do to each other.

259
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,605
But last night I realized what you didn't
tell me, and what's kind of irritating...

260
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,923
is that you have
feelings for him too.

261
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,762
No, Linda, I mean,
it's not like that.

262
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,730
One thing you learn about people
when you work here, Iris...

263
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,764
it's usually what isn't said
that's the real story.

264
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,286
Sounded like something
was bothering you on the phone.

265
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,444
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

266
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,729
- So the other night was fun, right?
- Yeah. Eddie have a good time?

267
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,964
- Yeah. Linda?
- I think so.

268
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,921
You don't think we
were too, you know...?

269
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,807
- No.
- Okay, good.

270
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,726
So the reason that I called you was
because my sort-of-advisor at the paper...

271
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,606
is always teaching me lessons, tricks
of the trade, how to get a good story.

272
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,964
And one of the things he's repeatedly
telling me is to follow your hunch.

273
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,288
- See where it leads.
- Sounds like good advice.

274
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,482
Yeah, it is.

275
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Except, in this instance,
that hunch involves you.

276
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,443
Uh... Well, you can
ask me anything, Iris.

277
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,004
It's about Harrison Wells.

278
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,685
What about him?

279
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,811
I mean, a lot of strange things have been
happening in Central City this past year.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,765
The Flash. The Burning Man.
People going missing.

281
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,806
He was there at Stagg's office
the night that Stagg went missing.

282
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,722
And you think that Dr. Wells
is what, responsible?

283
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,925
I mean, I don't really know him.
But you and your friends do.

284
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,970
Uh-huh.

285
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
Barry, in your
heart of hearts...

286
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,531
do you think it's possible
there's more to Harrison...

287
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,240
than people have
been led to believe?

288
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,971
Harrison Wells is a good man.

289
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,131
If you're looking for a story, then
you're not gonna find one with him.

290
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,203
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

291
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,842
- Subtle. How does it work? - Just
think of it like an active lightning rod.

292
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,682
Point it at the sky and it'll suck up whatever
energy's floating around it like a sponge.

293
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,882
- And it'll stop Mardon?
- It'll slow him down.

294
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,566
If there's no atmospheric
electrons available to him...

295
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,049
there's no way to control the
weather. Good work, Cisco. As always.

296
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,681
Excuse me. I'm gonna
go stretch my legs.

297
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,081
You okay? You seem a little off.

298
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,730
Yeah, uh, somebody at Picture
News got it into Iris' head...

299
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,606
that something suspicious
is going on with Dr. Wells.

300
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,720
Like what?

301
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,842
That he knows what happened
to Simon Stagg.

302
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,329
Nobody has heard from him or seen him
since the night I stopped Danton Black.

303
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,367
- What did you tell her?
- That she's wrong. And she is.

304
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,011
Keep this handy. It'll protect
you from Mardon's powers.

305
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,531
Yes, Cisco. I got it.

306
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,530
Hey, Joe. Um, I know you got
a lot going on right now...

307
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,769
but you mentioned Dr. Wells
might've had something to do...

308
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,445
with Barry's mother's murder.

309
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,729
- Why did you think that?
- Doesn't matter. I was wrong.

310
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,887
- But you seemed really sure of it. - Cisco,
I can't talk about this right now, okay?

311
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,644
I heard you were looking for me.

312
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,130
Here I am.

313
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,965
- Mardon.
- Hey, Joe.

314
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,481
I can call you Joe, can't I?

315
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,362
Figured we don't gotta be too formal, seeing
as you put two bullets in my brother's chest.

316
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,565
Your brother killed my partner and
a whole lot of innocent people.

317
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,603
And threatened to
kill even more.

318
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,322
Yeah, Clyde was no saint,
but he was family.

319
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,687
And if you can't protect your family,
the least you can do is avenge them.

320
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,527
This is between us.

321
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,489
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

322
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,001
But they are gonna get hurt.

323
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,529
- Joe!
- No.

324
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,606
I'm not gonna be so
easy to put down, Joe.

325
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
Take him down!

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,200
No, run!

327
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,131
Joe!

328
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,651
Captain!

329
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
David.

330
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,163
All right, Cisco,
I'm heading home.

331
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,245
Cisco?

332
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,250
All right, fine, I will watch every
episode of The Walking Dead with you.

333
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,680
H9)'-

334
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,843
You couldn't have stopped Mardon
from attacking the police station.

335
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,610
It's not your fault.

336
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,569
No, that's not it.

337
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,084
- What do you think of Dr. Wells?
- What do you mean?

338
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,685
I mean, do you think he's
capable of doing something bad?

339
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,528
Is this because of what
Barry said he heard?

340
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,405
Since the accelerator exploded,
there's always someone...

341
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,206
who's got it in for Dr.
Wells. It's more than that.

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,246
Joe said that maybe Dr. Wells was somehow
involved in Barry's mother's death.

343
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,204
In her murder.

344
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,246
That's absurd.

345
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,289
Yeah, I know. And
that's what I said.

346
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,767
And we proved that
that wasn't the case, but...

347
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,247
I'm just saying,
some things aren't adding up.

348
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,124
Like what, for example?

349
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,124
Come here. Look at this.

350
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,370
When we trapped the
Reverse-Flash...

351
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,801
he escaped because the
containment system failed.

352
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,764
But I checked that
data three times.

353
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,804
And the super-capacitors were
fully charged when he got out.

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,324
The numbers don't add up, Caitlin. No reason
the containment system should have failed.

355
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,807
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation.

356
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,482
One perfectly good explanation is
that Wells did something to the trap.

357
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,486
Are you suggesting that Dr. Wells is in
league with the man in the yellow suit?

358
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,962
I mean, we all saw that thing
nearly kill him that night.

359
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,288
Yeah. Nearly.

360
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,809
Cisco, what you're saying doesn't
make any sense. That's crazy.

361
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,648
Can you keep Wells out of
S.T.A.R. Labs tomorrow morning?

362
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,040
Thank you, Barry.

363
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah.

364
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,603
This isn't how I thought I'd
finally meet David's coworkers.

365
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,123
He speaks very highly of you.

366
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
Really?

367
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,362
David's all bark.

368
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,645
A very loud bark. Heh.

369
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,728
- How is he, doctor?
- We're stabilizing him.

370
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,963
He's experiencing some paralysis
in his lower extremities.

371
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,361
- Oh, my God.
- The hardest thing to gauge...

372
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,802
is the extent of his
neurocognitive deficits.

373
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,480
So he may not be the same person
you remember.

374
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,040
Can I see him?

375
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,646
I am sorry. Visitation's
for family only.

376
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,726
Being his fiancé makes
him family, doctor.

377
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,408
Ah. Sure.

378
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,729
Will he be able to
return to the force?

379
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,727
I'm actually not sure
he'll be able to walk again.

380
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,922
- Where are you going?
- I need to end this.

381
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,043
- Not by yourself.
- Yes, by myself.

382
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,325
I know him. I can find him. I don't
want anybody else getting hurt.

383
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,364
- Especially Iris and you.
- Iris is fi...

384
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,729
Mardon said he was going to avenge
his brother. That goes beyond me.

385
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,925
It goes all the way to you
and her. You stay with Iris...

386
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,401
and you keep her safe.

387
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,090
Do not leave her side.

388
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,571
Yeah, all right.

389
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,891
Hey, have you seen Iris West?

390
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,684
She went to see her dad.

391
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,450
- You're Barry Allen, right?
- Yeah.

392
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,849
Her friend/brother. Or
is that brother/friend?

393
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,010
- Friend is fine.
- I'm Mason Bridge.

394
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,851
Ah. You're the guy who thinks
Harrison Wells is a mad genius.

395
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,206
Oh, no, no, no. I never said he was crazy.
He's a sociopath and a liar, for sure.

396
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,045
Really?

397
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,526
You don't see it?

398
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,769
- All the time you two spend together?
- Excuse me?

399
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,531
Sometimes when I'm bored,
I follow him around.

400
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,563
For the most part, he
keeps to himself...

401
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,081
except when he's meeting
with you, which he does a lot.

402
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,811
And then, one time,
he met up with Simon Stagg.

403
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,008
And then, poof, no
more Simon Stagg.

404
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,010
So you're saying
Wells knows where Stagg is?

405
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,009
No, I'm saying Wells killed him.

406
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,006
Ah.

407
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,242
All right. Even if I believed
you, which I don't...

408
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,290
he's in a wheelchair. How
could he possibly have done that?

409
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,362
I have evidence in a secure digital
file that will explain everything.

410
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,609
What evidence?

411
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,329
Well, you'll just have to read about it
in the Sunday paper, like everybody else.

412
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,162
Let's see if you can tell me what
really went wrong that night.

413
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
Hey.

414
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,810
Joe.

415
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,091
Eddie. You shouldn't be here.

416
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,005
And you shouldn't be chasing
after Mardon alone, partner.

417
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,446
Did you find anything?

418
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,565
Not yet, but this was an old Mardon
brothers hideout about six years ago.

419
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,610
So it's a long shot, but...

420
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,766
- Listen, Eddie...
- Save it. I'm not leaving.

421
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,088
Hey, have you heard from Dad?
He's not answering his cell.

422
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,528
Uh, no. I haven't talked to him.

423
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,722
I'm starting to worry about him.

424
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,287
What are you doing
home so early?

425
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,968
Um, I was looking for you, actually.
I just met your friend Mason.

426
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,601
And he said that he had...

427
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,969
some kind of proof
that Dr. Wells did something.

428
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,685
Do you know what it is?

429
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,922
No, he hasn't told me.

430
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
All right.

431
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,971
So how are things
going with Linda?

432
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,162
- Why do you say it like that?
- Like what?

433
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,842
Like how you used to always say
"Becky Cooper."

434
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,281
Oh, come on. Becky Cooper...

435
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,320
was a nightmare of a high school girlfriend.
And you should've never dated her.

436
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,807
Okay, so you're saying that
Linda is Becky material?

437
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,650
I mean, I wouldn't go that far.

438
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,801
She's hot and nice and smart...

439
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,480
and she is really good
at her job. I just...

440
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,731
I don't think that she's
the right one for you.

441
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,169
Then who is?

442
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
What?

443
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,451
I don't understand.

444
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,201
This doesn't make any sense.

445
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,211
Somebody was here very recently.

446
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,482
He left this here for me.

447
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,483
Where to next?

448
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,609
Joe!

449
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,810
Small miracle
you only broke the one leg, Joe.

450
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,406
The night I got sucked
out of my plane...

451
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,251
I broke almost
every bone in my body.

452
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,410
That was excruciating.

453
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,251
At least you got a small taste
of what that felt like.

454
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,724
Still, I guess you'll never know
what it really feels like to be God.

455
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,890
That's what your brother said
to me right before I killed him.

456
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,645
I don't need these
powers to end your life.

457
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,520
Then do it. That's what you
came here for, isn't it?

458
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,490
An eye for an eye.

459
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,290
Oh, Joe.

460
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,448
I want so much more than an eye.

461
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,125
I forget how important it is...

462
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,760
to step away from my
ever-present routine. Thank you.

463
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,241
This morning has been a
refreshing change of pace.

464
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,570
You can have more than two hard-boiled
eggs for breakfast, Dr. Wells.

465
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,962
What can I say?
I guess I'm a creature of habit.

466
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,810
Sorry, I believe
these were to go.

467
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,009
Actually, I thought we could
sit here and enjoy them.

468
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,120
Why not?

469
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,323
We've seen what Mardon can do.

470
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,047
But do not forget,
he is not invincible.

471
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,089
- He's still a man.
- I can't believe this.

472
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,561
- At best, a criminal.
- We'll find him.

473
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,643
- And we will find this dirtbag...
- Hey.

474
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,808
Look at me, all right?

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,571
I promise, I'll bring
him back to you.

476
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,490
- Whatever you need to do...
- Okay.

477
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,850
I need you all to scour
this city until we find Joe.

478
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,480
Move out.

479
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
Hello?

480
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,689
I have your father.

481
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,369
He's a little broken,
but still alive.

482
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,202
If you want him to stay that way,
come to the waterfront, south side.

483
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,566
Oh, and, Iris.

484
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,327
You tell the police,
your father's dead.

485
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,684
She's on her way.

486
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,565
He has my dad.

487
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,649
If I tell anyone, he'll kill him.
He wants to meet at the waterfront.

488
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,644
- All right, I'm coming with you.
- Okay.

489
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
Let's go.

490
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,646
- Barry. Um, can I talk to you
for a second? - Hey.

491
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,962
Linda, I'm sorry. I
really can't right now.

492
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,487
- Of course not.
- Look, it's not like that.

493
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,451
It's an emergency. I
have to go right now.

494
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,322
You know, Dr. Wells, I just...

495
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,010
I wanna thank you again for all
that you've done for Ronnie.

496
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,047
One thank-you will
suffice, I'm sure.

497
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,410
You know, Caitlin...

498
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,884
if Cisco were to adjust the
radial velocity parameters...

499
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,764
of the S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite...

500
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,810
we might be able to better
detect the vortex of a storm.

501
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,725
If we could detect
those air updrafts...

502
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,281
no matter where they
originate, no matter how small...

503
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,448
we might be able
to locate Mark Mardon.

504
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,883
That's a great idea.

505
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,402
So why don't we go to
S.T.A.R. Labs and alert Cisco?

506
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,131
Let me just get these to go.

507
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,329
Hi. Could I get
these in to-go cups?

508
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,851
Sure, just a second.

509
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,928
My goals are beyond
your understanding.

510
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,007
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

511
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,811
My goals are beyond
your understanding.

512
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,645
I can't believe this.

513
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,526
Oh, I'm not like
the Flash at all.

514
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,969
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

515
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,763
Congratulations, Joe.
You're my plus-one today.

516
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,564
Front-row seats to watch everyone and
everything you ever loved destroyed.

517
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,570
Pretty girl too.

518
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,720
Such a shame.

519
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,530
Please, she's my daughter.

520
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,728
- Clyde was my brother.
- He's a thief...

521
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,964
and a murderer.
She's an innocent girl.

522
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,487
She'll pay for the sins
of her father, then.

523
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,523
They'll all pay.

524
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,366
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

525
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,483
I've always said so.

526
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,130
You're him.

527
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,407
The Reverse-Flash.

528
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,564
You and I have never been truly
properly introduced.

529
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,128
I am Eobard Thawne.

530
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,525
Thawne?

531
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,331
Like Eddie.

532
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,481
Let's call him a
distant relative.

533
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,124
The night that we trapped
the Reverse-Flash...

534
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,690
you almost died.

535
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,920
Mm-hm.

536
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,650
There were two of you.

537
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,369
It's an afterimage.

538
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,922
A speed mirage, if you will.

539
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,644
Joe was right.

540
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,210
You were there that
night 15 years ago.

541
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,364
In Barry's house.

542
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,608
You killed Nora Allen.

543
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,483
It was never my
intention to kill Nora.

544
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,007
I was there to kill Barry.

545
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,320
Why?

546
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,568
You're his friend. You've
been teaching him how to...

547
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,566
Go faster. I know.
A means to an end.

548
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,802
And I'll tell you why.

549
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,847
Because I have
been stuck here...

550
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,770
marooned here in this place
for 15 long years.

551
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,724
And the Flash...

552
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,962
and the Flash's speed...

553
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,088
is the key...

554
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,850
to my returning to my world.

555
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,890
To my time.

556
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,042
And no one is going to
prevent that from happening.

557
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,251
I can help you.

558
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,402
You're smart, Cisco.

559
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,690
But you're not that smart.

560
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,764
Do you know...

561
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,762
how hard it has been to keep all
of this from you, especially from you?

562
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,529
Because the truth is...

563
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,647
I've grown quite fond of you.

564
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,931
And in many ways,
you have shown me...

565
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,045
what it's like to have a son.

566
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,690
Forgive me.

567
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,161
But to me, you've been
dead for centuries.

568
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,451
- What do we do?
- He'll find us.

569
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,884
Oh, my God.

570
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,569
You need to get out of here. Get
as far away from here as possible.

571
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,960
- I'm not leaving.
- Please.

572
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,407
Listen. Since the night
you told me how you felt...

573
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,961
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

574
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,328
At first, I was really mad.

575
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,769
Then I realized that the reason I
couldn't stop thinking about you...

576
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,247
was because I didn't want to.

577
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,966
I've never stopped
thinking about you.

578
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,169
- Caitlin.
- Barry, I need to talk to you.

579
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,443
- It's Dr. Wells. He's...
- No time for that right now, all right?

580
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,450
There is a tsunami
heading for the city.

581
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,880
How do I stop it?

582
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,961
Theoretically, if you can create a vortex
barrier along the coastline, a wall of wind...

583
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,487
that would sap the tidal wave
of its energy...

584
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,484
before it hits the city.
By running back and forth.

585
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,840
How fast?

586
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,882
I don't know if you
can run that fast.

587
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,366
I am so sorry.

588
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,966
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

589
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,731
Go.

590
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,686
Taxi! Taxi! Oh, come
on, I'm gonna be late.

591
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,169
Oh, boy.
