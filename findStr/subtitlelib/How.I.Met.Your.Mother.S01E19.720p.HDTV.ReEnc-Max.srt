00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:16,383
Her favorite CD
in the Otis Redding box set? Disk three.

3
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,842
My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone?

4
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:20,852
Come on. Disk three!

5
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,335
God, Victoria's so amazing.
I could taIk about her for hours.

6
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,346
What do you mean could?

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,136
I'm sorry. It's just...

8
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:31,905
God, I'm crazy about this girl.
It feels like, maybe...

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,987
- I don't wanna say it.
- Trust that impulse, Ted.

10
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:38,931
Hey, something kind of cool just happened.

11
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,815
My story on Pickles, the singing dog,

12
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:44,616
just got nominated
for a Local Area Media Award.

13
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,599
- A LAMA?
- We prefer Local Area Media Award.

14
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:51,419
Um, there's gonna be this big banquet.

15
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:52,824
I know these things aren't much fun,

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,091
but it would really mean a lot to me
if you guys came.

17
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,689
Oh, well...

18
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:57,903
And there's an open bar.

19
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:58,924
- Oh, yes!
- Word up!

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,934
Put me down for two.

21
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:02,981
- Really? It's three months away.
- I know.

22
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:06,110
But, guys, I'm sorry, I'm gonna say it.

23
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:10,837
I have a feeling Victoria's gonna be around
for a long time.

24
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,885
I'm gonna miss Victoria.

25
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,638
I should just skip this thing entirely.

26
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:17,608
Robin is still pissed at me after,
you know...

27
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,578
You lied and said you were broken up
with Victoria before you actually were,

28
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:21,823
so you could try to nail Robin,

29
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,858
and you wound up losing both girls
in one night.

30
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,083
Yes, that's what I meant by, 'You know...'

31
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:30,989
I haven't seen her in three weeks.
She won't return my calls.

32
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,705
- Look, I shouldn't go.
- You should definitely go.

33
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,918
Look, it's a chance to show her...

34
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,738
you're still friends and that you support her.

35
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,868
Or it's a chance to mess with her head
by showing up with someone hotter.

36
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:43,094
Even better, triple threat,
hotter and bigger boobs.

37
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,793
- That's only two.
- Count again.

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,300
Barney, I'm not bringing a date
even if I wanted to.

39
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:49,673
The thing's in two hours.

40
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,059
- So get an escort.
- By escort, you mean prostitute?

41
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,354
- Why not?
- Because gross?

42
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,179
Oh, what, gross?

43
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:00,053
What, you have some puritanical hang-up
about prostitution?

44
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,485
Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.

45
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,738
- You really think that's true?
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,134
I bet even Cro-Magnons
used to give cave-hookers,

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,465
like, an extra fish for putting out.

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,704
Uh-huh. So, then, the oldest profession
would be fisherman. Kaboom!

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,714
You've been lawyered.

50
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:19,868
Come on, Ted. Let's get you a hooker.
It'll be fun.

51
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,646
Okay. To bring to the banquet
and hang out with ironically...

52
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,752
- or to actually have sex with?
- Yes.

53
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:30,400
No, it's illegal. And did I mention gross?

54
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:33,441
That's adorable.
Ted, you're such a hayseed.

55
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:37,434
The companionship business
is the growth industry of the 21st century.

56
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,937
You do realize that one out of every eight
adult women in America is a prostitute.

57
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:42,991
- You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.

58
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,045
Lawyered.

59
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,055
(GROANS)

60
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:49,067
The point is... How long has it been?

61
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,858
Fifty-seven days.

62
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,808
- Is that your water? May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

63
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:56,818
Much obliged.

64
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:01,130
Fifty-seven days! Ted, you are in a slump.

65
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:04,900
No, it's not a slump.
It's an intentional hiatus from girls.

66
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:07,647
A slump is when you strike out
every time you step up to the plate,

67
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,595
but I'm off the roster, baby.

68
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,511
I'm in the locker room
sitting in the whirlpool.

69
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,971
And I'll tell you something,
it feels pretty good.

70
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,887
Yeah. You know what else
is in that locker room?

71
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:18,993
A bunch of naked dudes hanging brain.

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,282
Ted, you need a lady,
and I've got the next best thing. Mary.

73
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:27,895
She lives in my building.
She's smart. She's hot. She's totally cool.

74
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,269
Oh, she sounds great.

75
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,792
And, who knows, maybe we will wind up
getting married someday,

76
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:34,730
you know,
if we can get a blessing from her pimp.

77
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,869
You wanna judge a fellow human being...

78
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:39,521
based solely on
one external characteristic?

79
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,246
That's racism.

80
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:44,759
And I do not drink with racists. Good day!

81
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,018
You're just waiting for me to speak,
so you can...

82
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,029
I said good day!

83
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,835
So should I wear my hair up or down?

84
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,859
So should I wear my hair up or down?

85
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,141
- Lily.
- What?

86
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:04,048
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

87
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm just exhausted from work.

88
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:10,085
The stupid school board took away
naptime in all kindergarten classes,

89
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,375
and now the kids are just going crazy
by the end of the day.

90
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:18,069
And it's much harder to deal with
because, well, I don't get my nap.

91
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:21,199
Oh, wait, you were taking naps
when the kids were? Is that safe?

92
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,444
Oh, they're only five.
What are they gonna do to me?

93
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:30,292
- Ted's still coming to this thing, right?
- Yep.

94
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:35,147
Do you think, hypothetically,
it would be weird if I bring a date?

95
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:39,267
Look at you, Scherbatsky,
blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.

96
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,630
(STAMMERING) No, it's just this guy
at the station.

97
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,335
I never get involved with coworkers,
but he asked me and I said yes.

98
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,912
- Is it gonna be weird?
- No, it's not gonna be weird at all.

99
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,521
- Robin's bringing a date.
- That's gonna be really weird.

100
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,531
- I know.
- Okay.

101
00:04:56,322 --> 00:05:00,154
- Robin's bringing a date.
- Oh. Okay, that's not weird.

102
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,645
She's bringing a date.
I'm glad she's moving on.

103
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,488
- Dude, it's gonna be weird.
- No, it's fine.

104
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,842
Look, in spite of whatever happened
between us, Robin and I are still friends.

105
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,895
I don't think it'll be weird.

106
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,524
- Yeah, it won't be weird.
- Thank you.

107
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:13,728
Because you're gonna bring your own date.

108
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:16,241
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mary.

109
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,261
Have you met Ted?

110
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,829
- Nice to meet you, Ted.
- Hi, Mary.

111
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,352
Wow! It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.

112
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,012
So, we're going to an award show?

113
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,641
Yep. Could you just excuse us
for one minute?

114
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:32,589
- Barney?
- See you in two shakes, Mar.

115
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:35,614
You two make yourselves comfortable.

116
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:37,476
What the hell?

117
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,159
Dude, your narrow-minded views
on professional fornicators...

118
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,628
are harshing my mellow.

119
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:45,460
- So, I got you a date for the evening.
- You got me a hooker.

120
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:48,104
A really hot... A hooker!

121
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,347
Think about it. This is perfect.

122
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,284
A, it will make Robin insanely jealous.

123
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,712
B, you get to have sex with her.

124
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,979
And C, maybe by getting to know Mary,

125
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,279
you'll come to see
that courtesans are people, too.

126
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,165
And D, B all night long.

127
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,922
I'm not taking a prostitute
to Robin's banquet.

128
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,126
Dude, the only people who will know
are you, me and Marshall.

129
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,212
No one will suspect a thing.

130
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,852
They'll just see you with
this unbelievably smoking hot girl and...

131
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:17,446
Okay, yeah, that's a little bit suspicious.

132
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,623
Look, I'm just trying to expand
your horizons a little bit tonight.

133
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:23,753
But if you're not interested, fine,
I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.

134
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,191
Five hundred bucks, you?

135
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,201
<i>Ted, you're my cabrón.</i>

136
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:31,451
You think I'm gonna stick you with some
toothless tranny from the Port Authority?

137
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,900
Look at how hot she is.
Robin would be so jealous.

138
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,934
I'm not trying
to make Robin jealous, Barney.

139
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,533
Look, I... Tell Mary thanks, but no thanks.
I have a soul.

140
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:44,194
<i>OLDER TED: And then
your Uncle Marshall and I...</i>

141

00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:54,372
<i>- Is that who I think it is?

Uh...

155
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:30,216
- French Sandy, porn-star Sandy...
- Yosemite Sandy, definitely.

156
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,226
Excellent choice.

- I'm Lily.
- I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.

Mary is a friend of Barney's.
Barney invited her.

165
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,066
Just met Mary ourselves.
Don't know too much about Mary.

166
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,076
Look, a beer.

167
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,686
- Hey.
- Hi.

168
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:05,858
- You look nice.
- Oh, Ted, this is Sandy.

169
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:10,010
Hi, Sandy Rivers. Use my full name.
People get a kick out of it.

170
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,273
Hi, Sandy Rivers.

171
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,686
- So, are you two...
- Starting a bunch of office rumors?

172
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,303
Looks that way. Looks that way.

173
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,336
Oh, how rude of me.

174
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:25,173
Robin, Sandy... Rivers,

175
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:28,310
this is Mary, my date.

182
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:57,649
Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.

183
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:01,524
I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.

184
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,070
Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily
go to the ladies' room together, man.

185
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,539
Secrets come out in there.

186
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, please, how's it gonna come out?

187
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,339
'Pass me a towel.
P.S. I have sex for money.'

188
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,606
- Who had sex for money?
- Nobody.

189
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,971
What did you guys taIk about in there,
anything interesting?

190
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,981
No, not really.

191
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:21,047
We just chitchatted,
and I borrowed her lipstick.

192
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,691
Yeah, why is Vampire Lou the host
of a Saturday afternoon kung fu movie?

193
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:30,811
You know? It just makes no sense.
God, that pisses me off.

194
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,089
Lily, you okay?

195
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,666
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired.
And when I get tired, I get cranky.

196
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,837
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.

197
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:41,188
'Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.'

198
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,201
Wow. Why are you so tired?

199
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,885
Well, I teach kindergarten,

200
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,802
and the school board
took away my naptime...

201
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,526
The kids' naptime.

202
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,858
Lily, quit your job.
Work at a private school.

203
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,359
You won't have to deal
with the school board,

204
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:56,042
- and you'll make a ton more money.
- Well, guess what, Barney?

205
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:59,492
I don't base all my life decisions
on how much money I'm gonna make,

206
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,599
unlike you and sadly my fiancé.

207
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,707
Well, it's just an internship
for the record for everybody...

208
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,316
Yeah, because if I did sacrifice
all my values just for an easy buck,

209
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,747
- what would that make me?
- A prostitute.

210
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:13,246
Exactly. Thank you, Mary.

211
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:18,170
- So, Mary, what do you do for a living?
- She's a paralegal.

212
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,666
Yes, I'm a paralegal.

213
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,203
ROBIN: So, Mary the paralegal.

214
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,937
What does a paralegal do exactly?

215
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:30,950
I just assist with day-to-day clerical work
in a law firm, downtown.

216
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,951
- Oh, what firm?
- Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.

217
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:37,772
- That's a real law firm.
- I know.

218
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,794
Nice.

219
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:43,278
- Pretty good on your feet.
- Are you flirting with me?

220
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,709
- Is that allowed?
- Yes, it's encouraged.

221
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,880
(STAMMERING) You know,
I wouldn't normally say this on a first date,

222
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:53,562
but, well, considering,
I'm just gonna say it.

223
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:55,572
You are so hot.

224
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,480
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

225
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:01,386
Mary, Ted is a great guy.
You hold on to him.

226
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:05,143
Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.

227
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,295
So, Sandy, what do you do?

228
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,211
Oh, wait, I know what you do.

229
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,159
You're the guy
who reads the paper in the morning.

230
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,097
You got me. What do you do, Ted?

231
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:16,461
Oh, same thing as you.
I read the paper every morning.

232
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:20,071
But then after that, I finish my coffee
and I go to my real job as an architect,

233
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,561
where I make an actual contribution
to the world.

234
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,829
I'm just kidding. Love your show.
You're terrific.

235
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:27,952
Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.

236
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,133
<i>Hey, you know that scene in Empire...</i>

237
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:36,071
where they lower the helmet
onto Darth Vader's head?

238
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,967
Do you think that's how Sandy
puts his hair on in the morning?

239
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:44,407
You just insulted someone I hate
by referencing something I love.

240
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,025
Damn! You just got even hotter.

241
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,062
<i>OLDER TED: And so, as the night wore on,
I started to realize...</i>

242
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:58,284
<i>this girl, despite what she did for a living,
was kind of great.</i>

243
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,503
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,005
Mary seems nice.

245
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,922
Have you kissed her yet
or are you waiting...

246
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,892
until you're in a serious relationship
with someone else?

247
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,927
Yeah. I've been meaning to apologize
for everything that happened.

248
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,609
And just like that it's all okay. Roll credits.

249
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,451
So you're gonna be mad at me forever?
What, we're not even friends now?

250
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,463
- We're still friends.
- We're... Are we?

251
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,475
You don't return my calls.
We never hang out.

252
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,701
And now you're trying to make me jealous
by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?

253
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:29,598
Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here
in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?

254
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:31,727
Oh, so now she's a whore?

255
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,517
- What?
- You know something?

256
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:37,454
Mary the paralegal is awesome.
And you know what else?

257
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,052
I didn't come here tonight
to make you jealous.

258
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:44,924
I came here to support you as a friend,
and frankly, I'm sick of trying.

259
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,343
I like that guy.

260
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,424
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,956
What were you guys
taIking about over there?

262
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:59,907
Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend
that I think you're awesome.

263
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:01,917
Well, thanks.

264
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:05,017
You know, this is one of the nicer hotels
I've ever been in.

265
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,326
Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel.

266
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,019
You should see the rooms,
the views are amazing.

267
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:11,776
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad
we don't have a room.

268
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,534
Room 1506, my treat. You kids go nuts.

269
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,233
Actually, don't use the minibar.

270
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,129
Do it. Come on, Ted, do it.

271
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:27,365
This is one of those things you have to do
before you turn 30.

272
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,718
- Sleep with a prostitute?
- No, lose your virginity. What up!

273
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:35,189
Statistic. Men who have had
at least one relationship with a prostitute...

274
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:38,830
are 75% more likely
to have success in future relationships.

275
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:40,172
- You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.

276
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,342
Lawyered. Okay, three things.

277
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,067
First of all, Robin's category is almost up.

278
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:47,421
And second of all, you cannot do this.
It's wrong on every level.

279
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:50,104
And third, I've been placing small items
in Sandy's hair all night,

280
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,796
and he still hasn't noticed.

281
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:55,949
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this.
It's just... It's a shame. She's really cool.

282
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,312

00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,497
- What?
- Barney paid for her.

329
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,609
Barney, is that true?

330
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,484
We were having a conversation
about prostitution.

331
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,581
And then Barney calls her up,
and then she shows up at the bar,

332
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:49,306
and now she and Ted are upstairs.

333
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,606
Okay, seriously,
what is going on with Ted, lately?

334
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,937
Is he having a nervous breakdown?

335
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:58,089
You know, Barney,
for anyone else this would be a new low,

336
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,683
but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle.

337
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:05,332
Oh, my God, I used her lipstick. Oh!

338
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:06,999
That's her napkin.

339
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,009
(EXCLAIMING)

340
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:12,269
Okay, well, I guess now
is as good a time as any.

341
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,409
In keeping with tonight's award show motif,

342
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:18,735
I'd like to announce
this evening's big twist ending.

343
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:20,829
(EXCLAIMS)

344
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:23,935
Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?

345
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:27,427
'Mary is not really a prostitute.'

346
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,506
- What?
- That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.

347
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,039
- So she's not...
- No.

348
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,275
Mary is just a paralegal
who lives in my building.

349
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,223
Oh! And here's the best part.

350
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,395
She has no idea
that Ted thinks she's a hooker.

351
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,405
(BARNEY LAUGHING)

352
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,418
Oh, come on.
If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

353
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,177
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

354
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,684
Feel kind of like Richard Gere.

355
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,340
- Not shy about your looks, are you?
- No.

356
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,797
You know, Mary,
I've never done this before.

357
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:10,618
- Done what?
- You know, been on a date.

358
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,067
Right.

359
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,624
- Wait, you're kidding, right?
- No.

360
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,381
Why, is that so odd?

361
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:23,195
Well, Ted, I mean,
I've been going on dates since I was 15.

362
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,228
God, you were just a kid.

363
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,942
Well, look, let's just have a few drinks.
We'll relax...

364
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,539
Yeah, that sounds great.

365
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:34,645
I had clients riding me all day long.

366
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:36,841
- Must be tough.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,980
I mean, this one guy
just wouldn't leave me alone.

368
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,028
I mean, taIk about anal.

369
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:49,901
Here we are.

370
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,707
Okay, look. Mary, I like you a lot.

371
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,080
(STAMMERING) I'm sort of amazed
at how much I like you.

372
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,186
But I can't do this, you're a hooker.

373
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,147
What?

374
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,181
Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned,
but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me.

375
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,896
I'm not gonna have sex with a prostitute.

376
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:11,906
Ted, I'm a paralegal.

377
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,952
Come on, Mary,
there's no one else around.

378
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,963
You're a hooker.

379
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,963
No, Ted. I'm a paralegal.

380
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,900
No, you're a hooker.

381
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:26,118
No, I'm a paralegal.

382
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,582
You're a paralegal.

383
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,592
(LAUGHING)...

384
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,353
- That was not funny.
- Not funny, dude.

385
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,483
I know. It was hilarious.

386
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:44,293
- Why would you do that?
- I did it to prove a point.

387
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,303
(SCOFFS) What point?

388
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,319
Stay with me, it's gonna come to me.

389
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,172
Okay, here's the point.

390
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:54,864
You thought that Mary
was a sure thing, right?

391
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,569
So what happened? She took you up
to a hotel room on the first date.

392
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,348
All you have to do is be that confident
with every girl you meet...

393
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,593
and your slump's over.

394
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,404
So the message is,
I should treat every woman like a whore?

395
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,480
Come on, dude.
You should be thanking me.

396
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,396
She slapped me and stormed off.

397
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,909
Can you blame her?
You called her a hooker.

398
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:15,783
I'm sorry, dude. It was funny.

399
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,732
Yeah. Well, it's getting late.

400
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,744
- I should get back to my room.
- Your room?

401
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,778
Yeah, that really expensive hotel room
you put on your credit card,

402
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:25,971
never checked out.
By the way, you know what's super fun?

403
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,559
Pouring Dom Perignon
down a bathtub drain.

404
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:32,397
Well, it's almost 3:00.
Got a massage. Toodles!

405
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,514
Come on.
If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.
