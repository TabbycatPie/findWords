1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:02,006
- Hey, yo, you wanna put
your hands up,

2
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,007
because we're going all out.

3
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,433
- All right, so where's
the supplier?

4
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,131
- I'm not sure.

5
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:22,003
My contact's gonna meet the guy
upstairs at the card game.

6
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:25,616
It wasn't easy getting you guys
in here, making you look legit.

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,008
- That's part of your deal.

8
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,880
- This gonna be enough
to clear my case?

9
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:30,577
- You get us the guy
selling China White,

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:33,580
I'm gonna clear your record
and never bother you again.

11
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:36,670
- Get eyes upstairs,
let's ID the supplier.

12
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:39,325
- Who's this guy?

13
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:41,675
Three body guards, wad of cash.

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,199
Looks like this guy's
coming to play.

15
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,766
- All right, heads up.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,378
We got a male, Hispanic, 30s,
5'7", buck-50.

17
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:52,381
He's in a blue coat coming in
with three additional.

18
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,079
- Copy that.
[camera snaps]

19
00:00:57,343 --> 00:01:00,085
All right, game on.

20
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,087
- We got a positive ID
on facial rec,

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,654
Frank Delgado,
got a sheet here,

22
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,655
multiple drug arrests.

23
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,918
He just walked in.

24
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,702
- Frank, now we got a game.

25
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:10,225
Sit down so I can take
your money.

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,885
Well, well, well, well, well,
well, well.

27
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,844
- Can I pour you gentlemen
some shots?

28
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,976
- Yeah, let's get a round.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,196
- So, uh, what's your name?

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,545
- Candy.

31
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,330
You know, I got a bit of
a sweet tooth.

32
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:31,072
- You know, I get that
all the time.

33
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:36,208
- Listen, Candy, I'll give you
$500 to take off your dress.

34
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:39,733
- The bar has a pretty strict
dress code.

35
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:43,084
- A thousand.

36
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:47,262
- There we go, smile for
the camera, you jagoff.

37
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:50,918
- We got eyes on the supplier
yet?

38
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:51,789
- Whoo.

39
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,051
Yeah, facial rec just popped,

40
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:55,140
Matthew Garrett,
lighting up the board.

41
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,750
He's got multiple
drug arrests.

42
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:58,970
- Matthew Garret?
That's not possible.

43
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,275
- Am I blind?
I mean...

44
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,973
Yeah, Pontiac Prison,
he just go released.

45
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,327
- That's our guy.

46
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,763
- Son of a bitch.
This can't be happening.

47
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,939
- What are you talking about?

48
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,333
- I got history with him.
He can't see me.

49
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,291
- He knows you?

50
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:21,514
- Why are you leaving?

51
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,994
- It's a long story.

52
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:24,952
- Okay, but I did my thing,
so we're all good, right?

53
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,737
- Yeah, you did great.

54
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,783
Come on.
Come on, we gotta go.

55
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,959
- Hey, yo.
Yo, I know you.

56
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,700
- Nah, I think you got me
mixed up with somebody, man.

57
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:36,877
- Nah, nah, nah,
you're that cop, Halstead.

58
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:41,708
- You're that punk that murders
teenage girls, Garrett.

59
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,975
Watch yourself.
- What are you gonna do, cop?

60
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:51,587
That's what you wanna do?

61
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,024
Come on, please, right here.

62
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,679
Please, take a swing,
I'm begging you, please.

63
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,506
Oh, my God, Chicago PD,
they might give me

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,725
another 200K, maybe even more.

65
00:02:58,769 --> 00:02:59,813
Right here, sweetheart,
don't miss.

66
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,815
- Come on, come on, let's go.

67
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,209
This dude ain't worth it.

68
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,737
- See you around, Halstead,
you coward.

69
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,827
- Who is that?
- The devil.

70
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,008
- The mystery player
bringing in China White

71
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,357
is Matthew Garrett.

72
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,750
He was doing 20 years for
possession

73
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,012
with intent to distribute,

74
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,014
served six, was released
last month.

75
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:29,451
- So the police put in
the proper paperwork

76
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,757
before they did the bust.

77
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:32,367
It was deemed
an illegal search.

78
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,544
That's why the city awarded
Garrett $200,000

79
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,807
for wrongful arrest.

80
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,373
- Huh.

81
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,853
- Now he's using the settlement
from the city

82
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:41,159
to corner the market on
high-end heroin.

83
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:42,813
- Gotta love
the justice system.

84
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,119
- I get it,
but we gotta stand down.

85
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,600
Ivory tower doesn't want us
chasing these so-called

86
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,775
wrongful conviction
offenders.

87
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,864
- Sarge, to hell with that.

88
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:53,737
Garrett's not just a drug
dealer, he's a murderer.

89
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,216
He killed Lauren Sanders.

90
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,871
She was 17 years old,
she ran away from home.

91
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,046
Garrett found her,
he pimped her out,

92
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,874
and then she just disappeared.

93
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:03,572
We found her bloody clothes
in a dumpster.

94
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,575
We never found her body,
so we couldn't make the case.

95
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:10,710
All due respect, standing down
should not be an option.

96
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,413
- Okay, let's go after him.

97
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,764
I mean, the good news is,
prick's got ambition,

98
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,810
means we can catch him dirty,
put him away once and for all.

99
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:25,812
So dig into Garrett's
associates,

100
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,596
talk to your C.I.'s,
let's find a way in.

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,772
Set up a buy/bust.

102
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,990
So who made the arrest,

103
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:31,600
put him away
in the first place?

104
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:34,299
- Narcotics, Garrett was part
of the Beverly Crew.

105
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,692
- That's good,
I got a guy who can help.

106
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,434
- Thanks, Sarge.
- Hmm.

107
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,394
I gotta tell you, Gus,
you have not aged.

108
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:45,876
- Tell that to my knees.

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,574
Hey, thanks. How's Erika?

110
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,097
- She's back in Florida.

111
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,666
Got the place all to myself.

112
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,407
- Miss seeing you around, bro.

113
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,105
- Well, if you get nostalgic,
I'm still on YouTube.

114
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,933
1.6 million views,

115
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,022
everywhere I go,
people know me.

116
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,676
Last time I went out for
a cup of coffee,

117
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,591
the barista spit in my face.

118
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,027
- Jesus.

119
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,812
- That video didn't show

120
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,336
the dirtbag beating the hell
out of his pregnant girlfriend,

121
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,556
just the part where
I pulled him off...

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,949
did what I did.

123
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,690
Heat of the moment.

124
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,126
- I know.

125
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,825
- 23-year career down
the drain in 19 seconds.

126
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,348
What are you gonna do?

127
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:27,874
- Hmm.
Let me ask you something, Gus.

128
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,920
When you took down
the Beverly Crew,

129
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,487
you come across a guy named
Matthew Garrett?

130
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,229
- Oh, yeah.
I buried his ass.

131
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,883
- Well, you didn't bury him
deep enough,

132
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,406
he just got released.

133
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,451
- You kidding?

134
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:40,669
- Yeah, he's back out
on the street,

135
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,671
he's dealing high-end heroin,

136
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,848
so we're looking for a way in.

137
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,458
I thought maybe
you might have an idea.

138
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,808
- Garrett had a sweet spot
for his little cousin,

139
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,201
kid named Tyler Reynolds.

140
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,333
- Right, you know where I can
find this Tyler kid?

141
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:55,162
- He's doing 10 years at
Stateville for armed robbery.

142
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:59,514
Tyler was just the driver,
he took the weight for Garrett.

143
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:00,776
- Hmm.

144
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,692
Yeah, I think I can work
with that.

145
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,477
Appreciate your time, Gus.

146
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,609
Listen, you need anything,
you let me know.

147
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,176
- No, I'm good, Hank.

148
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,178
Got half my pension,
my health.

149
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:14,268
And who the hell would wanna be
a cop in this day and age?

150
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,800
- Matt Garrett.

151
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,326
Right?
- Hey, yo.

152
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:29,936
- Easy, man.

153
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,633
- Who the hell are you?

154
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,201
- I'm Chris Wilson,
I'm a friend of Tyler's.

155
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,377
We're neighbors on cell bock H.

156
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:38,423
- Tyler didn't tell me
he had a boyfriend.

157
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,251
Hadn't said anything about you.

158
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:42,818
- Well, he said a lot
about you.

159
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,038
How he took the weight for that
robbery back in the day,

160
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,866
and you owe him a favor.

161
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,389
I'm the favor.

162
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,959
You can call him,
he'll vouch for me.

163
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,484
- Does Tyler still got that
funny little scar on his head?

164
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,965
- Tyler doesn't have any scars,
he's a baby face.

165
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,968
Maybe you forgot,
maybe you need to go see him.

166
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:03,491
- So what'd they pop you for,
Christopher?

167
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:06,842
- Cops hung a armed robbery
charge on me.

168
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,193
- Hmm.

169
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:11,282
Come over here a second.

170
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:20,552
- So listen, Tyler told me
you were the guy

171
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:22,771
to talk to about heroin.

172
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,251
- You're in the game, right?

173
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,644
You dole out supplies,
why are you coming to me,

174
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,862
to a complete stranger?

175
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,430
- Apparently you have
China White.

176
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,432
Yeah?

177
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:34,522
Look man, I got a lot of
clients in the north burbs,

178
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:37,351
and they don't want that
dirty brown heroin.

179
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,353
These are white people
that want white stuff.

180
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:42,313
They got the green
to pay for it.

181
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,706
- How 'bout you, Chris?
You got the green?

182
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,492
- I can get it, yeah.

183
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,581
- Tell you what,
I'll touch base with Tyler.

184
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:52,323
If your story checks out,
maybe we can do business.

185
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,151
- All right, works for me.

186
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:55,891
- The buy-in's 50K.

187
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,763
- I can make that happen.

188
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,504
- And I'll need that by today.

189
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,549
- By today.

190
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,988
- Shouldn't be a problem,
if you're serious.

191
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,641
All right?

192
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:09,166
Hey, Santana,
let's get out of here.

193
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,864
- See you, pal.

194
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:17,739
- Sir.

195
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,569
Superintendent.
- Sergeant.

196
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,144
You called me?

197
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:36,149
- Yeah, I saw your request
for 1505 funds.

198
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:38,369
- I'm not sure how that
ended up on your desk.

199
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:39,848
- Well, it's a new policy.

200
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:42,155
Anything $50,000 or over
requires my approval.

201
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,678
What's it for?

202
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,072
- We got a time-sensitive play
on an offender

203
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:47,160
dealing bulk heroin.

204
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,032
- And who's the offender?

205
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,859
- Matthew Garrett.

206
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:52,557
- As in the Matthew Garrett

207
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,211
who was just released
from prison?

208
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:56,691
- We weren't targeting Garrett.

209
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,955
Chased that heroin case,
he just fell in our lap.

210
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,481
- We just cut this bastard
a check for $200,000.

211
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,484
It was a big, fat black eye
for this department

212
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,268
and for the city.
- I get it.

213
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:11,358
We can't be cute,
too many eyes on us.

214
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,099
You authorize that 50K,

215
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,580
I can have Garrett in bracelets
tonight.

216
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,975
- Look, we all hate this prick
and yes,

217
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,195
he belongs behind bars.

218
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,980
But I cannot have members of
the CPD out there

219
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:29,376
acting like vigilantes,
not at this point in time.

220
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,554
There's about
100 different ways

221
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,643
this whole thing could go
wrong.

222
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,560
Walk away, Sergeant.

223
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,606
- Yes, sir.

224
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,959
- Jay.
Hey.

225
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,395
You all right? Where you going?

226
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,744
- No, I just got off the phone
with Voight.

227
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,398
He said Kelton denied
the 1505 funds.

228
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,444
- He's just covering his ass.

229
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,054
Look, Garrett's doing
bad things,

230
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,229
he's gonna make a mistake.

231
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:57,404
We'll catch him
sooner or later.

232
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:58,710
- Hailey, we got him right now.

233
00:09:58,753 --> 00:09:59,928
All we have to do
is make a deal.

234
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:02,105
- Jay, you got a visitor.

235
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,591
- Hello?

236
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,030
- Do you remember me?

237
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,641
- Yeah, of course,
Mrs. Sanders.

238
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,818
- They released the monster
who murdered my daughter?

239
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,211
And they gave him money?

240
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,864
What kind of world is this?

241
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:25,432
- I don't know, I really don't.
- What I don't understand

242
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:27,739
is why
nobody bothered to tell me.

243
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:32,135
Nobody had the courage
to look me in the eye.

244
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,484
- I'm--I'm so sorry.

245
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:36,617
- Eight years, and you know
something?

246
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:41,187
I can't let it go,
because I am so outraged

247
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:44,495
that he still exists
and my daughter doesn't.

248
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:47,150
We never even found her body.

249
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:49,369
- I know, look, I promise you--

250
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,545
- Don't make me
any more promises.

251
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,287
I told you he would kill her.

252
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,637
You were supposed to stop it.

253
00:10:58,857 --> 00:10:59,814
You didn't.

254
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,569
- Hey, Sarge,
I talked to Trudy.

255
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,571
The counterfeit crew that
we busted last year,

256
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,704
the money was still
in the evidence room.

257
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,621
We'll just flash the money,

258
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:24,839
Garrett's not gonna look
too close.

259
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,232
We got the hook in,

260
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,842
I think we gotta keep the deal
on track--

261
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,366
- Jay, you do know we were told
to stand down, right?

262
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:30,671
- So you wanna let
this guy go

263
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,977
just because Kelton wants
to be Mayor?

264
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,718
- I don't care about Kelton.

265
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,024
I did some digging
into Matthew Garrett,

266
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,852
got a hit on him as a victim.

267
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,507
Filed an official complaint
against a police officer

268
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,857
who threatened
physical violence.

269
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,555
Turns out,
that officer was you.

270
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:47,601
- Garrett is an evil guy.
I was just being a cop.

271
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,733
It was a ploy to get me
off his back.

272
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,387
- The allegation was sustained.

273
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,997
Your superior officer
took you off the case.

274
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,521
- I obeyed that order
and a girl went missing.

275
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:57,089
If we let this deal go away,
then we lose Garrett.

276
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:00,223
And if he hurts another girl,
that is on us.

277
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,234
You're not the first one
through the door.

278
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,844
You're background.

279
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,327
Hey, you talked to Garrett?

280
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,545
- Yeah, he wants to meet
in an hour.

281
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,287
- All right, confirm the meet.

282
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,984
- So we're back up?
- We are.

283
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,465
Hey, I don't want Adam
going in there alone.

284
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,250
Take someone with you,
right-hand man.

285
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,686
- What about
a right-hand woman?

286
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:31,254
- Do it. Cameras and mics.

287
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,299
- What about Kelton?

288
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:35,606
- I'll deal with Kelton.

289
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,396
- We're in position.

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,268
- All right, let me know when
you got Garrett in pocket.

291
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,314
Remember Jay,
stay in the shadows.

292
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,273
- Yeah, copy.

293
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,624
- So the mother of
the murdered girl

294
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,103
came to see you?

295
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,062
- Yeah.

296
00:12:58,063 --> 00:12:59,586
- Anything you wanna talk
about?

297
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,761
- No.

298
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,159
All right, here he comes.

299
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,859
- You got Garrett on the way,
and he's got two males with him

300
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,296
and a young girl.

301
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,688
- They're headed towards
the coffee shop.

302
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,561
- Yeah, we see 'em.

303
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,395
How's it going, Matt?

304
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,918
- You didn't say
you were bringing a friend.

305
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,267
- Yeah, I could say
the same to you.

306
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,791
This is my partner,
this is Marcia.

307
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:33,228
- Shouldn't you be at a kids'
soccer practice or something?

308
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,666
- Exactly, I even drive
a minivan.

309
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,450
- Two traps and a 357,

310
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:40,410
she's very good at what
she does, I promise.

311
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,585
- And this is?

312
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,500
- Oh, this is Jill.

313
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,153
Hey, why don't you, uh,

314
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,807
go and get yourself
something to eat.

315
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,287
I'll come and find you later.

316
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:49,723
Get a receipt.

317
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,860
Ah, look at all these
runaways.

318
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,863
They come from all over,

319
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,605
you know, looking for a fix,

320
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,389
trying to find Daddy.

321
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:08,002
But you get 'em hooked,
they'll do anything you want.

322
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,700
- Amen.

323
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,357
- Is this making you feel
uncomfortable?

324
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:18,535
- I'll let you boys
talk business.

325
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,017
- Why the hell is Burgess
walking away?

326
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,672
- I got no idea.

327
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,153
Hailey, you got eyes
on Burgess?

328
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:32,200
- No, I'm not sure
where she went.

329
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:35,552
- Okay, you said
you wanted serious.

330
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:37,902
I brought you serious.

331
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,608
- Hey. Jill, right?

332
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:52,264
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, Marcia.

333
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:58,705
So, Jill, how long have you
known Garrett?

334
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:00,533
- I met him a few days ago.

335
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,538
- Look, I don't know you, Jill,
and you don't know me,

336
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:10,021
but I do know about Garrett,
and he is not a good guy, okay?

337
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,501
- He's nice to me.

338
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,067
- Let me guess, he took you
to a fancy dinner

339
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,417
and bought you some nice,
new clothes?

340
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,723
Right?
Come on, Jill, think about it.

341
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,116
You know where this is going,

342
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,944
you know what he's gonna
ask you to do next.

343
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,642
- Why are you doing this?

344
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,731
- My sister was hurt by a man
like that.

345
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,255
I don't want it to happen
to you too.

346
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,562
Do you any place else
you can go, just any place?

347
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:30,911
- No.

348
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,565
- Here.

349
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:34,262
This is $200, I want you to go
out the back door

350
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,568
and get away from this guy.

351
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,091
You just call your parents
or your friends.

352
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,485
Just get out of here, okay?

353
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,487
Okay, now I need you to move,
okay?

354
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:42,619
Go, go, go.

355
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,926
- So where'd your partner go?

356
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,059
- I'm guessing a little
pick-me-up.

357
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,800
- How do I know
she can be trusted?

358
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:54,239
- Don't worry about her,
you're just dealing with me.

359
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:57,198
Come on, let's pick a spot,
get this deal done.

360
00:15:57,242 --> 00:16:00,288
I got 50K burning a hole
in this bag.

361
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:04,684
Let's get this deal done.
- Come on, let's go.

362
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,080
- Garrett's on the move.

363
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,126
- Where is she?

364
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,606
- Who?
- Jill, the girl I was with.

365
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,955
Where is she?

366
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,391
- I don't know.
- Is she in there?

367
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,916
- I don't think so.
- Go and check. Check.

368
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,136
- Look, man, I'm not trying to
push you or anything,

369
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,529
but I got a lot of money here,

370
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,791
I'm starting to get
a little nervous.

371
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:27,315
You wanna do this deal or not?

372
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,796
- You keep your phone on,
I'll be in touch.

373
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,232
- Okay.

374
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:37,543
Boss.
- Yeah?

375
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:39,545
- Talked to Garrett,
the deal's on.

376
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,025
- All right, you got
a location?

377
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,548
- Yeah, Beverly Yards,
tomorrow at noon.

378
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,855
- All right, get the
surveillance van, cameras.

379
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,421
Let's nail this guy.

380
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,814
Jay, remember,
you're background,

381
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,034
you got the long-eye.

382
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,081
- No sign of Garrett.

383
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,652
- Okay, well, we got
a blue coupe headed your way,

384
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:02,220
might be our target,
two passengers.

385
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,179
- Here we go, game time.

386
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,967
- We don't pounce till
we see those drugs.

387
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:20,151
- What the hell?
Garrett's not in the car.

388
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,597
Where's Garrett?
- He's with the dope.

389
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,381
He's not moving until
you give me that money.

390
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,774
- What, do you we think
we're stupid?

391
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,384
The deal was a hand-to-hand
with Garrett,

392
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:37,690
that was the deal.

393
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,170
- He never said anything about
a let-go, man.

394
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,606
So we're not gonna let go.

395
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,390
- You are if you want
your product.

396
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,872
- Look, man, we want
the product,

397
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,135
you're just changing the rules
in the middle of the game.

398
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,528
All right,
here's what we'll do.

399
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,835
I'll stay here with you
and the money,

400
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,532
she'll go pick up the drugs.

401
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:56,100
Why don't you call Garrett
and tell him the new plan?

402
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,234
- You gonna call him or are
we gonna go our separate ways?

403
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,202
- He's not answering.

404
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,685
- You know the address?

405
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,992
All right, I'm gonna take that
as a yes.

406
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,254
Why don't you just tell us,

407
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,648
and we'll go meet him
in person?

408
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:27,697
Tell us now or we take
the money and we walk.

409
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,698
Last chance.

410
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:33,746
- I see, this guy's a chump.

411
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,314
You don't know anything.

412
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,752
- It's the old warehouse...

413
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:41,145
On McKenzie.

414
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,503
- 5021 George,
what's your 20?

415
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,679
Halstead, you cop--

416
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,546
- Oh, it's you.

417
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,766
- Yeah, that's right.

418
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,593
What happened, Garrett?
Who did this?

419
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,335
Hey, Garrett, listen to me.
I will get you help.

420
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,598
I'll call you an ambulance.

421
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,992
You gotta tell me, where is
Lauren Sanders' body?

422
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,429
- Call an ambulance.
- No, you make this right.

423
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:49,517
You make this right,

424
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,823
you tell me where her body is,

425
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,346
and I will call you
an ambulance.

426
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,826
You understand me?

427
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,350
Garrett, you got a chance
to do something good.

428
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,787
You can make amends.

429
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:06,230
Kiss my ass.

430
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,362
- Garrett.

431
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:12,366
Garrett. Garrett!

432
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:22,376
- Jay?
You all right?

433
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,422
- Yeah.

434
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:26,859
- What the hell happened?

435
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,873
- That is exactly how
I found him.

436
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,527
I arrived, I cleared
the premises first,

437
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,658
I tried to render aid...

438
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:42,921
- Hmm.

439
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:45,967
- And then Hailey arrived
just after me.

440
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,490
- And the China White?

441
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,840
- Nothing yet, still looking.

442
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,711
- We talked to a crime tech,

443
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:52,669
preliminary time of death
is 12:10.

444
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:53,888
- Hmm.

445
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,498
- Hailey called us over
at 12:23.

446
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,197
Whoever killed this guy,
we just missed him.

447
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,676
- Hello, Leonard.

448
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,939
- Intelligence in the house.
- Hey.

449
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:02,157
- And I thought I was gonna be
figuring out

450
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,855
who killed some worthless
bad guy.

451
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,465
- He was worthless all right.

452
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:07,772
Trying to set up a drug bust,
somebody got here first.

453
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:09,034
- So your guy see anything?

454
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:10,600
- No, he was dead when
we got here.

455
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,515
- Murder weapon?
- Didn't find one.

456
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,866
Didn't find the drugs either,
figured whoever killed him

457
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:15,867
probably took 'em.

458
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,955
- So who found the body?

459
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,565
- One of my guys.

460
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:19,653
- Well, that's more of
a head start

461
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,046
than I usually get.

462
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:22,830
We'll take it from here, man.
- You know what?

463
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:25,572
If you don't mind, Leonard,
we'd like to run with this one.

464
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,226
- Why?

465
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,446
- DOA was our target,
we were told to stand down

466
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,274
not work him, so...

467
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,886
There's gonna be headaches
on this,

468
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,322
I don't wanna get you
jammed up.

469
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:37,889
- Okay, be my guest.

470
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:45,940
- So?

471
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,856
- I know I shouldn't have
gone in without backup,

472
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,771
but the deal was going
sideways and we were gonna--

473
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,120
- Jay, I think you
and I both know

474
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,296
that's not the question
you're gonna answer.

475
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:59,432
Upton found you standing over
Garrett's dead body, alone,

476
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,782
in a situation you would never
and should never

477
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,218
enter without backup.

478
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,525
So what the hell happened
in there?

479
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,529
- He was alive
when I got there.

480
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:14,012
Somebody already shot him.

481
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:16,188
I don't know who,
there was nobody else around.

482
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:19,365
- Why didn't you call it in?

483
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,716
- 'Cause I knew he wasn't
gonna make it.

484
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,935
I've seen enough
of those injuries.

485
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:25,893
- Uh-huh.

486
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,422
- I wanted to find out
where Lauren's body was

487
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,294
for her mother.

488
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:36,295
- Huh.

489
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:37,905
- So I gave that prick
one chance

490
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:40,647
to redeem his miserable life,
he didn't take it.

491
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,171
He told me to kiss his ass.

492
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,218
- Okay.

493
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:53,094
Listen, anybody asks you,
I mean, anybody...

494
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,531
Garrett was dead
when you got there.

495
00:22:57,055 --> 00:23:00,319
That's it. Hmm?

496
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,929
- All right.

497
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,627
Thanks, Sarge.

498
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,194
- Okay.

499
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,198
- Sarge, check this out.

500
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:12,287
Casing found at the scene,
it looks like a match to

501
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:14,072
the slug that killed Garrett.

502
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:15,682
- All right, well, let's hear
what Ballistics says.

503
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:16,857
We got anything else?

504
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,250
- No, we got nothing, Sarge.

505
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,078
We got no weapons,
no witnesses, no dope.

506
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:22,254
- No sign of struggle either,
which suggests Garrett

507
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,386
either knew his assailant
or was caught by surprise.

508
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,692
- He got popped
for his product.

509
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:26,998
- Yeah.

510
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,521
- Isn't it ironic
that we're the ones

511
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:29,957
that have to clear the murder
for this prick?

512
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,567
- Well, that's what
we gotta do.

513
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,874
So let's call in favors
with everyone who can help.

514
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,311
Okay, I don't care how much
we hated this son of a bitch,

515
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:38,226
we gotta find who killed him,
fast.

516
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,011
Hey, dig back into that
card game.

517
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:41,534
Who the hell had a beef
with Garrett?

518
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:43,188
Let's hit everyone
at that card game.

519
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,364
- I just got a tip
from a C.I.

520
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,627
Someone's looking to move
a lot of China White

521
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,628
on the south side.

522
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:49,846
- Location?

523
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,196
- Uh, Chicago Convention
Center,

524
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,328
drop's gonna be in
an employee locker.

525
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:54,721
- Hit it.

526
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:16,699
Ah, get off me!

527
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,312
- Oh, Santana,
you remember me?

528
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,661
- I remember you.

529
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:23,445
- Come on, man.
Come on.

530
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:25,143
- Stop.

531
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,407
- Ask him if he dropped
something.

532
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:31,758
- You drop something?

533
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:38,025
- We found your friend
at the west side warehouse

534
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:39,461
with a bullet in his neck.

535
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:41,028
- I don't know nothing
about that.

536
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,595
- Really, you sure?

537
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,075
'Cause he happened to be
missing a kilo of China White

538
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:45,641
we found in
your duffle bag.

539
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:49,906
- We also got a footprint
from that crime scene.

540
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,256
You a size 11?

541
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,822
- That don't mean I killed him.

542
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,172
- Does mean you were there.

543
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:56,435
- Mike, this thing is pretty
open and shut.

544
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:57,871
We're just going through
the formalities,

545
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,177
so we can go home.

546
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,266
So if you have anything
to say, say it now.

547
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,138
- Look, Garrett and I were
there to do a deal.

548
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:06,445
I was outside the warehouse,
heard the gunshot,

549
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:07,837
and ran inside.

550
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,448
I didn't see anyone else.

551
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,973
I swear, that's it.
I didn't kill nobody.

552
00:25:13,017 --> 00:25:15,019
- Mike...

553
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:16,455
the way I see it,

554
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,980
shooting Matthew Garrett
was a community service.

555
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,286
So you give us
the murder weapon,

556
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,071
help us clear this case,
I'll see if I can have

557
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,942
your charges lowered
to manslaughter.

558
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:27,509
- I wanna help you, all right?

559
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:29,294
I'm telling you the truth,
I didn't kill him.

560
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,992
He told me to take the heroin
and run, so I did.

561
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:33,385
He was alive when I left.

562
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,126
- Where'd you run?
- To my car.

563
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,345
I was parked out back
of the warehouse.

564
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,961
- Hailey, what's up?

565
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:48,313
- Hey, uh, I got some footage
from the warehouse.

566
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:50,141
Turns out Santana
was telling the truth.

567
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,447
He left out the back door
at 12:05.

568
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:55,189
This next part might be
a bit of a problem, though.

569
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,625
You said you got to
the warehouse

570
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:58,497
a few minutes before us.

571
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,847
- I'm not sure exactly,
but yeah.

572
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,284
- Okay, well...

573
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,372
According to this,
you were there

574
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,592
a full ten minutes before us.

575
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:12,598
- I mean, I must have been
in there longer than I thought.

576
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,820
- And then you shut off
your radio

577
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:19,387
before you went inside.

578
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,956
- Yeah.

579
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,871
What are you saying?

580
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:28,222
- Jay, you went dark before
you went in the warehouse.

581
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,702
You weren't even supposed
to be there

582
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,051
in the first place.

583
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,009
You were alone with Garrett
for ten minutes,

584
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,881
and you never called it in.

585
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,404
If anyone looks at these facts,

586
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:37,884
given your history
with Garrett,

587
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:40,452
they're gonna assume
that you had an agenda.

588
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,151
- Is that what you think?

589
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:45,761
- Come on.

590
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:48,895
And it doesn't matter
what I think,

591
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,071
these are the questions
they're gonna ask you.

592
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:54,335
Did you have an agenda?

593
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,858
- The deal was blown,

594
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:57,512
I thought Garrett was gonna
disappear,

595
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:59,123
so yeah, I went after him.

596
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,168
I didn't know what I was
gonna do when I saw him.

597
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:03,692
I didn't know.

598
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:07,218
He was already bleeding out
when I got there.

599
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,697
- And then what'd you do?

600
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:13,398
- I knew he wasn't
gonna make it,

601
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,791
and I tried to make him
tell me where her body is.

602
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,233
- Jay...

603
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,974
You crossed lines,
you didn't render aid.

604
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,107
- I know.

605
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,675
- That's official misconduct,
you can go to prison.

606
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:39,119
- Homicide wants to talk to me.

607
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,478
- Thanks for coming.

608
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:53,219
- So, uh, what's this about?

609
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:56,788
- Ah, just clearing up
this Matthew Garrett business.

610
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:59,660
What a thoroughly despicable
human being.

611
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,533
Good riddance, huh?

612
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:03,969
- Is that a question?

613
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,581
- Hell of a thing.

614
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,627
Hard enough being a cop
these days;

615
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,020
paperwork, cell phone cameras,

616
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:14,588
everybody looking for ways
to blow you up.

617
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:17,330
And a horrible criminal
like Matthew Garrett

618
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:21,421
gets released with a gift
of $200,000.

619
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,206
- Detective,
stop jerking me around.

620
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,425
You wanna ask me something,
just go ahead and ask me,

621
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,513
otherwise, I'm gonna walk out
of here.

622
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:31,605
Why'd you go dark?

623
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:33,520
We pulled the tracking records
from your unit.

624
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:37,263
You turned off your phone
and your GPS at 12:15.

625
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:40,353
- I turned my phone off because
I was afraid of a random call

626
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:41,920
just tipping off our suspect.

627
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,661
- Something else
I don't understand,

628
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:45,837
you had history
with Garrett.

629
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,493
He would recognize you.
Why go into the warehouse?

630
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,103
- I was in my vehicle,

631
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,061
I was the closest one
to the warehouse,

632
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:55,020
and I heard over the radio that
the deal was going sideways.

633
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:56,543
And I knew he had heroin
on him,

634
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,718
so I figured we'd at least
catch him

635
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:58,806
on a possession charge.

636
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,155
- You didn't wait for backup?

637
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,940
- I was afraid he'd get rid of
the drugs

638
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,724
and then he'd get away.
He'd still be on the street.

639
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,900
You wanna write me up
for being impatient, go ahead.

640
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,299
- So just to confirm...

641
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:15,432
He was dead when you got there?

642
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:19,000
- This sounds like I need
my FOP lawyer.

643
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,097
- Just doing
our due diligence.

644
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:31,404
Appreciate your time,
Detective.

645
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,934
- Why are you jamming up
Jay Halstead?

646
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,414
- Beg your pardon.

647
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,635
- Halstead was doing his job
to apprehend an offender.

648
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:46,114
- An offender he had
a history with.

649
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:49,727
Yes, I talked to Tillman,
and he told me there were

650
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,947
problems with Halstead's
version of the events.

651
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,080
This city is no longer
gonna tolerate

652
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:58,692
cowboy behavior from
its police, not on my watch.

653
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,433
- Lose the campaign speech,
Brian.

654
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:02,043
There's no cameras here.

655
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,437
How 'bout you and I just shoot
each other straight?

656
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,786
- You wanna shoot it straight,
Hank?

657
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,353
- Yeah!
- I told you to stay the hell

658
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:08,441
off of this one.

659
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,790
The last thing this city needs

660
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:10,835
is another cop involved

661
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,402
in a questionable shooting.

662
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:16,144
And if that is what
this turns out to be,

663
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,885
I'm not coming out on
the wrong side of it.

664
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,583
- Halstead didn't shoot
Garrett.

665
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,106
- Who did?
- I don't know yet!

666
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,456
- Your guy had motive
and he went dark.

667
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,110
This is a murder,

668
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:28,287
and right now Jay Halstead
is suspect number one.

669
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:36,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:38,950
- Jay.

671
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:40,908
Listen, I just talked
to Kelton,

672
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:42,475
this thing isn't going away.

673
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,825
They're still looking at you
for the Garrett murder.

674
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:47,175
- Are you telling me
I gotta call my FOP lawyer?

675
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,612
- Well, I wouldn't.

676
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:50,265
Just spark more attention,
make things worse.

677
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,050
- I think I gotta protect
myself, Sarge.

678
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,269
- I think they best way
for you to protect yourself

679
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,359
is for us to go out there
and the find the guy

680
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,838
who actually did kill Garrett.

681
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:01,015
Then this whole thing
will just wash away.

682
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,148
- I talked to Maury
at Ballistics...

683
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:04,671
- Huh.

684
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:06,194
- They're still working
on the official report

685
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,196
of the Garrett shooting,
but he shared with me

686
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,197
the unofficial report.

687
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,329
- Okay.

688
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:11,591
- The slug that killed Garrett

689
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,376
is a match to a slug
used at a robbery

690
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:15,073
at a Pilsen store in 2015.

691
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:17,510
The guy they busted
was Frank Delgado.

692
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:19,164
- Delgado was at
the poker game.

693
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,688
- Makes sense, we know he was
after the China White.

694
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,603
- Plus, we got an LKA
in Pilsen.

695
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:24,909
- All right, so hit it.

696
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:26,432
Remember, we are on a clock,

697
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:27,825
so let's make sure
we get this guy.

698
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:29,217
Jay, you hang here.

699
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:30,697
I don't want you leaving
the District.

700
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:37,704
- Chicago PD!

701
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:41,839
- Clear!

702
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,625
- Clear.
- Clear!

703
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,410
- We got a runner!

704
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:48,759
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

705
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,848
- Wrong exit, pal.

706
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:53,807
- What the hell are you doing?
Antonio!

707
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,418
- I got him, go ahead.
- I didn't do anything!

708
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:57,898
- Spread your arms!
Stay still. Give me your hand.

709
00:31:57,942 --> 00:31:59,117
Give me your hand.

710
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,466
- Go.

711
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:11,436
- We know you were doing
business with Matthew Garrett.

712
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:14,613
- I don't even know
who that is.

713
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,441
- You sure about that?

714
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,142
Hmm?

715
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,581
- Remember that night?

716
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,757
I got offered $1,000
to take my dress off.

717
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:32,282
- That guy...yeah.

718
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,849
We played cards.

719
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,417
- You found out he was holding
heroin at the warehouse,

720
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:40,116
and instead of paying for it...

721
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,292
You put a bullet in his neck.

722
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,207
- Nah, that wasn't me.

723
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:45,774
- Where were you at noon?

724
00:32:45,818 --> 00:32:48,342
- I was still in bed.
- So you don't have an alibi.

725
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:54,479
- Look, there's no upside
in taking Garrett out.

726
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,263
He had the hookup
for China White.

727
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:57,786
He's the golden goose.

728
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,441
- What I don't understand
is we got ballistics back

729
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:02,617
on the bullet that killed
Garrett.

730
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,186
And it's a match to a Glock 17
you used to rob

731
00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:07,622
a liquor store four years ago.

732
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,538
- I don't got that gun anymore.

733
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:13,106
When I got busted,
the cops took it off me,

734
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,629
I never seen it again.

735
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:16,196
- If the cops took it off you,

736
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,676
it would have been booked
in the evidence.

737
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,592
- Then maybe somebody
un-booked it.

738
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:23,899
Wouldn't be the first time
Chicago Police played dirty.

739
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:34,519
- Hey, Sarge, I found
the Delgado case file.

740
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:35,694
- All right,
you go through it?

741
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,347
- Yeah, so according to
the report,

742
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,610
the clerk struggled with
the assailant, Delgado,

743
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,394
before knocking the gun
out of his hands.

744
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,091
And then he claims that he saw
a police officer

745
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:45,094
pick the gun up
after Delgado fled.

746
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,531
- Then we should have the gun.

747
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,663
- I checked, it never was
booked into evidence.

748
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,013
- Who was the arresting
officer?

749
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,544
- Didn't have anywhere
to put 'em,

750
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,763
so we jammed these scumbags
into a phone booth.

751
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,549
Remembering phone booths?
- Barely.

752
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:09,554
- Now there's cell phones,
hashtags, social media.

753
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:14,254
Ask me, technology did not
exactly improve our lives.

754
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:19,389
- You're right about that.

755
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,311
- I gotta hand it to you, Gus.
You almost pulled it off.

756
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:31,445
- Not sure what you're saying.

757
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:35,405
- You know, one thing I can't
figure out is...

758
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,973
How did you know Garrett would
be at the warehouse?

759
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:41,586
- Now I definitely don't know
what you're saying.

760
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,632
- We know about the gun, Gus.

761
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:47,853
The Glock 17 you took off
Frank Delgado.

762
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,771
We traced the ballistics.

763
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:59,560
- Hard to make a case
without recovering the gun.

764
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:02,868
- We can place you
at the warehouse

765
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:05,044
at the time of the murder.

766
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,576
How did you know he was there?

767
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:19,493
- You asking as a cop
or a friend?

768
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:24,541
- I'm asking.

769
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,637
- When I heard that animal
got released,

770
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,813
something just snapped.

771
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:41,689
I gave my life for this job
and it was all a joke.

772
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,125
There's no justice anymore.

773
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:45,737
The system is totally broken.

774
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,571
- So you know what I did?
- Hmm?

775
00:35:56,182 --> 00:36:00,490
- I hit the streets,
just like the old days.

776
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,623
I went digging back
into that world,

777
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,799
worked some leads,
squeezed an old C.I.,

778
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,628
and found out where
the meet was happening.

779
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:09,238
- So you take him out
during a deal.

780
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:11,066
- Bad guys killing bad guys.

781
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,720
- Hmm.

782
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,113
- What's CPD's new name
for it?

783
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:17,682
- Mutual combatants.
- Mutual combatants.

784
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:18,900
- Yeah.

785
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,468
- Figured the CPD wouldn't look
too hard.

786
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,513
I had no idea
you guys were so close

787
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,603
to setting him up.

788
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:29,824
The world's a better place
without Matthew Garrett.

789
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:30,999
Don't you agree?

790
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,089
- I do.

791
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:37,266
- Maybe you can look
the other way on this one.

792
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:45,971
- I can't, Gus.

793
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,279
Otherwise, Homicide's gonna
jam up one of my guys.

794
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,759
He's...

795
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,719
I mean,
he's a hell of a cop.

796
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:59,245
- I was a hell of a cop, Hank.

797
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:01,769
23 years.

798
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,728
And I got blown up for putting
a beating on

799
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:05,033
a convicted rapist.

800
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,166
I lost my career,
I lost my wife,

801
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:09,211
I lost everything.

802
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:12,040
But this scumbag Garrett?

803
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,389
A drug pusher, a killer,

804
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,565
they put him
back on the street?

805
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,569
He gets 200 grand and I gotta
clip coupons?

806
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,875
What the hell happened?

807
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,976
- You know how this works.

808
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,683
- Can I have a little time
alone?

809
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:55,649
Wanna get a few things
in order.

810
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,391
- Yeah, sure, of course.

811
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,001
- Thanks, Hank.

812
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:04,527
You were always
one of the good ones.

813
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,319
- I'll be outside.

814
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:14,728
- Long week.

815
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:17,818
- Yeah.

816
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,562
- You all right?

817
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:29,874
- I just keep thinking
about Lauren's mom.

818
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:33,747
She'll never have closure.

819
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:39,753
- I get it, but you can't right
every wrong, Jay.

820
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:44,236
There's just some things,
some people...

821
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:46,064
You just gotta let it go.

822
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:50,459
- How are you supposed to be
a good cop and let things go?

823
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,374
What's the point of the job?

824
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,943
- Well, the job is to do
the best that you can.

825
00:39:55,987 --> 00:40:00,774
Then you go home, pretend like
the bad stuff never happened.

826
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:04,952
- Is that what you do?

827
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:06,345
- No.

828
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,349
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

829
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,973
- Is that Adam?

830
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,801
- Yeah.

831
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:32,110
- You should go.

832
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,507
- Yeah.

833
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:50,693
I'll see you later.
