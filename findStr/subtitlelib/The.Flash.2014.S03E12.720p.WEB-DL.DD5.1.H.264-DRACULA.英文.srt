1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,140
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,220
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,990
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,540
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,280
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,600
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,030
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,270
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,040
But I won't let that happen.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm gonna do everything in my power

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,050
to change the future,

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,680
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,900
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,160
Previously on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,550
hen I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force,

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,430
I accidentally ran into the future.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,040
I saw Savitar murder you.

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,650
- How are you gonna tell Dad? - I'm not.

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,220
If you guys got something going on,

20
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,690
I hope you know you can talk to me.

21
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,810
Every night when I go to bed,

22
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up and be her.

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,600
I didn't ask for these powers,

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,990
just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

25
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,190
So you're telling me that every time I'm blacking out--

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,340
You've become Alchemy.

27
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,680
Alchemy can restore the powers that people had in Flashpoint.

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,450
What Alchemy did was not your fault.

29
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm saying that at this point in his training,

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,950
- you're faster than Barry! - What?

31
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,290
It's crazy how fast I've gotten in such a short time.

32
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,630
And I'm gonna need you to get a lot faster.

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,930
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar.

34
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,910
You are.

35
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,110
- So this is it, huh? - Yeah.

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,390
This is the starting line to our race.

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,250
Cisco set up sensors all along the course,

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,430
and he'll be tracking your speed all the way to the finish line

39
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,600
on the other side of town.

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,020
No, I meant this is it--

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,260
the day the greatest upset in speedster history goes down.

42
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,640
Wally, man, this isn't about winning or losing.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,510
Okay?

44
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,780
This is about training

45
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,040
so you can get faster

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
and beat Savitar and save Iris.

47
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,870
- Yeah, which I'm gonna do. - Okay.

48
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,650
But first I'm gonna make you eat my dust.

49
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,610
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,690
Okay, you know there is a reason they call me

51
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,930
the fastest man alive.

52
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,850
Cisco, you good?

53
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,850
the Central City Speedster 500 is about to begin.

55
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,800
But first, I've got five-to-one odds

56
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,980
Barry takes down Wally.

57
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,010
- Any takers? - Yep.

58
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,400
Game of speculation? Are we--we're betting?

59
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,650
Yeah, no, I'm in.

60
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,780
On my Earth, financial wagering was banned

61
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,900
after an unfortunate incident with Vice President Al Capone.

62
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,630
Well, lucky for you, you live here now.

63
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,320
- Yes. - Put me down for 20 for Barry.

64
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,710
Joe, got to be in it--come on.

65
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,380
No, not me.

66
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,360
That's a Sophie's Choice I'm not gonna make.

67
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,520
$80 on Barry.

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,230
Mama needs a new confocal microscope.

69
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,400
All right, H.R., you put your life in my hands,

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
so I know for a fact you like high stakes.

71
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,050
How much you in for?

72
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,990
Wallace's recent speed tests ensure that he is a lock.

73
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,390
Put me down for an Abe Lincoln.

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,530
- Hm? - Uh, 100.

75
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,560
Whatever 100 is on this Earth, put me down for that.

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,130
- Guys, we're ready. - All right, all right.

77
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,830
All bets are in, and may the odds be ever in your favor.

78
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,210
Gentlemen, start your engines.

79
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,330
- Ready? - Get set.

80
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,590
Go.

81
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,390
At the first marker, 1/3 of the way in,

86
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,030
Flash is in the lead-- or is that Kid Flash?

87
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,150
Kid Flash! Come on, little Joseph, go.

88
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,890
Come on, mama needs a new pair of shoes.

89
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,830
Come on, Wallace, down the lane!

90
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,400
I think he's done this before.

93
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,730
Ooh, second marker. Wally's in the lead.

94
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,360
Yeah, Wallace! That's my boy!

95
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
- You mean that's my boy. - That's your boy.

96
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,710
I want to double down.

97
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,240
I want to double down on that right now.

98
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,550
Oh, H.R., big spender.

99
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,190
- You serious? - Serious?

100
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,980
Serious as a heart attack, Rich.

103
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,120
Guys, they're neck and neck.

104
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,420
And almost at the finish line.

105
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,090
Yes!

106
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
- Pay up. - Hmm?

107
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,790
Now?

108
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,470
Do you guys take IOUs?

109
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,920
Come on, man, that didn't count.

110
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,030
You know I can't phase yet.

111
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,640
Man, you just saw me do it, right?

112
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,660
And you have to be ready to face any obstacle

113
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,990
that's put in your path.

114
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,490
Yeah, well, don't worry, Barry.

115
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,900
I'ma get faster.

116
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,460
Pretty soon I'm gonna be faster than you.

117
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, yeah?

118
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,330
Well, until then, what's my name?

122
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,980
Joe, hey, this one, is, uh--

123
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,990
Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.

124
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,290
- That's the body? - Yeah, why?

125
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,320
Because he died less than eight hours ago.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Eight hours?

127
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,400
He was a chef here--

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,250
Stuart Holzman -- and the owner confirmed

129
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,840
that he was working last night.

130
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,590
That's a lot of damage in a short amount of time.

131
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,120
We thinking he's a meta?

132
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,880
Possibly, although certain chemicals

133
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,390
can cause a similar reaction.

134
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,620
Yeah, any acid with a pH below two.

135
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,570
Precisely.

136
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
We could be looking for an aggressive variant

137
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,810
of a necrotized fasciitis.

138
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,800
A flesh-eating disease.

139
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,930
In a restaurant?

140
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm never eating out again.

141
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,980
Okay, so an autopsy might help us hone in

142
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,750
on what really did this.

143
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,970
Yes, I agree.

144
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,390
Unfortunately, County denied my request

145
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,210
for a 3D image medical scanner,

146
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,610
which would make short work of the process.

147
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,640
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.

148
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,850
Allen, this is an active investigation.

149
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,540
There is protocol to follow...

150
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,670
surely?

151
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,210
Not if we're gonna figure this out.

152
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,420
Okay, I'll bag the body myself and meet you there.

153
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,330
Great.

154
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,360
Iris.

155
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,210
You okay?

156
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,150
Yeah, I'm just, uh,

157
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,300
running up against a deadline, so...

158
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,570
Since I have you both, I wanted to ask,

159
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,020
um, Cecile's daughter, Joanie,

160
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,360
is in town, and I was thinking

161
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,060
that maybe we could all get together.

162
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,410
If you don't think it's too soon.

163
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,230
I mean, I haven't exactly been dating Cecile for that long.

164
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,730
It's not too early, Joe.

165
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,760
- Yeah? - Yeah.

166
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,310
And Jitters-- is that cool?

167
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,740
Or is that too casual?

168
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,130
Dad, don't worry, okay?

169
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,310
It's great. Joanie's gonna love you.

170
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,780
I love my kids.

171
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,730
I'm gonna set it up. Thank you.

172
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,630
All right.

173
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,880
It's nice to see him so happy.

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah, it is.

175
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,720
You okay?

176
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,370
I need to show you something at S.T.A.R. Labs.

177
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,260
Okay.

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,610
Look.

181
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,630
That's the name of the restaurant where we just were.

182
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,200
- Yeah. - I spoke to the owner,

183
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,670
and he said he doesn't think that the restaurant can survive

184
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,380
an attack like this-- that they'd most likely

185
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,830
have to reopen under a new name.

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,580
- It's all coming true, Barry. - No.

187
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,300
I thought things were changing.

188
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,840
Things are changing, okay? They are.

189
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,000
I was supposed to stop Plunder, right?

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,390
And instead Wally did.

191
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,520
And we're gonna...

192
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,410
stop Savitar too. I'm making sure of it.

193
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,460
What if we can't stop all of this?

194
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,070
I'm scared, Barry.

195
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,970
Okay, uh...

196
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,560
Maybe we should tell Joe.

197
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,000
No, no.

198
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,610
No, we agreed that we wouldn't.

199
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
Besides, you saw him earlier.

200
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,370
He's-- he's planning for a future with Cecile.

201
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,030
If we tell him about Savitar,

202
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,150
it's all he's gonna think about.

203
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,370
I-I can't do that to him.

204
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,740
- I won't. - Okay.

205
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,240
Whatever you want.

206
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,720
Now listen to me.

207
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,050
I promise you I'm doing everything in my power

208
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,190
to make sure that that future never happens.

209
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,580
Okay.

210
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,370
You think this is what it's like to be a character on "CSI"?

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,860
What do they hope to gain from that examination?

212
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,760
They're trying to find the exact cause of death.

213
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,990
Once we know that, we'll have a better idea

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,210
of what we're dealing with.

215
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,900
But until then, we need to train.

216
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm gonna teach you everything I know,

217
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,980
starting with phasing.

218
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,010
- Yes! Finally. - You know what we should do?

219
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,140
We should concoct some simulations

220
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,990
to help Wallace learn this new skill.

221
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,000
What do you say, Francisco?

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
I got one word for you:

223
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,250
quebracho.

224
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,500
Let's go.

225
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,680
Quebracho!

226
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,060
What's his name?

227
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,850
Doesn't really matter much now, does it?

228
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,210
Of course, we should call him by his name.

229
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,330
After everything he's been through,

230
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,760
he deserves that much respect.

231
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,290
He is a corpse,

232
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,760
thus impervious to such bedside manners.

233
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, thank goodness, 'cause I'd hate to have

234
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,510
to subject him to yours.

235
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,230
Victim is male, between 30 and 40,

236
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,220
with a highly necrotized epidermis.

237
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,590
We plan to do a full-body scan

238
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,330
and a chest wall retraction.

239
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,420
Julian, look.

240
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,520
The decay continues even after the tissue's dead.

241
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,530
This is--this is not a bacteria.

242
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,050
Or any other disease known to medical science.

243
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,400
That was one crazy set, man.

244
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,450
I'm telling you, Rob, you keep wailing on that saxophone,

245
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,090
you're gonna running up to Lee Jay Thompson in no time.

246
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,590
All right, have a good one. Catch you laters.

247
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,800
All right.

248
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,040
- Do I know you? - Unlikely.

249
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,180
But I know you, Julio Mendez.

250
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,610
Man, that was some set.

251
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,370
Your cover of "Dock of the Ba"

252
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,990
took me to a different time and place.

253
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,270
Well, I'm glad you dug the set, man.

254
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,090
Hey, before you go, uh,

255
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,310
I'd just really like to shake your hand.

256
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,930
Yeah, anything for a fan.

257
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,350
What'd you do to me?

258
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,570
What you deserve for all the pain you caused me.

259
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,430
That hurt like a...

260
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,310
Like you ran into a giant wooden wall?

261
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,410
'Cause you did.

262
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,330
And it's not just any big wooden wall.

263
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,500
That's double-reinforced quebracho.

264
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,640
That's like the strongest stuff on the planet, right there.

265
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,350
Well, fantastic choice, Cisco.

266
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,940
Well, it shouldn't matter if it's wood or steel or stone.

267
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,130
If you're moving fast enough, you can phase through anything.

268
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,620
Even molten lava--

269
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,920
you know, if you ever ended up in a volcano.

270
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,160
You know, I-I still don't get it.

271
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,720
- How do you do this? - All right.

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,410
Here. Watch.

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,130
When you vibrate at the natural frequency of air,

274
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,440
your body, your cells, will be in an excited state

275
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
that'll allow you...

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,740
to phase.

277
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,540
Yeah, it's not-it's not really helping.

278
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,840
What exactly do I do?

279
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,350
Connect with your body, right?

280
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,670
Connect with the air. Be pure electricity.

281
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,640
You have to feel everything that's around you.

282
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
All right?

283
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,200
So go fast and feel things.

284
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,160
Yeah, no worries.

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,560
You can do this, Wallace.

286
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,140
Okay.

287
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,510
All right, all right.

288
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,560
You can do this.

289
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
All right, again.

290
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,940
- Yeah? - You got this.

291
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,590
This isn't working. It's not working.

292
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,100
You've been training him. What's worked?

293
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,400
You know what works with that guy?

294
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,960
Vocal encouragement. You got this, Wallace!

295
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,140
I don't know why you even ask him.

296
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,720
What did Wells do with me?

297
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,400
His plan was, uh, more methodically constructed

298
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,500
than John Doe's in "Seven""

299
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,620
And he had a bit more time to work it out

300
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,190
by, give or take, 15 years.

301
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,330
Well, we don't have 15 years.

302
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,510
I have a crime scene. I got to go.

303
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,180
I'll be back.

304
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,730
Just make sure he keeps practicing.

305
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,710
Go, Wallace!

306
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,560
Body was found by that bicyclist.

307
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,390
Same M.O. as the first one.

308
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,040
This victim was performing here last night.

309
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,120
He's a lounge singer named Julio Mendez.

310
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,340
Julio Mendez?

311
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,050
Has anybody seen Detective West?

312
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,250
In Flashpoint, he was Captain Mendez.

313
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,070
Sorry. In Flashpoint, this-this alternate universe

314
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,850
that you lived in, he worked at the CCPD?

315
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,290
Yeah.

316
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Wait a second, the other-the other vic, Stuart Holzman--

317
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,050
do we have a photo of him?

318
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,150
- Yeah. - Can I see it?

319
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,830
Yeah, hold on. That's him.

320
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,740
What is it?

321
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,460
He was a cop there, too.

322
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,740
So this is the second dead cop from Flashpoint?

323
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,780
Yeah.

324
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,860
We got to figure out who this guy is.

325
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,170
Well, if we hurry, there's still a chance

326
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,210
we can get some of the attacker's

327
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,700
residual DNA before this corpse disintegrates,

328
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,090
but we've got to move quick.

329
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,380
Barry, you can help with that.

330
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,440
All right, come on.

331
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,190
Did anybody see me?

332
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,620
Damn, I barely saw you.

333
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,220
Look, we got to get going.

334
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,560
Hey, Joe, hold on.

335
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,150
Um, look, I-I know how excited you are

336
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,100
for this coffee thing with Joanie and Cecile,

337
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,540
but I think we should hold off.

338
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,170
I don't think it's a good idea right now.

339
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,650
Bar, these two attacks don't establish a pattern.

340
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,300
- Well... - And besides, I'm a cop.

341
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,790
If I canceled my plans every time I was in danger,

342
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,890
I'd never leave the house.

343
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,000
I-I hear you.

344
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,050
I would just feel a lot better

345
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,220
knowing you were someplace safe.

346
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,640
Name a place safer than a coffee shop

347
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,030
with my two speedster sons.

348
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,190
Meeting Joanie is important to Cecile,

349
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,800
therefore it's important to me.

350
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,480
Some things are worth taking risks for.

351
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,040
All right. Let's get out of here.

352
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,790
Anything?

353
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,560
Aside from this body

354
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,220
disintegrating before our eyes?

355
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,650
Nothing unusual.

356
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,420
There must be a heightened point of necrosis somewhere.

357
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,360
Look!

358
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,410
We have less than 50 minutes before this corpse disintegrates

359
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,680
into ash like the last one.

360
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,100
- We need to find it now. - I'm aware.

361
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,360
This might be a faster process if I did it alone.

362
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,730
You know, I've done autopsies before, Julian.

363
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm sure you have.

364
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,530
This might just be a quicker process

365
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,940
if I did it alone.

366
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,210
What are you doing?

367
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,200
The gradation is darker

368
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,100
on the palm of his hand

369
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,770
from the point of contact.

370
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,830
I see, I see.

371
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,760
You know, I used to think Barry was overreacting

372
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,320
when he complained about sharing a lab with you.

373
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,940
But now I understand his frustration.

374
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,930
Believe me, no one is more frustrated than I.

375
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,170
You do realize that it's possible not to be a jerk

376
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,610
all the time, right?

377
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

382
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,680
Two strains of DNA.

383
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,390
One of them must be from our killer.

385
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,620
But, you know, there's something else here.

386
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,910
One of the DNA strains has an element in it.

387
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,750
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

388
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,630
I have--

389
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,880
in all the meta husks created by Alchemy.

390
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,470
Which means the meta that killed our two innocent people...

391
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,260
was created by me.

393
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,950
- French roast for Cecile. - Thank you.

394
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,730
Non-dairy green tea latte for Joanie.

395
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,050
You not much of a coffee drinker, Joanie?

396
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,360
Well, I used to be, but then I learned

397
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,760
hot roasted coffee beans contain

398
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,040
cancer-causing levels of acrylamide.

399
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,030
Well, damn.

400
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,200
Uh, Joanie, Cecile says you're at Coast U?

401
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,530
- What are you studying? - I'm undecided.

402
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,330
Are you leaning towards anything?

403
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,680
Not really.

404
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,920
Uh, Coast U's pretty far, right?

405
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,350
Do you ever miss Central City?

406
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,640
Actually, I like it better there.

407
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,470
Well, there is one thing I miss about Central City.

408
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,270
What's that?

409
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,730
You're gonna regret that you asked.

410
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Kid Flash.

411
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,450
She's a little-- little obsessed.

412
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,580
Kid Flash is the one thing you miss about Central City?

413
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,480
Whoa, Barry, slow down.

414
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,330
You don't have to be so skeptical about it.

415
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,910
Kid Flash is cool.

416
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,130
What do you like best about him, specifically?

417
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,630
Well, he's fearless.

418
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,380
- And he's brave. - Yeah.

419
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,250
He's a hero, and he's probably pretty cute under that mask.

420
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,490
Yeah, I think so, too.

421
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,700
Come on, Joanie, honey, Kid Flash?

422
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,440
He's a showboat-- he's snapping selfies,

423
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,260
he's leaving graffiti bolts on buildings.

424
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,680
- Okay, that's his signature move. - That's kind of his signature.

425
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,140
Yeah, well, from what I hear,

426
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,080
The Flash is the one who's actually saving people.

427
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,970
Sounds like Cecile's Team Flash.

428
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,970
Uh, Joanie,

429
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,530
my dad would never brag about this,

430
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,900
but he knows Kid Flash.

431
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,810
You do?

432
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,990
Is my mom right?

433
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,250
Who's the real hero--

434
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,850
Flash or Kid Flash?

435
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,470
Mmm... they both are.

436
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,280
Uh, they both do great things for Central City.

437
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,850
Okay, but if you had to choose?

438
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,420
I-I don't--

439
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't think I could choose.

440
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,830
Yeah, but if you, like, had to.

441
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,540
Um, would you go get me some cream, Wally, please?

442
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,300
Yes.

443
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,160
Ah, this is work. I'll be right back, sorry.

444
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,190
Hey, what's up?

445
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,490
Barry, we got some DNA

446
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,230
off Mendez's corpse.

447
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,030
We were about to match it with CCPD records.

448
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,780
The meta's name is Clive Yorkin.

449
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,300
We're sending you his info now.

450
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,060
Detective Joe West!

451
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,180
Long time, no see.

452
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,130
Do I know you?

453
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,870
You don't remember me?

454
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,440
You and your cronies had a very fun time ruining my life.

455
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,690
Not gonna let you do that this time around.

456
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,240
I think you have the wrong guy.

457
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,550
No, no.

458
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,540
You're the Joe West I remember.

459
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,230
Look a lot more full of life now, though.

460
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,860
But don't worry...

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,210
I can change that.

462
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,360
- Everybody get back. - Joanie, go.

463
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,150
Everybody get out of here. Everybody go! Go!

464
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,720
Yes, everybody run.

466
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,570
I only want him.

467
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,740
You can't hide up there, Detective.

468
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,950
No one can hide from me anymore.

469
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,920
- Joe... - One more step, and I'll shoot.

470
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Didn't work then.

471
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,080
Won't work now, either.

472
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,090
Told ya.

473
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,080
Stop!

474
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,770
Can't touch me, speedster.

475
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,380
I knew it. Kid Flash is the hero.

476
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,280
Well, thank God for Kid Flash, huh?

477
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,910
He's gone.

479
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,140
This guy's got the touch of death.

480
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,360
Yeah, he does, and it's not just people.

481
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,510
Anything he touched turned to ash.

482
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,570
Joe, I--I really think you should just stay here

483
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,900
until we find Yorkin.

484
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,510
No, I'm gonna go check on Cecile and Joanie.

485
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,760
They were pretty shook up.

486
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,070
Dad, are you crazy?

487
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,970
This guy wants to kill you.

488
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,640
If it wasn't for Wally and Barry, he could've.

489
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,360
He could've killed any one of us.

490
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,970
Come on, we have been through much worse metas than Yorkin.

491
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,670
What?

492
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,880
Iris, I'm fine. We're all fine.

493
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,560
We're not losing anybody today.

494
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,800
Maybe not today, but soon.

495
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,990
Soon?

496
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,030
W-what are you saying?

497
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,940
Iris...

498
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,460
Wally, he needs to know.

499
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,140
Needs to know what?

500
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,680
When Barry threw the Philosopher's Stone

501
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,070
into the Speed Force,

502
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,320
there was an explosion,

503
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,950
and he was propelled to the future.

504
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,020
The future?

505
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,050
It was a few months from now.

506
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,450
What he saw was himself

507
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
standing before Savitar...

508
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,750
and me.

509
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,710
Right before Savitar killed me.

510
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,700
So you're saying that in a few months...

511
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,630
you die?

512
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,240
Unless we can change the future, Dad.

513
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,870
Which we're gonna do, Joe, okay?

514
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,950
I'm not--we're not gonna let this happen.

515
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,540
How long have you known about this?

516
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,710
How long?

517
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,150
A couple weeks now, Joe.

518
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
And you're just telling me now?

519
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,450
That's my daughter!

520
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,280
Dad, I didn't want them to say anything

521
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,780
because I knew how you would react.

522
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,350
This is not something you keep from your father, Iris!

523
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,700
You should've known that.

524
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,120
- And you should've too. - I know, Joe.

525
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
Look, I can understand why they didn't want to tell me

526
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,570
because they didn't grow up under the same roof

527
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
that you did.

528
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,180
They don't know--they don't know what my baby girl means to me,

529
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,600
Barry, but you do.

530
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,950
I know.

531
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,720
Joe...

532
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,280
I'll talk to him.

533
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,420
I'm--I'm gonna go to CCPD,

534
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,170
see if I can find anything that might lead us to Yorkin.

535
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,990
Well, that went swimmingly.

536
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,190
Joe's right. We should've told him before now.

537
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,070
What you should have told him is that I'm the one responsible,

538
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,360
that the meta trying to kill him is one that I created.

539
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,020
Julian, you can't change what happened to you.

540
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,330
It's not your fault.

541
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,680
You keep saying that, but it is my fault.

542
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,690
People are responsible for their own actions.

543
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,480
To say otherwise is just...

544
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,520
it's just a way to make yourself feel better.

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,980
Is that what you think I'm doing?

546
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,550
Making excuses for things I've done in the past?

547
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,510
You know, I'm really starting to regret

548
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,380
bringing you in here.

550
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,810
Come on, Dad.

551
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,200
Ah, hey, Dad, it's me...

552
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,670
calling, again.

553
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,250
Look, I know you're upset,

554
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,140
but, um, give me a call back, okay?

555
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,880
I love you.

557
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Honey?

558
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,600
Good evening, Iris West.

559
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,540
It's Iris's panic alarm.

560
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,240
She's at the apartment. I'll call Barry.

561
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,720
No, no, no. I-I got this.

562
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,150
he's at CCPD, and I'm closer.

563
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,280
Okay, go!

564
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,740
You know, initially, I wanted your dad dead.

565
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,040
But then I thought, "If I really want to make him suffer,

566
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,920
I should kill his daughter instead"

567
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,870
This is not how I'm supposed to die.

568
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,230
Oh, I'm pretty sure it is.

569
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,750
No, stop!

570
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,430
Too late, Kid Flash.

571
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,620
Me or her?

572
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,110
I've got you, baby girl.

573
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm not going anywhere.

574
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,330
Elevated heart rate. Temperature's 104.

575
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,940
The decay is reaching her subcutaneous tissue.

576
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm here, all right? What happened?

577
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,520
Yorkin went after her.

578
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,850
Why didn't you call me?

579
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,650
Because I was here.

580
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,230
You call me! All right?

581
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,100
We have to give her something.

582
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,180
There has to be something we can give her.

583
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,110
It's not bacteria.

584
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,410
Antibiotics won't work.

585
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,370
We have to do something.

586
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,640
Nothing's not an option.

587
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,270
Okay, what do you do when a banana ripens too quickly?

588
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,840
- Put it in the freezer. - That's brilliant.

589
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,960
Caitlin, you can freeze her arm.

590
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,210
It'll stop the spread of decay

591
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,880
and give us some time to find a cure.

592
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,770
I trust you.

593
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,030
I can't, even if I wanted to.

594
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,630
We're not talking about a cold blast.

595
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,860
This is a specific and continuous cold stream.

596
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,650
Too high a temperature and the decay spreads,

597
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,200
too low and the frostbite will destroy your nerve endings.

598
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,030
And that long using my powers,

599
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,580
I could lose control.

600
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,760
Caitlin, you are strong, okay?

601
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,600
Stronger than you know.

602
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,350
You are not going to lose control.

603
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,840
Caitlin, try, please.

604
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,050
It worked.

605
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,080
Oh, thank God.

606
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,510
- You okay? - So far, so good.

607
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,460
Wally, where are you going?

608
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,440
Out of the way where I can't screw up again.

609
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,610
You okay?

610
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,230
Yeah.

611
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,730
Hey, look, what I said back there--

612
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,380
No, you were right.

613
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,080
We should've called you.

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,720
I just thought-- I thought I could do it.

615
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,940
I thought I was ready. Obviously, I'm not.

616
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,190
It's not on you.

617
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,690
I wasn't fast enough, Barry.

618
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,360
That--that is totally on me.

619
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,010
No, not really.

620
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,070
It's not, all right?

621
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,980
Look, when I got these powers, I-I...

622
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,770
I was really lucky, in a weird way.

623
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,240
You know, I had a lot of people helping me through all of this.

624
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,450
I had Wells--both of 'em--

625
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,380
and Jay and Zolomon.

626
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,910
I mean, two of them turned out to be bad guys,

627
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,980
but even they were good teachers

628
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,390
who really taught me how to use my powers.

629
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,510
I just don't think that I've been that for you yet.

630
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,590
You're telling me everything that I need to learn.

631
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,350
I'm just not getting it. I--

632
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,140
No, that's not it. It's--I've been--

633
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,840
I've been letting you coast by on your raw talent,

634
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
which you have a lot of, but teaching--it's a lot more than

635
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,570
just doing something and expecting you to follow.

636
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,180
It's about inspiring and

637
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,220
empowering you to use your gifts

638
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,480
to succeed on your own.

639
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,350
That's what I need to do.

640
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,890
That's what I'm gonna do from now on.

641
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,060
So the next time you're out there and you're alone,

642
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,550
you will win.

643
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,080
Deal?

644
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,610
Deal.

645
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,000
H.R. And I just came up with a way

646
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,260
to track down Yorkin, and it's...

647
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,620
crazy.

648
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,900
Like, defies time and space crazy.

649
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,360
Okay, here's what we know.

650
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,250
We know Yorkin's going after cops in Flashpoint, right?

651
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,690
What we don't know is who he's going after.

652
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,860
But if we find out who they are,

653
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,360
then we can be ready for him.

654
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,130
Right, so how do we do that?

655
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,160
We vibe Flashpoint.

656
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,810
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore.

657
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,970
Stop you right there, BA.

658
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,210
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.

659
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,160
But in quantum mechanics,

660
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,040
- the daughter universe theory tell us-- - Universe theory.

661
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,410
For every decision you make,

662
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,870
a universe exists where you don't.

663
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,850
Yeah, I actually went to that class.

664
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,240
You better be going to all your classes.

665
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,880
So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,

666
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,490
Francisco here could vibe it.

667
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,500
And you're sure you can do that?

668
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,050
No, no. Not at all.

669
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,290
But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things

670
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,750
- with my powers... - Yeah, she did.

671
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,470
Things I'm not even aware of yet, so--

672
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,930
things I haven't even imagined.

673
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,700
- Well, let's get to imagining. - All right.

674
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,840
What do you need me to do?

675
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,740
All I need you to do is to stand there,

676
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,120
focus on Flashpoint, okay?

677
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,980
Focus on CCPD, Joe, Mendez, that part of it, and

678
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,580
I'll take care of the rest.

679
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,930
It worked!

680
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,250
I'm here.

681
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,770
For some reason I thought Flashpoint would look a lot different.

682
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,430
Okay, all right, if I were Joe West,

683
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,600
where would I be?

684
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,930
He was at the same desk.

685
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,540
Got ya.

686
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,860
If it wasn't for this takedown,

687
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,930
we'd be having a different conversation right now, Joe.

688
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,090
Understood, Captain.

689
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,410
Ooh, Joe's in trouble.

690
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,550
Ladies and gentlemen, for today's perp walk,

691
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,670
we have a literal degenerate:

692
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,200
the one and only Clive Yorkin.

693
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,620
Here we go.

694
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,190
Captain Mendez, Detective West,

695
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,420
thanks for the assist.

696
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,320
Couldn't have bagged this goon without you.

697
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,150
Get him to Iron Heights.

699
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,950
Stone...

700
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,160
- Who's Stone? - Stone--that was the other cop.

701
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,900
And let me tell you, she loves her perp walks.

702
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,920
Laura Stone. She's a PI.

703
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,780
Yeah, that's her.

704
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,760
It was you, Mendez, Holzman, and her.

705
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,590
You guys took down Yorkin in Flashpoint.

706
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,520
Well, then, that means she's the only one

707
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,710
that Yorkin hasn't gone after yet.

708
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,190
Classic example of saving the best for last.

709
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,650
I'm on it. You guys stay here and try to figure out

710
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,350
how to catch somebody we can't touch.

711
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,070
- Joe West. Long time, no see. - Hey.

712
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,120
I wish it were under better circumstances.

713
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,350
Listen, you're being targeted by a meta.

714
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,350
Sweetheart, take a look over there.

715
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm the only one doing the targeting here.

716
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,600
That chick's husband is paying me

717
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,740
twice my going rate, so scram.

718
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,430
Look at this.

719
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,780
The guy that's coming after you

720
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,550
can do that with one touch.

721
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,060
Attention, all passengers.

722
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,390
The S.T.A.R. City Express is now boarding all platforms.

723
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,300
How about we multitask?

724
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,510
All aboard, please.

725
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,920
Hey, Julian.

726
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,460
You have anything?

727
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,720
Look, it's early days, but...

728
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,220
first tests show that her blood

729
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,250
is attacking the cells in her body.

730
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,500
Wait, that's the opposite of how my blood

731
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,080
causes cells to regenerate.

732
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,170
Precisely.

733
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,020
Can we use my blood to save her?

734
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,000
Listen, I don't think that your blood

735
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,360
is the key to saving Iris.

736
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,280
But I do think it might be exactly what we need

737
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,730
to take down Yorkin.

738
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,930
All is not lost, mate.

739
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,060
- The decay is spreading. - Why?

740
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,340
I don't know.

741
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,420
Caitlin?

742
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,720
- Caitlin? - I'm losing control.

743
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,110
Okay, all right, it's spreading.

744
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,060
We need you.

745
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,580
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

746
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,900
Just a little bit longer, and she's dead.

747
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,290
How's that for changing the future?

748
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,240
I know who you are, Caitlin. You do not want to do this.

749
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,660
This who I am. You said it.

750
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,830
It's time for me to take responsibility for my actions.

751
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,090
Time for me to own who I really am.

752
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,940
Who you are is Caitlin Snow.

753
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,440
I know firsthand the battle going on inside of you.

754
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,020
I know what it feels like.

755
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,380
When it happened to me, I lost.

756
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,740
All right? I was weak, and I let it win.

757
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,340
And I did-- I did horrible things

758
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,350
to a lot of good people.

759
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,890
And you don't have to do that.

760
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,180
You're not gonna do that.

761
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,430
You're stronger than I am, Caitlin.

762
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,000
You're far stronger than I am.

763
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,310
You're one of the strongest people I've ever known.

764
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,270
You can win this fight.

765
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,650
Iris needs your help now.

766
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,910
It's all right.

767
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,080
It's gonna be all right.

768
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,700
And how do you know this guy's coming after me, Joe?

769
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,400
We have pretty reliable intel.

770
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,350
Look, Laura, this is not someone you should be ignoring.

771
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,790
He's dangerous.

772
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,600
He's already killed two cops.

773
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
He tried to kill me and my daughter.

774
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,870
Well, I've certainly pissed off a lot of people in my day.

775
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,300
But the only thing I fear now is forgetting to clear my browser.

776
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,070
Consider me warned.

777
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,470
Oh, my God.

780
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,570
What is that?

781
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,120
It's Joe's panic alarm.

782
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,090
He must be on that train.

783
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,360
There's no way that train can stop--

784
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,040
It's not gonna stop in time.

785
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,080
We have to get everyone out of there.

786
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,310
We don't have enough time.

787
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,250
- Oh, no! - What is it?

788
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,700
- Everybody brace yourselves! - What's happening?

789
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,200
We're gonna move the train.

790
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,190
How are we gonna do that?

791
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,360
I'll vibrate it.

792
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,840
I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.

793
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,950
- You can do that? - I don't know.

794
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,190
I've never tried before.

795
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,860
Everybody hold on!

796
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,790
Is that even possible?

797
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,520
We're about to find out.

798
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,930
Holy Kardashians.

799
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,080
Barry. Barry!

800
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,780
We're good, man.

801
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,590
Took a lot out of me, but it worked.

802
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,920
Yeah, maybe, but we got another problem.

803
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,640
Yorkin's back.

804
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,720
You know what they say, Kid Flash.

805
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,140
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

806
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,780
You have to stop him.

807
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,670
I don't have it in me right now.

808
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,030
I need you to get your blood into him.

809
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,320
It'll counteract his cells and negate his powers.

810
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,380
How am I supposed to do that when I can't even touch him?

811
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,860
You're gonna phase it into him.

812
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,500
You know I've never done that before.

813
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,240
And you just watched me do something I'd never done,

814
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,900
but I did it because I had to.

815
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,000
All right?

816
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,960
I know you can do it, okay?

817
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,570
I need you to believe it, too.

818
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,810
Now run, Wally.

819
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,200
Run.

820
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,720
It worked!

821
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,540
- I did it! - You sure did.

822
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,400
Good-bye, Kid Flash.

823
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,810
Oh, wha--look at that.

824
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,280
Your powers are neutralized, Yorkin.

825
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,530
What did you do?

826
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,670
I won.

827
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,890
Iris.

828
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,320
Dad?

829
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,130
The last time I was this happy looking in your eyes,

830
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,770
you'd just been born.

831
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,980
It's okay. You're okay.

832
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,370
Yorkin's done.

833
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,520
What happened?

834
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,730
I'll tell you what happened.

835
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,510
Wallace was a total badass. That's what happened.

836
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,230
Translate.

837
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,170
Yeah, he phased his speedster blood

838
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,410
into Yorkin and neutralized his powers.

839
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,220
That's the science behind it.

840
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,930
I had a great teacher.

841
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,300
And me?

842
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,790
Once Yorkin's blood was stabilized,

843
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,630
we actually managed to get an antidote that cured you.

844
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,220
You'll have to wear the bandage for a few days,

845
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,970
but other than that, you're absolutely recovered.

846
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,200
Thank you.

847
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,950
I know what you risked for me.

848
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,590
I had some help.

849
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,390
Couldn't have done it alone.

850
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,830
It was all of us working together.

851
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,960
Yup, really proud of everybody.

852
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,380
Great job. Big ideas today.

853
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,640
My point is, if we're gonna save Iris from Savitar,

854
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,170
we're gonna have to up our game.

855
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,290
No more lies--

856
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,190
even well-intentioned ones.

857
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,740
We have to be completely real with each other.

858
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,860
- I agree. - I agree with Joe, too.

859
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,530
From here on out, complete honesty.

860
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,880
Honesty.

861
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,940
All right. Get some rest, all right?

862
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,370
I'll check on you in a bit.

863
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,600
- Bar? - Yeah?

864
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,320
Savitar's prophecy of someone dying--

865
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,840
was it Iris?

866
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah.

867
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,970
But it's not gonna happen.

868
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,760
Look, I'm glad she comes first in your life now.

869
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,880
If you're gonna date my daughter,

870
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,300
that's the way it should be.

871
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,620
You're still a close second.

872
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,720
It's just heartwarming.

873
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,540
It's just truly heartwarming.

874
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,990
You're already crafting a version of this

875
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,650
for your book, aren't you?

876
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,400
"Peace finally descends upon the family West"

877
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,150
The West family, or family West?

878
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,770
Right, it's time I get to work.

879
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,670
At this hour?

880
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,320
Yes, there's still one husk meta out there,

881
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,280
and I intend to find him.

882
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,560
Good night.

883
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,070
Hey, Julian?

884
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,270
I don't think you're weak

885
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,710
because of what happened to you with Savitar.

886
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,820
The strength that I found to stay in control--

887
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,090
that came from you.

888
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,790
So thank you.

889
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,930
Well, I wasn't gonna let Iris

890
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,250
die at the hands of Killer Frost, was I?

891
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,710
I knew there was a good guy inside of you somewhere--

892
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,950
one that the rest of us would like to see a little more often.

893
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,070
Good night.

894
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
Do you want to get a drink?

895
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,170
What? As in now?

896
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,570
Yeah.

897
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd love that.

899
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,000
What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?

900
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,130
Oh, Joanie's headed back for midterms.

901
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,280
We just thought we'd come and say good-bye.

902
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,100
I was hoping a redo on the coffee,

903
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,340
seeing as how the last one went off the rails.

904
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,850
Are you kidding me?

905
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,380
I got to see Kid Flash in action, right up close.

906
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,650
Well, we got a lot of stories about Kid Flash

907
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,080
I can guarantee you've never heard.

908
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
Maybe we can tell you them over dinner

909
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,310
next time you come to town.

910
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,620
I have a long weekend next month.

911
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,190
You sure you're ready to commit to something

912
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,800
that far in the future?

913
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,490
I am absolutely sure.

914
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,410
Good.

915
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,210
We should go.

916
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,480
- Good luck at school. - Thank you. See ya.

917
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,550
- Bye, babe. - Bye.

918
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,320
Okay, good as new.

919
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,210
Actually, it's better than new

920
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,800
with the three extra locks that I added.

921
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,750
Which you didn't have to do.

922
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,440
Well, Cisco did offer to build us

923
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,740
a custom security door,

924
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,420
but we've both seen how well

925
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,990
those things keep people out of S.T.A.R. Labs.

926
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,110
- So... - I like deadbolts.

927
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,040
Deadbolts work.

928
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,100
It's just with... what happened here,

929
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,710
I want to make sure you feel safe.

930
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,430
I do.

931
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,710
About everything?

932
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,030
You know, you've been saying for weeks

933
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,870
that you were gonna save me from Savitar.

934
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,280
And while I trust you with my life,

935
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,190
it was hard not to feel scared.

936
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,260
You know, sometimes it feels like The Flash is this guy

937
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,310
my boyfriend becomes when he runs off to save other people.

938
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,090
Like I'm the only one who doesn't get The Flash.

939
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,940
He felt separate from you.

940
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
But yesterday when you saved me,

941
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,460
I remembered that I have no reason to be scared.

942
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,130
The man I love is a superhero.

943
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,630
I love and trust you, Barry Allen...

944
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,300
The Flash.

945
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,600
I love all of you, and I always will.

946
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,670
I love you.

947
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,450
That was so nice.

948
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,340
Jesse!

949
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,740
No, no, no, no.

950
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,770
What's wrong?

951
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,730
Grodd.

952
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,240
He's got my dad.

953
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,210
And he has him in Gorilla City.
