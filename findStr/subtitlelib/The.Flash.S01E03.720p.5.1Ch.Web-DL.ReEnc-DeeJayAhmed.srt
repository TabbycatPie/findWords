Then an accident made me the impossible.

To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:27,561
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:29,361

Did you know that zombies exist in nature?

37
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:38,665
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,634
causing the ants to attack plants

39
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,937

which in turn infect new hosts.

00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,219
is putting criminals behind bars.

182
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,889
Except Iron Heights isn't exactly equipped

183
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:43,425
to handle meta-humans.

184
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,061
Then I guess it's fortunate the ones

185
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,596
you've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

186
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,632
Well, unless we're planning on executing

187
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,869
every super criminal we stop,

188
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,441
you geniuses are gonna have to come up

189
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,342
with someplace else to hold them.

190
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:57,311
A meta-human prison. Sweet.

191
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:00,081
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

192
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,752
There is one place here
that might hold them.

193
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,151
You can't be serious.

194
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,855
I mean, we haven't been down there since the...

195
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,190
It's cordoned off.

196
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,189
Cisco is right.

197
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,356
It could be modified to act
as a makeshift prison.

198
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,424
What could?

199
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,260
The particle accelerator.

200
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:24,667
Tonight, the future begins.

201
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,938
The work my team and I will do here

202
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,476
will change our understanding of physics,

203
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,712
will bring about advancements in power,

204
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,879
advancements in medicine.

205
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,747
And trust me, that future

206
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,483
will be here faster than you think.

207
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,819
Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

208
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,321
A big thunderstorm is rolling in.

209
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,890
We're not launching a space shuttle.

210
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,626
We'll be fine.

211
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,096
Tahiti?

212
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,665
I know it's a long flight, Ronnie,

213
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,701
but we can binge watch
<i>Orange Is The New Black.</i>

214
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:54,934
Oh, okay.

215
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:56,771
But what about Italy?

216
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:00,709
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

217
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,346
Yes, but Italy doesn't have Mai Tais,

218
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:06,752
and a honeymoon isn't a
honeymoon without Mai Tais.

219
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,721
Dr. Wells, the accelerator is primed

220
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,291
and ready for particle injection.

221
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:14,160
Well, I feel I should
say something profound

222
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:18,832
like one small step for man [sighs],

223
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,099
but all I can think of to say is,

224
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,603
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

That's it?

227
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,440
You'd think there'd be, like, a loud bang.

228
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,510
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

229
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,577
Take it from the guy who helped build it.

230

A loud bang.

Caitlin.

243
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,858
Did you hear me?

244
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,760
We're going down to the accelerator ring.

245
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,028
Actually, Dr. Wells,
I could use Caitlin's help

246

identifying the poison gas.

247
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,333
Okay.

248
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,733
If that's okay with you?

249
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,402
Let's go.

250
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,573
Welcome to the CCPD.

251
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:47,867
So this is your day job.

252
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,302
Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:52,038
I'm gonna rip out your hearts
and eat 'em for lunch.

254
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,440
Delightful.

255
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,841

256
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,577

Where the hell is the fiber

Upstairs. It's all finished.

259
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,752
I can just run up and bring it down.

260
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,487
With you, that could be
three days from now.

261
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,190
I'll go with you. Who are you?

262
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:12,093
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Barry's
personal physician.

263
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:19,600
The fiber analysis for the
Orloff case, like you asked for,

264
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,667
sir.

265
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,207
Clean up your lab.

266
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,842
It's a mess.

00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:34,515
The lightning was in the house.

268
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,653
I told my son to run, he disappeared,

269
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,155
and that's when I saw the blood.

270
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,823
Your prints were on the murder weapon.

271
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,494
I needed to stabilize the knife.

272
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,227
I'm a doctor.

273
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:48,996

You know me. Our kids are friends.

You tell them, Joe.

278
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:01,478
Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

279
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,179
It's just work.

280
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,950

Joe, I thought you were at the morgue.

284
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:22,433
I decided to bring some work home.

285
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,101
Why are you here?

286
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:28,537
Yes, well, I've been looking for you.

287
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,507
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

288
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,576
re-canvass, see if we missed anything.

289
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,977
Always work the case, right?

290
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,578

300
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:59,572
and now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad...

301
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:01,344
not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

302

I know, I know, it's just...

303
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,144
it's not the right time to tell him.

00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,446
When is, Iris?

305
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,980
I know my dad. He'll kill us.

306
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:13,080
Right now, you're killing us.

307
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:29,018
The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

308
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,758
and we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

309
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:37,661
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

310

meta-human abilities, but...

311
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,599
might just work.

312

One fault, and the helium blowback

00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,755
could damage the mountings.

you don't have to answer?

Ronnie. What was he like?

354
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:04,980
You just never talk about him that much.

355
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:08,117
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

356
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,452
He was the structural engineer.

357
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:11,952

00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:36,010
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

541
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,812
I can't. We're in lockdown mode.

542

out of there or he'll die.

Is Cisco there?

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:54,266
Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here. I'm listening.

550
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:56,570
I adjusted the magnets to redirect the beam

551
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:59,975
to try and vent the system so
the blast goes up and not out.

552
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll need to reset the particle
parameters to compensate.

553
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:06,281
Cisco's doing it.

554
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,917
There has to be another way out of there.

555
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,187
You have to find it.

Cait, the chain reaction,
I can't reverse it.

He saved so many lives that day,

565
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:48,658
and no one will ever know what he did.

566
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:56,930
I do.

567
00:27:56,932 --> 00:28:00,468
He was a hero.

568
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,905
I didn't want him to be a hero.

569
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,008
I wanted him to be my husband.

Barry, Caitlin, you down there?

571
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,854

Hey, check this out.

573
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,061
It's a 3D molecular model of the gas

00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:26,331

575
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,067
We have identified the toxin.

Hydrogen cyanide?

577
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,505
What's interesting is what's mixed in

578
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:36,309
with the cyanide... A sedative.

579
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,110
Of course.

Why?

582
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:44,217
That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

583
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,618
before they go to the gas chamber

584
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,887
and breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

585
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,122
That's right.

586
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:49,457
There was someone executed.

587
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:51,058
- Kyle Nimbus.
- That's him.

588
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,560
He was a hit man for
the Darbinyan crime family.

They turned on him and testified.

590
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:58,366
Judge Theresa Howard
was the judge at his trial.

591
00:28:58,368 --> 00:28:59,434
She sentenced him to death.

592
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:00,769
He must have been affected

593
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:02,804
by the explosion while he was being gassed.

594
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,075

the execution was completed.

That's why there wasn't a match.

one more person on his list.

- [Sighs]
- [Growling]

722
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,116
Hmm. He's mad.

723
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,618
[Yells]

724
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,022
Well, good night.

725
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:49,033
So we're just supposed to get used to

726
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,237
working above a makeshift prison

727
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,641
housing evil people with superpowers.

728
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,344
You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, Caitlin.

729
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,052
Caitlin.

730
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,821
Could I talk to you for a second?

731
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:09,893
Sure. What's up?

732
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:12,262
It's about the night that Ronnie died.

733
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,234
I...

734
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:20,438
Look, Cisco, I'm okay.

735
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,473
I thought coming down here would undo me,

736
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:28,210
but thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

737
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:31,949
It just made me love him more.

738
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:38,357
Come on.

739
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,292
I need ice cream or a drink.

740
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:42,360
Let's see which one we hit first.

741
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:53,136
Joe's gonna be okay.

742
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:01,747
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

743
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:04,148
A lot.

744
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,383
[Sighs]

745
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,349
I miss her.

746
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:11,681
Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

747
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,546
[Chuckles]

748
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,816
A couple times.

749
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,549
Everyone was walking before you.

750
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,815
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

751
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,446
not you.

752
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:22,580
But your mom was never worried.

753
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,915
She just said, he'll walk

754
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:29,484
when he has someplace to go.

755
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:32,487
And sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

756
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:38,460
you moved so quick, you didn't
just walk, you started...

757
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:42,028
To run.

758
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,801
And you ran to your mom, Barry.

759
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:49,407
Right into her arms.

760
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,612
You had someplace to go.

761
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:06,987
I thought being the fastest man alive

762
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,053
would make my life easier...

763
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:11,257
that I could outrun anything.

764
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:15,094
[Dramatic music]

765
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,029
Turns out, no one can outrun pain.

766
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,731
Somebody help! Please, somebody!

767
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,199
Life is tragic.

768
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:28,315
But it's also precious...

769
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:31,689
And sweet...

770
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,196
And extraordinary.

771
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:47,637
And the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

772
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,838
is to keep running.

773
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:11,456
Dr. Wells.

774
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,024
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.

775
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,390
He vented the system.

776
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,857
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

777
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,993
Good man.

778
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:19,563
I'm on my way down.

779
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,189
[Electronics hiss]

780
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,532
[Lightning cracks]

781
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:59,903
See you soon, Barry.
