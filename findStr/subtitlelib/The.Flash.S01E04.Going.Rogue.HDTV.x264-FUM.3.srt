1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,140
When I was a child I saw my
mother killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,233
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:16,167
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,870
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:21,702
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

7
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:23,638
and find others like me.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,075
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

9
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:26,209
Mom!

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,672
And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,073
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,411
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,048
What did you say your name was again?

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,454
- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

15
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:40,730
How's Barry doing?

16
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,463
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

17
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:43,698
The kind I have to keep.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,635
I just have a little experience

19
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:49,142
with liking someone who doesn't
see you the same way.

20
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:51,076
- Dad, the thing is...
- You two are dating.

21
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:53,812
- So you're not mad.
- Oh, I'm mad.

22
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:59,483
What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

23
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,317
Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

24
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,185
I'd be at home chilling,

25
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:05,653
but now my days off are different.

26
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,485
Now they aren't so lonely.

27
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:10,123
The lightning didn't just give me speed.

28
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,324
It also gave me friends.

29
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:15,359
This isn't even remotely
anatomically correct.

30
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,728
That's not the point, Dr. Snow.

31
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,898
Then what is the point?

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,671
To have fun.

33
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:25,041
And to continue your ongoing
training by testing the speed

34
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:29,482
of your mind by pushing
your ability to multitask.

35
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,921
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

36
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:52,205
182 seconds, gentlemen.

37
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,379
Heads up! I think we got something.

38
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,024
2-11, 2-11. We're being robbed!

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,337
Hey, cool it.

40
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:37,741
158 seconds to go.

41
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,115
Checkmate.

42
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,050
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

43
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,222
I guess we still have
a few things left to learn,

44
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:48,424
don't we, Mr. Allen?

45
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:52,597
Armed robbery at 4th and Collins.

46
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,405
For the record, I crushed it
in <i>operation</i> and ping pong.

47
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:05,120
It's not as easy as it looks.

48
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:26,602
Ugh!

49
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:32,072
Where's the nearest hospital?

50
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,874
St. Andrews...
Seven blocks north, two east.

51
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:37,246
Call the ER, tell them
they have an incoming GSW.

52
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,957
Let's go. I want this locked up all the way

53
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,762
to the end of the block.

54
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,262
Tow truck was stolen.

55
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,197
Driver of the armored car
is in a stable condition

56
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,765
at St. Andrews, and no one's
exactly sure how he got there.

57
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,400
Did you check the security cameras?

58
00:03:58,402 --> 00:03:59,969
Camera's storage drive was stolen.

59
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,038
Guys are pros.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,074
Everything's still here,

61
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,975
including what I think they were after,

62
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,675
the Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

63
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:10,546
It was on its way to Central
City museum for exhibition.

64
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,484
Right, Iris is trying
to talk me into going.

65
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,886
I'm not much of a museum guy,

66
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,758
but when she really wants to do something...

67
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,331
I'm just going to walk away now.

68
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,268
Sorry, Captain. I was at the hospital

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,236
- visiting a friend.
- There's nothing missing.

70
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:30,306
It looks like someone
interrupted a robbery.

71
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,907
Guard says there was three of them.

72
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:33,275
Actually, there was four.

73
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:34,708
I mean, that's how many I would bring

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,109
if I were doing a robbery of this nature.

75
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,176
That's definitely a four guy truck.

76
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,811
A driver, two more
to cover the guards, and...

77
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:44,682
Somebody used liquid nitrogen
to crack open this door,

78
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,284
so four bad guys.

79
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,523
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

80
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,056
For somebody so fast,

81
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,791
you're a little slow on the improvising.

82
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,624
Did you see anything that could
help us catch these guys?

83
00:04:55,626 --> 00:05:01,028
Yeah, one of them lost his mask.

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,667
I saw his face.

85
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,334
So look through these mug shots
of Central City's most wanted,

86
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,035
and see if you can find our guy.

87
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,637
That's him.

88
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,007
Damn.

89
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,510
Leonard Snart.

90
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,545
Leonard? That's almost
as bad as Bartholomew.

91
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,215
Snart ain't sexy, either.

92
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,150
Snart's father was a cop...

93
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,751
Was a bad cop.

94
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,019
Took his anger out on his kids
until he went to prison.

95
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,022
Snart's dad's in prison too?

96
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,458
We should start a club.

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,326
He shows up, like, every six months.

98
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,098
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,301
Then, he does the job... Gets away.

100
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,604
That's before The Streak was around.

101
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,874
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

102
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,176
I referred to The Streak,
which I'm pretty sure I can top.

103
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,443
I've been thinking of a new name.

104
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:43,778
What do you think about The Fla...

105
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,413
Coffee break.

106
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:46,681
Thought I would bring
Central City's finest java

107
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,283
over to Central City's finest.

108
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:53,425
Thanks. I'm off caffeine.

109
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,493
My dad's been mad
at me every since I told him

110
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,429
about me and Eddie.

111
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,166
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

112
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,103
Uh, first, that sounds
like you're taking his side,

113
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,638
and second, do you know
how he does this whole,

114
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,340
“I'm not talking to you,
but I have a whole bag

115
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:06,209
"full of judgmental looks
I'm gonna try out on you later”"

116
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:07,744
yeah, I've been on the receiving end

117
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,212
of those a few times.

118
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,846
Speaking of communications,

119
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,148
or lack thereof, after all
of these journalism classes,

120
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,849
- I got an idea.
- Huh.

121
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:16,520
I started a blog.

122
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,425
All right, what's it about?
Your brownie obsession?

123
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,727
'Cause, you know, you probably
shouldn't broadcast that.

124
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,428
No, something important.

125
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,066
Something that Central City
needs to know about, The Streak.

126
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,667
He's out there, Barry.

127
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,867
Rumor has it, he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

128
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:32,769
I was hoping that I could take
a look at the file, and...

129
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:34,370
What? I'm not at liberty

130
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:37,306
to discuss an ongoing police
investigation with you.

131
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:39,575
Since when, Mr. Blabbermouth?

132
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:41,176
Take it from someone who's been

133
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,444
investigating the impossible
since they were 11.

134
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,977
Blogging about this is

135
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,679
only gonna bring the crazies
to your front door.

136
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,448
My blog is anonymous.

137
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,316
All right, well, anonymous
or not, it's not safe.

138
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,251
You never know what kind
of weirdos are out there

139
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,519
trolling on the internet.

140
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,157
I can vouch for that.

141
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:58,960
The internet is full of
weirdos and nerd rage...

142
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:00,728
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

143
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,334
Hi. Felicity Smoak.

144
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,103
Iris West.

145
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,072
Barry Allen.

146
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,208
But you both already knew that.
Felicity is...

147
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,609
The girl that you met in Starling City,

148
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,712
the computerer, right?

149
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:18,249
You two worked on one
of Barry's unexplainable cases.

150
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:23,121
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

151
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:27,230
So the lightning came through here?

152
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,868
Yeah.

153
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:35,773
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

154
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,839
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

155
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,473
What the hell is it, man?

156
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:41,840
Maybe it was a drone.

157
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:45,144
Some top secret army thing.

158
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,281
When I was a kid, my grandfather used to

159
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,920
take my sister and me
to this diner, the motorcar.

160
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:57,092
Food was for crap, but the view was great,

161
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:00,430
right across from
the Central City precinct.

162
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:02,898
I still go there. I listen to their radios.

163
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,598
I learn their response times.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,434
There are 40 banks in Central City,

165
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,238
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,340
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

167
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,242
Once the armored car called 911,

168
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:20,349
we had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

169
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:24,587
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

170
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,458
But something did,

171
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,258
and you lost your cool.

172
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,159
You know the rules.

173
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:36,062
We don't shoot guards or cops
unless it's the only option.

174
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,097
We don't need the heat.

175
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,133
The heat?

176
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:46,034
What the hell do you think
the blur is, Snart?

177
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,236
Right. Screw this.

178
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,340
Screw you. I'm out.

179
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,315
Well, if you're out, you're out.

180
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:02,223
This blur is a man.

181
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:07,227
We're gonna have to up our game.

182
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,564
Iris seems very nice.

183
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:15,168
And really pretty. Like,<i> super</i> pretty.

184
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,002
Congratulations.

185
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,837
Well, Iris isn't my girlfriend.

186
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,608
She's just a friend
who actually has a boyfriend.

187
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,480
Oh, that's... Interesting,

188
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,083
I guess.

189
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,784
What are you really doing here?

190
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,350
I mean, it's good to see you,

191
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,386
but do you and Oliver need something, or...

192
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:38,555
No, no, I came because I wanted to see you.

193
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,324
I heard you were out of the coma.

194
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,593
Didn't call, didn't write,

195
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:47,096
didn't race over...

196
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,733
Oliver told you?

197
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,535
Honestly, I heard you two talking

198
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,469
on that rooftop
in Starling City that night.

199
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,542
I want to see it.

200
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,379
And by “it,” I mean your speed,

201
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,614
in case you thought I was
talking about something else,

202
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:11,489
- which I... which I was not.
- Okay.

203
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,358
Okay, you see that building?

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,393
Uh-huh.

205
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,662
Keep your eyes on it.

206
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,706
Whoo-hoo!

207
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,378
Whoa.

208
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,350
You took a picture of me?

209
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:29,784
From the top of that building?

210
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,153
Yeah. Don't instagram that.

211
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:34,458
Unbelievable.

212
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,093
Your shoes are smoking.

213
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:42,097
That... that's fine.
It's... it happens sometimes.

214
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,530
It's why I have a friction-proof suit.

215
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:47,100
Where did you get that?

216
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,101
I'll show you.

218
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,810
And this is where my team monitors the
police bands for criminal activity.

219
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,411
We can track anything
that's happening in the city.

220
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:06,580
Check this out.

221
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,749
We've got our own satellite.

222
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,150
I know.

223
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,685
I've hacked into it from time to time.

224
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,286
- Rude.
- It is, of course,

225
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,689
so wonderful to see you again, Felicity.

226
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,259
I'm just wondering

227
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,394
how much of our operation
she needs to know about.

228
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,928
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

229
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,398
Yeah, Felicity works with The Arrow.

230
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,635
- Sweet.
- And you apparently are not.

231
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:27,469
Now it's all making sense.

232
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,903
You know who The Arrow is.

233
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,169
Wait, do you know who The Arrow is?

234
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,508
Uh...

235
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,477
Let's just say that my team
has a similar set up,

236
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,749
but with... More pointy objects.

237
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,652
Welcome, Ms. Smoak.

238
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,087
Dr. Wells?

239
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,556
<i>The</i> Dr. Wells?

240
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,793
Please, call me Harrison, Felicity.

241
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:49,894
Oh, you know who I am?

242
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,297
Ranked second in

243
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,766
the national informative
technology competition

244
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,034
at age 19,

245
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,004
graduated M.I.T. with masters degree

246
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,908
in cyber security and computer sciences.

247
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,611
I know who you are.

248
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,746
I keep an eye out for promising
talent in scientific fields.

249
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,181
It's what brought me Cisco, Caitlin,

250
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:11,121
and I foresaw great things from you.

251
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:13,356
Speaking of great things,

252
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,292
want to see something cool?

253
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,397
How fast can he run?

254
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,033
He hasn't reached his top speed yet,

255
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:23,234
theoretically speaking.

256
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:24,736
So is he really okay?

257
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,903
His heart rate is
within normal range for him.

258
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:30,376
No, I mean, the lightning bolt changed him.

259
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,379
Do any of you really know how much?

260
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,983
We know a fair amount.

261
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,818
If everything about him is sped up,

262
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,119
is he going to age faster?

263
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,054
What would happen if he ran too fast?

264
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,623
I mean, would he just
be running, and then, poof,

265
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,730
he's dust in a red costume?

266
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,033
Everything we do here at S.T.A.R. Labs

267
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,603
is to protect Barry Allen.

268
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:54,442
Trust us, Felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

269
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:56,945
Want to see how fast I can run backwards?

270
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,184
Don't worry. He heals quickly too.

271
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,989
Eh, I don't get it.

272
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,859
Why would Snart come here?

273
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,360
Snart's been deterred before,

274
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:12,927
but once he goes after something,

275
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,294
he doesn't stop until he gets it, ever.

276
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,966
Joe, I want you to know that
I'm really serious about Iris.

277
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,171
She's an amazing woman,
and I can really see myself...

278
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,172
I ever tell you about that wild night

279
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:29,008
I had my last day of college?

280
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,675
I don't think so. No?

281
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,212
Not even after we kicked back
a few beers after work?

282
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,682
We've never done that.

283
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,116
Oh, right.

284
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,050
That's the things I do with my friends,

285
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,420
and since we've never done
those things we ain't friends.

286
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,821
So there's actually no reason

287
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,922
I need to know about your dating life.

288
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,828
I just don't want my personal relationship

289
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,767
with your daughter to affect
our working relationship.

290
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,802
It ain't about you, Eddie. It's about her.

291
00:13:56,804 --> 00:14:00,107
So as long as we don't talk
about you and her,

292
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:03,844
we will be cool.

293
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,014
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

294
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:13,321
♪ When a man loves a woman ♪

295
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:16,126
♪ let's get it on ♪

296
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,298
Quiet is good.

297
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,140
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

298
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,242
Hey, you two.

299
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,011
- Hey.
- We're not a two.

300
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,314
Oh, no. We are a one and one.

301
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,816
Yeah.

302
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:32,984
Has Barry been showing you

303
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,552
some of the sights in Central City?

304
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:38,457
Yes, I have seen some
pretty amazing things.

305
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,926
Really?

306
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,928
Well, if you've got some time,

307
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,131
maybe we can show you some
of Central City's night life.

308
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,566
Oh, no.

309
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:49,335
I get plenty of night life
in Starling City.

310
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,136
Oh, this is something that

311
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,003
I don't think that
you're gonna want to miss.

312
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,601
Trivia night at Jitters.

313
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,504
Eddie's not really excited
about it, I admit.

314
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,407
But it could be our night, guys.

315
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,176
Our night to win $75 worth of cappuccinos.

316
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:04,748
Uh, yum.

317
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,218
You know what, I'm gonna go call work,

318
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,120
check in, make sure everything's okay.

319
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:12,124
I'll be back in a second.

320
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,993
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

321
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,394
The trivia night with you and Eddie,

322
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,333
forcing this whole double date thing.

323
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,536
Because that girl is great,

324
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:22,307
and she happens to come
from your very rare species

325
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,709
of adorable nerds.

326
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,981
Why didn't you tell me more about her?

327
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,483
There's nothing to tell.

328
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,986
She's just a friend.

329
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:32,158
Barry, girls don't just hop on trains

330
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,494
and travel hundreds of miles

331
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,661
to see someone that they don't like.

332
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,994
See, this is why you need my help.

333
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,229
Bring her tonight.

334
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,997
We'll have fun.

335
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,735
Yeah, fun.

336
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,707
You wanted state of the art, Snart.

337
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,809
I bring you state of the art, my good sir.

338
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:55,311
- What's this?
- It might not look like much,

339
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,811
but never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

340
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,849
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

341
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:02,986
that ignites on contact with the air.

342
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,021
I don't need to heat things up.

343
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:09,260
I need to slow them down.

344
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:10,427
That's the one, then.

345
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,229
You were drawn right to it.

346
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:15,701
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

347
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,603
and with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

348
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,937
to guard the tech inside.

349
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:23,076
Emits some sort of substance.
I'm not sure what it is.

350
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,448
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

351
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,982
Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech.

352
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,552
What are they for?

353
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,654
The glare. You'll see.

354
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,990
Who else knows you took this?

355
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,995
Just us.

356
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,299
No, just me.

357
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:42,300
Sorry, pal.

358
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,934
Party people, who's ready
to get their trivia on?

359
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,536
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

360
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:03,542
Please, welcome e=mc Hammer.

361
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:06,611
No, you see, I did it because E=mc squared

362
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,449
is Einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

363
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,719
And, you know, <i>can't touch this.</i>

364
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,656
That's great, Barry.

365
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,726
So where is Felicity?

366
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,095
I'm not sure.

367
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:19,266
I told her it started at...

368
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,773
Feel free to buy yourself that dress.

369
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:29,612
I totally overdressed for trivia night.

370
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,448
No, you look amazing.

371
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,420
Yeah, you do.

372
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:36,889
E=mc hammer.

373
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,590
That's funny.

374
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:42,027
See?

375
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,262
It wasn't until 1852,

376
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,899
when the transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

377
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,637
through this thriving cattle town,

378
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,039
that we became officially incorporated.

379
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,579
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

380
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:58,719
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero,

381
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:02,357
cattle rancher Bobby “Bovine” McFeely.

382
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,462
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

383
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:09,734
Hey, kid. Gum?

384
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:19,909
And now, for the exhibit

385
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,113
I'm sure you've all come here to see,

386
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:26,115
the historic Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

387
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,719
Be careful. Get too close

388
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,189
and you'll set off the proximity alarms.

389
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,491
Wouldn't want to do that.

390
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,370
- Three is Pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

391
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,639
Three is Erdel, and four is Pasteur.

392
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,042
- Right.
- Five?

393
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,076
- Descartes.
- Descartes.

394
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,108
Are they even speaking English?

395
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,881
And the points go to E=mc Hammer.

396
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:03,016
I knew you two would make a good team.

397
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,884
So, Felicity, what do you do?

398
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:06,186
I work in computer sciences

399
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,486
- at Queen Consolidated.
- Really?

400
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,990
Do you have a boyfriend in Starling City?

401
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:15,761
No, no, there is no one.

402
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,094
I'll get us some more drinks.

403
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,694
And I had too many of those first ones,

404
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,864
so I will be right back.

405
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,741
- What?
- Dude.

406
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:32,676
Dude? Wha...

407
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:35,112
Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

408
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,149
Look at that dress.

409
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,718
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

410
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,221
she froze.

411
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,623
Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

412
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,158
Felicity is smart, nice, and pretty.

413
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,361
And most importantly, she is the first girl

414
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:50,965
at I have seen you with
that really understands

415
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,000
and appreciates you for the amazing person

416
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,769
that I am always telling you that you are.

417
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,338
She's perfect for you,

418
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,608
so what are you waiting for, Barry?

419
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,180
How long has it been missing?

420
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:09,885
I don't know.

421
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,887
I'm gonna ask you again, Cisco.

422
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,653
But when I do,

423
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:17,659
I expect a more specific answer
than “I don't know.”

424
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:23,134
Now, how long has this weapon been gone?

425
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:25,773
A day, maybe two.

426
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,709
One of the janitors didn't
show up for work this morning.

427
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,679
He was probably the one who took it.

428
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:34,318
I didn't think that...

429
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
You didn't think,

430
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:39,291
because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

431
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:40,693
first your desire to build
something that could,

432
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:41,795
in theory, hurt anyone,

433
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:45,430
and in particular, Barry Allen.

434
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:47,098
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,099
If you just let me explain...

436
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:50,902
You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco.

437
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,638
They do not belong in S.T.A.R. Labs.

438
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,911
Now, you are gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun,

439
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:00,347
and you are gonna do it right now.

440
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:09,592
This thing you built, what can it do?

441
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,930
Bad stuff.

442
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:17,666
You said to call if there
was anything suspicious.

443
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,668
This guy went through the tour twice.

444
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,937
Nobody does that.

445
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:30,510
This is Detective West.

446
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,178
I have a visual on
Leonard Snart at the museum.

447
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,446
Requesting immediate back up.

448
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,283
I'm sorry. I thought I knew it,

449
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:41,818
and I got excited, and I... I just hit it.

450
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,720
No, I mean, maybe they'll get it wrong too.

451
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,653
Oh, yeah. I am sure that the team

452
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,690
named Pride and Padawans
doesn't know the name

453
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:53,626
to Han Solo's ship.

454
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:57,366
Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

455
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:05,642
Someone spotted Snart.

456
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:10,488
- I gotta go.
- I'll cover for you.

457
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,389
All right, what are you gonna say?

458
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:13,791
I usually tell people Oliver's
at a night club with a girl

459
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:14,993
or nursing a hangover.

460
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:16,362
None of which will work for me.

461
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:17,996
Bad stomach ache... Really bad diarrhea.

462
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:19,230
Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that excuse.

463
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:20,364
Just go.

464
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:22,133
Stay safe.

465
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:25,138
And I'm talking to air now, which is odd.

466
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,241
And I'm still doing it.

467
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:45,225
Snart!

468
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,162
- You okay?
- Ahh, aah, it burns.

469
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,277
Time for a test run.

470
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,213
Let's see how fast you are.

471
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,186
Gah!

472
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:56,240
No!

473
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,856
No.

474
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:22,080
It's still numb.

475
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,950
It's presenting itself
like third degree frostbite.

476
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,454
I thought he had hyper healing.

477
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:26,992
It's been slowed.

478
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:28,560
If your cells weren't
regenerating at the rate

479
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:31,062
they are, your blood vessels
would have frozen solid

480
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:33,033
and the nerve damage
would have been permanent.

481
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:34,369
You're lucky to be alive.

482
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,504
Snart wasn't another meta-human.

483
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:37,738
He has some kind of gun.

484
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,173
It froze things, slowed me down...

485
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,543
Enough that I wasn't in time
to save someone.

486
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:45,079
According to his record,

487
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,713
Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

488
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:50,416
so how did he build a handheld
high tech snow machine?

489
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:52,618
S.T.A.R. Labs built the cold gun.

490
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,421
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

491
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:01,424
I built the gun.

492
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,761
You did?

493
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,996
Why?

494
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:08,134
Because speed and cold are opposites.

495
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,701
Temperature is measured

496
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:11,836
by how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

497
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:13,705
The faster they are, the hotter it is,

498
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:16,407
and when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

499
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:18,712
When there's no movement at all,
it's called...

500
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:21,215
Absolute zero.

501
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:22,881
Yeah.

502
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:28,557
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

503
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,791
I built it to stop you.

504
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:33,929
I didn't know who you were then, Barry.

505
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,698
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

506
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,932
like Mardon or Nimbus?

507
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:40,501
But I didn't. Did I?

508
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:44,505
We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

509
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:45,972
and it blew up.

510
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:48,208
In the wake of that,
you can understand why Cisco

511
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,010
would want to be prepared for the worst.

512
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:52,314
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

513
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,184
is why you didn't tell me what you did.

514
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,719
I mean, after all we've been through,

515
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,086
I thought you trusted me.

516
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:00,120
- I thought we were friends.
- We are, Barry.

517
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:01,957
I mean, if you would have just told me,

518
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,826
I could have been prepared.

519
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,028
But instead, someone died tonight.

520
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,969
And I have to live with that.

521
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:15,175
No, Cisco. We all do.

522
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,817
<i>Theatergoers remain shaken</i>

523
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,018
<i>after surviving tonight's
brutal and bizarre attack</i>

524
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,985
<i>in a downtown theater...</i>

525
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:28,055
The news... Are you okay?

526
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:30,891
I'm fine.

527
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,061
How long is this gonna go on?

528
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:35,732
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

529
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,167
Not now, Iris, please.

530
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,301
Yes, now.

531
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:41,104
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

532
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:43,040
for the police academy without telling you.

533
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,842
You didn't speak to me for weeks...

534
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,812
Not until I withdrew my application.

535
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,351
Well, I am not withdrawing this time, dad.

536
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:51,788
I am dating Eddie
whether you like it or not.

537
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,590
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

538
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:55,159
But you don't. You're not a cop.

539
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:57,660
You don't know what having a partner means.

540
00:26:57,662 --> 00:27:00,598
Wherever I go, he goes,

541
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,869
and where I go isn't always safe, Iris.

542
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:07,507
I need to be 100% focused.

543
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,915
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

544
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,883
that doesn't see Eddie as my partner,

545
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,151
but as your boyfriend.

546
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:18,653
So if he gets hurt or worse,

547
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,656
and I'm there,

548
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:22,760
how am I gonna look at you?

549
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:25,830
How you gonna look at me?

550
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,533
Now, I'm not mad at you,

551
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:33,438
but that's why this is so hard for me.

552
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,473
Do you understand?

553
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,812
We're going back tonight.

554
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:42,246
- Back where?
- To the museum.

555
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:44,283
That diamond isn't going to steal itself.

556
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,388
Super gun freeze your brain, Snart?

557
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,256
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

558
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:50,090
- and The Streak.
- This can stop The Streak.

559
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:52,762
It hurt him, and I know his real weakness.

560
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:55,764
So we go, unless you want out.

561
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:59,302
We both want out... Alive.

562
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,169
So you thought ahead and made a plan.

563
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:05,842
Least I taught you something.

564
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:07,612
So what are you waiting for?

565
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:10,582
Shoot me.

566
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:12,818
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

567
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,620
because if you don't,

568
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:17,221
if I ever see either one of you again...

569
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:19,520
You don't get it, do you?

570
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,856
This blur is out there,

571
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:24,989
and Central City ain't
your playground anymore.

572
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,425
Sure, it is.

573
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:41,797
Barry?

574
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,098
Barry.

575
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,070
What? What are you doing?

576
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:50,338
You should go back to your hotel.

577
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,876
- Get some sleep.
- You should too.

578
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:56,112
Not go back to my hotel...
I meant get some sleep.

579
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,751
I can't.

580
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,219
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

581
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,961
I watched him die.

582
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,233
I have to go faster.

583
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:18,103
Barry, it's not your fault.

584
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,671
And it's not Cisco's, either.

585
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,207
Barry, I know you're upset,

586
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,646
but you have to look at this
from his point of view.

587
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,582
No, I get it.

588
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:28,283
He didn't trust me.

589
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,355
Barry, when you met us...
Me, Oliver, and Dig...

590
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:34,394
We were this well-oiled archery machine.

591
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,665
But it didn't start out that way.

592
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,903
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

593
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,974
We came together one at a time.

594
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:43,745
Believe me, it took much more
than watching Oliver

595
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:46,483
do the salmon ladder to make me trust him.

596
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:04,133
I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

597
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,104
It's a lonely path.

598
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:09,937
Don't make it any
lonelier than it has to be.

599
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:24,807
Freeze!

600
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:26,976
You want to end up like that door?

601
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:37,321
Hi there.

602
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:41,296
I figured out a way to track Captain Cold.

603
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,165
You gotta stop naming these guys.

604
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,668
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

605
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,773
The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

606
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:52,213
a microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

607
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:53,514
so the sub-cooled fluid

608
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:55,551
in the chambers don't overflow and...

609
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,285
- Explode.
- Right.

610
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:00,654
This E.C.U. was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

611
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:03,524
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network

612
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:04,791
and send a false update,

613
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:06,224
we'll get a ping back, and then...

614
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:08,792
We can locate Snart.

615
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:10,293
How long will it take?

616
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:11,962
First I have to hack
into the City's network,

617
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:13,931
so I don't know, 30 minutes, maybe?

618
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,632
I can do it in less than one.

619
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,633
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

620
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:21,405
Ow! That was not as badass as I pictured.

621
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,045
All right, I'm in.

622
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,379
Are you kidding?

623
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:29,148
All right, I'm sending the updates.

624
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,482
We're connected.

625
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,548
Network is triangulating the location.

626
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,784
We got him. He's heading west on Nelson

627
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,550
toward the train station.

628
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:39,086
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten

629
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:42,024
what he came for.

630
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,793
When we put our minds to it,

631
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:46,228
dude, nothing can stop us.

632
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,231
Oh, you turned your ear piece off.

633
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,402
How are we gonna talk to each other?

634
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:52,939
I don't feel like talking right now.

635
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:02,653
<i>All available units, suspect
spotted at Central City train station.</i>

636
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,959
We got Snart.

637
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,730
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

638
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,499
That's an order.

639
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,805
- You should go after Barry.
- You heard him, Felicity.

640
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,240
He wants to do this alone.

641
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,641
Of course, he said that.

642
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:18,876
He's hurt.

643
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:20,611
You're his team and his friends.

644
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,913
If I had a nickel for every time
The Arrow told me to back off,

645
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,880
I would be as rich as Oliver Queen,

646
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:27,816
who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

647
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,318
or used to be.

648
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,857
The point is,

649
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:34,391
you have your partner's back

650
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:38,297
no matter what.

651
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,800
I have something that might help.

652
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:54,714
I'm your partner, not your assistant.

653
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,165
There's nowhere to run.

654
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,833
I didn't see you before.

655
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:19,139
Your mom know you're out past your bedtime?

656
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:21,343
If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

657
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:22,946
faster than a train.

658
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:25,713
That's if I wanted to get away.

659
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:28,649
I've seen your weakness at the armored car,

660
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:30,285
then at the theater.

661
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,987
See, while you're busy saving everybody,

662
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:35,591
I'll be saving myself.

663
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,646
Good luck with that.

664
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:31,760
Ahh!

665
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:34,896
Pretty fast, kid,

666
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,500
but not fast enough.

667
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,062
Thank you.

668
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,230
For what?

669
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,434
You forced me to up my game,

670
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,636
not only with this gun,

671
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:53,237
but with how I think about the job.

672
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,838
It's been educational.

673
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,573
Drop it.

674
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,274
This is a prototype cold gun,

675
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:05,011
four times the size, four times the power.

676
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:07,116
I was wondering who you were talking to.

677
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:10,220
Hey, unless you want a taste
of your own medicine,

678
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:11,222
I'd back the hell up.

679
00:35:11,224 --> 00:35:12,457
Your hands are shaking.

680
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:14,160
You've never killed anyone.

681
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:17,129
There's a first time
for everything, Captain Cold.

682
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,068
I will shoot you.

683
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:28,469
You win, kid.

684
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:30,770
I'll see you around.

685
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:37,477
Hey, leave the diamond.

686
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,747
Don't push your luck.

687
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:48,089
Couldn't shoot him if I wanted to.

688
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:51,928
This is actually
the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner

689
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,661
with a lot of L.E.D's.

690
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:57,996
Let's get you warm.

691
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:00,030
Thank you.

692
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,345
We've been trying to track Snart,

693
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:17,119
but he must have
disconnected the signal somehow.

694
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:22,057
We'll find him, Cisco, together.

695
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:26,633
You have a great team here, Barry.

696
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:32,139
Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

697
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,911
It was nice meeting you, Ms. Smoak.

698
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:37,548
Please extend a hello to The Arrow for us.

699
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,819
I will.

700
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:45,494
Good-bye, Felicity.

701
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,530
Bye, Barry.

702
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,503
Remarkable young woman.

703
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:05,170
She's special.

704
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:07,673
Yeah, she is.

705
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:16,152
Cisco,

706
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:21,396
don't you ever do anything like that again.

707
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:25,236
Do you understand me?

708
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:27,807
Yes, sir.

709
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:43,326
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

710
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,966
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in evidence.

711
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,567
I am looking for you.

712
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,703
I came to apologize... Again.

713
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,008
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

714
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,577
Look, dad, I just want you to know

715
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,880
that there is nothing that you could do

716
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,948
that would ever change the way
that I look at you.

717
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,582
And I'm sorry.

718
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:10,117
I should have thought about how

719
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,586
it would affect you if Eddie and I...

720
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:13,591
Listen...

721
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:16,629
Chasing down this Snart character tonight?

722
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:18,932
He had the draw on me.

723
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:22,737
Eddie saved my life.

724
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,539
Maybe I underestimated him.

725
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,373
From now on, no more secrets.

726
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,880
No more secrets.

727
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:43,178
- Well, go see Eddie.
- Okay.

728
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,279
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

729
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:06,937
Did I just yelp?

730
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:08,474
- Yeah.
- I yelped.

731
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,177
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

732
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:11,945
Don't tell me you're here to save me.

733
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:14,080
Taking the train is still one
of the safest ways to travel.

734
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,216
I thought that was airplanes.

735
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:18,385
Mm...

736
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,460
You remember when you told me
you had a little experience

737
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,930
liking somebody who
didn't see you the same way?

738
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,900
That was Iris, right?

739
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,238
How did you know?

740
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,606
It's the little things.

741
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,777
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking,

742
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:44,479
the smile you fake to play the part,

743
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:47,348
quiet dreams you keep to yourself.

744
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,754
Like you and Oliver.

745
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:55,726
Takes one to know one.

746
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:04,035
I'm afraid it'll change everything.

747
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:06,769
It will,

748
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,439
but maybe that's not such a bad thing.

749
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,047
What is wrong with us?

750
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:17,348
We are perfectly perfect for each other.

751
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,386
Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

752
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,220
I guess what they say is true.

753
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,256
Opposites do attract.

754
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:32,294
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

755
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,796
Same.

756
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,331
Well, as fast I can run,

757
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,165
which might take me a while,
but I will still come.

758
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:47,908
Bye, Felicity.

759
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:10,096
Bye, Barry.

760
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,999
Whoo-hoo!

761
00:41:18,638 --> 00:41:21,940
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

762
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:24,674
I know it didn't go so well for you,

763
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:26,410
and I know I said we were finished.

764
00:41:26,412 --> 00:41:28,012
But things have changed.

765
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:29,813
If I want to keep working in Central City,

766
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:32,518
I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

767
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,652
I'm gonna need someone like you.

768
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,688
You're tolerant of extremes.

769
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,289
You have certain skills.

770
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,630
You just need some direction.

771
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:46,831
And I can give that to you.

772
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,437
You still like playing with fire?

773
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:52,272
You're gonna love this.

774
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,306
So...

775
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:56,974
Are you in Mick? Or are you out?

776
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:01,076
Yeah buddy, I'm in.
