1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,840
I don't think anybody could have predicted
the speed and the damage that this virus

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,360
you know, could and has done.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,600
There's no plan for the race team,
no plan for the race cars,

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,440
but also no plan for ourselves.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,560
It's terrifying.
Each and every day, it's terrifying.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
We've got to get back
so that all ten teams have a chance,

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
not a guarantee, but a chance of survival.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>Just a heads up, Mr. Zak Brown is on-site.</i>

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,040
Only the second time
I've been in my office

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,720
since the race getting canceled
in Australia.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,960
Feels like a sci-fi movie.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Very bizarre.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
<i>Level plus one.</i>

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,840
It's no secret we had
our financial challenges through COVID.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,840
It's devastated businesses.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
It brought us to a standstill.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,280
That means job redundancies and pay cuts.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Just impossible to know, uh,
what the future has in front of us,

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,200
and I think all we can do now
is hope for the best.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Hey, how are you?

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah, good. Just at the office.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
Yeah. Quiet<i>.</i>

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Do you think there's a scenario

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,960
where you could even just get 15 races in?

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
So what does that then look like?

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Two Austria, then Hungary.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,280
Europe, Middle East,

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,480
global.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
Sounds like everything is under control.
All right. Good stuff.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,720
<i>There is good news coming out of Formula 1</i>

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>as racers dust off their cars
and get underway</i>

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
<i>with the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,120
<i>The British Formula 1 Grand Prix
will go ahead in July.</i>

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,480
Ah, morning, Netflix. Back for more.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Two meters this year though.
You gotta keep your distance.

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,040
<i>The person you are calling
is unable to take your call.</i>

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,560
Drivers. It's a problem.
It's probably too early in the morning.

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm just grateful that we're...
we're racing.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,320
I think, to get the series up and running,
it's been a phenomenal effort.

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,680
You know, I've had ten weeks
sitting at home, not doing anything.

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,000
Teams are gonna be race-rusty
on the strategy, on the pit stops.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
And I think that this year
will create some different scenarios.

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,560
But it feels like Mercedes
could be vulnerable this year.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,680
I think this work from home thing's
been taken to an extreme in marketing.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,880
"Work from home." We never saw 'em again.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,840
The way this is structured
is everybody gets a section of questions.

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,720
They will direct a question to you
when they want you to answer.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,880
- It's not interactive between me and Toto?
- It doesn't appear to be.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
So I can't take the piss
out of this haircut.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,480
It doesn't appear to be.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,920
Ask Susie,
"Have you been cutting Toto's hair?"

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Right, Christian, if you want
to grab a seat in the hot seat.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,720
Hey, Susie, how are you?

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,440
<i>- Good, Christian. How are you?
- </i>Good. You got Toto doing the housework?

56
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,200
<i>No. No chance on that one.</i>

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm in my kitchen.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,960
<i>It's a nice kitchen.</i>

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
<i>That's a great kitchen.</i>

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,160
<i>Toto's gonna be really looking forward
to getting back to racing.</i>

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Personally, I'm looking forward
to seeing Toto again

62
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,840
and hopefully giving him a harder time
this year.

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
<i>Absolutely.
We are fierce competitors,</i>

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,120
<i>but I, personally, actually look forward
to the racing itself.</i>

65
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,280
<i>Forget all the rest around it,
um, let's just race.</i>

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,240
How long do you think it'll be
until the glovesjust come off?

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,000
I reckon about two o'clock Sunday.

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,360
Sunday afternoon in Austria.

69
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,520
<i>Good morning, everybody,
from the Styrian Hills. We're in Austria.</i>

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,240
<i>This is the first race
in the 2020 Formula 1 season.</i>

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,040
<i>The arena is open for business.
The 20 gladiators return.</i>

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Bonjour!

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
Perfect.

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,120
That's deep.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Sorry, you will have to wait.
You're way too hot.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
That's just the way I am.

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
Would you like to say hello to the fans?

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
- We've actually got fans here?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

79
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Check this out.

80
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
Hiya. How are you doing?

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
<i>- Morning, Lance.</i>
- Morning. Hello.

82
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm really impressed by this.
This is awesome.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,000
I think you're on mute.

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,960
- Wait for it.
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,440
Yep. What's going on?

86
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,240
You can ask me a question, or I can just
stand here and dance or something.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
I don't know. As you will.

88
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
<i>I want to see you dance, please.</i>

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Aaah!

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,040
I shouldn't have said that!

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
I shouldn't have said that.

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
The Austrian Grand Prix
is an absolute marker in the ground

93
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
that, you know,
Formula 1 is open for business again.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,120
After lockdown, we are finally able
to take the covers back off the race cars

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
and have a Grand Prix.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Getting into the paddock,
seeing the people again,

97
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,040
knowing that you can get back soon racing,
the feeling is fantastic.

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,720
- Morning.
- I won't shake your hand.

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm very much looking forward
to going racing again.

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,520
As an Austrian, I enjoy being in Austria.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,480
As a racing team,
it's back to what we love in the sport,

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,120
and that is the stopwatch.

103
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,760
Hey. I don't know what to do.
Do I touch you? Do I...

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
I don't think we can hug.

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
- Good. You been okay?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,320
Christian, to give him credit,

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,440
he came into the sport very young.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,200
He was put in charge
of the Red Bull Formula 1 team

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,480
and won four championships.

110
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,840
Red Bull ruled the roost
for four years

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,520
and then along came Toto and Mercedes
and stole their ball.

112
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,800
And Christian wants it back.

113
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,920
It's incredibly hard
to keep that level of winning consistency,

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,240
and all credit to Mercedes.

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,480
We managed it for four years.
They've managed it for six.

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,600
But inevitably,
at some point, that comes to an end.

117
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,200
Christian. Are we allowed to...

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,456
- Are we allowed to shake or not?
- Probably not.

119
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,240
- No, what about this?
- We do a little toe hug.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
- It's all right.
- Good.

121
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,080
Have you been OK?

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
It's good to be back
after such a long break.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
- It's crazy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Stronger and fitter than ever.
That's good.

125
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,200
But we also have more time,
so you would expect that.

126
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
Max is,

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,040
arguably, the hottest property
in Formula 1 at the moment.

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,760
The thing about Max
is he's got this magic dust about him.

129
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,520
The dream is
to win a fifth world championship,

130
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,760
to make Max the youngest
Drivers' World Champion ever.

131
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,680
Three, two, one.

132
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,960
Alex is Max's teammate.

133
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,600
He had a really solid,
you know, nine races for us,

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,640
and put in a very strong performance.

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
Yes. Come on!

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,440
He could be
the surprise of this season.

137
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,160
- Yes!
- Come on!

138
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,120
<i>Excellent work, Alex.
Thumbs up, mate.</i>

139
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
With Max, with Alex,

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
we've got two cars
in the fight with Mercedes.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
This is our best shot
to win this championship,

142
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,240
you know, since 2013.

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,520
Hello? Hello? Where's our entrance?

144
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,576
- Our entrance is that one.
- That one?

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,480
- There other one.
- Oh, here we go.

146
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,000
It's too long
since I've been at the track.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
It's gonna be really interesting

148
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,000
to see where the drivers all lie
after lockdown.

149
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
I feel excited about getting back
in the car. It's been such a long time.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
You know, you get itchy, uh,

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
itchy feet and hands,
getting back in the car.

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,880
I'm ready to get back into it.

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,320
We've got an acronym, "FSU."
"Fuck shit up."

154
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
That's what I'm hoping to do.

155
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,560
It's such a good racetrack,
so I cannot wait to get on track, be fast.

156
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
Don't forget the boots, mate.

157
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,960
Everyone will be a bit rusty,
but you get back in the swing of things.

158
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
<i>And radio check.</i>

159
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,400
<i>It is time for the cars
to take to the track.</i>

160
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
<i>You're free. Go push.</i>

161
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Max said
he doesn't need to do any practice.

162
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
He just needs two laps,
he'll be switched on.

163
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,680
And that's what... These guys,
they're the pinnacle, aren't they?

164
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
They should just be able to flip a switch
and they're back onto it.

165
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
<i>Fuck.</i>

166
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

167
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,080
Our goal is to get closer to third,
but thecompetition's tough.

168
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
You have Racing Point.

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,720
<i>Sergio Perez,
fastest for Racing Point.</i>

170
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,000
And then Renault.

171
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
Extremely strong.

172
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,960
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, fifth fastest.</i>

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,440
It's gonna be a big fight.

174
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,360
Let's maximize
our time on the track.

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,240
It's the longest
I've been out of a race car in...

176
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,080
Well, since I started go-karts
back in 2007.

177
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,240
Things were pretty much just playing games
and streaming on Twitch.

178
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,960
And that was pretty much my life.
Now there's just so much excitement.

179
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,040
Just being able to do what I love,
driving a Formula 1 car.

180
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,120
Just going to take a few laps
to get back into it.

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,760
In Austria, you've got a massive
long straight as you come out the pits,

182
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
and you put your throttle down.

183
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Your head gets put back
against the headrest.

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
Your body gets compressed.

185
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Then you hit the brakes
for the first time.

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
My head just fell forward

187
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,720
and it just felt like I was,
I'd never driven a car before.

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,640
It just feels a bit alien really.

189
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
But within a couple of laps,
it just felt like I was back home again.

190
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,040
Uh, <i>Max, can I have
engine five, position two, please.</i>

191
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,296
<i>Looking a very strong lap by Verstappen.</i>

192
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,280
<i>- Yeah.
- Personal best.</i>

193
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,560
We've had a habit of coming out the blocks
a little slowly the last few years.

194
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
We need to address that<i>.</i>

195
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,720
We have to believe in ourselves.
We have to beat Mercedes.

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,720
- You're back up to speed quick.
- Yeah. That's always the goal.

197
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
- Did it feel quick?
- No, it was all right.

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,080
It's fast, don't get me wrong,
but, like, it feels all right.

199
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,840
OK, <i>Lewis,
so circuit's all clear. All clear.</i>

200
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
<i>Give yourself a bit of room
so you are safe.</i>

201
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,240
<i>Lewis Hamilton on track at the moment</i>.

202
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,960
<i>There's a lot of intrigue
around the Mercedes.</i>

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,040
<i>There's something
very interesting going on in the cockpit.</i>

204
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
<i>Yeah. There we go.</i>

205
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
<i>That's the DAS.</i>

206
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,880
<i>The steering, moving about.</i>

207
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
<i>Interesting.</i>

208
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,400
<i>Not seen that before.</i>

209
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>Um...</i>

210
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,920
<i>Yeah. As he hits the anchors,
the steering wheel is moving forward.</i>

211
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,000
<i>Yeah, very interesting.</i>

212
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,200
The reason that DAS is so clever,
but also so controversial,

213
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,000
is that Mercedes have been able to create
a system that not only steers the car,

214
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,920
but also, when you pull that wheel out
and push it back in again,

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,480
it changes the positioning of the tires
to improve grip,

216
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
which should give extra speed
through the corners.

217
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,760
We're giving six tenths,
seven tenths to Hamilton on the straights.

218
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,280
We've got seven to eight tenths
in qualifying.

219
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,840
It depends how much they've got.

220
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,520
If they've got that much,
then we're fucked.

221
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,880
What is he doing with it though?
Does it try and heat tires up or...

222
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,400
That's what it looks like.
It's not really a steering system.

223
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Right.

224
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
Is there gonna be a protest?

225
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,560
It's the only way to clear it up.

226
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,320
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

227
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,720
How you doing?

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Monty looks so different
with his hair cut.

229
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,920
- <i>Talk to Daddy.</i>
- How was swimming, Mont?

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,360
<i>- He's getting really good.
- </i>Yeah.

231
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
<i>How did P3 go?</i>

232
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,400
Okay. They were third and sixth.

233
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,440
<i>Who was one and two, Mercedes?</i>

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,440
Ah, yeah, I'm gonna say they look
very strong here, so let's see.

235
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
<i>Um... okay.</i>

236
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,160
It's all quite tight, apart from Hamilton.
I'm gonna have to go.

237
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
- Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,960
<i>- Love you. Bye.
- </i>Bye. Bye.

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
Hi, hi, hi.

240
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,000
The DAS system
that they're running on their car,

241
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,680
the steering system,
falls into a very gray zone.

242
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,760
So you've got your DAS on the car.

243
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
We've got the DAS.

244
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,120
I know.
Well, don't take it personally.

245
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
No, I won't.

246
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,240
But we'll protest it today.

247
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,440
And then it's down to the FIA.
They're either happy or they're not.

248
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,120
As an innovation, isn't it great?

249
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,680
It's clever.
Hats off, full respect.

250
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,000
It adds a new dimension to it.

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,440
I think I'd shit myself

252
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,600
if I pulled a steering wheel
and it went like that.

253
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Christian is a good operator.

254
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
He likes to have
these little war games between us.

255
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,120
But the rivalry is big.

256
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
<i>It's time for qualifying</i>

257
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,280
<i>and the serious business of forming a grid
ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>

258
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,640
<i>It's the season opener</i>

259
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,240
<i>and it's been a long time since
the Formula 1 season began in Europe.</i>

260
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,920
There's Mr. Todt.

261
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,160
I'll say hello to him.

262
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,000
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

263
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Yeah, okay.

264
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,560
Are you quick or not?

265
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,200
I hope so. We'll see today.
Mercedes is bloody quick.

266
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,960
We tried to slow them down with the DAS,
but no luck.

267
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,840
The FIA have judged DAS to be legal,

268
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,240
which means
Mercedes can use it on their car

269
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,000
until the end of the season.

270
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,200
Under control.

271
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,840
You do the foot one.
Is that how you do it?

272
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,080
What was the response
to the protest stuff?

273
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,920
I think, from a fan perspective,
people are just saying,

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
"Red Bull are just responding
to getting whipped on the track."

275
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
- Yeah.
- 'Cause that's what they see.

276
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
- So...
- We'll see.

277
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,960
<i>So far, this weekend
has been absolutely perfect for Mercedes.</i>

278
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,480
<i>Lewis Hamilton,
heading every single session.</i>

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
<i>Mercedes, the favorites for pole today.</i>

280
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,976
- They're bloody quick.
- They're strong.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,600
- Even stronger than we expected.
- Unbelievable.

282
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,760
<i>But what have Red Bull,
with Alex Albon and Max Verstappen,</i>

283
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,080
<i>got up their sleeves?</i>

284
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,320
- Let's see what happens in this session.
- It's gonna be tough for Alex.

285
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,120
If he can get in the top six,
that'll be okay.

286
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
Alex had a really good
second part to the season last year,

287
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,080
and now he comes into the races this year
ready to score big points.

288
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,800
Ready to help Red Bull
in their fight against Mercedes.

289
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,160
- Okay, Alex.
- Yep?

290
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,040
- You can fire up.
<i>- </i>Copy.

291
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,760
Alex has ticked all the boxes
with how he races.

292
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,280
I think it's only a matter of time
before he achieves that first podium.

293
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,880
He did have a chance last year in Brazil,
but it all went a bit wrong.

294
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,920
<i>Alex Albon should have this wrapped up.</i>

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>Hamilton now is gonna try
and take second place.</i>

296
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>Alex, hold Hamilton up.
Keep your position.</i>

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,320
<i>Albon locks up.</i>

298
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Hamilton inexplicably turned him round.

299
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Fuck!

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,080
<i>- Albon's been hit!</i>
- Fuck!

301
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,880
<i>The chance of his first podium, gone.</i>

302
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
It was painful.

303
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,560
Frustrating. But if I did it again,
I would've been more aggressive.

304
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
I know what I need to do,
and now it's more about just

305
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
getting them results in.

306
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,120
<i>Okay, Alex.
You'll get one timed lap.</i>

307
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
Yep, copy.

308
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
<i>The moment of reckoning.</i>

309
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,160
No lift off Turn 1.

310
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,640
This car still feels very nervous.

311
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
Work the brakes.

312
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Okay, copy.

313
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
Alex, come on!

314
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,160
- Go on, boy!
- Come on!

315
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,400
<i>Albon goes fourth fastest.</i>

316
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,480
<i>But Norris is on a flyer just behind.</i>

317
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,800
<i>We're now onboard
with Lando Norris on a flying lap.</i>

318
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,720
Lando, you're 0.4 seconds quicker
than Albon. Keep this up.

319
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,680
Fucking hell!

320
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,880
<i>Push now, please. Push now.</i>

321
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
<i>100% pace.</i>

322
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
<i>Give it everything.</i>

323
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,480
<i>Is Lando Norris quicker than Alex Albon?</i>

324
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh, he's quicker.

325
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,320
<i>Norris steals fourth
from Albon. What a lap.</i>

326
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Yeah!

327
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,240
<i>Lando, P4, mate. Amazing job. P4.</i>

328
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,320
<i>Lewis Hamilton on his final flying lap.</i>

329
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,160
<i>DRS, wide open then for Lewis Hamilton.</i>

330
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,120
<i>Oh, and someone's had a problem.</i>

331
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,880
<i>And it's Valtteri Bottas
going off into the gravel.</i>

332
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,680
<i>Yellow flag out there.
Does that mean Hamilton has to back off?</i>

333
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,800
If Lewis Hamilton drove through
a yellow-flag zone without slowing down,

334
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
it will be considered to be dangerous

335
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,120
and the penalty will be severe.

336
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Did they show a yellow flag?
I couldn't see with the dust.

337
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,080
<i>Hamilton rounds the final corner.</i>

338
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>So it looks like Lewis's time stands.</i>

339
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>He takes second place,
behind Bottas on pole,</i>

340
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>and Mercedes qualify one-two for the race.</i>

341
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,520
- Well done. Ish.
- Yeah.

342
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,040
A yellow flag is that you have to
show caution and slow down.

343
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
The drivers know.

344
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,560
They've grown up with that
since their first races in karting.

345
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,880
Looking at his lap time,
I'm pretty sure he didn't lift.

346
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,800
He should get a fucking penalty.

347
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,800
Against a Mercedes team
that is so strong, so dominant,

348
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,840
you have to exploit every opportunity
that you possibly can.

349
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,160
<i>It's here.
Round 1 of the 2020 season.</i>

350
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,840
<i>We're in Austria around the Red Bull Ring.</i>

351
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,840
Christian Horner aims
to disrupt Mercedes

352
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,360
in any way that he can.

353
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,080
So, yeah, you'll protest DAS.
Yeah, you'll protest that qualifying lap.

354
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,840
You're not gonna win championships

355
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,120
by just sitting back
and accepting everything.

356
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
So we've got to push.

357
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,560
He's like a dog with a bone.
He won't let go.

358
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,560
We found some more footage
the FIA didn't have, which is crazy,

359
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
from his camera in his car.

360
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,680
And you can clearly see a yellow flag.

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,520
The stewards
hadn't looked at that footage.

362
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Good luck today.

363
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,880
You put us back three spots now?
Or what happened?

364
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,880
I don't know. We're trying.

365
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,840
Something's gotta slow you down.

366
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,760
- I'm starting P3!
- Are you?

367
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,520
- Yeah!
- How come? Where's Hamilton, P10?

368
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
I don't know. I don't care.

369
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,160
- Maybe thanks to Horner.
- Oh yeah.

370
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,840
Three-place penalty
confirmed for Lewis.

371
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,160
Surely the decision was made
before 14:20 on race day?

372
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,360
The timing of it was brilliant.

373
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,200
Because Mercedes
had already made their way to the grid

374
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,920
and were setting up Lewis Hamilton's
grid spot from his original place.

375
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,680
If you're gonna pull the rug
from under your biggest rival,

376
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,240
you wait till the last minute.

377
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,560
I love the idea
of keeping pressure on 'em.

378
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,800
Best time to do it.
That'll really ruffle him now.

379
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
Anyway, good job.

380
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,280
Christian likes to rumble around
a little bit.

381
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,680
But I think
we're doing it a bit different.

382
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,120
We concentrate on ourselves.
We don't look too much left and right.

383
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,520
We do the talking on the track.

384
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,240
<i>217 days without a race,</i>

385
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,600
<i>the longest period in Formula 1 history,
and finally we can go racing.</i>

386
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,800
Seems like a long time
since we've been here.

387
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,920
<i>After Red Bull's protest,
it's Verstappen up to second,</i>

388
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,360
<i>Lando Norris's best ever start
in third place,</i>

389
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,080
<i>Alex Albon in fourth,</i>

390
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,920
<i>and Hamilton,
well, he's been bumped back down to fifth.</i>

391
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,520
<i>That's a big blow for Toto Wolff
and for Mercedes.</i>

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm always excited,
but I'm always nervous.

393
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,440
You'd like to cruise to victory
anytime you're on a race track,

394
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
but you know
it's never gonna quite be that easy.

395
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,280
- At least you have a fast car.
- Yeah. We needed that.

396
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,600
Especially after everything we've had
in the last two, three months.

397
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,200
The one thing
that we've talked to Lando about

398
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,360
is just maybe being
a little bit more aggressive.

399
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,280
We've all got one chance
in this championship,

400
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,280
so it's all about making sure
you're always focused

401
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
on what you need to do
to extract the best performance.

402
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
Have a good one.

403
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,800
I think we're well-equipped.
The drivers are up for it.

404
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,080
Max is in the best shape he's been in.

405
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,720
It'll be down to
who makes the least mistakes,

406
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,640
gets the most out of these early races,
and particularly this weekend.

407
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,120
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

408
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,480
<i>And it's lights out, and away we go!</i>

409
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,560
<i>Verstappen alongside Lando Norris.</i>

410
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
No!

411
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
<i>So far, so good. No contact.</i>

412
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,640
<i>Lando, urgent. Albon's behind.</i>

413
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,200
<i>Alex Albon passes
Lando Norris, goes into third place.</i>

414
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,680
Behind is Hamilton.

415
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,000
Confirm.

416
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
<i>Overtake available.</i>

417
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>Lewis Hamilton now ahead of Lando Norris.</i>

418
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,080
<i>Alex Albon might be a touch worried,</i>

419
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,560
<i>Lewis Hamilton's getting within DRS range.</i>

420
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,560
- They're so fast on the straights.
- Understood. You're doing great.

421
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,440
<i>The last time
Hamilton tried to overtake Alex Albon,</i>

422
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,200
<i>he missed out on a podium in Brazil
and Hamilton got a penalty.</i>

423
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
Come on, Alex! Come on!

424
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,680
<i>So it's Mercedes,
Red Bull, Mercedes, Red Bull.</i>

425
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
<i>The one, two, three, four,
with Lando Norris dropping back.</i>

426
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,800
Max,
Hamilton is now the car behind.

427
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,440
<i>Engine nine, position four.</i>

428
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,640
<i>What's happened to Max Verstappen?</i>

429
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,520
I've just stalled.
Tell me something.

430
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,360
Stand by.

431
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,680
<i>Verstappen,</i>

432
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,760
<i>desperately trying
to get power back into that Red Bull.</i>

433
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,000
It's going backwards.
This fucking setting!

434
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Engine nine, position two.
Engine nine, position two.

435
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
It keeps saying the fucking...
I can't change it.

436
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,480
<i>- How can this happen?</i>
- Okay, Max, box, please. Box.

437
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,080
Just gutting.

438
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,800
He is our championship hopeful.

439
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,320
We're in a great position
in the opening race,

440
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,080
in our home Grand Prix.

441
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,960
- Switch off.
- Fuck this.

442
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,640
And he's out.

443
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,400
It was just a punch in the guts
for the whole team.

444
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,320
But then, you know,
we've still got a car in the race.

445
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,480
<i>Great job, mate.</i>

446
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,560
It looks like a solid P3 for Alex.

447
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Which... Okay, we've lost Max,
but we should get a podium.

448
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,520
The fact that Albon is fighting
for podiums and a potential victory

449
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,000
shows that he's delivering
on the promise that we believe in him.

450
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,600
That first podium, that first victory,
it removes the pressure.

451
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,160
There's a big difference between thinking
you can do it and knowing you can do it.

452
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,080
Box, Alex, box.

453
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Box, box.

454
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,880
We put him onto a new set
of tires for the last stint.

455
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,280
Which, amazingly,
Mercedes didn't cover.

456
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
That gave him a significant tire advantage

457
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,360
for what would almost certainly be
his first Grand Prix victory.

458
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,496
<i>This has worked out
brilliantly for Red Bull.</i>

459
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,200
<i>Albon has a chance at the win.</i>

460
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>Albon's got a slipstream
on Lewis Hamilton.</i>

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,880
- Come on.
- Come on!

462
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,120
<i>Great exit from Alexander Albon!</i>

463
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
- Come on, Alex.
- That's it. Come on.

464
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,640
Go on!

465
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Come on!

466
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,520
<i>He's lost out once more,
as it was in Brazil!</i>

467
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,360
Oh fuck! Again!

468
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,960
This guy is such a sore loser.

469
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,080
- What a load of bollocks.
- Fucking, fucking fuck!

470
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,240
<i>He was about to take
his first Formula 1 podium</i>

471
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,800
<i>and now he's tumbling down to last place.</i>

472
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Ugh!

473
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>Lewis Hamilton
is given a five-second penalty</i>

474
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,240
<i>for causing a collision with Alex Albon.</i>

475
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,200
Hard luck. Hamilton, for what
it's worth, got a five-second penalty.

476
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,640
Copy.

477
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,920
<i>Remember,
Hamilton has a five-second penalty.</i>

478
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,800
<i>McLaren need to be telling Lando Norris.</i>

479
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,920
<i>Hamilton is 6.5 ahead.
He has a five-second penalty.</i>

480
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,400
<i>Norris has a chance of a podium.</i>

481
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Come on, Lando!

482
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,480
Oh my God.

483
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,000
I had one and a half laps
to try and somehow gain

484
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,200
this 1.5 seconds
I needed for my first podium in Formula 1.

485
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,000
<i>Go flat out to the end.
Give it everything.</i>

486
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
I never really thought,
"I can do this,"

487
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,360
because it was Lewis Hamilton
in a Mercedes, who are a lot quicker.

488
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
Normally.

489
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,400
It was,
"Forget about everything and just drive."

490
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,000
Please, mate, come on.

491
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
<i>We're on the final lap.</i>

492
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,400
<i>Can Norris find the lap of his life to get
within five seconds of Lewis Hamilton?</i>

493
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
Look, how sweaty my hands...

494
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,880
I could really push the car
to the limit, 100%.

495
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Come on.

496
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,200
It was incredible, and insane.

497
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,000
All of a sudden, I go over the line.

498
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,680
<i>Lando Norris
with the fastest lap of the race.</i>

499
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Did he do it or not?

500
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,720
<i>Lando,
the gap to Hamilton was 4.8.</i>

501
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
<i>That's a podium.</i>

502
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,200
Yeah!

503
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,960
Fuck yeah, boy!

504
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes!

505
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,200
It was incredible.

506
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,800
Something I'll remember
for the rest of my career in Formula 1.

507
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Yeah!

508
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Whoo!

509
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,080
I'm glad I was able to share
Lando's podium at the start of the season.

510
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,480
That was an awesome reward
for everyone's hard work and dedication

511
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800
and, um, it was exactly what we needed.

512
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,920
Hard luck, mate.

513
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Fuck!

514
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,360
He doesn't like you, does he?

515
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,480
It'll come.

516
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
It'll come.

517
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,680
You did nothing wrong today.

518
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,000
- Oh man, that race!
- Amazing!

519
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,960
- Chin up. It's gonna come.
- See you.

520
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,120
It'll just make you
enjoy it even more when it does.

521
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.
I mean, I would have enjoyed it a lot now.

522
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,240
I know. I think we all would.

523
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Cheers.

524
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,520
Fucking hell.

525
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,920
People say
Valtteri is your number two driver.

526
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
- Is that fair?
- Fuck you.

527
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,160
- I hate to be second.
- He was a sensational wingman.

528
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,280
Well, first of all, "wingman" hurts.

529
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Everyone's expecting Lewis to win,
but everyone cracks. Action.

530
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,080
The pressure is gonna be on Alex.

531
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,600
He needs a bit more
of that "fuck you" attitude.

532
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,600
<i>Oh my goodness, it's a slow stop!</i>

533
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,680
The competitiveness
is not where we want it. Fuck!

534
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,840
We can try again next week, huh?
