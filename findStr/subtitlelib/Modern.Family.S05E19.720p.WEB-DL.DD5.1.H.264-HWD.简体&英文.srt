1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,640
我爸寄来了个包裹
We got a package from my dad.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,700
盒子上没有气孔
No air holes in the box.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,370
这是个好兆头
That's a good sign.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,970
莉莉很喜欢那只小鸡
Lily loved having that chicken.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,680
后来吃得也很开心  尽管她不知情
One more time than she realized.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,260
我刚收到婚礼歌手的电邮
Listen, I just got an e-mail from our wedding singer.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,680
-他有个小要求  -又来吗
- He has a small request.   - Another one?

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,040
婚礼歌手何时开始向我们提要求了
Since when does the wedding singer send us requests?

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,300
不  他只是想把你的几首歌换掉
Well, no, he just wants to change a few songs in your medley

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,180
以免跟他要表演的部分重复
to avoid overlap with the stuff that he's performing.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,980
可别换了我的重头戏
Well, I hope it's none of my showstoppers.

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,590
你的歌都是重头戏啦
Oh, they're all showstoppers.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,050
你太好了
Oh, you're too kind.

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,070
天啊  是我们
Oh, my gosh, it's us.

15
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,860
放在我们的婚礼蛋糕上
For our wedding cake.

16
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,100
是不是激动得要死了
Couldn't you just die?

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
我真觉得我要死了
I really think I could.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,080
我爸爸做的
My dad made this.

19
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,700
他可是世界级的肥皂雕刻师
He's a world-class soap carver.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,210
我小时候有一次说脏话
You know, once, when I was a kid, I cussed,

21
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,430
我妈妈用他雕的比萨斜塔
and my mom washed my mouth out

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,340
洗我的嘴
with the leaning tower of Pisa.

23
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
她到现在还在自责
She still blames herself to this day.

24
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,940
本来我是会马上反对那个婚礼蛋糕人偶的
Oh, I would have nixed that wedding topper immediately,

25
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,690
但小卡跟我有项协议
but Cam and I have an agreement.

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,520
我们每人有三次否决对方婚礼创意的机会
We -- we each got three vetoes of each other's wedding ideas --

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,090
无需任何理由
No questions asked.

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,000
倒是  实施了那么一小会儿
And it -- it worked for...a while

29
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,100
你会爱上我的婚礼公告牌的
I think you're gonna love my wedding board.

30
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,980
我也非常激动
I'm pretty excited, too.

31
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,770
-反对  -反对
- Veto.   - Veto.

32
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,630
-反对  -反对
- Veto.  - Veto.

33
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,660
很抱歉我太激动了
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,360
真的是最棒的礼物了
It's just the nicest thing ever.

35
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,560
你不觉得我看起来有点
You don't think that I look just a little bit --

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,140
我爸爸忍着关节炎刻出来的
I mean, my dad carved through his arthritis!

37
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,240
可能是因为那只翘起来的腿
Maybe it's the kicky leg.

38
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,590
想想他用一双残手雕刻所投入的时间
I mean, the hours his ruined hands put into this.

39
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,070
他在肥皂中挖掘到了我们
He found us in soap.

40
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,420
今天  米奇尔  我懂得了爱
Today, mitchell, I know love.

41
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,820
我也懂得了"唉"
I no love, either.

你四处看看吧
So, take your time looking around.

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,880
谢谢
Thanks.

55
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,990
我在帮歌洛莉亚卖掉她在认识杰之前
I'm helping Gloria sell the old apartment

56
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,050
和曼尼住的旧公寓
that she and Manny lived in before she met Jay.

57
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,440
这里的邻居前卫大胆
It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood

58
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,980
拥有鲜明独特的多元文化趋向
with a distinct multicultural bent

59
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,440
正在经历着令人欣喜的城市复兴
that's undergoing an exciting urban renewal.

60
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,300
换个说法就是"基佬们发现了这块宝地"
That's a fancy way of saying "The gays found it."

61
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,410
难以置信我在这里住了五年
I can't believe that I lived here for five years.

62
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,250
连开灯都很痛苦
Even turning the lights on was a pain.

63
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,500
你看
Look at this.

64
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,040
小点声  你个婊子
Keep it down, you bitch!

65
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,000
里维拉太太还活着
Ay. Mrs. Rivera's still alive.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,100
我还真中意这地方
I am really digging this place.

67
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,920
是吧
Right?

68
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,450
瞧瞧这燃气灶  线脚
The gas stove, the moldings --

69
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,920
如今很难找到这样的房子了
they don't make 'em like this anymore.

70
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,850
我可能会全拆掉
I'll probably gut it.

71
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,370
全拆掉
Rip it out.

72
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,650
我也会这么做
That's what I'd do.

73
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,370
我会让我的承包人来看看
I want my contractor to swing by,

74
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,540
但我真的很喜欢这里
but I really like it.

75
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,250
太好了  好极了  谢谢
Great. All right. Thanks.

76
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,720
-拜拜  -再联系
- Bye-bye.  - Talk to you soon.

77
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,850
真高兴认识你
So nice to meet you.

78
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,730
我才不卖给他
I'm not selling to him.

79
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,970
什么  真的吗
What? Really?

80
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,120
他是个不错的买家啊
He's a quality buyer.

81
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
你也不想再找租客了
You're tired of finding renters.

82
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,890
这房子是给一大家子人住的
This is a family building.

83
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,350
一大家子几代人
Generations have lived there,

84
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,350
往往是数世同堂
and usually at the same time.

85
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,360
他不过是想转手赚钱
He just wants to flip it.

86
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,580
好吧
Okay.

87
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,410
还有另一个买家大概一小时后能到
I got a backup I can probably get here in an hour.

88
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,890
你想去那里面等吗
You want to wait in there?

89
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,580
你走进去
You walk in that door,

90
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,180
[鸡尾酒吧]

91
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,080
就别想出来了
you never come out.

92
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,830
不不  不是那家酒吧  是那家咖啡厅
No, no, not the bar -- the coffee shop.

93
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,670
对啊  我说的就是那个
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

94
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,470
但我们可以去隔壁等
But we can wait next door.

95
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,620
那是我以前工作过的美发店
That's my old hair salon where I used to work.

96
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,340
去那里也有的喝
You can get drinks there, too.

97
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,260
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

98
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,700
不不不  这不是杰
No, no, no, it's not Jay.

99
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
什么这么好笑
What's so funny?

100
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,820
什么这么好笑
What's so funny?

101
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,630
她以为你是我情人
She thinks you're my lover.

102
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,100
太好笑了
That is funny!

103
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,030
我不确定是不是值得一屋子女人捧腹大笑
I don't know if it's "a room full of women laughing" funny,

104
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,740
但是 
but...

105
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,890

Ay, Rita, no.

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,280
我们在等人  过来消磨点时间
and we're just killing time before an appointment.

108
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
我也不想这样  歌洛莉亚
I hate to ask, Gloria,

109
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,640
但我新招的店员还没来
but my new girl hasn't shown up.

110
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,070
你可以帮忙吗
Any chance you could help?

111
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,700
当然可以啦
Ay, of course!

112
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,950
一定会很好玩的
It will be so much fun!

113
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,010
我不想毁了我的指甲
I don't want to ruin my nails.

114
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,950
菲尔  你能帮忙洗头吗
Phil, would you do my shampooing?

115
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,980
应该可以吧
Well, I-I guess so.

116
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,780
我们还有时间
We've got the time.

117
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,500
我得声明一下
Just a warning --

118
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,620
大学后我就没有专业洗过头发了
I haven't shampooed professionally since college,

119
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,860
那只是一份兼职  来付拉拉队服装的钱
and that was only part-time to pay for my cheer gear.

120
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,460
我真是太爱炫了
Wow. That was super-braggy.

121
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,580
这里有什么  并排水槽吗
What do we got, double sinks?

122
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,060
花洒还好使吗
What's the nozzle sitch?

123
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,650
我不想太炫耀自己
Not to sound too braggy,

124
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,600
但你妈妈我这周工作
but your mom was kind of

125
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,500
是上天入地无所不能
a badass at work this week.

126
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,450
外公病了  我突然掌管大权
It was hard enough with grandpa being sick

127
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,020
这就已经够艰难了
and me suddenly in charge,

128
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,720
但危机真是一个接一个啊
but it was just one crisis after another.

129
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,110
卢克  亲爱的  我们要走了
Luke, honey, we're going!

130
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,470
仓库起火
Fire in the warehouse,

131
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,090
职业安全和健康署突击检查
surprise inspection from OSHA,

132
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,010
我们最大的顾客企图取消订单
our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal,

133
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,870
我得让他打消这个念头
and I have to talk him off a ledge.

134
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,870
随便啦  都结束了
Whatever. It's over now.

135
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,600
我不想说这些来让你们觉得无聊
I don't want to bore you guys with this stuff.

136
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,860
我周三去上班时
So, when I get to work on Wednesday,

137
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,220
玛格利特已经在哭了
Margaret is ready in tears,

138
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,890
接待室里有两名警察
and there are two cops in the waiting room,

139
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,740
我对他们说
and I say to them,

140
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,490
你们最好有人能开18轮巨型货车
"One of you had better be able to drive an 18-wheeler,

141
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,300
因为我要送100块紫檀板去胜利谷
"because I've got 100 rosewood panels to get to Victorville,

142
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,020
不然我就要用薪水补偿了
or it's coming out of my paycheck."

143
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,430
我跟你们说过司机和变质金枪鱼的事了吗
I told you guys about the drivers and the bad tuna?

144
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,330
-变质金枪鱼  -对
- Bad tuna, - Yes.

145
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,530
-说了  -我的确说了
- yeah. - Yes, I did.

146
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,950
妈妈  我都忘记这辆车有多好玩了
Hey, mom, I forgot how fun this car was.

147
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,970
自动门  还有后排的电视
And these automatic doors and that TV in the back.

148
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,420
你知道还有什么很好玩吗
You know what else was fun?

149
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,590
他们周五为我办的派对
The party they threw for me at work on Friday.

150
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,100
那的确有点尴尬啦
I mean, it was a little bit embarrassing.

151
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,270
我都不知道还有"英雌"这个词儿
I didn't even know "She-ro" was a word,

152
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,010
结果他们用糖霜写了这个词
and there it was, in icing.

153
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,710
好啊好啊
Hello, hello!

154
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,180
欢迎来到杰之夜
Welcome to Jay's night.

155
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,950
请报上尊姓大名
Names, please.

156
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,850
确保你在邀请名单内
Want to make sure you're on the list.

157
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,420
开玩笑啦  我很激动
Kidding! Just excited.

158
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,810
吧台上有开胃菜
Appetizers on the bar,

159
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,390
咖啡桌上有拼词游戏
scrabble on the coffee table,

160
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,260
还有我们的特色演讲
and our feature presentation,

161
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,100
"超级大逃亡"
"The Great Escape."

162
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,980
说到这个  海莉
Speaking of which, Haley...

163
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,060
别担心  外公
Don't worry, grandpa.

164
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,080
我不会走的
I'm not leaving.

165
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,010
我今晚没安排
I have no plans for the night.

166
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,830
我也没有
Me, either.

167
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,260
但我没安排是了不得的新闻
But when I say it, it's news.

168
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,410
你说了任何一句完整的话
When you say any complete sentence,

169
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,920
都是了不得的新闻
it's news.

170
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,610
别吵了  姑娘们  爸  你好些了吗
Okay, girls. Dad, you feeling better?

171
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,420
你这周很难受  对吧
You had a rough week, huh?

172
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,870
我没事
Nah. I'm fine.

173
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,410
看来你这周很忙啊
Looks like you had a big week.

174
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,450
你听说了吗
You heard about that?

175
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,090
办公室八卦的所有细节都尽在我掌握
Yeah, I got the blow-by-blow on all the office drama.

176
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,870
顺便说一句  真的...
By the way, sincerely...

177
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,680
什么
Yeah?

178
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,710
超棒...
...great...

179
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,380
吧台那边的鳄梨色拉酱超棒
great guacamole on the bar, there.

180
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,440
就这样吗
Wow. That's it?

181
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,490
你为他做了那么多事
Everything you did for him,

182
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,250
他都不说一句谢谢吗
and he doesn't even say "Thank you"?

183
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,110
我明白了
I get it.

184
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,370
是"英雄"中的"雄"换成了"雌"
It's "Hero" with a "She."

185
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,450
好  我跟上了
Okay, I'm up to speed.

186
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,820
是啊  太冷漠了
Yeah, that was cold.

187
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
他就是这样
It's just his way.

188
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,480
多年的失望过后
After years of disappointment,

189
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,860
我学会了不指望我爸给我肯定
I have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.

190
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,210
他做不到
He's not capable of it.

191
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,410
但这教会了我一个很重要的教训
But it has taught me a very important lesson

192
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,250
你们也该学学
that you girls should learn, too --

193
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,720
自我肯定首先要来源于自身
approval comes from within.

194
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,670
我知道  妈妈
I knew that, mom.

195
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,190
你当然知道啦  因为你聪明
'Course you did, 'cause you're smart.

196
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,250
莉莉从浴缸里出来了吗
Hey, is Lily out of the tub?

197
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,530
我们得赶去我爸家了
We got to be at my dad's soon.

198
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,720
不
Oh, no!

199
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,440
没什么大不了的
It's not that big of a deal.

200
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,400
我们可以稍微迟到一会儿
We can be a little late.

201
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,090
不  莉莉把我们的蛋糕人偶
No! Lily had the cake topper

202
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,960
带进浴缸了
in the tub with her!

203
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,480
不  怎么会犯这么严重的错误呢
Oh, no. How could such a terrible mistake have occurred?

204
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,910
我想她一定以为那是个玩具之类的
I think she must have just thought it was a toy or something.

205
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,930
希望人偶没有被玩坏
Well, I hope it's not completely ruined forever.

206
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,150
没有  你开玩笑吧
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?

207
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,530
我爸爸用了特殊的虫胶清漆
My daddy uses a special shellac on this thing.

208
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,970
这玩意儿能防水
This is water-resistant,

209
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,860
隔热  百毒不侵
heat-resistant -- you name it.

210
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,420
真好
Good to know.

211
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,450
是啊  放在安全的地方
Yeah, but put it someplace safe.

212
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,410
可能还有点滑
It could still be slippery,

213
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,120
小心点
so be careful.

214
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,630
是吗
Is it?

215
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,230
是啊  的确是
Oh, yeah, it is!

216
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,090
好滑
It's slippery!

217
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,230
没坏吧
Is it okay?

218
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,160
安然无恙
Not a scratch.

219
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,910
显然我比看上去要强壮
Apparently, I'm tougher than I look.

220
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,200
孩子们  玩得开心吗
Hey, boys. Having fun?

221
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,950
你知道的
You know it.

222
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,550
我们喜欢杰之夜
Love us some Jay's night.

223
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,800
好了  我们走吧
Okay, we're out of here.

224
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
克里斯蒂・休斯
Kristy Hughes,

225
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,690
外号"克里斯蒂・胸器"
A.K.A. "Kristy huge ones,"

226
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,090
在两个街区外开泳池派对
is having a pool party two blocks away.

227
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,800
那杰怎么办
What about Jay?

228
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,070
他认为我们就是在开派对
He thinks we're at a party.

229
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,050
他不会知道的
He'll never know.

230
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,540
我们偷偷溜出去  溜进屋里
We sneak out, work the room,

231
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
欣赏大胸
cannonball, cannonball,

232
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,030
然后我们赶回来吃晚餐
and we're back in time for dinner.

233
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,080
你被邀请了吗
Were you even invited?

234
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,180
没有
No.

235
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,930
但那只是因为我不认识她或她的朋友
But that's only because I don't know her or any of her friends.

236
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,430
非法入侵的事咱们不能干
We're not invading her house.

237
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,570
再说  我这头发在泳池派对上
Besides, this hair at a pool party --

238
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,580
一碰水就跟安全气囊似的爆开了
One dunk, and it goes off like an airbag.

239
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,820
这是什么  你做了酱汁吗
What's this? You made sauce?

240
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,460
你生病了
Well, you were sick.

241
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,980
我不知道你能不能坚持做饭
I didn't know if you could handle it.

242
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,570
越战的时候我得了肝炎
Back in Vietnam, I had hepatitis.

243
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,380
照样给三百个士兵准备了
Still managed to cook Thanksgiving dinner

244
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,850
感恩节晚餐
for 300 soldiers.

245
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,460
我觉得我能搞得定酱汁
I think I can handle sauce.

246
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,150
我这不是帮你省了麻烦嘛
Well, I saved you the trouble.

247
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,410
玛格利特告诉我公司在用新的运货卡车
So, Margaret tells me I'm using some new delivery trucks now.

248
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,350
是的  它们都是混合动力的
Yeah. They're hybrid.

249
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,640
确实贵一些
Now, they cost a little more,

250
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,710
但是我把使用绿色产品的
but when I factored in the tax rebates

251
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,280
退税算上
you get for going green,

252
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,130
我们就把钱赚回来了
we come out ahead.

253
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,700
提到绿色
Speaking of "Green,"

254
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,590
你蔬菜放得太多了吧
you went a little heavy on the vegetables, huh?

255
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,140
我不确定我能吃下任何健康食物
I'm not sure I can stomach anything that's healthy.

256
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,560
天啊  妈妈  那些卡车听起来真不错
Gosh, mom, that truck thing sounds so amazing.

257
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,830
是啊
Yeah!

258
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,150
没关系  爸
It's fine, dad.

259
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,430
只做力所能及的  对吧
Only do what we're capable of, right?

260
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,010
该死
Oh, damn.

261
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,610
不  斯黛拉  站住  不行
No, Stella, stay. No.

262
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,180
乖狗狗
Good girl.

263
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,570
谢谢  斯黛拉
Thank you, Stella.

264
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,770
谢谢你听我的话
Thank you for listening.

265
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,470
我太为你骄傲了
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

266
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,430
谁是我的好闺女
Who's my best girl?

267
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,280
不用了
Don't.

268
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,510
好了姑娘们  我们准备好拼字游戏了
Okay, girls, we are ready for scrabble.

269
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,450
我去拿些零食
I'll grab some snacks.

270
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,710
我要薯片  拜托了
Uh, potato chips, please.

271
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,930
然后我就能整晚听你抱怨
Oh, so I can hear about how much

272
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,600
你有多讨厌自己了
you hate yourself all night?

273
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,580
你好  卢克
Hello, Luke.

274
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,290
拜托  我们去吧
Come on! We've got to go!

275
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,980
那个派对上都是高二的学生
That party's full of sophomores.

276
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,250
那些学姐们可都是过来人
Those women have lived.

277
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,670
不  我们现在回屋去
No, we're going back inside,

278
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,490
吃杰准备的食物
we're eating Jay's food,

279
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,890
然后玩他的桌游
and we're playing his board games.

280
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,480
应该叫"无聊"游戏吧
More like boring games.

281
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,510
那名字本身就和"无聊"读音相同
They're already called "Board."

282
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,200
你没必要再做多余演绎了
You don't make it more clever by --

283
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,330
算了
Never mind.

284
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,140
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

285
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,000
你和婚礼主唱把问题都解决了吗
Did you work everything out with the wedding singer?

286
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,580
是的  我刚放弃了我的压轴表演
Oh, yeah -- I'm just dropping my big finale

287
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,970
因为他要唱同一首歌
because he's doing the same song.

288
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,960
《我的路》吗
"My Way"?

289
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,840
已经是他的路了
His way.

290
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,500
大家好啊
Hey, guys.

291
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,190
抱歉我们迟到了
Sorry we're late,

292
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,860
但我们带了红酒
but we come with wine.

293
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,830
还有雕刻艺术哦
And whittlin'!

294
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,340
看看
Check it out.

295
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,510
这是我父亲做的美丽礼物
This is a beautiful gift my father made

296
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,310
为了放在结婚蛋糕上面的
for the top of our wedding cake.

297
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,820
我猜他肥皂用光了所以没把我放进去
I guess he ran out of soap before he got to me.

298
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,750
-太糟了  -给你
- Darn. - For you.

299
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,860
女士们  来看看
Ladies, check out

300
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,230
肥皂版的米奇尔和小卡叔叔
your uncle Mitch and Cam in soap.

301
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,390
那是肥皂做的吗
That's soap?

302
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,940
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

303
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,590
这是我最恐怖的噩梦
This is my worst nightmare.

304
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,560
你不应该把否决权都浪费了的
You shouldn't have blown through those vetoes.

305
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,810
这就是小卡爸爸眼里的我
This is how Cam's dad sees me --

306
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,530
像个谄媚的黄花闺女一样
like some fawning damsel.

307
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,960
小卡更像个黄花闺女
If anything, Cam's the damsel.

308
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,130
爸
Dad!

309
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,130
谢谢
Thank you.

310
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,540
大婚之前什么都可能发生
A lot can happen before the big day.

311
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,310
相信我  我什么招都试过了
Believe me, I've already tried.

312
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,250
那东西简直坚不可摧
That thing is indestructible.

313
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,090
如果它消失不见了呢
What if it went missing?

314
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,200
我这里可总是丢东西
Things disappear around here all the time.

315
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,340
是吗
Do they?

316
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,210
一直都是
All the time.

317
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,280
我有个小伙伴
Let's just say I have a friend

318
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,080
总在这样的时刻帮我
who helps me in these kinds of situations.

319
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,930
我听着呢
I'm listening.

320
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,970
你知道的越少越好
The less you know, the better.

321
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,370
那我不听了
I'm not listening.

322
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,430
这段对话从没发生过
We never had this conversation.

323
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,890
这是段"没话"
This is a non-versation.

324
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,950
是的
Right.

325
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,660
我要你  "不动手"
I am giving you the...no-ahead.

326
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,230
我太想念你们了
Oh, I miss you girls.

327
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,580
我的白人家庭里没人觉得我幽默
Nobody in my white family thinks that I am funny.

328
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,090
亲  赫克托遇到你前有自己的人生
Honey, Hector had a life before he met you.

329
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,870
所以我就得和他前任一起吃饭吗
So I have to eat dinner with his ex?

330
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,550
那你肯定不想让他自己去吧
Well, you certainly don't want him going alone --

331
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,160
特别是他还有那么段历史
Not with his history.

332
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
你到底是生谁的气呢
Who are you really mad at?

333
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,650
我不知道
Ay, I don't know.

334
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,270
说说吧  路易莎
Come on, Luisa.

335
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,720
劳尔
Raul!

336
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,870
赫克托会像劳尔那样伤我的心
Hector's going to hurt me just like Raul did!

337
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,900
这就是了
There it is.

338
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,840
但赫克托不是劳尔  对吗
But Hector isn't raul, okay?

339
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,260
他们只是表亲而已
They're just cousins.

340
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,970
我们得走了
We need to get a move on.

341
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,950
客户会在四点来看房
The client's gonna come over to the apartment at 4:00.

342
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,060
我太忙了  脱不开身
I am swamped. I can't just leave.

343
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,720
歌洛莉亚  我们是来这卖你的公寓的
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.

344
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,870
不是来发廊打工的
We don't work at the salon.

345
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,190
非常感谢  比安卡
Muchísimas gracias, Bianca.

346
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,990
别再跟那个男人发短信了
No más texting ese hombre.

347
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,120
这是一对快生小孩的年轻夫妇
It's for a young couple with a baby on the way.

348
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,830
买房不是为了转手赚钱
They're not flippers.

349
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,030
他们是想找个地方安定下来
They're looking for a place to settle down and make a home.

350
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,870
跟他们换个时间
Okay, just move them.

351
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,580
要是他们真想要这房子肯定会回来的
If they really want it, they'll come back.

352
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,530
可是  歌洛莉亚
But, Gloria --

353
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,660
拜托你帮我处理一下安娜的锡纸
Ay, please, just help me with Anna's foils.

354
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
我得赶紧去帮人驳发
I have a weave emergency!

355
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,870
有点不对劲
Something's not right.

356
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,470
什么  怎么了
Qué qué pasó?

357
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,360
不  不  跟你没关系  你好着呢
No, no, no, not with you. You look great.

358
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
你知道谁会痛恨这个造型吗
You know who's gonna hate this,

359
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,390
对你羡慕嫉妒恨的小姐妹
is a certain jealous sister.

360
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,980
来  我们击个掌
Cinco de my, oh, my.

361
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,240
我这儿有这么多个"I"让我怎么玩
How am I supposed to do this with so many "I"s on my rack?

362
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,240
[曼尼听成"eyes on my rack: 这么多只眼睛盯着我的脖子"]

363
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,300
真抱歉
Sorry.

364
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,150
卢克在哪儿
Where's Luke?

365
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,670
他拿个字典要这么久吗
How long does it take him to get the dictionary?

366
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,550
我们很清楚地告诉他字典长什么样子了
We described it for him perfectly.

367
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,510
等等
Wait a minute.

368
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,880
他不会是不回来了吧
He's not coming back.

369
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,110
[音似Move your ass: 动作快点]

370
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,110
移动你的"S"
Ugh. Move your "S."

371
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,800
我已经走得够快了
I-I'm going as fast as I can.

372
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,770
米奇尔  它不见了
Mitchell! It's gone!

373
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,450
什么东西
What is?

374
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,860
那个蛋糕装饰人偶
The cake topper.

375
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,370
莉莉  你有看到之前跟你一起洗澡的
Lily, have you seen the little daddies

376
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,450
小版爸爸们吗
you were bathing with earlier?

377
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,670
别这么说话
Don't say that.

378
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,200
我看到斯黛拉在玩它
I saw Stella playing with it.

379
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,330
什么
What?

380
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,690
瞧瞧她身上  全是泥巴
Oh, look at her. She's all muddy.

381
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,560
她肯定是叼出去埋起来了
She must have brought it outside and buried it.

382
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,770
她老是做这种事
She does it all the time!

383
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,350
不  我们必须找到它
Oh, no. We have to go find it.

384
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,850
祝你们好运
Good luck.

385
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,810
那东西估计是找不到了
That thing's as good as gone.

386
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,330
真糟糕
Dang it!

387
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,610
最惨的是
And the worst part is,

388
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,220
我们连张照片都没来得及拍
we don't even have a picture of it.

389
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,820
我们有吗
Do we?

390
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,690
我们不能放弃
Okay, we can't give up.

391
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,190
我们去院子里找找看
Let's go out into the yard and look for it.

392
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,580
注意点  换成我是不会干涉斯黛拉
Careful. I wouldn't come between Stella

393
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,680
藏任何东西的
and anything she's buried.

394
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,630
她有自己的天性
She's a wild animal.

395
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,170
不会别人告诉她会做什么
No telling what she'll do.

396
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,810
这姿势真是充满挑衅的味道
That's a very aggressive stance.

397
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,920
卢克  等等
Luke! Wait!

398
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,570
瞧瞧你
Oh. Look at that.

399
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,270
你都离开院子了
You left your yard,

400
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,890
你的电子项圈居然没有响
and your little shock collar didn't go off.

401
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,390
卢克
Luke --

402
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,320
好了  新计划是这样的
Okay, so, here's the new plan.

403
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,850
你站后面  由我先来活跃气氛
You hang back while I break the ice,

404
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,830
等到一个恰当的时候
and then, when the time is right --

405
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,830
曼尼  你来了
Manny! You made it!

406
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,720
这是谁
Who's this?

407
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,140
这是谁
"Who's this?"

408
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,970
拜托
Excuse me,

409
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,510
克里斯蒂・胸器  我是有名字的
Kristy huge ones, I have a name.

410
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,700
好了  别闹了
Okay, come on. Stop.

411
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,050
我追了你一整天已经受够了
I'm tired of chasing you all day.

412
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,890
那就别追我
Then don't.

413
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,370
去那个无聊的派对上玩吧
Stay as long as you want at that lame party.

414
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,450
你想聊聊吗
You want to talk?

415
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,030
你才应该是那个呆呆的配角  不是我
You're the dorky sidekick, not me.

416
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,390
能稍微友好点吗
Want to talk nicer?

417
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,090
凭什么她请你不请我
How could you be invited and I wasn't?

418
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,470
我不知道
I don't know.

419
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,700
貌似过去我身上让人觉得奇怪的地方
It's like the stuff that used to make me kind of weird,

420
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,010
开始招人喜欢了
people are starting to like.

421
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,250
所以呢
So?

422
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,350
我还跟以前一样
I'm the same as I always was.

423
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,090
说不定你可以提高一下自己
Well...maybe you could upgrade a little.

424
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,150
[尤达:《星球大战》中的人物]

425
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,150
我们受够了你的"尤达"音
Uh, we're tired of the yoda voice,

426
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,840
如果有个女孩告诉你她去了伦敦
and if a girl tells you she went to london,

427
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,360
最好别问她是不是看见了法国
maybe don't ask if she also saw France.

428
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,370
我还是喜欢
I liked things better when you were the one

429
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,960
你比较像鸵鸟的时候
who was ostrich-sized.

430
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,770
什么
What?

431
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,420
你懂的  一个怪异的圈外人
You know, like a freaky outsider --

432
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,130
鹤立鸡群的感觉
the way an ostrich feels around regular birds.

433
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,760
你知道女孩子还喜欢什么吗
You know what else girls like?

434
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,620
神秘又安静的类型
The mysterious, silent type.

435
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,230
你在对我的酱汁做什么  伙计
What are you doing with my sauce, there, cookie?

436
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,420
那才是你的
That's yours.

437
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,130
这是我的
This is mine.

438
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,210
我早上就准备好了
I prepped it this morning.

439
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,420
我想了下  为什么不做呢
I figured, why not make it?

440
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,020
因为我已经做好了
Um...maybe because I already made sauce?

441
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,030
多多益善
Can't have too much.

442
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,850
是吗
Can't ya?

443
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,240
把汤勺递给我
Hand me that ladle, huh?

444
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,710
你干嘛  我已经拿住了
What are you doing? I got it.

445
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,650
你要说什么
What do you say?

446
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,670
什么
What?

447
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,640
当别人为你做事的时候你要说什么
What do you say when somebody does something for you?

448
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,260
你要说什么
What do you say?

449
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,010
你想让我谢谢你把汤勺给我吗
You want me to thank you for handing me a ladle?

450
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,800
你感谢了狗狗站着不动
You thanked the dog for staying --

451
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,850
虽然它其实什么都没做
which is basically doing nothing --

452
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,900
所以我确定你知道该怎么说
so I know you know the words.

453
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,770
好吧
Fine.

454
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,910
谢谢你把汤勺递给我
Thank you for handling me the ladle.

455
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,210
你确定这些煮好了吗
You sure those are ready?

456
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,360
[旧时通过意大利面是否能粘到墙上来判断是否煮熟]

457
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,360
你还没往墙上扔呢
You didn't throw one against the wall.

458
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,910
爸  现在没有人这么做了
Oh, dad, nobody does that anymore.

459
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,720
就是说我们做所有事都换新方法了是吧
Oh. I guess we have new ways for doing everything now, huh?

460
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,800
不  我可没那么说
No. I didn't say that.

461
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,360
我只是说你可以直接尝一下熟了没有
I'm just saying that you can taste your food

462
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,560
而不是像黑猩猩一样往墙上甩
instead of flinging it at the wall like a chimp.

463
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,650
好吧
Okay.

464
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,970
味道如何
How's it taste?

465
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,880
事实上  还不错
Actually, mm, that's pretty good.

466
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,620
但是如果能加点
But it could use a little,

467
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,350
酱料
um...sauce.

468
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,290
我来试试  好烫
Let me just -- ooh, hot.

469
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,990
再加点帕尔马干酪
Try a little Parmesan with that?

470
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
我应该把面包放进烤箱了
I should probably get that bread in the oven.

471
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,540
只要
Just...

472
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,920
好了  好了
Okay! Hey!

473
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,750
这里交给我们吧
Hey, how about we take over in here

474
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,860
你们去收拾一下准备吃饭了
while you two get cleaned up for dinner?

475
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,180
好主意
Yes, good idea.

476
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,530
好的
Yeah. Okay.

477
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,940
自我肯定首先要来源于自身
Approval comes from within.

478
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,990
谢谢
Thank you.

479
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,660
你的酱料需要加点蒜
Your sauce needs garlic.

480
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,960
-好了  -好了
- Okay.   - Okay.

481
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,700
这是个表
And that's a clock.

482
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,850
好吧  再试另一个地方
Okay, well, do another one.

483
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,030
我试了四个了
I've done like four.

484
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,720
这只狗比你叔叔克莱顿还爱囤东西
This dog is a worse hoarder than your uncle Clayton.

485
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,860
他是个收藏家
He's a collector.

486
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,370
收藏过期酸奶吗
Of expired yogurt?

487
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,940
累死我了
Getting tired.

488
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,310
小卡  能不能别找了
Cam, can we just stop, please?

489
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,210
我觉得我们已经尽力了
I feel like we've done our best,

490
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,820
肯定是找不到了
but we're just not gonna find it.

491
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,970
找到了
Found it!

492
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,710
太好了
Oh! Good.

493
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,270
谢天谢地
Thank god.

494
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,690
我还没告诉你我对它的宏伟计划呢
I hadn't even told you my biggest plan for this yet.

495
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,050
比装饰蛋糕还宏伟的计划吗
Bigger than the top of our wedding cake?

496
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,520
我要用它做个模子然后批量生产
I'm gonna have a mold made of it and give a reproduction

497
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,790
赠送给每一位来参加婚礼的
to everyone who comes to the wedding

498
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,380
和来不了的客人
and everyone who can't come to the wedding.

499
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,280
想象一下数百个我们的人偶散布全国
Imagine hundreds of these across the country.

500
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,260
不
No!

501
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,680
不行  不行  绝对不行
No! No! Absolutely not!

502
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,940
我讨厌它  太恶心了
I hate it! It's awful!

503
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,880
我就知道
I knew it!

504
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,970
我就知道
I knew it!

505
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,750
它只是恰巧出现在莉莉的浴缸里
It just shows up in Lily's bath,

506
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,950
然后突然间  又被狗叼走了吗
and then, all of a sudden, the dog has it?

507
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,400
你就是故意盯着它不放
You have it in for this beautiful topper.

508
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,230
你看看  你好好看看它
Look at this. Look at it. Look at it!

509
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,950
你一副威风凛凛大块头的样子
Come on, you're all heroic and Paul Bunyan-y,

510
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,610
我呢  我就像个娘娘腔
and I'm -- I'm, like, some sissy man

511
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,940
红着脸颊  夹着腿
with -- with pinkish cheeks and a turned-out heel.

512
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,800
那只是一种表现形式
It's a caricature.

513
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,610
重要的是它代表的意义
What matters is what it represents.

514
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,330
我爸爸为我们亲手制作的
My daddy making this for us

515
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,370
说明他已经接受了我们本来的样子
means he's accepted us for who we are!

516
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,000
你难道不明白吗
Don't you get that?

517
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,880
我倒是没有从这个角度想过
I never really thought about it that way.

518
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,190
你确实没有
No. You hadn't.

519
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,310
我只是有些敏感了
I'm just being sensitive.

520
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,820
我应该神经再大条一点
I need to have a thicker skin.

521
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,830
我真的非常非常抱歉
I-I'm really, really sorry.

522
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,530
不  不用抱歉
No, don't -- don't -- don't be sorry.

523
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,600
不用
No.

524
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,430
我不希望有你不喜欢的东西
And I -- n-- I don't want something at the wedding

525
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,610
出现在婚礼上
that makes you uncomfortable.

526
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,840
不  那不太公平
Well, no, that doesn't seem fair.

527
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,930
我的否决权已经用光了
I've used up all my vetoes.

528
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
如果
Well, if it --

529
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,790
能让你好受一些的话
I guess, if it makes you feel better,

530
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,190
我可以再给你加一个否决权
I could give you one more veto --

531
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,600
但你也要给我加一个
if you give me one more, too.

532
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,300
好吧  当然可以
Okay, sure.

533
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,310
如果以后
And in the future,

534
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,080
有什么事情
if there's anything --

535
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,400
辞掉婚礼歌手
The wedding singer.

536
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,720
好的  谢谢  爸爸
Okay. Thanks, daddy.

537
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,930
我会给你一张非常适合的照片作参考
I'll send you the perfect picture to model it on.

538
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,630
今天过后我相信了
After today, I'm convinced

539
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,830
10%的填埋垃圾是头发
our landfills are 10% hair.

540
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,920
是啊
Oh, yes.

541
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,680
我都忘记这事这么累人了
I forgot how exhausting this is.

542
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,470
现在我们只需要
Well, all we have to do

543
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,130
回公寓去见一下客户
is meet the clients back at the apartment,

544
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,160
然后就可以回家了
and then we can head home.

545
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,940
不  我现在好累
Ay, no. I'm too tired now.

546
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,140
改期吧
Let's reschedule.

547
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,340
真的吗  还改
Really? Again?

548
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,670
是啊  下周再见吧
Yes. Let's meet them next week.

549
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,280
而且  杰的聚会我们已经迟到了
And besides, we're late for Jay's party.

550
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,910
我不会让你这个样子回家的
Well, I'm not letting you go home looking like this.

551
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,630
你头发后面有点乱
You're a little ratty back here.

552
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,820
是啊
Ay, no.

553
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,340
没事  没事  我来
No, no, no. I got it.

554
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,230
你放松就好
You just relax.

555
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,740
今天真是够累的
What a day, huh?

556
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,410
回到这里一定唤起了你很多回忆
Being back here must bring up a lot of memories.

557
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,540
是啊
Oh, yeah.

558
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,320
也许还有一些情绪
Maybe even some emotions.

559
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,760
是啊  感觉怪怪的
Yeah. It feels weird.

560
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,690
怪是一个形容词
No, weird's an adjective,

561
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,440
不是一种情绪  但你继续说
not an emotion, but go on.

562
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,120
我现在的生活与以前大不相同
Well, it's just that my life now is so different than before --

563
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
轻松多了
so much easier.

564
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
所以你觉得
And that makes you feel...?

565
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,040
很好
Good.

566
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,290
还有呢
And also...?

567
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,510
也不好
And bad.

568
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,580
为什么
Why?

569
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,610
我也不知道
I don't know.

570
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,860
说说吧  歌洛莉亚
Come on, now, Gloria.

571
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,430
我也不知道
I don't know.

572
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,870
我想我只是觉得有些惭愧
I guess it just makes me feel a little ashamed.

573
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,670
为什么会惭愧呢
Now, what in the world do you have to be ashamed of?

574
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,380
只是  你懂的
It's just that, you know,

575
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,000
以前住在这里时
before, when I used to live here,

576
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,630
我要努力工作赚钱
I used to work for every penny.

577
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,120
我全靠自己
I would stand on my own two feet.

578
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,260
现在我穿着这些昂贵的鞋子
Now I just stand on expensive shoes

579
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,310
都是杰买给我的
that Jay buys for me.

580
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,610
是因为这样才不想卖掉房子吗
Is that why it's so hard to let go of the apartment?

581
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,580
不  菲尔  不是因为这个
No, Phil, it's not that --

582
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,820
歌洛莉亚
Gloria.

583
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
也许是吧
Maybe.

584
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,160
歌洛莉亚
Gloria.

585
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,100
是的
Yes.

586
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,560
它是最后一件属于原来的我的东西
It's the last piece of the old me.

587
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,760
停  停  你太用力了
No, no! You're going too deep!

588
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,230
抱歉抱歉
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

589
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,880
对不起  但我觉得你的想法不对
I'm sorry, but I think you're looking at this all wrong.

590
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
原来的你还在这里
The old you hasn't gone anywhere.

591
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,900
看你培养曼尼和乔的方式
I-I-I see it in the way you're raising Manny and Joe,

592
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,710
看你照顾杰的样子
the way you care for Jay.

593
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,800
你从没把任何东西当作理所当然
You never take anyone or anything for granted.

594
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,180
你多年来一直努力工作
You worked hard for years

595
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,290
那时你也不知道生活会不会变好
without knowing that things were gonna get better.

596
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,350
然后你得到了回报
And then the universe rewarded you.

597
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,210
这没什么好惭愧的
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

598
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,910
你不会因为
So you're not mad at me

599
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,930
我不想卖房子而生气吧
because I don't want to sell the apartment?

600
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,000
不会
No.

601
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,070
有一天你会准备好的
You'll know when you're ready,

602
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,450
我等你
and I'll be here.

603
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,400
菲尔
Aw, Phil.

604
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,350
你最好了
You're the best.

605
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,670
没有谁像你这样
There's no one like you.

606
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,870
克莱尔  看起来真好吃
Claire, that looks so good.

607
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,330
我等不及要尝尝了
I can't wait to try it.

608
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,570

Come on, Cam. We're eating over here.

614
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,120
等一下
Wait.

615
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,180

Didn't I give you this for Father's Day?

616
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,140
还有这个
And that.

617
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,630
看到这狗的本性了吧
You see how this dog is?

618
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,900
我的卡拉OK麦克风
My karaoke microphone.

619
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,120
杰  快看
Jay, check it out!

620
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,950
是另一个无线通话机
The other walkie-talkie!

621
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,150
真替你脸红  杰・普里契特
Shame on you, Jay Pritchett!

622
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,140
你利用这只狗把你讨厌的东西都埋了
You have used this dog to bury the things that you hate.

623
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,740
-什么  -没错
- What? - Yeah!

624
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,450
你从何时开始需要别人帮你埋东西了
Since when do you need help burying things?

625
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,100
淡定  她也埋了我的东西  看
Calm down. She buries stuff of mine, too. Look.

626
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,450
上个月办公室的人给我买了这只钟
Everybody at the office bought me this clock last month.

627
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,150

628
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,080
这个问题该问你吧
That's a question that maybe you should answer.

629
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,880
天呐  我的耳机
Oh, my gosh! My headphones!

630
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,490
这太恶劣了
That's the worst.

631
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
谨以此庆祝从业40周年
"Here's to 40 years in the business.

632
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,390
享受你的新家伙吧  老家伙
Enjoy your new timer, old-timer."

633
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,690
我猛然间明白了
Suddenly, it made sense.

634
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,710
在我爸爸眼里
In my dad's mind,

635
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,340
我要接住火炬了  而他还不想传下去
I was reaching for a torch he wasn't ready to pass.

今晚还是属于杰的
Tonight is still Jay's night.

640

爸爸
So, dad...

641

我上周有很多问题想问你

644
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,570
我不想让你觉得我搞不定

寻求帮助没有什么可耻的

我不用打给你
Well, I won't need to.

648
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,090
你会一直在走廊尽头的办公室里不是吗
You'll be in the office down the hall, right?

649
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,540
没错
Right.

孩子们又和我解除好友关系了

661

他们也不跟我说
