我真想要那两片嘴唇  我是说在我身上

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
我是说想要他的嘴唇在我嘴上

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,100
我们能直接切入正题吗

他的嘴唇很性感
He's got great lips.

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,160
不不不  我们在这里干什么

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,720
出来放松一下 
with our daughter.

24
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,250
是啊  就把我们当做你的朋友

-是啊  -我可没有45岁的朋友

你的父母也还没45岁呢  亲爱的
Well, you don't have 45-year-old parents yet, either, honey,

27
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,150
别激动
so calm down.

28
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,080
海莉对她的未来毫无规划
Haley has no plan for her future whatsoever.

29
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,420
她住在我们的地下室里
She's living in our basement,

30
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,650
在社区大学上课  整天混日子
taking community-college classes, and, well, meandering.

31
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,320
所以我们打算带她出去  放松一下
So we're gonna take her out. We'll have some fun.

让她放松警惕
And then gently ease her

33
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,060
跟我们友好地聊聊她的未来
into a friendly conversationabout her future.

34
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,570
跟我们过去采取的方式截然不同
As opposed to the approach that we've taken in the past.

35
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,370
你打算以后就干这个吗
Is this what you're gonna do with your life --

36
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,050
睡懒觉  然后自拍
Sleep late and take a selfie?!

37
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,770
你为什么总是批评我
Why are you always criticizing me?!

38
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,390
你想这样开始新的一天吗
Is this really how you want to start the day?!

39
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,900
我的一天五小时前就开始了
My day started 5 hours ago.

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,540
我的压力很大
I am under a lot of pressure!

41
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,570
怎么大  如何大  你一周只有三节课
How?! How?! You take three classes a week,

42
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,630
还逃了一半
and you miss half of them!

43
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,500
车很难停
The parking is tricky!

44
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,290
早上好  宝贝  我给你留了些午餐
Morning, sunshine. I saved you some lunch.

45
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,320

晚餐期间接到询问客户满意度的电话
Getting these customer-satisfaction calls during dinner.

59
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,530
他们给车换了油而已
They change the oil on your car,

60
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,380
却期待着我写感谢信
they want a love letter!

61
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,000
没错  我还在等我的医生打来电话
I know. I'm waiting for a call from my doctor's office --

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,040
"请评价您的前列腺检查
"Please rate your prostate exam.

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,080
您满意吗"
Would you say you were satisfied?"

64
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,470
我希望你没有
I hope you weren't.

65
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,460
"我希望你没有"
"I hope you weren't."

66
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,750
这太好笑了  歌洛莉亚
That's a good one, Gloria!

67
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,930

幽默一下有多困难吗  杰

是啊  小短和我开始上课了

74
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,610
你说的是"太棒了"  对吗

为什么突然对西语感兴趣

77
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,550
其实我们有件事想告诉你们
Well, actually, there's something we have to tell you,

78

好吧  你们看如何  我们

79
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,960
-我们要搬去哥斯达黎加啦  -是的
- We're moving to Costa Rica! - Yeah!

80

-什么  -什么时候

81
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,270
再过几周  那里的生活成本很低
In a couple of weeks. The cost of living is so low down there,

82
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,490
我们在海边找了个美丽的地方

83
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,090
还有自己的私人沙滩
It's got its own private beach.

84
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,200
泳衣可穿可不穿
Bathing suits are optional.

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,160
但还是鼓励穿上
But encouraged.

86
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,790
我会想你们的
Ay, I'm going to miss you guys.

87
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,660
别担心  我赌他们最多能坚持三个月
Don't worry about it. I give it three months, tops.

88
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,770
你讨厌沙滩  你知道那里有多潮湿吗
You hate the beach. And you know how humid it is down there?

89
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,150
我爱俱乐部的蒸汽房
I love the steam room at the club.

90
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,310
都一样的  除了我再也不用看着你
It's the same thing, except I don't have to see you

91
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,710
像一滩化了的冰淇淋一样摊在那里
sitting there like a pile of melted ice cream.

92
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,860
而你披着毛巾就像汤姆・塞立克
'cause you're Tom Selleck in a towel.

93
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,210
我已经准备好冒险了

待在这里  偶尔交个帐单

96
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,840
你为什么总是这么消极
Why do you always have to be so negative?

97
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,110
我就觉得很好
I think it's great.

98
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,080
不  你说得对  我很抱歉
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

99
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,930
我就是有点吃惊  仅此而已
I'm surprised, that's all.

100
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,850
我们来为你们美好的生活新篇章干一杯吧
Let's toast this amazing new chapter of your lives.

101
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,900
敬拳头大小的蚊子
To mosquitoes the size of your fist.

102
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,870
难怪你的朋友们一个个都搬走了
This is why all your friends move away.

103
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,240
敬我们  终于有独处时间了
To us, alone at last.

104
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,320
我们两个今晚看起来都很帅
We both look very handsome tonight.

105
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,880
如果  如果你只说
You know, if you -- if you'd just said

106
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,740
我看起来很帅  我就会说  你也是
that I looked handsome, I would have said, "So do you."

107
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,510
我不敢冒险
I couldn't take that chance.

108
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,360
我想有个良好的开端
I wanted to get off on the right foot.

109
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,210
米奇尔和我急需一个
Mitchell and I desperately need

110
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,570
浪漫的夜晚来重燃激情
a romantic night out to reconnect.

111
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,040
是啊  我不
Yeah. I don't --

112
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
我不知道是不是因为筹划婚礼压力太大
I don't know if it's the stress of planning a wedding,

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,450
但我们最近的关系有点紧张
but we've been a little tense with each other lately, huh?

114
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,860
连我们的朋友马库斯都说我们最近很暴躁
Even our friend J'marcus said how bitchy we've been.

115
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,950
什么  他什么时候说过这话
What -- when did he say that?

116
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,760
在胡娇的派对上
Oh, at Pepper's party

117
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,700
那晚你穿了那条不太合适的裤子
that night you wore those pants that don't fit you anymore.

118
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,460
没错  而你带了一瓶大家都讨厌的酒
Oh, right. And you brought that bad wine that everybody hated.

119
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,990
-瞧  我们真的很需要  -真心的
- See? We really need this. - We really do.

120
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,780
那天胡娇说
Oh, you know, uh, Pepper said

121
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,960
为了我们的蛋糕试吃
that for our cake tasting,

122
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,230
我们得...
we needed to have --

123
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,850
我们说好的  不谈婚礼  不谈莉莉
Remember our rules -- no wedding talk, no Lily talk.

124
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,470
抱歉  好吧  你是对的
I'm sorry. No, you're right.

125
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,500
那么我们聊聊...
So, just gonna...

126
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
我们再听一遍招牌菜怎么样
Should we hear the specials again?

127
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,650
不能再让他重复第三遍了
We can't ask him a third time.

128
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,130
你知道我搬过去以后会做什么吗
You know what I might try when I'm down there?

129
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,110
冲浪
Surfing.

130
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,940
那看来你的遗体无法供亲友瞻仰了[死得很惨]
So it's gonna be a closed casket.

131
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,850
该我了
My turn.

132
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,570
你在说什么  我刚刚打进了3号球
What are you talking about? I just sunk the 3 ball.

133
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,380
然后你的杆子碰到了白色球
Then you moved the cue ball with your stick

134
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,940
就在你跟我讲要从南加州搬走
while you were telling me how you were gonna move away

135
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,970
去学冲浪的时候
from Southern California to try surfing.

136
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,820
我没碰白色球
I didn't touch the cue ball.

137
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,120
是啊我知道  但你就是碰了
Yeah, I know. But you did.

138
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,820
你说我是骗子吗  你
You're calling me a cheater? You?

139
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,510
一个打高尔夫最多数到5杆的家伙
The guy on the golf course who can't seem to count higher than 5?

140
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,880
我忘记杆数是因为
Maybe I can't keep track of my shots

141
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,780
我身边总有个家伙喋喋不休
because somebody won't stop talking.

142
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,680
那是因为我天生就爱
It is in my nature to comment on

143
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,180
对看到的奇闻异事发表评论
the bizarre and unusual things I see in the world,

144
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,200
比如你总是将胡乱一击称为挥杆
like that convulsion you call a golf swing.

145
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,710
你猜怎么着  我不打了
You know what? I'm done here.

146
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,820
是我不打了
No, I've done.

147
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,470
我不能站在这里接受你对我人品的质疑
I will not have my integrity questioned here.

148
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,750
我参加过海军  
I was a Marine.

149
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,260
一同服役的伙伴有些都为国捐躯了
I served with guys who died.

150
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,300
那是老死的
Of old age!

151
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,420
你连国门都没出过
You never left the states!

152
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,880
你是说我没为国家效力吗
Are you saying I didn't serve my country?

153
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,230
哪个国家  美国还是哥斯达黎加
Which one, America or Costa Rica?

154
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,520
你干嘛老跟哥斯达黎加过不去
What's with you and Costa Rica?!

155
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
因为那是个糟糕的主意
It's a terrible idea!

156
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,340
你总是头脑发热冲动做决定
You get into things without thinking,

157
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,870
你需要被当头棒喝
and you need to be rescued,

158
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,880
就像上次你买的那辆车
like that time you bought that car

159
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,340
说什么可以变成一条船
that was supposed to turn into a boat!

160
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,420
-怎么了  -结果变成沉船 
- Yeah? - It turned into a reef!

161
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,030
那是因为你手贱没关车门
That's 'cause you left your door cracked open!

162
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,000
是啊  又变成我的责任了
Yes, it was my fault.

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,010
记住我的话
Mark my words --

164
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,010
哥斯达黎加就是下一个
Costa Rica is another amphibicar

165
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,070
沉在湖底的水下汽车
at the bottom of a lake.

166
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,240
只不过这一次  我不会再捞你起来了
Only this time, I won't be bailing you out!

167
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,430
谁要你捞了
Who asked you?!

168
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,960
达琳  我们走
Darlene, we're going!

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,530
怎么了  为什么要走
Wha-- wha-- what do you mean, we're going?

170
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,750
谢谢款待  歌洛莉亚
Gracias, Gloria.

171
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,100
晚餐很棒
That was a lovely dinner.

172
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,960
你能忍受得了这个家伙实在太伟大了
And you are an incredible woman for putting up with this gringo!

173
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,860
-快点  -怎么回事
- Come on! - What happened?

174
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,180
祝你在哥斯达黎加有好运
Good luck in Costa Rica!

175
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,730
-谢谢你  杰  -他在说反话
- Aw, thanks, Jay. - He didn't mean it!

176
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,310
我知道  我只是想缓和下气氛
I know! I'm trying to defuse the tension.

177
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,140
-上酒了  -太棒了
- Here we go, guys. - Oh, yeah!

178
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,360
-再来三杯莫吉托  -好喝极了
- Three more Mojitos. - Yum!

179
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,850
是不是美味到爆啊
Aren't these yum?

180
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,570
我第一杯都没碰过
I didn't even drink the first one.

181
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,860
你确定吗  它总不会平白无故消失了吧
Are you sure? 'cause I don't think it drank itself.

182
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,580
是啊  确实不是
No, it did not.

183
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,690
我喝酒一点问题都没有
Look, I have no problem drinking.

184
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,810
说真的姐倒立着都能喝酒
I can literally do it standing on my head.

185
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,600
但是  首先  我不跟爸妈一起喝
But, "A," not with my parents,

186
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,650
其次  我得保持清醒
and plus, also, I needed to stay sharp,

187
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,210
因为他们显然醉翁之意不在酒
because they were obviously up to something,

188
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,640
而且我也没心情喝酒
and I was in no mood.

189
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,260
昨晚我才睡了不到10个小时
I barely got 10 hours of sleep last night.

190
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,690
我给你们再拿点水
So, I'll go get you guys some more water,

191
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
主菜应该马上就来了
and your food should be out in just a few minutes.

192
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,430
谢谢你伙计  你的服务很周到
Thanks so much, pal. We appreciate it.

193
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,650
他看上去真是积极进取啊  对吧
He seems like a real go-getter, huh?

194
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,320
因为他总是"进"厨房"取"东西吗
Oh, 'cause he goes and gets things?

195
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,780
我想知道他对人生有什么规划
I wonder what he wants to do with his life.

196
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,710
我总是很好奇别人的人生规划
I wonder that about people all the time.

197
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,350
我觉得这很正常  
I think that's very common,

198
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,110
想知道其他人的志向
to wonder about other people's aspirations.

199
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,960
我总是这样
I do it all the time.

200
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,240
-是  你是这样  -好了  水来了
- Yeah, you do. - Yeah. Here we go.

201
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,980
布莱恩  作为一个年轻人
Hey, Brian, you're a young guy.

202
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,720
你在这之后想做点什么  有什么规划吗
Wha-- wha-- what do you want to do after this? What's your plan?

203
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,540
说实话
Uh, to be perfectly honest,

204
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,050
我大概会回家  看看电影  再磕点药
I'm probably gonna go home, watch a movie, and get high.

205
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,390
你们在考虑饭后的活动吗
You guys looking for something to do?

206
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,610
不  不  不  
No. No. No.

207
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,410
我还有点存货
Oh. I mean, I think I got extra.

208
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,040
不用了  你真是...  
No, no, that's --

209
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,820
他是在问你对人生的规划  
I-I think he meant your plan for your life,

210
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,440
不是指今天晚上
not -- not just tonight.

211
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,650
我想当编剧
Oh. I want to be a screenwriter.

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,370
-很有理想  -真有意思
- Ambitious. - And -- and so interesting.

213
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,840
是不是啊  海莉
Isn't that interesting, Haley?

214
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,570
-当然了  -你应该跟他说说你的事
- Sure. - You should tell him what you're doing.

215
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,690
你是说在我们一起跟布莱恩嗑完药之后吗
Oh, you mean after we all go get high with Brian?

216
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,510
那是不可能的
That's not happening.

217
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,450
很抱歉拒绝你  我是说
I'm sorry. I meant that --

218
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,250
我知道你们的意思
No, I know what you meant.

219
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,620
布莱恩  你可以回避一下吗
Hey, Brian, could you give us a second?

220
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,090
好  当然
Uh, ye-- sure.

221
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,510
这就是你们今天带我来的原因
So this is what this whole night's about --

222
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,620
鸡尾酒  假装是我朋友  都是幌子
the drinks, the pretending to be my friend?

223
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,960
我们确实是你的朋友
We are your friend.

224
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,490
亲爱的  我们很关心你
Honey, we care about you.

225
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,010
我们想确定你有自己的人生规划
And we want to make sure that you -- you've got a plan,

226
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,130
因为看上去你在混日子
'cause it seems like you're meandering.

227
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,740
别这样  亲爱的  不要每次谈到
No. Sweetie, don't just start texting

228
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,490
你不喜欢的话题就开始玩手机
because you don't like the conversation.

229
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,270
-看  -这是什么
- Here. - What is this?

230
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,160
这是我一直在写的博客
That's a blog that I've been doing.

231
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,020
我真的很喜欢我拍的照片
I'm really liking my photography,

232
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,420
别人也总说他们喜欢我的穿衣风格
and people always say that they like the way that I dress,

233
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,410
所以我就在这个网站上传我的穿着搭配
so I've been posting pictures of my outfits on this site.

234
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,730
我知道现在还赚不了多少钱
I know it's not a huge money-maker right now,

235
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,960
但每当有人点击链接  买我穿的衣服时
but I do get money whenever someone clicks on a link

236
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
我就会有收入
and buys something that I wore.

237
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,710
下学期我会去上商务课
I'm gonna take a business class next semester,

238
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,310
希望能帮助我通过现在做的事
which I'm hoping will help me turn all of this

239
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,380
成为一个造型师
into becoming a stylist.

240
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
我已经有1200个粉丝了
I have 1,200 followers.

241
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,070
多数是想知道怎样穿衣搭配的女人
Most are women who want to know what to wear.

242
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,390
还有一些想知道我穿什么的男人
Some are men who want to know what I'm wearing,

243
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,390
不过我已经在想办法
But, you know, I'm trying to figure a way

244
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,370
屏蔽那些变态了
to block all of the pervs.

245
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
所以  这就是我的规划
So, yeah. I guess that is my plan.

246
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,850
真是太棒了
It's amazing.

247
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,390
我们真为你骄傲
We are so proud of you.

248
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,440
省省吧  你们总是用恶意揣测我
Don't even, guys. You always assume the worst of me.

249
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,120
亲爱的
Honey --

250
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,730
你们两个坐在那儿
No, you guys sit here

251
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,010
假装是我的朋友  却对我评头论足
acting like we're drinking buddies, judging me,

252
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,490
事实是我对未来的规划比你们两个
when I have a better handle on my future

253
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,730
在我这么大时能做到的都要好
than either one of you did at my age.

254
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,550
你曾经想做个魔术师
You? You wanted to be a magician.

255
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,510
而你呢  三分钟就换一次专业
And you were changing your major every three minutes,

256
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,290
这是外公告诉我的
according to grandpa --

257
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,020
顺便说一句
who, by the way,

258
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,550
我和外公一起喝酒好多年了
has been drinking with me for years

259
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,640
因为他爱我
because he loves me,

260
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,130
而且觉得我喝高了的时候说话很风趣
and he thinks I say funny things when I'm buzzed.

261
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,560
很显然  叙利亚局势日趋紧张
Well, apparently, the situation in Syria is worsening.

262
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,500
是啊
I know.

263
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,630
现在联合国有证据显示阿萨德
In fact, now U.N. evidence suggests that Assad was --

264
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,580
你是在照着手机念么
Are you reading this off your phone?

265
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,540
什么
What?!

266
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,330
你在
You're --

267
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,080
不是  没有
No! No! What --

268
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,030
-我只是在确认没有记错细节  -小卡
- I was just making sure my facts were straight... - Cam.

269
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,610
以便我对当今局势高谈阔论
...before I started a spirited conversation of current events.

270
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,970
好吧
Yeah.

271
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,930
还说什么了
What else does it say?

272
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,740
谢谢
Thank you.

273
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,210
不好意思  那是金枪鱼鞑靼吗
Sorry. Is that the tuna tartare?

274
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,580
是啊  很好吃
Yes, and it is delicious.

275
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,280
我应该点那个的
Oh, I should've ordered it.

276
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,300
想尝一口吗
Would you like a taste?

277
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,260
不用了  但是谢谢  你人真好
Oh, no. But thank you. That's very sweet.

278
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,360
她是认真的  卡蒂喜欢跟别人分享食物
She really means it. Uh, Katie loves sharing food.

279
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,350
我也是  我觉得
Me, too. You know, I think

280
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,510
在大家庭里长大都会这样
it's growing up in a big family,

281
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,280
因为晚餐桌上的所有东西
'cause everything at suppertime on the table

282
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,710
都是给大家一起吃的
was up for grabs.

283
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,850
我们不做饭前祷告  
We didn't say grace.

284
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,880
我们会说  各就各位  预备  开吃
We said, "On your marks, get set, go."

285
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,490
你的语气跟我爸完全一样
You sound exactly like my dad.

286
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,340
他出生在密苏里一个很大的家庭里
He was from this really big family in Missouri, and --

287
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
不是吧
Shut up!

288
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,190
我自己就是个密苏里的乡下孩子
I'm a Missouri farm boy, myself!

289
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,590
-不是吧  -天啊  我叫小卡
- Stop! - Oh, my gosh! I'm Cam.

290
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,450
很高兴认识你  小卡
Well, right pleased to meet you, Cam.

291
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,400
这是布兰登
This is Brandon.

292
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,360
你好  她平常不这样说话的
Hi. She doesn't really talk like that.

293
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,200
他时不时也会有口音
Oh, well, he slips in and out of his accent

294
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,930
就像《泰坦尼克号》里的凯特・温丝莱特
like Kate Winslet in "Titanic."

295
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,180
-我叫米奇尔  -你好
- Uh, I'm Mitchell, by the way. - Hi.

296
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,600
-你好  -你点了什么  布兰登
- Hi. - What -- what's yours, Brandon?

297
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,990
看起来也很好吃
It looks delicious, too.

298
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,150
这是马铃薯干酪松露
It's the truffle parmesan gnocchi.

299
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,960
但是你知道吗  如果你想尝一口那个
Do you know what, though? If you want a bite of that,

300
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,400
你就找错人了
you're barking up the wrong tree.

301
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,160
因为那是一个严格的不分享区
'cause that dish is in a strict no-share zone.

302
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,050
我只是
I just --

303
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,750
不喜欢别人从我的盘子里吃东西
I don't like people eating off my plate.

304
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,620
因为我们不是动物  我也一样
Yeah, because you're not an animal. I'm the same way.

305
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,440
天啊  我们完全一样
Oh, my gosh! You're exactly us!

306
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
不  你们要更有趣
No, you guys are more interesting,

307
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,970
因为你们基情四射
'cause you have the whole gay thing.

308
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,290
卡蒂  你都不知道他们是不是
Katie, you don't know if they're gay.

309
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,190
你真可爱
Okay, that's adorable.

310
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,050
是啊  我们的关系很明显
Yeah, it was -- it was a pretty safe bet.

311
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,850
我要去下洗手间
Okay. I'm running to the powder room.

312
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,210
小卡  尝尝这个
Cam, please try the tartare,

313
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,870
一会儿不管你点了什么  我也要尝尝
because whatever you order, I want a taste.

314
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,680
没问题  不过你要快点回来
Okay. Well, don't you dillydally,

315
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,810
因为我一挂上饲料袋就慢不下来
because I ain't exactly slow once I tie on the ol' feed bag!

316
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,190
别激动  亲爱的
Calm down, honey boo boo.

317
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,490
-她真可爱  -超级可爱
- She's so cute! - Very adorable.

318
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,090
布兰登  你是做什么工作的
So, Brandon, what do you do for a living? Are you --

319
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,940
听我说  伙计们  我不想这么没礼貌
Look, guys. I-I hate to be blunt,

320
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,670
但是你们能不能给我们一点空间
but could you please give us some space?

321
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,310
没问题
Not a problem.

322
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,800
不  不是
Look, no -- no, it's --

323
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,000
你们人很好  只是我
I mean, you guys are great. But I'm gonna...

324
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,710
我今晚要向卡蒂求婚
propose to Katie tonight.

325
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,850
而我觉现在有点...
And I'm kind of feeling -- yeah.

326
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,730
什么  在这吗
What?! Here?!

327
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,370
天啊  这太棒了
Oh, my god! That's amazing!

328
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,820
我们几个月前刚刚订婚
We just got engaged a few months ago.

329
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,060
太好了
Great.

330
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,120
所以我们一定会尊重你们的隐私
Yeah, so we will definitely give you your privacy.

331
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,370
-恭喜你  -是啊
- Congratulations. - Absolutely.

332
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,550
祝你好运
Yeah. Good luck.

333
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,640
这样吧  如果你想的话
You know what? If you wanted,

334
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,200
我可以假装在发短信
I could pretend like I'm texting,

335
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,720
然后用手机把整个过程录下来
and I could video the whole thing on my phone.

336
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
这样你就能留作纪念了
That way, you'd have it forever.

337
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,140
真的吗  好啊
Really? I mean, that -- yeah.

338
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,740
-那太好了  -你确定吗
- That would be awesome. - A-are you sure?

339
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,260
他很容易过于激动
He gets very, uh, well, excited.

340
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,980
有可能会漏出马脚
And he might give it away.

341
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,990
米奇尔  我觉得凭我对卡蒂的了解
Mitchell, um, I think I know Katie well enough

342
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,090
我能看出她有没有起疑心
to tell if she's getting suspicious.

343
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,190
-小卡  -她说过我可以尝尝的
- Cam?! - She said I could.

344
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,830
见鬼的开瓶器去哪儿了
The hell's the corkscrew?

345
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,730
你想谈谈吗
Do you want to talk about it?

346
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,190
没什么可谈的
There's nothing to talk about!

347
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,710
小短总是做傻事
Shorty does dumb things all the time.

348
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,460
我打赌  不出三个月
You mark my words -- in three months,

349
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,400
他就会花光钱滚回来了
he'll be back here needing money.

350
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
也许你不高兴不是因为小短会滚回来
Maybe this is not about Shorty coming back.

351
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,030
而是因为小短可能不会回来了
Maybe this is about Shorty not coming back.

352
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,250
曼尼
Manny.

353
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,770
她的意思是  在你内心深处
What she's saying is, deep down,

354
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,300
害怕小短会爱上哥斯达黎加
you're afraid Shorty's going to love Costa Rica,

355
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,910
你就永远失去自己最好的朋友了
and you'll lose your best friend forever.

356
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,870
你一直都是这样
That's what you do.

357
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,560
你故意疏远别人  这样他们离开时
You push people away, so when they leave,

358
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,220
你就不会那么难受
it doesn't hurt that much.

359
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,560
我搞不明白  你们这代人那么伟大
I don't get it. You're the greatest generation,

360
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,650
怎么就没有情感呢
but why can't you feel?

361
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,280
你怎么不能像其他青春期少年
Why can't you spend your teen years

362
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
整天呆在房间不出来呢
locked in your bedroom like a normal kid?

363
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,220
看吧  他现在在疏远我了
See? Now he's doing it to me.

364
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,130
杰  这是你必须面对的
Uh, you have to face it, Jay.

365
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,010
我终有一天会搬出去
One day, I'll be moving out of this house.

366
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,260
你可以写个保证吗
Can I get that in writing?

367
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,190
我脑海里现在都是30岁的你
'cause I just can't shake this image of a 30-year-old you

368
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,710
吃着我的食物  还黏着我老婆
eating my food and cuddling with my wife.

369
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
男孩子永远都该黏他们的妈妈
Boys should never stop cuddling their mothers.

370
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,180
我会做噩梦的
I'm gonna have nightmares!

371
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,260
你假装很强硬
You pretend to be so tough.

372
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,350
可你知道我怎么想吗
But you know what I think?

373
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,170
我觉得事实上
I think that deep down,

374
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,840
你才是这屋子里感情最细腻的人
you're the most sensitive person in this house.

375
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,550
看吧
See?

376
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,830
又开始了
You did it again.

377
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,110
一说到这种敏感的话题
I say something that strikes a nerve,

378
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,000
你就受不了了
and immediately, you cannot handle it.

379
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,100
所以你才这样逃避话题
That's why you "Pbht" in my face!

380
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,700
终于发现一个你不那么可爱的地方了
We just found the one thing you can't make sexy.

381
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,600
又来了
There it is again.

382
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,820
我需要喝一杯
I need a drink.

383
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,070
杰  你得跟小短说清楚
Jay, you have to make this right with Shorty.

384
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,500
告诉他你的真实感受
You have to tell him how you feel!

385
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,900
他可是你那么多年的老朋友
He has been a great compadre with you for many years.

386
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,530
除了他还有谁给你的笑话捧场
Besides, who else is going to laugh at your jokes?

387
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,400
大把人欣赏我的笑话
Lots of people laugh at my jokes.

388
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,270
除了你的员工以外还有别人吗
Name one person that doesn't work for you.

389
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,680
要不你们两个还是一边温存去吧
Hey, you know what? Why don't you two just go cuddle?

390
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,560
她来了
Okay, here she comes.

391
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,650
淡定
Stay calm.

392
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,300
-你会露馅的  -你才要淡定
- You're gonna spoil it. - You stay calm.

393
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,730
看起来真不错  这是什么
Ooh, that looks good. What is it?

394
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,310
这个是烤鱿鱼圈
Um, uh, this is the grilled calamari.

395
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,560
很美味的  你要不要来一"环"
It's scrumptious. Would you care for a ring?

396
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,520
我是说你要不要尝一下  亲
I -- um, I mean, dig in there, girlfriend!

397
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,320
不用了  谢谢
Oh, no, that's okay. Thank you.

398
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,200
看起来超美味
This looks so delicious.

399
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,000
我的也很美味
Yeah, mine's delicious, too.

400
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,320
卡蒂
Katie...

401
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,460
你今晚真美
You look so beautiful tonight.

402
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,460
要知道我从来没遇到过像你这么好的人
You know, I-I've never met anyone like you,

403
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,820
我也知道不可能再遇到了
and I know that I never will. And I...

404
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,990
我好爱你
I love you so much.

405
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,580
你能让我变成世界上最幸福的男人吗
Will you make me the happiest man on earth

406
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,110
-嫁给我  -什么
- and be my bride? - What?!

407
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
我的天啊
Oh, my god!

408
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,220
-不行  -不行吗
- No! - No?

409
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,240
不行
No!

410
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,280
对不起
Sorry.

411
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,070
你知道这里以前是个银行吗
Did you know that this place used to be a bank?

412
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,860
真的哦
Was it, really?

413
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,230
我只是  我不想结婚  布兰登
I just -- I don't want to be married, Brandon.

414
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,620
我们会变得跟那些
We'll end up like one of those couples

415
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,500
相对无言的夫妻一样
that just sits there with nothing to talk about

416
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,590
直到移情别恋
until we glom on to other people.

417
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,760
我简直不敢相信  你  你不爱我吗
I can't believe this. You -- you don't love me?

418
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,120
-不  -不爱吗
- NO! - NO?

419
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,610
-对不起  -不
- I'm sor... - NO!

420
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,140
我需要透透气
I need some air.

421
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,230
叙利亚那边有什么新情况
So, Syria, any updates?

422
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,910
-还没什么  -没有啊
- No, nothing yet. - Nothing.

423
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,210
你还记得她小时候发不出"p"这个音
Do you remember how cute she was when she was little

424
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,790
-有多可爱吗  -烤"堵"豆
- and she couldn't say her P's?  - "BAKE A-TATOES."

425
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,770
烤"堵"豆  还有"饼"果酱
"Bake a-tatoes" and "Attlesauce".

426
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,390
"饼"果酱
"Attlesauce"!

427
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,740
能给我点"饼"果酱吗
"Can I have attlesauce?"

428
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,560
首先  你有点高了
First of all, you're screaming.

429
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,570
我们可以买单了吗  拜托
Can we just get the check, please?

430
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,750
你可以不要生我们的气了吗
Could you please not be mad at us anymore?

431
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,550
我们很抱歉让你有被摆布的感觉
We are very sorry that you felt manipulated.

432
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,390
你们知道我觉得最讽刺的是什么吗
You know what I'm pretty sure is ironic?

433
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,090
你们花那么多时间担心
You guys spend all this time worrying

434
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,280
我将来要做什么
about what I'm going to do,

435
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,750
但也许你们应该开始思考一下
and maybe you should start thinking

436
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,520
你们要做什么了
about what you're going to do.

437
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,860
这是什么意思
What are you talking about?

438
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,930
我们都离开家以后你们打算做什么
Well, what are you gonna do when we're gone?

439
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,760
有什么计划
What's your plan?

440
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,830
-我们会好好的  -是啊
- Uh, to be fine. - Yeah.

441
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,240
-因为我们很好啊  -特别好
- 'cause we're fine. - Totally.

442
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,770
你们都走了
You guys are gone.

443
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,630
我们就买辆休旅车
We get an R.V. Bam!

444
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,440
我  你妈妈
Me, mama...

445
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,700
外加一条狗  默林  踏上旅程
and our dog, Merlin, hit the open road.

446
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,240
不  我可不要把我的晚年
No. I am not spending my golden years

447
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
浪费在一个个房车公园里
driving around an R.V. park,

448
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
整日寻找地方安营扎寨
looking for a place to plug my house in.

449
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,570
不  我要去周游世界
No. I am gonna go see the world.

450
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,640
那你想去哪里
Where do you wanna go?

451
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,320
我不知道  菲尔  印度  非洲
I don't know, Phil. India. Africa.

452
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,450
痢疾  会得痢疾
Diarrhea. Diarrhea.

453
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,950
看起来你们真的要开始规划一下
Wow. It sounds like you guys really need to start thinking

454
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,310
你们的未来了
about your future.

455
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,040
我们走后你要让默林住在狗舍吗
Are you just gonna put Merlin in a kennel when we're gone?

456
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,150
菲尔  默林根本不存在
Okay, Phil, Merlin doesn't exist.

457
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,410
孩子们走后你为何要
And why do you want to get a dog to take care of

458
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,630
急于找只狗来养呢
so soon after the kids leave?

459
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,680
因为我需要有人疼爱  克莱尔
Well, I'm gonna need someone to love me, Claire.

460
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,880
与此同时  妈妈
And in the meantime, mom,

461
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,450
外公想让你接管公司  但是
grandpa wants you to take over the business, but...

462
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,590
那是你想要的吗
Do you want that?

463
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,090
这么久远的事情我还没想过
I-I guess I hadn't thought this far into the future.

464
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,450
爸爸  你要一直以卖房子为生吗
And, dad, are you just gonna keep selling houses?

465
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,480
我不是想要动摇你的心思
I mean, I don't want to blow your mind here,

466
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,830
但你还是可以成为一个魔术师啊
but you could still be a magician.

467
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,990
我可以
I could.

468
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,170
他不行
He couldn't.

469
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,100
真的吗
Really?

470
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,980
你身后的这个盐罐可不是这么说的
This salt shaker behind your head says different.

471
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,230
菲尔  你把盐弄到我身上了
Oh, Phil, you're getting salt all over me.

472
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,750
我要变成玛格丽特了[想要一杯]
I feel like a Margarita.

473
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,810
-马上来  -不  不  不  不
- You got it! - No, no, no, no, no, no!

474
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,610
结账吧  麻烦了
Just the check, please.

475
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,560
好的
Okay.

476
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,000
非常感谢你
Thank you so much.

477
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,350
-谢了  兄弟  -多谢
- Thanks, buddy. - Yeah.

478
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,850
糟了  我的钱包在另一件外套里
Oh, no. I left my wallet in the other coat.

479
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,200
我没带包包
I did not bring my purse.

480
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,870
没事  我来吧
It's fine, guys. I got this.

481
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,400
-谢谢你宝贝  -谢谢你  亲爱的
- Honey, thank you. - Oh, thank you, sweetie.

482
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,040
-等下看来也要我来开车了吧  -是啊
- I should probably drive, too, huh? - Probably.

483
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,380
-我觉得  也是  -是啊
- I gue-- yeah. - Yeah.

484
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,500
不如我留在这里结账  你们去叫门童
Why don't you guys have the valet pull the car up

485
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,870
把车取来
while I pay the check?

486
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,130
这倒是可以
That we can do.

487
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
伙计们  那边
Uh, you guys, it's that way.

488
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,770
-是吧  -是啊
- Mm-hmm. - It is.

489
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,620
顺便说一下  我们其实有很多可聊的
Y-you know, for the record, we do have a lot to talk about.

490
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,500
今天只是把有些话题先放一放
Yeah, we just took a couple of topics off the table

491
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,620
因为我们今晚想来一次浪漫的约会
because we wanted to have a romantic date night.

492
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,480
也许我们太想让今晚特别一点了
And it probably put too much pressure on it to be special,

493
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,760
事实上我和他在一起的每一天都很特别
but the truth is, every day I spend with this man is special.

494
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,930
小卡
Oh, Cam!

495
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,260
不  我才是幸运的那个人
Oh, no, I'm the lucky one.

496
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,830
我们都是
There we are.

497
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,890
抱歉
I'm sorry.

498
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,430
我想刚才布兰登求婚时我只是慌乱了
I guess I just panicked when Brandon asked me.

499
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,780
我们很不一样  我知道这看来
I mean, we're so different. And I know it seems petty,

500
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,630
很矫情  但其实不然
but it speaks to something bigger.

501
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,320
我不知道我能否与一个
I don't know if I can spend the rest of my life

502
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,510
不让我碰他食物的人共度余生
with the kind of guy who won't let me eat off his plate.

503
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,880
相信我  那不是问题
Trust me -- it can be done.

504
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,360
我也不应该太在乎这件事
And I should not make such a big deal about that.

505
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,670
我保证会努力调整的
I promise I'll try and do better.

506
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,170
不  你说得对  你不喜欢我那样
No, you're right. You don't like it,

507
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,030
我就应该尊重你的喜好
and I should respect that more.

508
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,780
你们结婚了吗
Are you guys married?

509
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,880
今年五月结
Oh, this May.

510
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,250
-但我们算是结婚很多年了  -是的
- But, basically, we've been married for years. - Yeah.

511
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,530
小卡难道就是我心中的完美人选吗
I-I mean, is Cam everything that I dreamed of?

512
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,580
谨言慎行  律师
Tread lightly, counselor.

513
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,780
是的  他就是
Yes. Yes, he is.

514
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,450
因为尽管经历了种种妥协
Because through all the compromises

515
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,200
协商与争执
and negotiations and arguments

516
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,850
甚至是厌倦情绪
and sometimes even boredom,

517
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,620
我无法想象没有他的生活
I cannot picture my life without him.

518
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,190
说得真好
That's very sweet.

519
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,760
但要是我就不会说厌倦  不过
I would've scooted past the boredom, but...

520
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,300
说到最后  卡蒂  你必须问问你自己
At the end of the day, Katie, you have to ask yourself,

521
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,820
你能想象没有这个人的生活吗
can you imagine your life without this person?

522
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,720
好了
Hey. All right, look.

523
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,990
我买完单了  我们走吧
I, uh, paid the check, okay? Let's just go.

524
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,590
布兰登  你能先坐下吗
Brandon, can you just please sit?

525
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,730
我一直在和他们两个聊
I've been talking to the guys here,

526
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,170
他们真的让我想了很多
and they really opened my eyes.

527
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,480
真的吗
They did?

528
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,400
是的
Yes.

529
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,160
我尝试着想象没有你的生活
I've been trying to picture my life without you, and...

530
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,460
你知道吗
You know what?

531
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,410
我能接受
I can.

532
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,100
我们可没那么说
We didn't tell her that.

533
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,850
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

534
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,170
不  我想和你们一样  懂吗
No, I want what you guys have, okay?

535
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,730
抱歉  布兰登
I'm sorry, Brandon.

536
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,280
对不起  但我们都该有那样的感情
I am so sorry, but we both deserve that.

537
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,750
我从未如此确定过
I've never been so sure of anything.

538
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,990
好了  我还是
You know what? I'm just...

539
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,740
打车回去好了
gonna go get a cab, okay?

540
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,150
再见
Goodbye.

541
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,670
谢谢
And thank you.

542
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,570
-别  别谢我们  -我们什么都没做
- Don't-- don't thank us! - We didn't do anything,

543
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,320
我们真的没有
So... we didn't, honestly.

544
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,070
这真是我人生最悲剧的一晚
This is the worst night of my life.

545
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,980
抱歉
I'm sorry.

546
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,130
但是好在一切都结束了
But, I mean, um, a-at least now it's over.

547
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,410
你可以开始新生活了
You can... start to move on.

548
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,530
我尝试着想象没有你的生活
I've been trying to picture my life without you.

549
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,540
你知道吗
And you know what?

550
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,210
-傻缺手机  -我能接受
- S-stupid phone. - I can.

551
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,310
这手机着魔了
It's a... devil phone.

552
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,090
米奇尔出生时  早产了一个月
When Mitchell was born, he was a month premature.

553
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,610
当时事态很紧急
So it was touch and go there for a while.

554
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,950
是凌晨两点
It's 2 a.m.

555
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,950
我走进医院的等候室想喘口气
I walk out into the hospital waiting room to get some air,

556
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,710
小短也在
and there's Shorty.

557
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,360
他在那坐了六个小时了
He'd been sitting there for six hours

558
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,980
还坚持要继续再呆两天
and refused to leave for the next two days.

559
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,980
米奇尔的中间名就是这么来的
That's where we got Mitchell's middle name.

560
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,190
不是叫小短
Not Shorty --

561
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,570
是文森特
Vincent.

562
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,650
M.V.P[最有价值球员]
"M.V.P."

563
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,000
这点上我们也有些不成熟
We were a little premature on that one, too.

564
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,540
歌洛莉亚  我要开车出去了
Gloria, I'm going for a drive!

565
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,050
替我向小短问好
Say hi to Shorty for me!

566
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,410
没跟你说话
I'm not talking to you!

567
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,220
我正要去找你
I was just coming to see you.

568
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,300
我把外套落在这里了
Um, I left my jacket.

569
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,890
在这呢  进来吧
Oh! There it is! Come on in.

570
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,020
小短  你知道我说的那些话
Uh, Shorty, you know that stuff I said, uh --

571
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,080
-我懂  -我们没事吧
- Yeah, I get it. - We're good, huh?

572
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,190
没事
Under the bridge.

573
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,000
好的  回头见
All right. I'll see you.

574
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,190
小短  等等
Shorty, wait.

575
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,310
我有话想跟你说
I need to say something to you.

576
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,280
说吧
Yeah.

577
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,280
我想说谢谢你
I want to thank you...

578
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,810
感谢我们一同经历的好时光

580

你应该知道
And you should know that, uh...

582
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,750
你是我最好的朋友
you're my best friend.

583
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,590
知道吗
You know?

584
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,330
也许是我一生中最好的朋友
Probably the best friend I'm ever gonna have.

585
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,460
杰  你这是干什么
Jay, I mean... what are you doing to me?

586
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,100
这对我有点难  我只是
This is hard for me. I'm just...

587
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,540
我只是想告诉你我的感受

我总跟达琳说  "这是个真男人"
I always tell Darlene, "That's a real guy."

591
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,260
自立  敢说敢干
Self-made, stand-up,

592
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,860
是那种你愿意和他在同一战壕奋斗的人
the kind of guy you want to be in a foxhole with.

593
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,180
我没那么好
Well, I'm not all that.

594
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,090
我也没下过战壕
Well, it's not like I've been in a foxhole.

595

我会想你的  文森特

说实话
If I'm being honest,

604
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,440

this is a little girlier than I thought.

两年
Two years.

606
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,100
她怎么就这么走了
How could she just walk away?

-知道吗  她这是帮了你  -绝对的

他没开玩笑  布兰登  你这么帅
No, he's not kidding. Brandon, you are seriously gorge!

610
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
要我说  她和你在一起绝对是占便宜了
If you ask me, she got the better end of the deal.

611
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,970

614
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,330
-有点不太正经  -而且说实话

她看起来不是很阳光

616
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,800
她是不是比你大
And is she older than you?

617
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,460
-她看起来比你大多了  -相信我们
- Because she looked significantly older than you. - Trust us.
