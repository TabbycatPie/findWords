2011年秋天 高科技已经让
By the fall of 2011, technology had taken

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:06,640
人们的生活失去了秘密
a lot of the intrigue out of life.

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:11,024
网络上有每个人的信息墙
The Internet had everyone's wall of information.

4
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,611
任何事都不再神秘了
Nothing was a mystery anymore.

5
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:20,008
不过 孩子们 在那之前有一段时间
But, kids, there was a time before that,

6
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,476
回到那段黑暗时期
way back in the dark ages.

7
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:23,877
你们疯了吗
Are you people insane?!

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,364
美国最受欢迎的食物是芝士汉堡
The most popular food in America is the cheeseburger!

9
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,848
不可能 是披萨才对
No way! It's pizza!

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,068
我们是不是忘了某位香肠先生
Are we forgetting about a certain Mr. Furter,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,653
他的名字叫法兰克福
first name Frank?

12
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,055
嗯 每个孩子午餐盒里带的是什么
Um, what did every kid bring in their lunchbox

13
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,224
直到八年级前的每一天都带
every day till grade eight?

14
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:38,892
蘸着枫糖浆的薄煎饼
Pancakes with maple syrup.

15
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,162
谢谢你 加拿大
Thanks, Canada.

16
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,914
我们在寻找一种普通美国人吃的食物
We're looking for a food the average American eats.

17
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,399
-没错 没错 -哦
- Yeah. Yeah. - Oh!

18
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,701
中国菜
Chinese food.

19
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,170
后来智能手机出现了
And then came the smartphone.

20
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,340
嘿 还记得
Hey, remember

21
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:55,760
有一次我们争论什么才是最受欢迎的食物吗
when we were arguing about the most popular food?

22
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,045
是面包
It's bread.

23
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,797
嗯
Hm.

24
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,183
酒吧争论就从此消失了
And the barroom debate was dead.

25
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,251
你们都是白痴
You guys are idiots!

26
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:07,054
-好吧 没有彻底消失 -你真的要告诉我
- Okay, not completely dead. - You are seriously telling me

27
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,556
你不打算拆开这个信封吧
you don't want to open that envelope

28
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,758
看看你怀的是男孩还是女孩
and find out if you're having a boy or a girl?

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,445
不打算 索尼娅医生给我们这个只是为了以防万一我们想知道
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us this in case we wanted to know.

30
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:16,147
但我们不想
But we don't.

31
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,816
莉莉派和我只是想等着宝宝生出来
Lilypad and I are just gonna wait till that baby pops out

32
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:20,201
然后享受这个巨大的惊喜
and enjoy the big surprise.

33
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,903
听着 我假装持照医生的时间
Look, I have pretended to be a licensed therapist

34
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:25,072
已经长到能发现你们不想知道孩子性别这件事
enough times to know there is something unhealthy

35
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:26,907
是很不健康的
about your not wanting to find out.

36
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,160
-支持我一下 凯文 -不 不 不 不 不
- Back me up here, Kev. - No, no, no, no, no.

37
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:32,496
这名真正的医生不会冒着让
This real therapist won't risk upsetting

38
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,217
他的完美的新女朋友生气的风险去分析她的完美的朋友
his wonderful new girlfriend by analyzing her wonderful friends.

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,054
不管他们的精神有多不正常
No matter how mentally unbalanced they may be.

40
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,172
我懂的
I hear you.

41
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,790
我觉得你不懂
I don't think you do.

42
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,726
我们只是不想让那种大男子主义的期望
We just don't want to burden our little angel

43
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,063
给我们的小天使太多的负担
with all kinds of gender-specific expectations.

44
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:51,766
男孩可以跳芭蕾 女孩也可以打橄榄球
Boys can do ballet; girls can play football.

45
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,576
太对了 绿湾包装工队几年前
Hell, the Green Bay Packers have been

46
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,801
就已经证明了这点了
proving that for years.

47
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,491
要是在体育酒吧的话这个笑话会让人哄堂大笑的
That would've gotten a big laugh at a sports bar.

48
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,493
嗯 我说要早点确定性别
Well, I say define gender roles early.

49
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,745
其它女孩14岁生日得到的都是
All the other girls got a pretty dress

50
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,365
漂亮的裙子和蛋糕
and a cake when they turned 14.

51
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,666
可我
Me...

52
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:10,918
我想回家 爸爸
I want to go home, Daddy!

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,755
那个方向只有狼
That direction is nothing but wolves.

54
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:20,511
而那边40公里处是斯密舍矿山镇
And 40 kilometers that way is the mining town of Smithers.

55
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:23,330
要是我就选狼
I'd take my chances with the wolves.

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,552
三天后见
I'll see you in three days.

57
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,305
等一下 我吃什么啊

58
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:34,358
嘿 你有把刀 森林里到处是动物

对此有什么想法吗 大夫
Got any thoughts on that, Doc?

63
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,938
如果你们觉得我会有想法的话 那么 你们疯了
If you guys think I'm going near that, you're crazy.

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,907
你为什么要强调"你们"
Why'd you emphasize "you're"?

65
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,184
没有原因 你漂亮极了
No reason. You're pretty.

每次我和一个新认识的女孩约会
Every time I go on a first date

88
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,961
他们都会突然进入调查模式

89
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,429
它的开始是因为一个意外
It started by accident.

你说的关于女人被迫节食时的感受的那些话

100
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,769
实在是太有道理了

噢，有热狗。追

从那以后，背景调查
<i>After that, background checks</i>

103
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:17,244

而且，她现在还是一个死囚的妻子

113
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,470
她只给了《安妮·霍尔》两星
She gave <i>Annie Hall</i> two out of ten stars?
（《安妮·霍尔》是1977年的奥斯卡电影）

114
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,773
拖沓而且被高估
"Slow and overrated"?

115
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,325
不是吧，你就注意到了这个
Really? <i>That's</i> your takeaway?

116
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,494
这可是伍迪·艾伦的巅峰之作
It's the Wood Man at the height of his powers.

从那时候人们就为他痴狂
People have been ripping that off ever since.

119
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,953

00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:04,068
请不要上网搜对方的信息
let's not do any prior Internet research on each other.

153
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,637
我听起来是不是在隐瞒什么不良信息
It sounds like I'm hiding something horrible, doesn't it?

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,105
我百分之百确定你是个连环杀手
I'm pretty sure you're a serial killer.

155
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:09,389
我不是 我不是
I'm not. I'm not.

156
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,408
我的意思是，你看，我爸妈认识的时候
It's just, you know, like, when my parents met,

157
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,393
还没有互联网——他们只是
they didn't have the Internet--they just went out

158
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,279
约了个会就相爱了
on a blind date and fell in love.

159
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,164
很好啊 他们还在一起吗
That's nice. And they're still together?

160
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,248
直到他们离婚的时候都在一起
Right up to the divorce.

161
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,335
我的意思是，我很想了解你本人
The point is, I'd love to get to know you

162
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,637
而不是网络信息
in person, not on my computer.

163
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,589
想法不错 开始听起来
I like that. What started out

164
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,008
很诡异 事实上还挺有爱的
sounding really creepy turned out really sweet.

165
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,178
这是我的行事风格
That's kind of my move.


166
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,630
她居然
And she was

167
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,832
同意了“无网约会”
on board with the whole "no Internet" thing?

168
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,800
她觉得很有爱
She loved it.

169
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:38,936
这个女人有不可告人的秘密
The bitch is hiding something.

170
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,804
这个女人肯定有不可告人的秘密
The bitch is totally hiding something.

171
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,449
嘿 泰德 你走之前问一句— 
Hey, Ted, before you leave--

172
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:49,268
是珍妮特·麦-艾-金太尔还是麦金太尔
is Janet McIntyre M-A-C or M-C?

173
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,304
最后说一次，在和她约会之前
For the last time, I don't want to know

174
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,905
我不想知道她的任何信息
anything about her before the date.

175
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,825
你可能想看看这个 泰德 有裸照
You might want to see this, Ted-- naked pictures.

176
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,660
那不是珍妮特
That's not Janet.

177
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,445
那是谁
Who, now?

178
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,214
说正经的
Seriously...

179
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:04,333
如果你们尊重我这个朋友
if you guys respect me as a friend...

180
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,885
就别查了
stop looking.

181
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,725
呃 既然泰德的意思很清楚了 那么 
Well, Ted was pretty clear there, so...

182
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:13,959
我们就关掉本本
let's shut those laptops

183
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,462
去帮马修和莉莉 我们说好的
and go help Lily and Marshall, just like we promised.


185
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:21,484
把本本留在这里 去粉刷婴儿室
Let's leave the laptops here and go paint that baby room.

186
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,837
别带本本
Without laptops.

187
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,489
带就带吧 无所谓
Or bring the laptops. Either way.

188
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,974
激动人心的时刻
This is exciting.

189
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,476
给你们看看
I give you...

190
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,329
伴随我们宝宝长大的颜色
the color our child will grow up with.

191
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,582
黄色，像太阳一样
Yellow, like the sun.

192
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,318
也可能是女儿 近音双关
Or daughter. Pun snuggle.
（sun-太阳与son-儿子发音相近）

193
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,206
哦，天哪，宝宝马上就要入住了
Oh, God, this room's about to get its first spit-up.


194
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,341
打开信封不就完事了
Just open the envelope already!

195
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,593
凯文，你能不能告诉巴尼
Kevin, will you please tell Barney that it is

196
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,429
想保持神秘感是很正常的？
perfectly normal for us to want to preserve the mystery.

197
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,932
我不是来做分析的 我是来给自己加男友分的
I'm not here to analyze; I'm here to win boyfriend points.

198
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,885
顺便说一句，你们都很靓，尤其是罗宾
By the way, you all look great, especially Robin.

199
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,020
好吧，如果你们不知道孩子的性别
Come on, if you don't know the gender,

200
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,556
在婴儿洗礼上会被鄙视的
you're gonna get generic crap at the baby shower.
（婴儿洗礼是孩子出生前举办的一个party）

201
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,441
但如果你们真的知道了性别
But if you do know the gender,

202
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,311
你们就会
you'll get, oh,I don't know, this!

203
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,863
马修 关灯
Marshall! Lights!

204
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,699
好吧
Okay.

206
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,303
当这个小男孩儿还不能双飞的时候
BARNEY: When little Jack's not turning double plays,

207
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:16,088
他会穿着这身
he's turning heads with this

208
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,140
家庭版本垒打的帅气衣服
home run of an outfit!

209
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:20,159
但如果是一个小女孩儿
And if it's a little girl...

210
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,696
这身皇家公主一样的打扮会让你无话可说的
This royal ensemble may leave <i>you</i> speechless,

211
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,331
而我们的小公主一定会说
but it's sure to make little Sally say,

212
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,551
我奈你妈妈我奈我的衣服
"I wuv you, Mommy, and I wuv my dress,

213
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:32,205
我会很乐意看到你洗澡的样子的
and I would love to see you in the shower."

214
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,557
不好意思我太投入这个角色了
Sorry, I kind of fell out of character in that last part.

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,577
但如果你们不知道它的性别
But if you don't know the gender...

216
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:41,097
我们的小朋友就只能像一个在操场上被遗弃的小孩子一样
Little Fran is sure to be the pariah of the playground

217
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,367
穿着这身像雌雄同体一样的麻布衣了
in this hermaphroditic burlap sack.

219
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:47,937
马修 开灯
Marshall! Lights!

220
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,574
巴尼
Barney,

221
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,026
你一点也不在乎我们孩子的性别
you don't really care abo'.

222
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:54,777
你只是不能
No. You just

223
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,761
忍受
can't stand

224
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:57,330
你不知道的一些事情
not knowing something.

225
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,282
这太荒唐了
That's ridiculous!

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
马修你能
Marshall, will you...

227
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,518
帮我拿着这些东西一小会儿么
will you hold these for a second?

228
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,619
当然你要干什么
Yeah, sure. Why?

229
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,454
我一定要知道
Because I gots to know!

230
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,506
哦 巴尼 帮我把他推开
Oh, Barney, no!Help! Get him off of me!

231
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,126
所有人都hold住
Everybody hold it Hold it!

232
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:13,212
我发现珍妮特·麦肯泰尔当过三次寡妇
I found Janet McIntyre,who's been widowed three times.

233
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,298
很显然她杀了他的老公们
She's obviously killing her husbands!

234
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,934
我勒个去
Oh, my God!

235
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,552
他们约会已经六分钟了
They're six minutes into the date.

236
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,887
泰德可能已经对她说我爱你了
Ted's probably already told her that he loves her!

237
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,439
我们必须赶到那儿去
We've got to get down there!

239
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,226
没人要离开
Nobody's going anywhere!

240
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,260
为什么
Why?!

241
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,779
孩子们 就在那会儿
NARRATOR:<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

242
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,764
凯文想起了之前他定下的规矩
<i>Kevin thought back</i><i>to his earlier rule...</i>

243
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,116
我这个真正的心理医生
This real therapist won't risk

244
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,268
不会去冒着惹火他完美的女朋友的风险
upsetting his wonderful new girlfriend

245
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,437
去分析她这些完美的朋友们
by analyzing her wonderful friends.

246
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,139
凯文把这些规矩统统抛弃了
<i>...and threw it out the window.</i>

247
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,375
你们是我见过的最最相互依赖的乱七八糟的
You're all the most codependent, incestuous,

248
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,710
喜欢控制别人的一群人了
controlling group of people I've ever met!

249
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:49,498
顺便说一句 你们都很不错 尤其是罗宾
By the way, you all look great, especially Robin.

250
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,617
哦 别
Oh, mm-mm.

251
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,255
这真的很棒
This is so great.

252
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,123
对吧 如果我们事先调查了对方
Right? See, if we'd researched each other,

253
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,226
我们都会偷偷的用对话引向
we'd both be secretly steering the conversation

254
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,560
一个方向或另一个方向
one way or the other.

255
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:02,979
但像我们这样却更刺激不是么
But this is more exciting, right?

256
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,096
老刺激了
Way more exciting.

257
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,148
这样我们就可以谈论任何我们想说的话题了
I mean, we can talk about anything we want.

258
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,484
任何话题
Anything. 

260
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,971
所以
So...

261
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,192
来的路上路况怎么样啊
...how was the traffic getting here?

262
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,244
你把我从公寓接来的
You picked me up at my apartment.

263
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:20,696
我确实这样做了
I certainly did.

264
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,199
老天啊
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

265
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,984
没有了网络我就失去了和女人交流的能力了
<i>I've lost the ability to talk</i> <i>to girls without the Internet.</i>

266
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:28,421
我的大脑彻底短路了
<i>My brain is completely shutting down.</i>

267
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,989
请问两位是准备吃饭还是只喝东西
So, are you folks gonna have dinner or just drinks?

269
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,992
我不知道
I-I don't know.

270
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:37,296
你说的到底是什么鬼东西 凯文
What the hell was that, Kevin?

271
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,514
我们都是一群疯子仅仅因为
We're all crazy just because

272
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,016
我上网找了些东西
I'm looking up some stuff on the Internet,

273
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,000
而巴尼希望知道那个孩子的性别么
and Barney wants to know the baby's gender?

274
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,603
这个 老实说
Well,to be honest,

275
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,772
我注意到了另外一些让人不安的东西
I noticed some other disturbing...

276
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,508
算了
Never mind.

277
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,893
当我没说 对不起
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

278
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,528
我必须知道
I gots to know!

279
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,864
好吧 昨天晚上
Okay, last night alone...

280
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,283
你什么时候回来
When-When are you coming back?

281
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:59,702
因为我想你了小傻瓜
Because I miss you, silly!

282
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,456
等下 你在和谁说话
Wait, who's he talking to?

283
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,624
嘘 我马上就回来
Shh, I'll be back soon.

284
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,526
嗯 你想让我帮你带份椒盐脆饼么
Yeah, you want me to bring you a pretzel?

285
00:11:07,900--> 00:11:09,202
分离焦虑症
separation anxiety

286
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:12,298
泰德在洗手间给我发短信
Ted's texting me from the bathroom.

288
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,501
哦
Oh.

289
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,669
我表示我不明真相啊
I don't get it.

290
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,888
-只是发了一个带撇的C啊他 - 哦
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.- Oh.

291
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,922
是啊
Oh, yeah.

292
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,341
当有的时候我们中的一个在大号
Sometimes when one of us is on the can,

293
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,894
我们会偷偷看一眼然后发信息给别人
we'll, uh, sneak a peek and then text each other,

294
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,896
你懂的
you know.

295
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:30,549
用符号来描绘你拉的一坨的样子
Symbols to describe what your bowel movement looks like?

297
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,938
今天早上我拉了一坨像 & 的东西
This morning,I took an ampersand.

298
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,556
去年夏天我拉的像两点
Last summer,I dropped a deuce

299
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,825
看上去确实就像我三点里的两点
that actually looked like the number two!

300
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,528
不合时宜的社会行为举止
inapporopriate social behavior

301
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,664
你上个礼拜三加班的时候
When you worked late Wednesday,

302
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,835
我感到很寂寞
I... I got lonely and...

303
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:53,071
所以我就一个人偷偷看了幸存者
I watched <i>Survivor</i> without you.

304
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:55,074
幸存者的内疚感
Survivor guilt

305
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,176
我唯一没能看到的你们不健康的行为
Practically the only unhealthy behavior I didn't see

306
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,795
就是肢体暴力
from you people was physical violence.

309
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,387
耶
Yeah.

310
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:09,805
至少 我们最近没那样做
At least we don't do that.

311
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,224
其中最极端的就是
And to top it off,

312
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,059
你们只关注干涉泰德的恋爱
all the meddling in Ted's love life,

313
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,427
却不关注莉莉怀孕
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?

314
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,764
这些让我感觉自己被你们刺激的都有点身体功能失调了
It all strikes me as just deeply dysfunctional.

315
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,951
所以综上所述 我们都很正常是么
So what you're saying is,we're fine?

316
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,987
否认
denial

317
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,656
虽然这些字体经常
So, while this font is often

318
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,625
错误的被认为是黑体
mistaken for Helvetica,

319
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:33,078
事实上
the fact is...

320
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,881
这些是黑粗体
it's Helvetica Bold.

321
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,617
我都能确切的听到
<i>I can actually hear the sound</i>

322
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:41,353
她的阴道关上门的声音
<i>of her vagina being boarded up.</i>

323
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,557
我必须坦诚珍妮特
I got to be honest, Janet.

324
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,643
首先这是新罗马字体
First of all..this is Times New Roman.

325
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:49,962
第二 我很纠结
Second, I'm having trouble

326
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,931
怎么能挑出话题
coming up with things to talk about.

327
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,799
我也一直坐在这里想
You? I'm sitting here thinking,

328
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,019
擦 我真希望我能找出一个关于字体的话题
"Damn it, I wish I had something as good as that font thing.

329
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,487
那真是个不错的话题
That's gold."

330
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,523
伙计们 我很抱歉说了那些
Guys, I'm so sorry I said anything.

331
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:04,109
你基本上把我的朋友们当成了精神病
Um, you basically called my friends mentally ill.

332
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,612
而你却还想仅仅用一点沉闷的道歉化解么
Yeah, you think some lame apology will fix that?

333
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:09,331
那我一个人粉刷这个屋子怎么样
What if I just paint the rest of the room by myself?

334
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,750
接受你的道歉
ROBIN, LILY & MARSHALL:Apology accepted.

335
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,118
好的那我们这样吧
Okay, let's do this.

336
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,753
我们来找找相互之间的相同和不同
Let-Let's find out each other's likes and dislikes.

337
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,955
就随机找个东西开头吧
Start with something totally random.

338
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,540
比如我不知道怎么说
Like, um, oh, I don't know.

339
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,325
你是我不知道
Are you a fan of--I don't know--

340
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,344
安妮霍尔的粉丝么
<i>Annie Hall?</i>

341
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:25,297
我想这绝对不是随便的话题你想用这部电影
I'm guessing that's not random at all, and you use that movie

342
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,216
来测试我是不是一个很酷的女孩儿
to test whether a girl is cool?

343
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:28,934
不不不 这只是一部第一时间跃入我脑海的电影
No, it's-it's the first movie that popped into...

344
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,636
-我喜欢安妮 霍尔  -哦 感谢上帝 你很酷
-I love <i>Annie Hall.</i>  -Oh, thank God you're cool.

345
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,471
但就像一切刚开始那样
<i>But just as things started</i>

346
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,523
和珍妮特·麦肯泰尔相处的开始
<i>to go well</i> <i>with Janet McIntyre...</i>

347
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,809
哇哦 我找到了关于珍妮特·麦肯泰尔的东西
Whoa. I just found Janet McIntyre.

348
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,028
是传说中的珍妮特·麦肯泰尔
<i>The</i> Janet McIntyre.

349
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:49,071
我 勒 个 去
Sweet... mother... of God!

352
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,996
我要去下洗手间了
Uh, well, I got to run to the restroom.

353
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,081
别上网啊 亲
No internet, Mister.

354
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,866
如果你发现我那些阴暗的秘密我会宰了你的
If you find out my deep, dark secret, I'll have to kill you.

355
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,418
这只是我的朋友在问我约会怎么样
It's just my friends checking up on me.

356
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
我会很礼貌的告诉他们我享受了一段美好的时光
I'll politely let them know we're having a lovely time.

357
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,871
好的
Okay.

358
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,758
泰德说 他不会点击链接的让我们让他独处一会儿
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on the link, so leave me alone."

359
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,428
然后又给我发了一堆表示脏话的符号
And then either texted me a bunch of symbols for profanity,

360
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,545
或者是表示拉肚子的符号
or got food poisoning

361
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,547
然后用一直以来最诡异的两点来结尾
and dropped the weirdest deuce of all time.

362
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,650
你们真的应该看看这些
You guys have to see this.

363
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,485
不 我们现在和泰德站在一边
No. We're with Ted on this.

364
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,386
我们不想知道珍妮特是什么人
We don't want to find out about Janet,

365
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,056
就好像我们不想知道孩子的性别一样
just like we don't want to find out about the baby.

366
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,407
因为我们喜欢神秘
Because we like mystery,

367
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,493
不管是威严而毛茸茸的野人
whether it's the hairy majesty of Bigfoot,

368
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,529
还是卓柏卡布拉凶猛的吸血鬼
or the bloodsucking ferocity of the Chupacabra,

369
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:32,364
还是莉莉肚子里这个奇迹一般的生命的性别
or the gender of our little miracle.

370
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,699
谢谢你啊 
Thanks for putting those together

371
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,067
把这些归为一类
in the same sentence, sweetie.

372
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,418
额
Mm.

373
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,121
这样吧如果你们不想知道那这样
Look, if you guys don't want to know, how about this?

374
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:41,707
让我看看我不会告诉你们的
Let me look,and I won't tell you.

375
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,509
-绝对不行  -可以
-Absolutely not.  -Fine.

377
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:45,544
亲爱的 如果我们不让他歇会儿
Baby, if it will shut him up,

378
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,629
谁知道他会做出什么
what's the harm?

379
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,683
我可以么
Can I...?

382
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:57,806
我感觉我犯了个错误
This may have been a mistake.

383
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,558
男孩儿
Boy!

384
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,926
我喜欢孩子吗
Do I like babies!

385
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:02,478
女 
Girl!

386
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,113
朋友
...friend,

387
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,931
你的头发看上去真不错
your hair looks fantastic!

388
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,150
双胞胎
Twins!

389
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,402
是1988年的一部超好的电影
was the feel-good movie of 1988.

390
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:13,038
好了 巴尼我们不会在乎你说什么的
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't matter what you guys say.

391
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,239
我们不会感兴趣的
We're not gonna cave.

392
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,574
不 我们想知道
Yes, we are!

393
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,559
哦 睁开眼睛看看
Oh, just open your eyes.

394
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,045
这种中性的黄色看上去糟透了
This gender-neutral yellow is horrible!

395
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,581
我们肯定要重新粉刷的
We're clearly gonna paint over the whole thing!

396
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,616
这就是你想听的
That's what you want to hear.

397
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,051
老娘我一定要知道
I gots to know!

398
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,720
耶
Yeah.

399
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:30,139
是一个
"It's a..."


400
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,057
是个
It's a...

401
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,726
剩下的卡片去哪里了
Where is the rest of the card?

402
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,477
我把它撕成两半了
I ripped it in half.

403
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,462
我知道你极其渴望看一看
I knew you'd be desperate to see it,

404
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:38,764
当然我会把它给你的
and I'll give it to you.

405
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:41,934
你只需要读一读珍妮特·麦肯泰尔的事情
All you have to do is admit that mystery is stupid

406
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,404
然后承认神秘感是愚蠢的
by reading about Janet McIntyre.

407
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,139
这一点都是不是感情勒索
This is in no way emotional extortion.

408
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,524
你们要不要这么赞
You guys are great.

409
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,659
好吧 让我们来看看你本本
Fine, we'll look at your laptop.

410
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,446
我
Sweet...

411
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,082
勒 个 去
mother... of God.

412
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,336
我没看到电脑屏幕
I can't really see the computer screen.

413
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,371
只是被呛到了
It just went down the wrong pipe.


415
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,759
[莉莉和我都坚决认为你得看看这个关于珍妮特·麦肯泰尔的链接]
哇
<i>Whoa.</i>

416
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,044
要是莉莉和马修要我看看
<i>If Lily and Marshall want me to click on it,</i>

417
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,847
那估计珍妮特·麦肯泰尔真是有什么不为人知的阴暗面了
<i>maybe Janet really does have a deep, dark secret.</i>

418
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,266
肿么了
What's going on?

419
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,434
我是个妓女
I'm a prostitute.

420
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,352
你该不会以为我
You didn't think I was

421
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,469
真的是看上你了吧
actually into you, did you?

422
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,887
有点
Sort of.

424
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,175
淡定点 莫斯比
<i>Get it together, Mosby.</i>

425
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,079
噢
Oh.

427
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,348
这酒喝了又得还回去哈
You don't buy beer,you rent it.

428
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,784
对吧
Am I right?

429
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,202
这可是男厕所
This is the men's room.

430
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,787
我知道
I know.

431
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:35,754
我是男人啊
I'm a dude.


434
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,133
听着，有些事情你应该知道
Listen, there's something you should know.

435
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,386
我撒谎了
I lied.

436
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,221
我只对安妮·霍尔这电影只有一点点喜欢
I only kind of liked <i>Annie Hall.</i>


438
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,261
我得看看
<i>I gots to know!</i>

439
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,717
我
Sweet...

440
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:08,437
勒 个 去
mother... of God.

441
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,695
嘿
Hey.

443
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,923
泰德 你还好吧 你看起来有点被吓到了
Ted, are you okay? You look freaked out.

444
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,559
我哪有
I'm not freaked out.

445
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,995
我很被吓到了 为啥呢
<i>I was freaked out. Why?</i>

446
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,964
因为我刚发现了珍妮特·麦肯泰尔
<i>'Cause I had just discovered that Janet McIntyre was...</i>

447
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:37,200
超级赞
<i>amazing!</i>

448
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,039
珍妮特·麦肯泰尔:15岁的普林斯顿大学毕业生
Janet McIntyre:Princeton Grad at Age Fifteen

449
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,800
普林斯顿神童珍妮特·麦肯泰尔向陌生人捐肾
Princeton prodigy Janet McIntyre donates kidney to complete stranger

450
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,800
肾脏捐献者登上珠穆朗玛峰
Kidney donor climbs Everest

451
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,500
最年轻的珠穆朗玛峰登峰者从河里救了一个孩子
Youngest woman to climb everest saves baby from creek

452
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,800
挽救了孩子的天才少女继承了麦肯泰尔家族的亿万财富
Baby-saving Genius inherits billion dollar McIntyre Fortune

453
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,800
我想找个人一起抱着看<i>安妮·霍尔</i>
I just want someone to cuddle up with & watch Annie Hall

454
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:02,458
然后 那堵信息墙出现了
<i>And just like that, the wall went up.</i>

455
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
好吧 他看到了珍妮特·麦肯泰尔的
Okay, he looked at Janet McIntyre's

456
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:06,329
网上超强事迹
Internet extravaganza.

457
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,348
这是卡片的另一半
Here's the other half of the card.

458
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:16,139
等等 我们应该这样做吗
Wait. Should we do this? I...

459
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,474
我不知道 我的意思是 我内心深处有个声音说 不应该
I don't know. I mean, my soul says no,

460
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,027
但是这些丑陋的黄色墙却尖叫着说 应该
but these hideous yellow walls scream yes.

461
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,813
那我是停下来 还是
Should I just stop, or...?

462
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,316
我勒个去
Sweet mother of God!

463
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,702
一只狗从渥太华跑到了萨斯卡通
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way to Saskatoon!

464
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,854
怎么
What?

465
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,122
我们已经把珍妮特·麦肯泰尔人肉了个底朝天了
We figured out the Janet thing.

466
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,457
我得看看加拿大的新闻啊
I'm catching up on Canada.


467
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,862
你是赞同我这样做的吧？ 
You're with me on this, right?

468
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,698
不然的话 我得下去把纸条捡回来
Otherwise, I can go down,and I can get the card.

469
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,466
绝对赞同
Absolutely.

470
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,418
噢 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

471
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,756
所以 孩子的性别依然是一个迷
<i>And so the gender remained a secret,</i>

472
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,176
但是 珍妮特·麦肯泰尔的生活却不再是了
<i>but Janet McIntyre's life no longer was.</i>

473
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:55,144
只有一个问题
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

474
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,729
泰德 怎么了
Ted, what's going on?

475
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,265
没事
Nothing.

476
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,550
我有没有跟你说过我是纽约建筑史上
Did I mention that I'm the youngest architect

477
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,987
最年轻的摩天大楼的建筑师
in New York historyto have a skyscraper built?

478
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,721
噢 所以 我也没有你想像的那么
Oh.So, I'm not quite

479
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:08,241
的默默无闻啦
as far beneath you as you might think.

480
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:10,276
为什么我要那样想
Why would I think that?

481
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:12,695
没啥原因 但是我六年级时
No reason, but this one time in sixth grade,

482
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,665
我见到一只浣熊被困在了排水沟里 然后我告诉我爸爸
I saw a raccoon trapped in a gutter, and I told my dad,

483
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,533
后来 消防员们来把它救出来了
and the firemen came and got it out,

484
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:20,503
虽然这不像我把孩子从河里救出来或别的事那么伟大
so it's not like I pulled a baby from a creek or anything,

485
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,754
至少 我没有因事小而不为之
but at least I didn't ignore it

486
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,674
而且我还用放大镜把萤火虫烧着了
and keep lighting bugs on fire with my magnifying glass.

487
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,793
我们有过约定的 但是你打破了
We had one promise, and you broke it.

488
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,661
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

489
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,579
你查了我 结果现在你发现我很可怕了
You looked me up, and now you find me intimidating.

490
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:32,849
为什么我要觉得你很可怕呢 
Why-Why would I find you intimidating, okay?

491
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:35,084
这又不像我捐了个肾
It's not like I donated a kidney,

492
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,352
但我曾经献过血
but I donated blood once,

493
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,586
尽管我紧张得昏过去了
although I wound up fainting,

494
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,722
然后他们不得不把血又输回去了
and they had to put it all back in.

495
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,941
这些事真是让我超激动
I was so excited about this.

496
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:45,228
但现在你和其他人一样就像个又哭又闹的蠢蛋
But now you're just a blubbering idiot like the rest of them.

497
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,696
我不是
No, I ain't!

498
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:49,782
我是说 我哪里又哭又闹了
I mean, no, I never do that thing you says.


499
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,652
我的意思是 你比我优秀太多
What I mean is, you gooder than me

500
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:55,705
是没什么关系的
no make difference!

501
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,124
就那样了
<i>And that's that.</i>

502
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,493
我真希望我没去点那个网页
I wish to God I'd never clicked on that link.

503
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:01,911
真是遗憾 泰德
I'm sorry, Ted.

504
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:03,779
我们只是想帮帮忙
We were just trying to help.

505
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:06,165
我觉得的那是咸吃萝卜淡操心
I said it was meddling and manipulative,

506
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,167
但是凯文非要我们插手
but Kevin insisted we butt in.

507
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,167
病态的惯性骗子
pathological liar

508
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,256
不 是我的错
No, it's my fault.

509
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,807
我不应该看的
I never should have looked.

510
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,677
在这场神秘VS史实大对抗中
In the battle of mystery versus history,

511
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,645
还是不要知道的比较好
it's best not to know.

512
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,315
莉莉
Lily Pad

513
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:23,850
怎么
What?

514
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,235
我们有个男宝宝了
We're having a boy.

515
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,489
我们有个男宝宝啦
We're having a boy.

516
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,806
我们有个男宝宝啦 你有个男宝宝了
We're having a boy! You're having a boy!

517
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,360
我们有个男宝宝了
We're having a boy.

518
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,081
我去买些蓝色的画
I'll go buy some blue paint.

519
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,551
刀得磨一磨了
It needs sharpening.

520
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:54,138
你看到了吧  我三天前就说 你会很快回来的
You see? I told you three days would go by in no time.

521
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,806
菲利斯 起飞吧
Phineas, take us up!

520
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,224
要是你想问我
Well, in case you were wondering,

521
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,527
我在加勒比海的时候是不是一直在下雨
it rained the entire time I was in the Caribbean.

522
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,708
那么 谢谢你的关心
Thank you for asking.
