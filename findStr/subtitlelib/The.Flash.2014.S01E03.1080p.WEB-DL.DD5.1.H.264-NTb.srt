1
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:06,283
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:08,185
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:10,120
by something impossible.
Run, Barry, run!

4
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:13,157
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:17,594
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:19,997
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,166
but secretly I use my speed

8
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,735
to fight crime
and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:27,504
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother

10
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,306
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:32,643
I am...The flash.

12
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,678
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,413
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

14
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,582
But you really did see something
that night your mom died

15
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:40,317
and your dad <i>is</i> innocent.

16
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:43,654
The explosion that put you
in a coma also killed my fiance.

17
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,822
Can you imagine if
you could control his power?

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,191
If you could harness it,

19
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,660
you could change
what it means to be human.

20
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,361
He's called the flash.

21
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:54,798
Or, at least,
he will be one day.

22
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,835
He must be kept safe.

23
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,209
It doesn't matter
if you're the slowest kid

24
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,511
in gym class
or the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:11,315
Every one of us is running.

26
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:12,583
Being alive means running--

27
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:14,184
running from something,

28
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:15,686
running to something

29
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:17,688
or someone.

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,690
And no matter how fast you are,

31
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,692
there's some things
you can't outrun.

32
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:25,662
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

33
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,365
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

34
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,501
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four, tops.

35
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:33,237
There's a zombie movie scale?

36
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,639
Did you know that zombies
exist in nature?

37
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,575
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

38
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,544
causing the ants
to attack plants

39
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,913
that can release spores
which in turn infect new hosts.

40
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,348
I'm going full nerd again,
aren't I?

41
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,482
- Yep.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:46,917
Yeah.
It's okay though.

43
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,019
You are still the cutest nerd
that I know.

44
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,754
Anyways,
I'm a lot more interested

45
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:52,322
in the amazing as of late.

46
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:54,258
You mean 'cause of
this "Streak" thing?

47
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,093
He's out there.
People are talking about him.

48
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,361
How do you even know
he's a he?

49
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,395
Maybe it's a she.

50
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,130
It's a man, okay?

51
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:02,399
You know I am really intuitive
about this kind of stuff.

52
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,767
Someone even posted a picture

53
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,369
after being yanked
from a car accident.

54
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:07,070
It's a red blur
leaving the scene.

55
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:09,539
Here, what do you see?

56
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:14,244
I see
your boyfriend's calling.

57
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,646
Oh,
I should probably get this.

58
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,314
I'm crashing at his place
tonight,

59
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,283
and he's supposed to leave
a key for me somewhere.

60
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,984
Hey, babe.
What's up?

61
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,453
Not much,
just hanging out with Barry.

62
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:24,455
You off yet?

63
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:28,558
Hello.

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,827
Code 237 on Waid Boulevard.

65
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,629
Public indecency?

66
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,364
Wait, I think I meant a 239.

67
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,300
Dog leash violation?

68
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:38,935
Bad man with a gun
in a getaway car.

69
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,637
Go.

70
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,307
You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

71
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,653
He's got a gun.
Look out!

72
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,894
Where'd he go?

73
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,767
What the--

74
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,002
Key's in the mailbox.

75
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,671
I'll see you later.
Bye.

76
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:16,506
Eddie says hi.
Nice of him.

77
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,841
You wanna grab a bite?

78
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:19,643
I'm feeling a little famished.

79
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,812
After the Mongolian barbecue
we had before the movie

80
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:23,680
and the extra large popcorn
you had at the movie?

81
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,016
How are you not fat?

82
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:29,119
I've been jogging.

83
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:30,354
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,060
Why so public a meeting,
Uncle?

85
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:40,464
We're dining out to show
our enemies we're not afraid.

86
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,132
Relax, nephew.

87
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:45,369
We've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

88
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,636
Close it up.

89
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:47,638
Come.

90
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,872
Have a drink.

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,855
Our own drivers
are ripping us off.

92
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:07,557
Someone is paying them

93
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,360
to steal from us.

94
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:14,898
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,100
And then those thieves...

96
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:19,870
Those thieves...

97
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:23,273
will draw

98
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,574
their last breath.

99
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,679
Uncle!

100
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:42,549
<font color=#00FF00>♪Flash 1x03 ♪</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Thing You Can't Outrun</font>
Original Air Date on October 21, 2014

101
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,550
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

102
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,699
- Where'd you cut him off?
- So we cut him off at Eighth.

103
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,668
I mean, the perp was in
the backseat of the cruiser

104
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,036
before he even knew
what happened.

105
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,204
Congratulations, Paulson,

106
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,672
on that arrest last night.

107
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,340
Hell of a job.
You come by later, Joe.

108
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:00,043
I'll give you a driving lesson,
okay?

109
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,145
Wasn't even him last night.
It was me.

110
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:03,280
I figured.

111
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:04,581
I just didn't realize

112
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,183
you were helping people
for the glory.

113
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,852
It's not like I want a museum
built in my name.

114
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,488
Keeping what I can do a secret
from Iris and everyone,

115
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,823
it's harder than I thought.

116
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,691
I know,
but it is safer that way.

117
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,527
Besides, me and you
got work to do.

118
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,132
The evidence
from my mom's case.

119
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,834
I had it brought up
from storage.

120
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:25,735
I've been through this box
1,000 times.

121
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:29,506
Before, your story about what
really happened that night--

122
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,475
the lightning storm,
the man in the middle of it--

123
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:32,909
I thought that was a kid

124
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:34,644
trying to protect his father
from prison.

125
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,246
But now that I know it's true,

126
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:39,082
we're gonna go through
every scrap of evidence

127
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:40,684
until we find something
that helps us.

128
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,686
It took the jury 52 minutes
to come back

129
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:43,954
with a verdict of guilty.

130
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:45,989
They moved too fast,

131
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,858
which is why we got to
take our time.

132
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,529
Barry, Joe,
we got multiple homicides.

133
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,065
Do you know
the Darbinyan crime family?

134
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,574
Barry?

135
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,710
Ah.
Anything?

136
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,212
Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

137
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:12,182
The cells in their bodies
were unable to utilize oxygen.

138
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,584
It's consistent with exposure
to poison gas.

139
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:15,986
What kind of poison?

140
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,354
I'll need to take
a lung sample,

141
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,089
see if I can narrow it down.

142
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:22,526
The only other exit was bolted
from the inside.

143
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,160
They were trapped.

144
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:26,596
I was thinking someone
pumped gas in from the outside,

145
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:29,032
but witnesses say
the street was empty.

146
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,667
So it was from the inside.

147
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,335
That means there should be
a canister

148
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:34,371
or a container left behind.

149
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,573
The gas just didn't
come in by itself.

150
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,742
Unless it had
a mind of its own.

151
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,915
Eddie, would you mind
canvassing again?

152
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,584
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

153
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,588
Okay, explain.

154
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,190
The boss collapsed
by the table.

155
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,059
This guy made it 10 feet away.

156
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,527
That guy had a chance
to move off

157
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,929
and fire three shots
into the window

158
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,330
trying to break the glass.

159
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,532
But they all started
in the same spot,

160
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,734
which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

161
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,436
at the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

162
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,272
They were attacked one by one.

163
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:12,709
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

164
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,444
you and me are gonna need...

165
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:17,981
Backup.
Yeah.

166
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:20,650
Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

167
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,052
Is it just poisonous gas,

168
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,753
or can he control
all aerated substances?

169
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,889
And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

170
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,791
Is it physiological
or psychological?

171
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,225
This individual can create

172
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,894
a mental nexus
using gaseous substances.

173
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,896
You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

174
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,364
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

175
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,066
They get really excited
about this stuff.

176
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,400
The only thing
I'm excited about

177
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,202
is putting criminals
behind bars.

178
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:41,805
Except Iron Heights
isn't exactly equipped

179
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,373
to handle meta-humans.

180
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,041
Then I guess it's fortunate
the ones

181
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,576
you've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

182
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:48,545
Well, unless we're planning
on executing

183
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,814
every super criminal we stop,

184
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,415
you geniuses are gonna have to
come up

185
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,317
with someplace else
to hold them.

186
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,220
A meta-human prison.
Sweet.

187
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:00,056
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

188
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:04,694
There is one place here
that might hold them.

189
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,162
You can't be serious.

190
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:08,798
I mean, we haven't been
down there since--

191
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,133
it's cordoned off.

192
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,135
Cisco is right.

193
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:12,135
It could be modified to act

194
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,303
as a makeshift prison.

195
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:15,372
What could?

196
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,073
The particle accelerator.

197
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,681
Tonight, the future begins.

198
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,950
The work my team and I
will do here

199
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,452
will change our understanding
of physics,

200
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,655
will bring about
advancements in power,

201
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,890
advancements in medicine.

202
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,725
And trust me,
that future

203
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:38,461
will be here faster
than you think.

204
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:40,797
Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,266
A big thunderstorm
is rolling in.

206
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:44,801
We're not launching
a space shuttle.

207
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:48,538
We'll be fine.

208
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,040
Tahiti?

209
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,675
I know it's a long flight,
Ronnie,

210
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,610
but we can binge watch
<i>Orange is the New Black.</i>

211
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:54,844
Oh, okay.

212
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,680
But what about Italy?

213
00:08:56,682 --> 00:09:00,650
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

214
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,353
Yes, but Italy
doesn't have Mai Tais,

215
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,055
and a honeymoon
isn't a honeymoon

216
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,790
without Mai Tais.

217
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,725
Dr. Wells,
the accelerator is primed

218
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,293
and ready
for particle injection.

219
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:14,164
Well, I feel I should
say something profound

220
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:18,835
like "one small step for man,"

221
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,071
but all I can think of
to say is,

222
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:23,406
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

223
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:36,119
That's it?

224
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,455
You'd think there'd be, like,
a loud bang.

225
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,523
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

226
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,559
Take it from the guy
who helped build it.

227
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
we did it.

228
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,869
Mai Tais it is.

229
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,854
Was that...

230
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:14,791
A loud bang.

231
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:17,794
Caitlin.

232
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,129
Caitlin.

233
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:20,764
Did you hear me?

234
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,700
We're going down
to the accelerator ring.

235
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:25,902
Actually, Dr. Wells,
I could use Caitlin's help

236
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:28,738
identifying the poison gas.

237
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,208
Okay.

238
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,610
If that's okay with you?

239
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:36,146
Let's go.

240
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:46,756
Welcome to the CCPD.

241
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:47,991
So this is your day job.

242
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,392
Mm-hmm.

243
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:50,627
I'm gonna rip out your hearts

244
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,162
and eat 'em for lunch.

245
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:53,596
Delightful.

246
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:56,900
Lab rat, I need prints
off this gun pronto.

247
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:58,735
Allen!

248
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,904
Where the hell is the fiber
analysis on the Orloff case?

249
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,439
Upstairs.
It's all finished.

250
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,974
I can just run up
and bring it down.

251
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:06,709
With you, that could be
three days from now.

252
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,344
I'll go with you.
Who are you?

253
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:10,213
Dr. Caitlin Snow,

254
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,115
Barry's personal physician.

255
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,221
The fiber analysis
for the Orloff case,

256
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:19,789
like you asked for,

257
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,724
sir.

258
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,395
Clean up your lab.

259
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:26,896
It's a mess.

260
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:34,671
The lightning
was in the house.

261
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:35,939
I told my son to run,

262
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,807
he disappeared,

263
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,376
and that's when
I saw the blood.

264
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,011
Your prints were
on the murder weapon.

265
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:44,647
I needed
to stabilize the knife.

266
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,382
I'm a doctor.

267
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,152
I was trying to save her.

268
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,453
I didn't kill my wife.

269
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:53,223
Joe, tell them.

270
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,058
You know me.
Our kids are friends.

271
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,593
You tell them, Joe.

272
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,664
Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

273
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,399
It's just work.

274
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:07,103
Some old cases
weren't filed properly.

275
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:17,914
Detective.
What are you doing here?

276
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,449
Joe, I thought
you were at the morgue.

277
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,619
I decided
to bring some work home.

278
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,354
Why are you here?

279
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:28,758
Yes, well,
I've been looking for you.

280
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

281
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:33,763
re-canvass,
see if we missed anything.

282
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,198
Always work the case, right?

283
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,733
That's what you taught me.

284
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,068
Wow, you've been listening.

285
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,937
Okay, let's hit it.

286
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,872
You mind
if I use your bathroom?

287
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,407
It's the first door
on the right.

288
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,609
I'll be in the car.

289
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,111
Bye, baby.

290
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,512
Bye, Dad.

291
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,618
Okay, this has got to stop.

292
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,287
I came here
to surprise my girlfriend,

293
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,789
and now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad--

294
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,624
not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

295
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,959
I know, I know,
it's just--

296
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:04,327
it's not the right time
to tell him.

297
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,696
When is, Iris?

298
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:09,232
I know my dad.
He'll kill us.

299
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:13,136
Right now,
you're killing us.

300
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:29,285
The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

301
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:33,823
and we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

302
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,860
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

303
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,697
meta-human abilities, but--

304
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,832
might just work.

305
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,934
First, we have to decouple
the main injection system

306
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:45,936
on the gantry level.

307
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,170
I'll be right back.

308
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,905
Why don't I do that?

309
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,573
I need the exercise.

310
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,350
There's an anomaly
in the core chamber.

311
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:02,251
The ring's
structural integrity is holding.

312
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:03,820
It's started a chain reaction.

313
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,755
The system is collapsing.
We need to shut it down.

314
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,223
We can't ramp down
the accelerator from here.

315
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,558
We need to do it manually.
Go.

316
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

317
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,227
I'm the lead engineer.

318
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,862
I know how to operate
the shutdown valve.

319
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:15,898
- It's not safe.
- Cait, I have to go.

320
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,042
Okay, you stay here.

321
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:28,144
We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows,

322
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,380
and if I'm not back in time,
you need to initiate lockdown.

323
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:32,181
No way.
I am not closing this door.

324
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,683
I won't be able
to open it again.

325
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,251
Cisco, if you don't seal off
the blast,

326
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,753
everyone in this building
will die,

327
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:39,188
including Caitlin.

328
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,656
Okay, now promise me.

329
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,261
Set your watch.

330
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:46,329
Two minutes.

331
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,902
You're coming back.

332
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:17,293
Cisco.

333
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,195
Cisco, we're ready to go.

334
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:27,537
Must be hard,
coming back down here.

335
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,539
A lot happened that night.

336
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,773
If you feel the need to talk--

337
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,708
I was just thinking,

338
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,977
we need to nail
those voltage calculations.

339
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,046
One fault,
and the helium blowback

340
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,916
could damage the mountings.

341
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,884
Smart.

342
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,426
Can I ask you something

343
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:51,994
that you don't have to answer?

344
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,163
My least favorite
kind of question.

345
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:56,365
Shoot.

346
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:01,137
Ronnie.
What was he like?

347
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,274
You just never talk about him
that much.

348
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:08,311
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

349
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,713
He was the structural engineer.

350
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,181
He liked to joke
that he was basically

351
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,283
a very high-priced plumber.

352
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:19,689
We were very different.

353
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:22,191
You might have noticed
I can be a bit...

354
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,960
guarded.

355
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:26,062
Ronnie knew how
to make me laugh.

356
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:30,099
He used to say we were
like fire and ice.

357
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:37,106
He wasn't supposed to be there
that night.

358
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,475
He was just there for me.

359
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,710
If he hadn't--

360
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:48,784
This says that there was
no residue of gas in the tissue,

361
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:50,686
poisonous or otherwise.

362
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,889
It must have evaporated.

363
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,190
We'll need to get
a fresh sample.

364
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:56,192
Wait, this can't be right.

365
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:59,162
This says that there are
two distinct strands of DNA

366
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,564
inside the tissue.

367
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,267
How did someone else's DNA
get inside the victim's lungs?

368
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,773
Well, my docket was clear,
so I stopped by the mall

369
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:13,276
to pick up
your homecoming dress.

370
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,711
I <i>am</i> a great mom.

371
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:17,780
I'll see you for dinner,
sweetie.

372
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,954
There's no DNA match
in the database.

373
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,222
I don't understand.

374
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,024
Why would a chemical attack

375
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:32,562
leave behind another person's
DNA inside the victim?

376
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:34,230
What if the meta-human
we're looking for

377
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,399
doesn't control gas?

378
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,568
What if he becomes it?

379
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,882
Judge Howard.

380
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:55,585
It's nice to see you again.

381
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,119
You died.

382
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,256
You say that like
it was an accident.

383
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,958
You remember the last thing
you said to me

384
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,593
in the courtroom?

385
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:07,930
May god have mercy
on <i>your</i> soul.

386
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,144
All available units,
we have a report

387
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,479
of a toxic gas attack

388
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,847
in the Central City
shopping mall.

389
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,983
Barry, don't.

390
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,486
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

391
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,687
It's not safe.

392
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,223
Caitlin, I have to go.

393
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:51,173
I patched into
the mall's security system.

394
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,775
According to witnesses,
the gas attack

395
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:54,810
was in the main elevator
in the north wing.

396
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:56,145
Which one is the north wing?

397
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:59,782
The one
with the Big Belly Burger.

398
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,684
I eat.

399
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:04,120
Back up.
Please, keep back.

400
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,907
Why did you kill that woman?

401
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,516
She deserved to die.

402
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,918
Now go run away.

403
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,288
I still have one more name
on my list.

404
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,425
don't make me add you to it.

405
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,582
Barry.

406
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,284
Barry, can you hear me?

407
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:10,219
His vitals are weak,
but he's alive, Dr. Wells.

408
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,521
I'm sure he's fine.

409
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:15,424
I can't breathe.

410
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:18,494
He needs oxygen.
Get the crash cart!

411
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:24,433
Barry!

412
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,268
Barry.
Cut me open.

413
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,571
The poison's still in me.
He brought us a sample.

414
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:30,840
Caitlin, we need to do
a pulmonary biopsy,

415
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:32,375
extract an active portion
of that gas.

416
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:33,876
I can't give you
any anesthetic.

417
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,611
Your metabolism will burn
right through it.

418
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,580
I heal quick, remember?

419
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:38,848
Do it.

420
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,015
Cisco, give me the syringe.

421
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,184
This is gonna hurt a lot.

422
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,286
It's a small needle.
You probably won't even feel it.

423
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,622
You're definitely
going to feel it.

424
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,168
The streak lives.

425
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,503
You'd be dead
if your lung cells

426
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:02,004
didn't regenerate
so quickly.

427
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:03,906
My chest feels like
that one time

428
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,509
I had a cigarette.

429
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,310
Yeah, teen me lived for danger.

430
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:09,678
This isn't funny.
You could've--

431
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,814
I didn't.

432
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,984
Now that we have a sample,
we'll get to work analyzing it,

433
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,485
figure out the makeup
of the poison,

434
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,621
maybe get a clue as to
his human identity.

435
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:21,857
Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

436
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,794
The Mist.
Okay, that's his name.

437
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,128
End of discussion.

438
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,496
I have to get
to the station.

439
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,131
You should be resting.

440
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,667
I have to talk to Joe.

441
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:36,172
Joe.
I had him.

442
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,807
The meta-human.
We were wrong.

443
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,676
He's not controlling
airborne toxins.

444
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:43,479
He can literally transform
himself into poison gas.

445
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,415
That's new.

446
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,083
The victim was a judge.

447
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,685
We're going through
some of her old cases

448
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:50,953
to see if there's a connection.

449
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,255
It's too late.

450
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:54,690
I should have been faster.

451
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,292
Focus on the job.

452
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,961
Don't think about that
right now.

453
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,397
You don't want to know
what I'm thinking about.

454
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,472
My dad has spent 14 years

455
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:14,343
in a 6x8-foot cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

456
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,645
I couldn't save my mom,
but I can save him.

457
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,247
Didn't I promise you

458
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,916
that we would get your father
out of prison together?

459
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:24,353
I don't need your help, Joe.

460
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:25,921
I could be in and out of there
with him

461
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,592
before anyone even sees me.

462
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:31,560
Okay.

463
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:34,497
You break him out of there.

464
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,999
Then what?

465
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,002
He's on the run
for the rest of his life.

466
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:42,204
And something tell me
he's not as fast as you are.

467
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,672
You don't know
what it's like there.

468
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,241
You think I don't understand

469
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:47,142
what you're feeling?

470
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,411
I have been a cop
for almost as long

471
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:51,313
as you've been alive.

472
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,982
So you should know,
putting on that suit

473
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:55,084
does not make everybody safe.

474
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,585
For every person you save,

475
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,254
there's gonna be somebody
you can't.

476
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,089
And the hardest thing
you're gonna have to face

477
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,124
is not some monster out there
with powers.

478
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:04,593
It's gonna be that feeling
of uselessness

479
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:07,730
when you can't do anything.

480
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:17,606
Or the guilt that weighs on you
when you make a mistake.

481
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,050
Some things, Barry,
you can't fight.

482
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:32,621
Some things
you just have to live with.

483
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,841
Yes, I'm writing this down.

484
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,710
Red streak at the mall

485
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:56,879
during the gas attack.

486
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:00,149
Thank you for calling.

487
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,850
Never fails.

488
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:03,953
Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

489
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:06,021
Did they get a good look
at the streak's face?

490
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:09,725
Not you too.

491
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,928
What are you doing here anyway?

492
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,331
We need to talk.

493
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,767
I thought about what you said,
and--

494
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,836
I know what you're gonna say.

495
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,071
I understand.

496
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,505
I'm your dad's partner.

497
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:25,741
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

498
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:29,612
I have never really had
a serious boyfriend.

499
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:32,047
Between dad and Barry and work,

500
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,682
my life has been full.

501
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:37,019
And I really like you,

502
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,121
but I thought that if I told
my dad about us,

503
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,956
then it would make this real,

504
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,759
and suddenly, it's something
that I could lose

505
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:47,563
or screw up.

506
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,999
I wanted it to be real.

507
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,300
Eddie.

508
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:20,596
I'm sorry.

509
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:22,331
I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

510
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,833
It's okay.
I get it.

511
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:28,470
You had to go.

512
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:31,473
It's just--

513
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:33,976
that's the last thing that
Ronnie said to me that night.

514
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:43,752
My mother died
14 years ago.

515
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,924
I used to think that
the further away I got from it,

516
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:53,429
the less it would hurt.

517
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,899
But some days, the pain,

518
00:25:56,901 --> 00:26:01,236
it's worse than the day
that it happened.

519
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,138
Some things you can't fight.

520
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,511
For so long,

521
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:13,682
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

522
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,984
What if I went with you?

523
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:33,736
Where's Ronnie?
Cisco, where is he?

524
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:35,904
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

525
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:37,740
I can't.
We're in lockdown mode.

526
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:39,742
Cisco, we have to get him
out of there or he'll die.

527
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,311
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

528
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:47,916
Caitlin.

529
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:52,221
Is Cisco there?

530
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,156
Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here.
I'm listening.

531
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,425
I adjusted the magnets
to redirect the beam

532
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,826
to try and vent the system

533
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,862
so the blast goes up
and not out.

534
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:01,830
I'll need to reset
the particle parameters

535
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:03,866
to compensate.

536
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,235
Cisco's doing it.

537
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,803
There has to be another way
out of there.

538
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:11,073
You have to find it.

539
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:14,042
Cait, the chain reaction,

540
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,078
I can't reverse it.

541
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,316
The doors need to stay shut
to protect you.

542
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:22,584
You still there?

543
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:23,886
I'm here.

544
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,894
Caitlin, whatever happens--

545
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:32,896
Ronnie.

546
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:36,398
Ronnie!

547
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:45,808
He saved so many lives
that day,

548
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,377
and no one will ever know
what he did.

549
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:56,785
I do.

550
00:27:56,787 --> 00:28:00,389
He was a hero.

551
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:03,792
I didn't want him
to be a hero.

552
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:05,794
I wanted him to be my husband.

553
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,702
Barry, Caitlin,
you down there?

554
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:15,604
You got to come look at this.

555
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:22,945
Hey, check this out.

556
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:24,947
It's a 3-D molecular model
of the gas

557
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,181
we retrieved from your lungs.

558
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:27,950
We have identified the toxin.

559
00:28:27,952 --> 00:28:29,685
Hydrogen cyanide?

560
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,454
What's interesting
is what's mixed in

561
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:36,191
with the cyanide--
a sedative.

562
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,026
Of course.

563
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:40,662
The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

564
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:42,197
Why?

565
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,132
That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

566
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,434
before they go
to the gas chamber

567
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:46,702
and breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

568
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:47,970
That's right.

569
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:49,371
There was someone executed.

570
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:50,939
Kyle Nimbus.
That's him.

571
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:53,475
He was a hit man
for the Darbinyan crime family.

572
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,344
They turned on him
and testified.

573
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:58,213
Judge Theresa Howard
was the judge at his trial.

574
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,281
She sentenced him to death.

575
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:00,649
He must have been affected

576
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,784
by the explosion
while he was being gassed.

577
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:05,053
Records indicate
the execution was completed.

578
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,622
That's why
there wasn't a match.

579
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,457
The DNA database only has
records of the living.

580
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,058
Right.

581
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,860
He said there was
one more person on his list.

582
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:13,795
Check the arrest record.
Who caught him?

583
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:15,430
That could be his next attack.

584
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:18,767
Barry, the lead detective...

585
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,676
Here to see Henry Allen.

586
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:29,011
Sign here.

587
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:30,412
Personal effects here.

588
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,100
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

589
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,502
Hey, do you know
where Joe went?

590
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:54,770
He's not picking up his cell.

591
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:56,705
Uh, not sure.

592
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,507
Eddie, it's really important
I speak to him.

593
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:01,043
I need to know
where he went.

594
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:04,846
He went to Iron Heights
to see your dad.

595
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,616
Barry.

596
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:09,952
I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

597
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:11,720
I hope you won't need it.

598
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:34,209
What are you doing here?
Is Barry all right?

599
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:35,744
He's fine.

600
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:41,650
Then to what
do I owe this visit?

601
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,353
I know I should have
come to see you sooner.

602
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:46,688
You just weren't up
for a little chitchat

603
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,992
with a man who murdered his wife
in front of his own son?

604
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:53,295
Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

605
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,170
Barry, I pulled up the specs
on Iron Heights prison.

606
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:03,839
It's maximum security,

607
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:06,942
but I think I can talk you
through breaking in there.

608
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:07,944
Don't bother.

609
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:08,945
I've been figuring out

610
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,012
how to break into that place

611
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:11,847
since I was 11.

612
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:14,850
Some new evidence
has come to light.

613
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:17,052
I can't go into detail.

614
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:19,121
It's just--

615
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:22,457
look, the important thing is,

616
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:24,893
I'm reopening the case.

617
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:28,063
I'm gonna find out
who really killed Nora,

618
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:29,398
and I promise you, Henry,

619
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,199
I'm going to get you
out of here.

620
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,538
I am so sorry.

621
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,341
It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

622
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:44,513
Because you always believed
in my son.

623
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,605
Nimbus.

624
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,841
You're supposed to be dead.
Same to you.

625
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:19,981
Joe?

626
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:21,917
Joe!

627
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,919
Help!

628
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,486
Guards!

629
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:25,754
Somebody help!

630
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:51,746
Go get him.

631
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:08,663
So you've come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

632
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:12,067
You're going somewhere you
can't hurt anyone ever again.

633
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:15,370
Wrong.

634
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:26,148
He used the antidote on Joe.

635
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,216
You need to stay away from him,
Barry.

636
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,751
Do not breathe him in.

637
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:38,026
I'm not sure
how that helps me, guys.

638
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:51,072
You can't fight him, Barry.

639
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:53,808
Just keep him coming at you.

640
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,210
That should sap his strength.

641
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:57,312
Gas is the least stable form
of matter.

642
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:58,547
This meta-human will not be able

643
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:59,915
to stay in his mist form
for long.

644
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,783
His particles will need
to reform.

645
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:04,045
Barry.

646
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:07,816
Barry.

647
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:09,384
We win.

648
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:26,334
It's been a while
since I watched you sleep.

649
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:34,009
Rescuing you is exhausting.

650
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:36,177
I really miss the ability

651
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,213
to be able to ground you.

652
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:40,915
Sorry I went and grew up.

653
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:48,623
I could have got my dad
out of Iron Heights tonight.

654
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,626
I know.

655
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:52,894
But you were right.

656
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:54,929
That's not the way.

657
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,197
- Daddy.
- Oh.

658
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,833
Baby, I'm fine.
don't worry.

659
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,241
I'll let you guys talk.

660
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:10,011
Partner.

661
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,714
You two arrive at the same time?

662
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,720
Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

663
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,024
Dad, the thing is--

664
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:26,027
You two are dating.

665
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:27,529
I know.
You do?

666
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:30,632
I'm a detective, remember?

667
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:34,569
And both of you
are lousy liars.

668
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:35,804
So you're not mad?

669
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,839
Oh, I'm mad.

670
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,774
And if the doctor
hadn't confiscated my gun,

671
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,077
we'd be having an entirely
different conversation.

672
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,747
Well, I should let
you two talk,

673
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:48,583
and I'll just be outside

674
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:50,985
looking into
the Witness Protection program.

675
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:55,357
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,259
Iris,
this is going to be complicated.

677
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,528
You know
I don't like complicated.

678
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,167
Do you like him?

679
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:08,370
Yeah, I do.

680
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:10,572
Then I will do my damnedest
not to shoot him.

681
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:12,707
That is all I ask.

682
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:21,516
Will it hold?

683
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:22,984
The barrier is powered by

684
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:25,820
an 8.3 Tesla superconducting
electromagnet,

685
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:28,423
which is about 100,000 times
the strength

686
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:31,059
of earth's magnetic field.

687
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:33,762
In other words, yes.

688
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,199
Hmm.
He's mad.

689
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:41,936
Well, good night.

690
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,043
So we're just supposed
to get used to

691
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:51,346
working above a makeshift prison

692
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:54,749
housing evil people
with superpowers.

693
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,252
You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, Caitlin.

694
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,226
Caitlin.

695
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:06,961
Could I talk to you
for a second?

696
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:10,064
Sure.
What's up?

697
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:12,233
It's about the night
that Ronnie died.

698
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,271
I--

699
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:20,575
Look, Cisco, I'm okay.

700
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:23,578
I thought coming down here
would undo me,

701
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,149
but thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

702
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:31,886
It just made me love him more.

703
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,426
Come on.

704
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,428
I need ice cream or a drink.

705
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,297
Let's see which one
we hit first.

706
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,041
Joe's gonna be okay.

707
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:01,850
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

708
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,219
A lot.

709
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,523
I miss her.

710
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:11,793
Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

711
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,997
A couple times.

712
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:17,699
Everyone was walking
before you.

713
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,868
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

714
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,503
not you.

715
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:22,770
But your mom was never worried.

716
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:25,039
She just said,
"he'll walk

717
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:29,611
when he has someplace to go."

718
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:32,647
And sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

719
00:39:32,649 --> 00:39:37,552
you moved so quick,
you didn't just walk,

720
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:38,554
you started...

721
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:42,190
To run.

722
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:45,894
And you ran to your mom,
Barry.

723
00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:49,364
Right into her arms.

724
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,537
You had someplace to go.

725
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,048
I thought being
the fastest man alive

726
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,117
would make my life easier--

727
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,286
that I could outrun anything.

728
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:17,125
Turns out,
no one can outrun pain.

729
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:18,793
Somebody help!
Please, somebody!

730
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:20,328
Life is tragic.

731
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,202
but it's also precious...

732
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:31,573
and sweet...

733
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:38,279
and extraordinary.

734
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:47,655
and the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

735
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:49,724
is to keep running.

736
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,512
Dr. Wells.

737
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:13,081
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.

738
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,449
He vented the system.

739
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:15,917
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

740
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:18,052
Good man.

741
00:41:18,054 --> 00:41:19,687
I'm on my way down.

742
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,794
See you soon, Barry.
