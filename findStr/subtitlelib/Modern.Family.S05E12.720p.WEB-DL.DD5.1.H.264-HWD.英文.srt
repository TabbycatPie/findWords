1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,690
Okay, everybody. Cake time!

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,180
Thank god. I really have to study.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,570
Oh, sweetheart, can't you just take a minute to enjoy it?

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,560
It's your birthday.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,810
You put too much pressure on yourself.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,500
I remember my sweet 16.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,800
I wanted a theme party.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,020
"Moonstruck" had just come out, but I hadn't, so --

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,440
No stories, no time --

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,230
S.A.T.s.

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,600
Here we go, everybody.

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,200
Wait, wait.

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,500
We all know why we're here.

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,870
- Ay, honey, you missed one. - I know!

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,220
I know I missed one! I'm not an idiot!

16
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,450
There! Happy?!

17
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,840
- You're being a little... - Obstreperous?!

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,480
Recalcitrant?! Truculent?!

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,030
I was gonna say "Cray-cray."

20
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,850
Alex, sweet...

21
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,050
I really need to focus!

22
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090
There is a 16-year-old science prodigy

23
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,270
studying cancer research at Johns Hopkins!

24
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,690
16! What am I doing?!

25
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm eating cake!

26
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,390
No, no, no.

27
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,990
Cake! Cake! Cake!

32
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,300
Alex might be a little bit fragile after last night,

33
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,480
so let's try to be sensitive.

34
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,930
Oh, believe me -- I am going to be

35
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,910
nothing but nice to Alex from now on.

36
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,370
If she snaps and goes on a rampage,

37
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,790
who do you think she's coming for first?

38
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,670
She's not going on a rampage.

39
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,370
I bet she'd let me live. She likes me.

40
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,020
I'm just gonna say it -- I never trusted her.

41
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,370
Oh, everybody just be normal.

42
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,450
We're gonna treat her exactly the way we usually do.

43
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,940
And there she is.

44
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,340
- Hi, pretty girl. - How'd you sleep?

45
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,620
- Fine. - Your hair looks super-soft, Al.

46
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,650
And is that a great new sweater? Love!

47
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,650
Dad, can you hand me the butter knife?

48
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,610
No!

49
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,590
Haley, Luke, upstairs, please.

50
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,640
Thank you.

51
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,300
Thanks.

52
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,010
So, about my meltdown.

53
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,200
- Who? - What meltdown?

54
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,290
I want to see a therapist. I did some research.

55
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,030
Dr. Gregory Clark -- highly recommended,

56
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,950
specializes in teenagers, and is covered by our insurance.

57
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,470
I booked a double session with him today.

58
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,960
And since you guys have the open house,

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,990
I will be taking the bus.

60
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,920
- Okay. - That sounds good.

61
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,490
She's like a self-cleaning oven.

62
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,350
Check it out.

63
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,590
I'm rockin' the old school for the open house today.

64
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm gonna put the "Fizz" back in "Phys Ed."

65
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,350
I love it -- all of it.

66
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,130
- Really? - Yeah.

67
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,360
Because I want to make a good impression today.

68
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,590
I want to be the teacher all the parents are talking about.

69
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,950
Well, that explains the socks.

70
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,930
What?

71
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,770
There's a caste system at school --

72
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,990
Academic teachers at the top, gym teachers at the bottom.

73
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,660
It's offensive and disrespectful.

74
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,360
They treat us like we're lunch ladies.

75
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,820
Hey, there, neighbor.

76
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,230
- It's Asher, right? - Yeah.

77
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,600
Um, I just wanted to let you know --

78
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,670
I think there might be something

79
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,520
- wrong with your air conditioner. - Oh, really?

80
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
Yeah, I mean, it just seems to be running a lot,

81
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,440
even when it's, uh, kind of cool outside.

82
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,720
No, no.

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
Um, my partner runs a little hot.

84
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,880
Not as hot as our planet.

85
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,000
Sorry. I don't mean to be that guy.

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,320
It's just, um, we're all in this together.

87
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,180
Yeah, I drive a Prius, so...

88
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,590
And that's a nice little gesture.

89
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,460
My car runs on reclaimed cooking oil.

90
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
I have some literature, if you want it.

91
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,340
That's okay. Save the paper.

92
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,070
I haven't printed anything since 2004.

93
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,800
I was gonna e-mail you.

94
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
On your power-hungry computer?

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,530
My entire house is solar-powered.

96
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,760
I sell energy back to the grid

97
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,560
and use that money to save polar bears.

98
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,900
I'm an environmental lawyer,

99
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,650
so, you know, I'm pretty green.

100
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,870
So is your lawn.

101
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,650
I went drought-tolerant --

102
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,820
Succulents, indigenous plants, rock garden.

103
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,510
My other daddy says your yard looks like a litter box.

104
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,920
She's a cute kid.

105
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,210
I remember when she was in disposable diapers.

106
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,290
Are you ready?

107
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,220
Yeah.

108
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,330
Why do you look like that when I look like this?

109
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,880
My friends say it's because of your money.

110
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,240
No, I'm just saying why is she all dressed up

111
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,160
for a school open house?

112
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,270
I want to impress Manny's history teacher.

113
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,630
I want Manny to go to Washington, D.C.

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
Yeah, Junior Congress.

115
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,850
Only one kid in the whole grade gets picked to go.

116
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,440
I think I can make a difference.

117
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,380
Regular Congress can't even make a difference.

118
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,780
Don't worry, Manny. I have it covered.

119
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,110
You just go and enjoy your date.

120
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,080
I have a date. It's no big deal.

121
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,260
D-don't make a whole thing about it.

122
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,330
What did I do with my car keys?

123
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,440
I mean, we're just friends now,

124
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,580
but I have a good feeling.

125
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,940
I know -- don't get ahead of myself.

126
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,250
Every time I put them down.

127
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,310
What is her name?

128
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,800
Either Zoe or Piper.

129
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,180
How can you be going on a date and you don't know her name?

130
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,420
This is where it gets interesting.

131
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,920
I seriously doubt that.

132
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,210
A few days ago, we almost let a girl come between us.

133
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
- Who is she? - The new girl.

134
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,690
- She's pretty. - Super-pretty.

135
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,550
Dibs.

136
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,400
What?! N-no. You can't call dibs.

137
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
She's a human being with feelings,

138
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,150
not the front seat.

139
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,980
Then a miracle happened.

140
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,080
Twins -- each as pretty as the other.

141
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,300
It's funny -- Luke and I don't usually

142
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,590
go for the same kind of girl.

143
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,320
Yeah. I like to describe my type as "Gettable".

144
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,950
What are you doing, Tucker?

145
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,620
Oh, hey, Principal Brown.

146
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,420
Do you know how other teachers drone on and on

147
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,160
to parents with their boring lectures?

148
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,460
Well, I thought I would go another way.

149
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,390
Oh. Well, I don't like the sound of that at all.

150
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,380
I think you will.

151
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,350
I'm gonna spice things up with a spirited game of dodgeball.

152
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,960
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

153
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,130
Okay, before you say "No"...

154
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,100
I already said "No."

155
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,460
...let me show you my whole bit.

156
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,620
Howdy, folks.

157
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,910
My name's Tucker.

158
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,130
I'm the Sheriff of Dodge...ball.

159
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,620
"Laugh, laugh, laugh."

160
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,230
And then --

161
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,080
No, no "then." No.

162
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,050
Have you seen the shape some of these folks are in?

163
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,730
We don't need a parent dropping dead in here.

164
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,400
Look, this is the "Dolphin Den."

165
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
I am not renaming it

166
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,570
the Harvey K. Mandelbaum memorial gym.

167
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,320
But I was gonna divide everybody up into

168
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,460
the Hatfield and McCoys.

169
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,850
Just no dodgeball.

170
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,690
Hello, Mr. Ingram.

171
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,280
I am Gloria Delgado-Pritchett,

172
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,250
Manny's mother.

173
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,480
Yes, of course.

174
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
I just wanted to thank you so much.

175
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,810
He thinks the world of you.

176
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,290
You know, as a child of an immigrant,

177
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,830
he can look at the world with such a fresh perspective.

178
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,440
And talking about fresh,

179
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
I brought you some empanadas.

180
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Subtle.

181
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,650
Hey, Phil. Where's Claire?

182
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,160
Oh, she's going to Alex's classes.

183
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm doing Luke's.

184
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
I'm surprised to see you here.

185
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,990
Isn't your team playing today?

186
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,410
Yeah. Gloria made me come.

187
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,780
I think I'm recording the game,

188
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,460
but, you know, you can never know.

189
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,780
The last time, I got six hours of Bravo.

190
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,820
And who knows?

191
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,320
Maybe Manny's going to be the first Latino President.

192
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,740
Hello, Mr. Ingram.

193
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,340
Dr. Donna Duncan,

194
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,730
Wesley's mom.

195
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,470
Just brought you a little thank-you

196
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,420
for being his absolute favorite teacher ever.

197
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,080
- Those cupcakes are so white. - Thank you.

198
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,500
Dr. Donna Duncan.

199
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,530
I'm Gloria.

200
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,010
We've met several times.

201
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,820
Oh, of course.

202
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,480
Mario's mom.

203
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,610
Manny.

204
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,170
And how is he fitting in now? Better?

205
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,180
Anyway...

206
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,050
Here she is.

207
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,340
You brought a flask to an open house?

208
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,780
You want some? It's Scotch.

209
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,710
No. Put it away.

210
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,110
Don't be such a goody-goody.

211
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,580
Taste it. It's older than you are.

212
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,840
- I don't want any scotch. - Well, just smell it.

213
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,220
- Fine. - Mr. Dunphy, is that a flask?

214
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,930
No. It is. It I--

215
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,270
Uh, I was -- it's his.

216
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,050
No, it's not.

217
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,910
For the record, no alcohol is allowed on school premises.

218
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,370
For god's sake, Phil,

219
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,150
it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

220
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,180
So, Alex, tell me why you're here.

221
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,590
I had a little meltdown last night,

222
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,470
and I'm afraid it'll happen again.

223
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,830
But, this time, in the middle of the S.A.T or something.

224
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,650
Why do you think you melted down?

225
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,060
I'm stressed.

226
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,450
It's my junior year.

227
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,530
Part of me feels like

228
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,330
the limbic system in my brain's a bit off.

229
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,450
That's a thing, right? I did some research.

230
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,840
You know I charge the same

231
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,700
even if you diagnose yourself?

232
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,710
I'm just trying to move this along.

233
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,180
I have a lot to do.

234
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,510
Well, uh, this is a process.

235
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,100
You know, it takes some time.

236
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,720
What -- what are you thinking?

237
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,820
- Nothing. - No, no. Go ahead. Tell me.

238
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
That maybe you're not up for this.

239
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,970
I mean, no offense.

240
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,420
You're just a lot older than you look on your website.

241
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,640
Did you even have S.A.T.s when you were in high school

242
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,000
or Asian kids?

243
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,270
Oh, no. no, no, no.

244
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,590
But there were other things I worried about --

245
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,830
Spanish inquisition,

246
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,440
sailing off the edge of the world,

247
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,640
learning how to understand fire.

248
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,040
Sorry.

249
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,120
- You mind if we try something? - What?

250
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,600
Just do me a favor.

251
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,640
Take a deep breath.

252
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,200
Great.

253
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,670
Now... what's on your mind?

254
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,710
Well... I just remembered that I forgot

255
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,540
to charge my computer before I left

256
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,450
and that I have to get new index cards before Monday.

257
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,900
Hopefully they don't run out of the blue ones,

258
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,460
because, for some reason, those help me study better.

259
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,060
Maybe it's because they're easier to read

260
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,350
or maybe my prescription's getting worse.

261
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,050
I should probably make an appointment with the eye doctor.

262
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,600
Also, should I get a job this summer

263
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,510
or would an internship look better on my application?

264
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,160
And what is up with Hillary?

265
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,650
Is she going to run or not?

266
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,260
I mean, I feel like she'd totally understand

267
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,700
the feeling of being overwhelmed,

268
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,450
but also like you're not doing enough at the same time.

269
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,800
Hey, Nina, how's Sanjay?

270
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,050
Oh, great. Thanks.

271
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,300
He's just dealing with the S.A.T.s and the A.C.T.s.

272
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,830
And that merit scholarship application

273
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,970
everyone's so stressed about.

274
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,660
What -- what application?

275
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,120
Let's begin by talking about the A.P. Physics test,

276
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,190
which, as you know, takes place on...

277
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,800
May 21st.

278
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,310
With Luke and Haley,

279
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm on top of everything because they aren't.

280
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,960
But Alex is so self-sufficient,

281
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,930
I just sort of put it in cruise control.

282
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,450
I've fallen asleep at the wheel,

283
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,460
and now my little genius is covered in cake.

284
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,640
Now, a list of practice tests I recommend

285
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,280
the students take before then

286
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,240
3a, 4c, 12a through "f,"

287
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,710
18d, 19a, 23c,

288
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,060
24g, 25h, 26a...

289
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,340
Meanwhile, a great artist like Bob Dylan

290
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,710
would get voted off in the first round, which --

291
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,180
If you wet the end,

292
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,640
it will stick to his face.

293
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
You're a genius.

294
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,330
Piper, that's rude.

295
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,740
You know, Manny, in chorus,

296
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,310
we sing "Blowin' in the wind."

297
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,810
Now that's blowin' in the wind.

298
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,760
You're funny, Luke.

299
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,570
Manny and I need to use the restroom.

300
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,510
We do?

301
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,140
You've got to switch with me.

302
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,720
What? No, we can't do that.

303
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,650
They're twins. They'll never notice.

304
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,860
You realize we're not twins, right?

305
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,460
Special dollhouse delivery for Lily!

306
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,750
It's here, it's here!

307
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,220
I think you're going to love it.

308
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,450
I spent so many hours playing with this when I was your age.

309
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,750
Yeah, me too.

310
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,950
Hey, quick, turn off your car.

311
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,440
Why? It's in park, I think.

312
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
I have a judgey green neighbor.

313
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,990
He had the nerve to come over here

314
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,300
and tell me that I'm not green enough.

315
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
Shut up! You're super-green.

316
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,600
Thank you. I'm -- I'm recycling a dollhouse.

317
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,270
I even recycled a child.

318
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,120
- Didn't you win some award? - Yes, yes.

319
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,010
The state bar association award for sustained excellence

320
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,950
in the field of environmental...

321
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,910
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one.

322
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,510
...law. There was one word left.

323
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,590
You didn't have to cut me off.

324
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,690
Dollhouse, please.

325
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,300
Okay. Yeah, in a minute.

326
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,210
You know what you should do?

327
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,350
March right over there

328
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,970
and wave that trophy in his stupid eco face.

329
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,440
No. You think?

330
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,450
Yes. Those people are so annoying.

331
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,330
There's this girl at my school

332
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,080
who was all over me about my boots 'cause they're leather.

333
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
Meanwhile, she's wearing Crocs,

334
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,100
like those aren't endangered.

335
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,720
You know what? I am gonna do that.

336
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,830
Show him to out-green me.

337
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,860
- Okay. Oh, no. - Oh, no.

338
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,320
All right, those are blowing into his yard.

339
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,930
That is -- okay, that's definitely gonna hurt my case.

340
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,600
Uh, you pick these up.

341
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,470
I'm gonna go get the trophy. Lily, help her.

342
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,770
I heard that "recycled child" comment.

343
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,090
Thanks to your little flask,

344
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,660
now the teacher thinks I'm a burnout.

345
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,090
Football game.

346
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,840
Football game!

347
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
- What are you doing? - You can do this now.

348
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,530
I saw it in a commercial.

349
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,160
Not with that phone.

350
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,950
You might as well say it into your wallet.

351
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,920
Come on. We're gonna be late for math.

352
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm not going to any more boring classes.

353
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,770
You're just gonna cut?

354
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,670
No,I'm just not gonna go because I'm in my 60s.

355
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,340
Teacher's lounge.

356
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,740
They got a TV in here.

357
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,510
- We can't go in the teacher's lounge. - Why not?

358
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,950
- Um, it's for teachers only. - You're a teacher.

359
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,320
Right now, you're teaching me how to be a little bitch.

360
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,960
Jay, don't. Jay.

361
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,060
Jay!

362
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,280
So, when do you think you'll be making your decision?

363
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,370
Oh, sometime in the next week or so.

364
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,300
Oh, take your time. It would be rude to rush you.

365
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,040
Not as rude as interrupting two people

366
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
in the middle of a conversation.

367
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,950
Well, actually, I'll go.

368
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,630
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

369
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,010
Good idea because those cupcakes look very dry.

370
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,950
Okay. This is unbelievable.

371
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,130
They just gave me four books on applying to top colleges.

372
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,310
When am I gonna have time to read all this?

373
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,120
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

374
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,210
I didn't see you there. Come on, girls.

375
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,090
Oh, she's so mean.

376
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,170
- Everybody sees me. - Who was that?

377
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,610
Dr. Dooda Dada.

378
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,390
She thinks that she can flirt her son all the way to Washington,

379
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,980
but I'm gonna take her down.

380
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,580
I would love to chat, but I got to get to A.P. Calc.

381
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,250
Physical education is a critical part of every school day.

382
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,270
As we develop the mind, so we must the body.

383
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,550
This begins with good nutrition, uh, physical activity,

384
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,280
sportsmanship, and attention to personal hygiene.

385
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,520
No, please, please, please don't go.

386
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,690
I know this is boring, but this isn't my idea.

387
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,260
I wanted to play a spirited game of dodgeball, but --

388
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,750
That sounds fun. I'll play dodgeball.

389
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,950
I'll play, too.

390
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,480
Anything's got to be better than this.

391
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,460
Oh, well, you know what?

392
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,180
We're really not supposed to, but you know what?

393
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,410
Hey, guys, listen to this. My name's Cam.

394
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm the sheriff of Dodge...ball.

395
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,310
Okay, you guys are the Hatfields.

396
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,790
You are the McCoys.

397
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,440
Mr. Mandelbaum, I'd like you to stay seated.

398
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,940
You're gonna be our referee.

399
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,200
All right, everybody, let's dodgeball!

400
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,150
Dodgeball was a smash.

401
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,500
Dr. Donna and Gloria were like two assassins

402
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,540
just picking off their victims one by one.

403
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,470
Okay, last two dodgeballers.

404
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,710
Are you ready?

405
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,870
Yes.

406
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,480
Are you ready?

407
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,800
Yes!

408
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,500
Oh, I'm so sorry.

409
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,050
I'm going to kill you!

410
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,850
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, don't!

411
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,610
Ow! My eye! I don't understand you!

412
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,660
So, you like theater,

413
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,030
and you just put this fake thumb in our fries.

414
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,010
Yep.

415
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,150
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

416
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,600
and say we're with the wrong people.

417
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,230
Let's just switch dates and get this party started.

418
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
What? We don't want to switch.

419
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
Yeah. I'm not attracted to you.

420
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,160
And I'm not attracted to you.

421
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,050
Wait a minute.

422
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,500
We like all the same things, but you don't think I'm cute?

423
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,380
I've got a thing for Latin men.

424
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,840
I like 'em dumb.

425
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,490
- Ugh. Well, that's just offensive. - And shallow.

426
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,820
Just because we're guys doesn't mean we don't have feelings.

427
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,920
Yeah. I don't feel good about this.

428
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,250
It makes me feel...

429
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,460
bad.

430
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,190
Come on, Luke. Let's get out of here.

431
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,300
Our parents aren't home.

432
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,430
If you want, we'll make out with you.

433
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,570
I'm not proud of what happened next.

434
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,500
I am.

435
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,520
He's not home.

436
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,480
How's the cleanup going?

437
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,570
Well, I think I got most of them.

438
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,340
You've been at this a while.

439
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,000
How come you only have like eight peanuts?

440
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,470
Instead of carrying them around,

441
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,930
I made a huge pile right over th--

442
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,140
- Again?! - Geez. They're everywhere.

443
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,050
Oh, god. No! Bird!

444
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,340
Aah! Oh, no!

445
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,450
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

446
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,190
Oh, no! What is that smell?!

447
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,290
It smells like french fries!

448
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,650
It's biodiesel. Can you plug it up?

449
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,540
- Oh, what? With what? Popcorn? - Oh, geez. Oh, god.

450
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,710
No! My boots! This is a disaster!

451
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,800
Save the seals!

452
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,310
What -- what -- what -- what the hell?

453
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,020
What did you do?

454
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,930
Uh, I won a green award.

455
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,460
That's what.

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,590
You think you can get this thing to work?

457
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,730
Hey, you're supposed to be the lookout.

458
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,690
What if somebody walks in?

459
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,420
Gee, they'll call my parents.

460
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,420
Hey! Look! You did it!

461
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,780
Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

462
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,960
Listen, I'm gonna get back to class.

463
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,930
Before you go, let me ask you a question.

464
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,220
How do you know how to do all this stuff?

465
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,140
Back in high school, I was in the A.V. Club.

466
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,820
We did all kinds of crazy things.

467
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,770
One year, we hid a microphone in the gym.

468
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,440
We could totally hear everything that was going on at prom.

469
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,330
I used to make fun of guys like you.

470
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,470
This is pretty cool.

471
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Really?

472
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,190
You think this is cool...

473
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,300
First down! All right.

474
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,450
Best open house ever.

475
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,360
It's all gravy when you're in the A.V.

476
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,500
Admit it -- doesn't it feel good

477
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
to break a few rules,

478
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,320
take a walk on the wild side?

479
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,660
- You're welcome. - No, you're welcome.

480
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm the one who set this whole thing up.

481
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,070
Let's just say we make a good team.

482
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,360
To us.

483
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,160
There he goes. There he goes.

484
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,310
Come on, come on! Come on!

485
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,110
Come on! Yeah!

486
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,600
I've been like this for as long as I can remember.

487
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,470
Can you give me an example?

488
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,400
Well, when I was little,

489
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,970
I was in a spelling team at school

490
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,880
and I really wanted to win.

491
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,210
I don't know why. There was no prize.

492
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,520
No one cared.

493
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,750
My parents didn't even know I was in it.

494
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,500
I just felt this weight on my shoulders,

495
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,510
like if I lost, I'd...I don't know.

496
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,480
- I just had to win. - And did you?

497
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,850
Yep. Know what the winning word was?

498
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,700
Responsibility.

499
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,430
Is that what you feel?

500
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,790
A responsibility to win all the time?

501
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,600
To always be the best?

502
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,320
That's one way to put it.

503
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,520
And this responsibility -- where does it come from?

504
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,940
I'm not sure. It's just...there.

505
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,450
So it's an internal pressure.

506
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,490
Kind of.

507
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,870
I mean, once you start overachieving,

508
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,570
people expect things from you.

509
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,800
Like what people?

510
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,990
You know, the world...

511
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,000
Teachers, parents, other kids.

512
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,030
It's not all internal.

513
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,700
Don't get me wrong.

514
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,390
I like the way I'm wired.

515
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,260
It's what's going to get me into a good school.

516
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,110
It's what makes me who I am.

517
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,760
And how is that -- being who you are?

518
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,940
I don't know.

519
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,270
Mostly good.

520
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,230
A little exhausting.

521
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,700
Sometimes hard.

522
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,910
I guess there's your answer.

523
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,550
It's hard being me.

524
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,700
Tell me a little more about your family.

525
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,770
They're pretty normal, I guess.

526
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,330
I'm not like any of them,

527
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,240
- But that doesn't really bother me. - Ever?

528
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,490
Only when they say things like "Alex, you study too much"

529
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,840
or "Don't freak out" or "Go do something fun."

530
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,820
So, your siblings--

531
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,030
they don't experience the same pressures you do.

532
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,770
Oh, god, no. They don't care about school.

533
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,170
Hmm. Why do you think that is?

534
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,810
I mean, you all grew up in the same house

535
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,470
with the same parents, yet you're the only one

536
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,450
who feels this enormous pressure

537
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,320
to achieve at such a high level.

538
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
Why do we even have to talk about my family?

539
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,990
They don't have anything to do with this.

540
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
They don't get me.

541
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,710
How's that feel?

542
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,070
- I don't know. - You're a smart girl.

543
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,610
- Try a little harder. - I said I don't know.

544
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,110
I feel...

545
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,560
kind of alone.

546
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,320
I realize our juniors are busy with SATs, so as a rule,

547
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,580
I only give two hours of homework a night.

548
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,030
- Two hours? - Our students are highly advanced.

549
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,280
It's nothing they can't handle.

550
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,970
You know, I'm-- I'm sure they can.

551
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,710
It's just that if they have two hours in this class

552
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,720
and they have an hour for A.P. Bio

553
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
and an hour and a half for, um, advanced lit

554
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,010
and-- hang on one second.

555
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,540
Let me just do this on the board,

556
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,090
'cause then it's-- um, we got 2 and 1 and 1.5

557
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,930
and then another, uh, hour and a half

558
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,920
for A.P. History-- gives us...

559
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,240
- It's 6. - Yes!

560
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,410
Nina, I was getting there.

561
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,640
Thank you! Thank you so much!

562
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,920
If I could just have a second to think

563
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
without all the tippy-tappy typing.

564
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,160
6.

565
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,700
Well, I hope you're happy.

566
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,410
You've ruined dodgeball for everyone.

567
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,300
She was the one who threw that ball in my face.

568
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,540
Only because you threw yourself at Mr. Ingram.

569
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,590
Okay, ladies, please.

570
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,660
Can't you see what's going on here?

571
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,700
You both just want what's best for your kids.

572
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,530
I need to get this trip for Wesley.

573
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,290
I'm tired of him being so mad at me all the time.

574
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,270
Why is he mad?

575
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,100
Oh, he blames me for the divorce.

576
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,990
His father will always be the hero.

577
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,190
It's hard to blame someone who's never there.

578
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,950
Now, can't you relate to that?

579
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,270
It will get better.

580
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,610
Kids always figure out who's really there for them.

581
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,150
Again, we're very sorry about the projector.

582
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,940
I'll send a check on Monday.

583
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
- Hi, honey. - I got in trouble.

584
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,350
Whatever she did, add it to my tab.

585
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,790
- All right, let's do this. - No. No, no, no.

586
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,650
Not you two, just you. Come on, sheriff.

587
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,220
Oh, hey, honey. How did it go?

588
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,140
Good. And I made another session for next week.

589
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,020
How was the open house?

590
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,630
Wow. So intense.

591
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,530
I had no idea the kind of pressure you're under.

592
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,600
Honey, I was just you for two hours.

593
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,820
I could barely hold it together.

594
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,760
I don't know how you don't have a meltdown every day.

595
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
- I... - Oh, honey.

596
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,560
Sweetie, what? Did I say something?

597
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,520
Yes.

598
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,830
Thank you.

599
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,420
Okay.

600
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,960
Okay.

601
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,210
Okay.

602
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,290
Again, I am so sorry.

603
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,040
I-I guess, in retrospect, it was a little crazy

604
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,350
that I wanted to show you my state bar association award.

605
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,260
Stop.

606
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,370
And it's possible I come on a little too strong.

607
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,810
No. No, no.

608
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,480
I like to think that I'm greener than I am,

609
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,170
but maybe I just want the credit

610
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,850
without doing all the hard work that you do.

611
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,230
Well, you're right-- it is hard,

612
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,960
but, you know, it's also alienating.

613
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,610
You know, no one wants to be friends with me.

614
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,120
I-I can't tell you the last time

615
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,550
I had people over for dinner,

616
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,750
which is probably a good thing.

617
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,690
You know, with solar power,

618
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,520
it takes four days to roast a chicken.

619
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,010
- Really? - If you want it cooked all the way through, yeah.

620
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,890
You know I had salmonella three times?

621
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,830
If you want to come over to our house for dinner,

622
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,830
- we kind of owe you. - You can play with my dollhouse.

623
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,840
Yeah?

624
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,960
Does it made from sustainable materials?

625
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
Forget it.
