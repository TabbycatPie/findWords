00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:24,550
Oh, okay. I'm gonna call him. Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,335
You really want me to call The Flash?

180
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,504
I need his help too.

181
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,892
My brother's been kidnapped.

182
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,680
All right, so you really want us

183
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:42,051
to just believe that
Captain Cold was kidnapped?

184
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,936
- I saw it happen.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,404
Last night, Lenny, me, and Mick

186
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,772
were knocking over the cashier's cage

187
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,107
at Central City Racetrack.

188
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,326
Does it physically pain your family

189
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,744
not to rob people?

190
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,829
I never finished the job.

191
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,698
After Mick torched
through the side entrance,

192
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,533
I looked back for Lenny
and saw him getting thrown

193
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:58,868
into the back of a van.

194
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,536
And why didn't you and Mick follow?

195
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:02,088
I would have.

196
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,507
Someone hit me from
behind and knocked me out.

197
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,125
When I came to, Lenny was gone,

198
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,843
and Mick already made off with the cash.

199
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,628
How do we know this isn't
some kind of a trap?

200
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,097
If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

201
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,748
he would have let Mardon,
Simmons, and Bivolo

202
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,433
take that honor, remember?

203
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,185
- Yeah, I remember.
- Good.

204
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,420
Then you'll also recall
that you owe Lenny a favor

205
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,889
for saving your life.

206
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,591
Time to make good on that debt, Flash.

207
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:24,426
I do not like her.

208
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,697
Yeah, but she makes a point.

209
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,649
What? We should at least hear her out.

210
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,401
Right?

211
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,269
Even if I wanted to help,
how are we supposed to find him?

212
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:35,454
Not a problem.

213
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,106
See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

214
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn't have time to
place a tracker on it,

215
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,825
so I devised a method of locating it

216
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,211
by borrowing some military technology.

217
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,796
See, the gun works the
same as thermal imaging,

218
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,498
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

219
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,250
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

220
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:49,885
Whoa, look at that.

221
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,338
The gun's UV thermal
reading was last picked up

222
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,523
at 5th and Hoyt eight minutes ago.

223
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,093
All right. Let's see if you're a liar.

224
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,071
Snart.

225
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,740
Barry.

226
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,775
Are you okay?

227
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,410
Peachy.

228
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,911
Okay.

229
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:19,031
Uh, I'm supposed to be here to rescue you.

230
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,616
That's not necessary.

231
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,318
You can speed along now.

232
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,588
Look, Snart, if these guys
are making you do this...

233
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,322
No one makes me do anything.

234
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,542
Then why does your sister
think you've been kidnapped?

235
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,460
[thud]

236
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:35,181
[yelps]

237
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,766
What's taking so long?

238
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,050
I got held up.

239
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,336
Always the excuse with you.

240
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,306
Look at that.

241
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,108
I didn't think you had it in you, son.

242
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,943
Thanks, Dad.

243
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:50,229
[Flash groans]

244
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,448
Come on.

245
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,899
We're behind schedule.

246
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:58,520
You know what they say.
"Live fast, die young."

247
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,457
<i>Talk to me. What's going on?</i>

248
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,076
Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun.

249
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,411
His vitals are bottoming out!

250
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,298
I'm bringing the heat right now.

251
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,386
What? [sighs]

252
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:16,672
The suit. What's happening?

253
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,207
Therma-threading, baby.

254
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,425
It's a little something I added

255
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,727
for situations exactly like this one.

256
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:25,514
[grunts]

257
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,569
Please, please tell me it's working.

258
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,824
Yeah, it works, but Snart's gone,

259
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:37,827
and Lisa has a lot of explaining to do.

260
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,737
So your brother was not kidnapped.

261
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:47,640
He was pulling a job with your father.

262
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:51,327
What? No, Lenny would never do that.

263
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,146
Oh, just like he would never

264
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,014
try and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

265
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,651
Are you sure it was my dad?

266
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,487
- That's him.
- Lewis Snart.

267
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,873
Convicted of larceny, armed robbery,

268
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,376
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.

269
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,962
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

270
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,680
He's a bad guy.

271
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:13,850
You and your entire family are criminals.

272
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:16,603
Why should we trust anything you say?

273
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,511
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.

274
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:27,697
I got it being a daughter.

275
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,540
Let me go. I got this.

276
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,131
I see you found my hiding spot.

277
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,133
This is usually where I come

278
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:51,004
to, you know, get away.

279
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,876
First time my father came after me,

280
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:59,178
I was seven.

281
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,049
Second time, I was eight.

282
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,518
That's when I learned
that a bottle hurts worse

283
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,820
than a fist.

284
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,559
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

285
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,280
I must have been a slow learner,

286
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:21,034
because the lessons never stopped.

287
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:32,428
I'm sorry, Lisa.

288
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,682
Lenny practically raised me.

289
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:36,933
If it weren't for him,

290
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,936
I would have turned out a lot worse.

291
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:42,922
I know, how could I be any worse?

292
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,891
[chuckles] I didn't say that.

293
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:48,094
You didn't have to.

294
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:51,114
But believe me, there is worse.

295
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:54,117
And, look, he may be a jerk brother,

296
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,536
but he's the only jerk brother I've got.

297
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,941
He protected me.

298
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,961
Now it's my turn.

299
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,829
If he's with my dad,

300
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,583
he is in serious trouble.

301
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:12,919
Please.

302
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,287
You've gotta find out what's going on.

303
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:29,068
Hey, baby.

304
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,486
Dad! [laughs]

305
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,654
What are you doing here?

306
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,855
Came to check in

307
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,640
on my favorite crime-fighting reporter.

308
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:35,658
Dad!

309
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,027
[laughs]

310
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,196
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

311
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,664
Hey, Iris.

312
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,149
Editorial needs your photos and story ASAP.

313
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,700
Congratulations, Detective.

314
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:48,538
Your daughter's exposé
just made the front page.

315
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,757
What?

316
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,375
I am so happy for you.

317
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,544
A little bit jealous, but I'll get over it.

318
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,328
Thanks, Linda. I got lucky.

319
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,047
No, she's being modest.

320
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,966
Your daughter's a serious badass.

321
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,051
You don't have to tell me.

322
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,353
Well, better let you get back to work.

323
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:05,638
Wait, there was something that you wanted

324
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,889
to talk to me about, right?

325
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,142
Later, it can wait. Go be fabulous.

326
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,110
[chuckles] Okay.

327
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,649
<i>♪ Oh, shame, children, shame ♪</i>

328
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:20,570
<i>♪ There in your bed... ♪</i>

329
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:24,123
Back from the dead so soon, Barry?

330
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,375
Pass me the salt.

331
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,880
Don't spill. It's bad luck.

332
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,886
Why are you working with Lewis?

333
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:39,205
Lisa told us you hate him.

334
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:43,042
Things are...

335
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:45,561
complicated with family,

336
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,214
as you know with your own parents, hmm?

337
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,683
Tell me what's going on.

338
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,268
Let me help you.

339
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,603
Don't waste your time trying to save people

340
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,271
who don't want to be saved.

341
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,024
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just about you, all right?

342
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,826
I'm betting whatever you two are up to,

343
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,277
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

344
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,829
Don't worry, I remember our deal.

345
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:06,833
You leave me alone, I
make sure no one dies.

346
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,584
All right.

347
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:11,403
You're a criminal, Snart,

348
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,872
but you live by a code.

349
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,406
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't,

350
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:18,544
like he won't care if people die.

351
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:22,682
That's why I can't leave this alone.

352
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:26,418
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

353
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,754
I don't care.

354
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:32,058
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

355
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,530
We'll see about that.

356
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,901
Thanks for dinner.

357
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,874
Mm-hmm.

360
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,499
Iris' mom is alive.

361
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:59,451
I lied to Iris, you, everybody.

362
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,421
Why?

363
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,056
I felt like I didn't have a choice.

364
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:08,010
Francine did so many things wrong.

365
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,430
Just about everything.

366
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:12,932
I don't know.

367
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:16,769
Now I feel like my one
wrong might be worse.

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,474
Look, Joe.

369
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:25,978
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

370
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,115
and I know that you
always have a good reason

371
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,366
for the decisions you make.

372
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,818
And obviously, you were worried

373
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,503
that Iris would go down the wrong path

374
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,122
if Francine raised her.

375
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:37,623
Look at Snart.

376
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,992
He's a criminal because
he had Lewis for a father.

377
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:40,960
That could have been me.

378
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,428
Oh, come on. Never.

379
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,097
Yeah, because I had you.

380
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,665
And so did Iris.

381
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,604
You just gotta trust in
that and tell her the truth.

382
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,639
Yeah, how do I do that without hurting her?

383
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,891
She's not a little girl anymore.

384
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,177
You should have seen her
in action the other day,

385
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,646
putting her neck on the line for a story.

386
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,481
She can handle anything that comes her way.

387
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,317
I just lied to her for so long,

388
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,286
I'm scared she's not gonna
understand or forgive me.

389
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:08,955
I could lose her.

390
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:12,491
No, she's gonna forgive you.

391
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:15,711
You just gotta give her a chance.

392
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:20,916
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

393
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,752
We make our move at 9:00.

394
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:24,637
That's when the cleaning crews go in

395
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,305
and the daytime shift leaves.

396
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,540
Now we'll go up in the service elevator

397
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,376
to the 27th floor.

398
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,011
They got a two-man team of armed guards

399
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,680
working the 27th through 29th floor,

400
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,548
but if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

401
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,317
we should be able to get in and out.

402
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,935
And if the timing doesn't work out?

403
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,487
Then those guards don't make it home.

404
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:42,989
But if we start on the top floor,

405
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,390
there's a service elevator that will...

406
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:45,992
Son, you and I both know

407
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:48,744
that there's casualties
in this line of work.

408
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:54,166
Rutenberg, you're the tech guy.

409
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,369
Did you find a solution
for the vault hallway?

410
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,070
Not yet.

411
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,872
That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

412
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:01,707
[chuckles]

413
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,909
Fine. How about you?

414
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:07,079
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

415
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:08,464
gonna look after the power source

416
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:09,882
for the laser grid?

417
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,218
It's a cold gun, and yes,

418
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,020
but I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

419
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,472
That gun is the only reason you're here,

420
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,641

Oh! My head! Aah!

00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,700

[small explosion]

426
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,461
Nobody talks to my son that way.

427
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,879
Nobody.

428
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:51,250
Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

429
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,135
Okay, I may have done a
quick preliminary assessment

430
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:54,470
of my own.

431
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:56,138
Something is definitely weird.

432
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:00,926
- Oh.
- Decapitation.

433
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,678
- Yeah.
- Yikes.

434
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,313
We're still recovering parts
of the head, so the ID

435
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,714
is taking a little longer than normal.

436
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,182
Aah! Ugh.

437
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,435
Sorry, I thought I stepped on an ear.

438
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,887
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

439
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,073
- Oh, hell no.
- [chuckles]

440
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,824
Doesn't look like the head was sliced off

441
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:17,276
with any weapon I'm familiar with,

442
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:18,861
and I'm familiar with most weapons.

443
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,362
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:22,531
Perforation around the
neck... it's too jagged.

445
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,283
It's almost like the head was blown off.

446
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,786
Like a meta-human who
can explode heads, right?

447
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,705
Not necessarily.

448
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,426
[beeps]

449
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:35,594
Traces of thermite.

450
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,245
- Bomb residue?
- Uh-huh.

451
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,014
But then why wasn't the rest
of the body blown apart?

452
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:41,760
- I don't know.
- The victim is David Rutenberg,

453
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,479
security systems expert,
and guess who's on his list

454
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,197
- of known associates.
- Hmm?

455
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,949
- Lewis Snart.
- Lewis Snart.

456
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:51,568
Isn't he related to Leonard
Snart, aka Captain Cold?

457
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,537
- Please don't call him that.
- Okay.

458
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,238
- Uh, one second.
- Sure.

459
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,607
Come here. I think this guy
is part of Snart's crew.

460
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,110
So Snart put a bomb in
him to keep him in line?

461
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:04,280
No, Snart wouldn't do that,
but his father would.

462
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,782
So Lewis is killing people,

463
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,000
and Snart's still working with him?

464
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:08,335
What happened with the deal you had?

465
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,003
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

466
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,923
So you think Lewis put
a bomb in his own son

467
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,424
to force him to pull off a heist?

468
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:16,126
Snart still wouldn't do it.

469
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:17,761
He'd dig the bomb out of
his own head if he had to.

470
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,296
So it must be something
else that Snart cares about.

471
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:25,235
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

472
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,908
- Hey.
- Hey.

473
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,410
Thought you might be hungry.

474
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,445
Ah, good to know whatever Earth you go to,

475
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,647
there's always a Big Belly Burger.

476
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,082
Thank you very much.

477
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,750
Looks like you're making progress.

478
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:44,287
Slowly.
Should be able to do this a lot faster.

479
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,922
You miss it, your speed?

480
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,925
Yeah. Surprising how much.

481
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,711
So what will you do when
you go back to your Earth?

482
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,296
I don't know.

483
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:56,433
Guess I'll just have to
get used to being...

484
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,768
Normal?

485
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,854
[chuckles] Yeah.

486
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,442
Two years ago, I was just a scientist

487
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,677
slowly trying to save the
world by purifying heavy water

488
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,446
without residual radiation.

489
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,647
Important work.

490
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,066
Yeah, it was,

491
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,035
but after the Particle
Accelerator exploded,

492
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:17,204
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life,

493
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:18,622
I could save one before breakfast.

494
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:21,124
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

495
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,577
There's nothing like that rush.

496
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,546
You guys have been fighting so
many battles, one after another,

497
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:29,966
I'm not sure Barry's had
time to take it in,

498
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:33,203
to appreciate how great it can feel.

499
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:37,474
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

500
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:40,010
It's about helping however you can,

501
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:42,929
wherever you're needed most.

502
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:46,850
I think that Jay Garrick,
physicist, has just as much

503
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,736
to contribute as Jay Garrick, superhero.

504
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,387
Maybe more.

505
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:57,661
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

506
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:00,413
- Hmm?
- An extra set of hands.

507
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:03,566
Specifically ones with
a surgeon's precision.

508
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,568
Me?

509
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,403
Sure, if you think I can really help.

510
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:08,738
<i>Hey, Caitlin?</i>

511
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,341
We need you up here, like, right now.

512
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,260
Sorry.

Oh, boy.

00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,887
What is it?

516
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,357
Lisa,
there are traces of thermite on your skin.

517
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,392
Thermite?

518
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:30,727
Like an explosive?

519
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,979
Not <i>like</i> an explosive.

520
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,449
It's a bomb.

521
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,451
When you were knocked out,

522
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,705
your dad must have injected you with it.

523
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,748
Hey, Dad, what's up?

524
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,552
Your message was pretty
cryptic, even for you.

525
00:22:58,723 --> 00:23:02,458
Hey, baby, I need you to sit down.

526
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:07,264
Dad, what's going on?

527
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,602
Okay.

528
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,856
When I was still a beat cop,

529
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,409
me and my partner were on patrol,

530
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,662
and dispatch came on the radio.

531
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:25,031
A little girl had called in.

532
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:29,252
She said her mom had taken some pills

533
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,671
and she wouldn't wake up.

534
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:35,258
And the little girl gave the address.

535
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,660
The address was mine.

536
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:43,600
By the time I got here,
your mother was unresponsive.

537
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,835
Passed out on the couch.

538
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:49,723
And in the kitchen, the stove was on.

539
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:51,608
There you were, standing in front

540
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,443
of an open flame.

541
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:54,944
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

542
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:59,115
- Wait, my mom...
- Your mom was a drug addict.

543
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:01,684
This wasn't the first time

544
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,871
something like that had happened.

545
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,524
I got Francine into another rehab,

546
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:11,861
and a couple days later,

547
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:14,464
she was gone.

548
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:18,918
I looked everywhere for her,
but wife of a cop,

549
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,137
she knew how to disappear.

550
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,089
I couldn't stand...

551
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:26,393
the thought of you growing up

552
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,877
thinking you were abandoned.

553
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,596
Going to sleep at night thinking

554
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,098
your mother left because you weren't enough

555
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,850
to make her stay, that you weren't loved,

556
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,569
because I loved you.

557
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:41,858
I loved you with everything I got.

558
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,411
Then we took Barry in,

559
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,696
and I saw the trauma he
was going through and I...

560
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,331
I was sure.

561
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,867
I was sure...

562
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,036
that I did the right thing.

563
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,587
Not giving you that burden.

564
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,006
What do you mean "Mom left"?

565
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,242
I...

566
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,677
I don't... I don't understand.

567
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,213
I don't understand. What
are you telling me?

568
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:06,883
Your mother's alive.

569
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,585
She's here in Central City.

570
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,604
She wants to see you.

571
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:18,278
All these years, I thought...

572
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,098
Daddy, you told me that my...

573
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,268
I know.

574
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,769
I should have told you sooner,

575
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:30,490
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

576
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,710
The mother you thought you remember...

577
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,112
the perfect mother and the
stories I made up for you...

578
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,748
that is the mother you deserve,
and I knew Francine

579
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,967
couldn't be like that.

580
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,752
She would only break your heart.

581
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,308
I'm so sorry.

582
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,631

584
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:03,406
It's okay. I understand.

585
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,442
You were just trying to keep me safe.

00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,152
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,

590
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,853
I can surgically excise it.

591
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:24,438
Put the magnet down!

592
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,140
This is a really concentrated bomb.

593
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:27,725
It's gonna combust if it's exposed

597
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:38,636
Uh, the bomb will explode if
it comes in contact with air.

598
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,037
Don't worry, Lisa.

599

We're gonna find another way to get it out.

What if Flash speed extracts it?

602
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:47,745
Nope, it's too risky.

603
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:50,257
I'm gonna find a way to get it out.
I just need a little time.

604
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,376
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

until you figure out how
to disarm the bomb.

606
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,381
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next and when.

607
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,633
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

608
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,885
Their tech guy is dead,
so I'm betting they're

609
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,104
gonna need a new one.

610
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:05,889
I'm saying I'm gonna
infiltrate Lewis' crew.

can crack a Draycon keypad?

Uh, kind of in the middle

721

All right, we need that bomb out.

Do not bet! Give me a minute.

Shoot him, son.

see your sister alive.

He broke my sister's heart.

- I was visiting my Dad.
- Yeah, me too.

752
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,247
- And yet you killed him.
- He deserved it.

- Is that funny to you?
- No.

754
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:23,355
What's funny is I finally
figured out your secret.

755
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,473
And what secret would that be?

756
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:28,660

Well, I know your secret too.

And you don't have to admit it to me,

you don't have to let your past define you.

So I should be a hero like you, Barry?

What exactly does that pay again?

769
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,731
It's just a matter of time.

I know, we should just make
a schedule or something.

Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have,

793

you know, my people call your people.

- Yes, it is.
