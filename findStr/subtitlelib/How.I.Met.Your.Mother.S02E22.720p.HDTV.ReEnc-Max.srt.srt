1
00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:03,374
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:08,584
Mr. and Marshall Eriksen
and Lily Aldrin.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,700
Does it make you kind of sad that
we don't share the same last name?

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,660
You know, in a totally evolved
21st-century kind of way,

5
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:23,102
yeah, a little.

6
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:24,992
You know what we should do?

7
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,412
We should come up with
a whole new last name.

8
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,805
Oh, that's easy--
Lily and Marshall Skywalker.

9
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,649
Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.

10
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,067
I got it. You ready?

11
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:37,025
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,379
Lily and Marshall Awesome.

13
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:41,545
Have you met the Awesomes?

14
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:44,887
Marshall, Lily, their son,
Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?

15
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,472
I love you, Mr. Awesome.

16
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,375
I love you, Mrs. Awesome.

17
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:54,287
- So...
- So...

18
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:55,688
Wedding's over.

19
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,046
Yes, it is.

20
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:59,398
I guess starting tomorrow,

21
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:00,862
we can tell people.

22
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,541
Tell people what?

23
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,043
Hi, Barney.

24
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,269
Tell people what?

25
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:06,818
The food looks delicious,
doesn't it?

26
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:08,046
Tell people what?

27
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:08,875
Nothing.

28
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:11,252
Oh, okay. Tell people what?

29
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:12,498
Can we talk about this later?

30
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:14,376
Absolutely. Tell people what?

31
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:17,218
- Hi. Have you met Barney?
- Hey. Barney Stinson.

32
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,365
Lovely dress.
I know, I'm sick of these things, too.

33
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,761
It's like the same wedding over and
over again. You're totally right.

34
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:24,336
You want to dance? Great,
see you out there. Tell people what?

35
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,985
Look, this is just not something we want
to talk about right now, okay, Barney?

36
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:30,847
Okay.

37
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,405
Whoo, that was a close one.

38
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,224
Think he'll actually let it go?

39
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,709
Tell people what?
Tell people what? Tell people what?

40
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:40,934
Tell people what?
Tell people...

41
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:45,506
There's a black Nissan Stanza in
the parking lot with it's lights on.

42
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,922
Can I get a water please?

43
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:06,855
- Tell people what?
- Oh, God! Okay.

44
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:10,184
Look, we have some... news.

45
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,679
But we don't want to draw attention
away from Lily and Marshall's big day.

46
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,511
So just forget about it until
they leave for the honeymoon.

47
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,778
Fine.

48
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,085
- It's pretty big, though.
- Oh, my God, just tell me!

49
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:23,867
- Oh, help us.
- What's wrong?

50
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,317
We're starving.

51
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:27,336
We planned this amazing
meal with the caterers,

52
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,052
and we haven't
had a bite of it.

53
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:32,282
Every time we get near the food,
we get cocktail weiner blocked.

54
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,957
Marshall!

55
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,906
We haven't eaten all day.

56
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,388
All right,
let's run some interference.

57
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,558
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table.
Come on.

58
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,131
Oh, there you are.

59
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,576
My dear, you look so beautiful.

60
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,103
Thanks, Grammie,
but we really need to...

61
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,790
And you...
you look like a 1940s movie star.

62
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,477
And you look like a pepper-crusted
rack of lamb with mint jelly.

63
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,555
All right,
let's get these two back to their table.

64
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,259
We will see you on the floor for
the conga line later, won't we?

65
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:28,423
The answer to that one
was decided weeks earlier.

66
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,303
Conga line.

67
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,522
Oh, yes, definitely.

68
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,555
How about a slide show of
you guys through the years

69
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,465
set to Green Day's
"Time of Your Life"

70
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,496
and ending with your baby
photos side by side.

71
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,894
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.

72
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:46,829
What list?

73
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:51,214
Horrible wedding clichés we're not going
to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.

74
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,301
Oh, like First Corinthians?

75
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,718
That Bible verse?

76
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,025
They do that at every wedding.

77
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:57,092
How's it go?

78
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,690
"Love is patient and kind.

79
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,578
"Love does not envy or boast.

80
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,882
"It is not arrogant or rude.

81
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,096
"Love does not insist
on it's own way.

82
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,170
"It is not irritable
or resentful.

83
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,971
"Love bears all things,

84
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,223
"believes all things,

85
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:15,331
"hopes all things...

86
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,857
"endures all things."

87
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,001
- Lame.
- Going on the list.

88
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:25,558
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.

89
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,919
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception
hall bathroom kind of a cliché?

90
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,551
Well, okay, one cliché.

91
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,649
Well, technically two.

92
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,829
No! They cleared
our plates again!

93
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,270
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,
where did you go?!

94
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:43,014
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have my way with you.

95
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,348
Well, you still have me.

96
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,542
Yeah...

97
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:50,068
Anyway, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something,

98
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:53,063
so if you could go bicker or
share a tense, sexless silence

99
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,452
or whatever married people do
somewhere else, that'd be great.

100
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,328
No, Barney, this is my wedding,

101
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,181
and I will sit wherever
I damn well...

102
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:00,674
Are those mini quiches?

103
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,523
Tell the secret.

104
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,204
Okay, uh...

105
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,882
it was our anniversary,

106
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,824
so we went to this
restaurant Carmichael's,

107
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,779
which is where we went
on our first date.

108
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:14,605
Remember, the place where I stole
the blue French horn for Robin?

109
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:16,596
Oh, right, that was you.

110
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,558
I knew that was
somebody I knew.

111
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,460
What?

112
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,716
Dude, you were there.

113
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:24,227
That was like a big iconic
moment in all of our lives.

114
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,720
Maybe in your life--
I got a lot of stuff going on.

115
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,902
Okay, so we're sitting there
and the waiter comes over...

116
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,334
Champagne?

117
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,423
Um, we didn't order champagne.

118
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,985
Compliments of the house.

119
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:36,886
Wow.

120
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,384
Thanks.

121
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:40,833
Cheers.

122
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:44,148
And there, sitting at the bottom
of my champagne glass is...

123
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,252
Mini quiche.

124
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,057
You're a mega-douche.

125
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,100
Oh, that's right, they moved that
table back toward the kitchen,

126
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,679
because that's where they're setting
up a surprise chocolate fountain.

127
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,805
Oh, no, I gave it away.

128
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,881
So what was in the glass?

129
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:01,771
Right.

130
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,438
So the waiter comes up
with two glasses of Dom.

131
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,793
He says, "Champagne?"
"We didn't order any champagne."

132
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:08,392
"Compliments of
the house." "Wow."

133
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,312
You said that already!

134
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,743
Right. So Robin looks down,

135
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:15,721
and there at the
bottom of her glass...

136
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,948
Is an engagement ring.

137
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,378
Anything you want to say
to the bride and groom?

138
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:24,724
Don't get married.

139
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,737
Why don't I come back.

140
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,007
An engagement ring?

141
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,187
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

142
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,909
Ted, you cannot do
this to me. No.

143
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,461
No, no, no!

144
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,939
That's what she said.

145
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,424
No.

146
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,176
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.

147
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,215
No. No, no, no.

148
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,519
What are you talking about?

149
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:56,387
This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?

150
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:58,473
Oh, God, listen...
I just got to get out of here.

151
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,017
That's not mine.

152
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,189
What?

153
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,994
That's not mine.

154
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:04,608
Then whose is it?

155
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,451
It's mine.

156
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:11,355
Janna...

157
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,334
will you marry me?

158
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,935
Yes.

159
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:22,554
Wow.

160
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,829
That was hilarious.
I was like... what?

161
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,748
Anyway.

162
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:32,324
What the hell was that?

163
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:34,277
What the hell was what?

164
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,046
That reaction?

165
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:37,878
I thought you were
proposing to me.

166
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:41,411
Really? Because it sounded like you
thought I was trying to set you on fire.

167
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:43,694
Ted, you know how I
feel about marriage.

168
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,158
Now more than ever.

169
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,288
I'm sorry,
were you planning on proposing tonight?

170
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:47,991
No.

171
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:49,088
Then why is this an issue?

172
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,756
Because even though you
don't want to get married,

173
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:52,893
I'd like to think the fact that
we've been together for a year,

174
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,339
and that we love each other
might get me a gentler reaction

175
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,595
than, "No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,476
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.

177
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,040
"No. No, no, no."

178
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,594
Okay, you're right, I just...
freaked out.

179
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,160
I don't know why.

180
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:09,772
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,575
Can we please just let it go?

182
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,167
No.

183
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,549
Hey, Stinson.

184
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,945
Never lie to a man about
a chocolate fountain.

185
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:24,836
So did you guys find
anything to eat?

186
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,429
I had four strawberries.

187
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:30,867
Was there a side of champagne
with each of the strawberries?

188
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,279
Yes.

189
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,266
Lily, you could have burped
or said the word "Yes,"

190
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:40,883
but the fact that you did both
is exactly why I married you.

191
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,091
Oh, look, more strawberries!

192
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,093
So what happened next?

193
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,393
- Ted, don't do this.
- No, seriously.

194
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,210
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

195
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,840
Where do you see yourself?

196
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,187
Honestly, in five years...

197
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,506
I probably want to be married.

198
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:02,668
And I probably want
to be in Argentina.

199
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,655
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo, or Paris.

200
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,516
Look, Ted, I don't know where
I'm going to be in five years.

201
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,573
And I don't want to know.
I want my life to be an adventure.

202
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,708
We have an expiration date,
don't we?

203
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,671
Oh, my God.

204
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,681
You guys broke up.

205
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:27,448
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.

206
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:28,747
Barney...

207
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,634
story's not over.

208
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:33,597
Can we please not talk about this here.
Can we go home?

209
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,449
Yeah, of course.

210
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,520
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually...

211
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,073
Oh, my God, it's you.

212
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,594
Wha... what?

213
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:44,631
You're the son of a bitch who
stole our blue French horn.

214
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:46,324
Run!

215
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,833
Run? Your strategy was run?

216
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,245
It was a perfectly good idea.

217
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,897
They didn't have our
credit card information.

218
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:53,198
They didn't know us from Adam.

219
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:54,307
I stand by it.

220
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:55,014
Yeah?

221
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,648
And how did that
work out for you?

222
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,608
I don't see why they had to keep
my credit card and driver's license

223
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,146
till we bring the horn back.

224
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,140
Well, come on, Ted,
can you blame them?

225
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:08,263
Look, I'm sorry about
the French horn.

226
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,986
I want to make this right.

227
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:13,398
So what we're going to do right now is,
we're going to run!

228
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,472
So... Argentina.

229
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,086
Argentina.

230
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:24,497
Why is this the first
I've heard of Argentina?

231
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,281
Mmm, American schools
suck at geography.

232
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:31,034
What would be the point in telling
you that I want to live in Argentina?

233
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,224
You don't want to live there.

234
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:33,554
I could want to
live in Argentina.

235
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,573
No, you couldn't.

236
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,649
I mean,
you life is here and your career.

237
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,854
I'm a journalist,
my career could take me anywhere,

238
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,687
and I hope it does.

239
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,038
Hey. I could be an
architect anywhere, too.

240
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,943
They have buildings
in Argentina.

241
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,419
And Paris. And even Tokyo.

242
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,455
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but
he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.

243
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,565
So, what? You're saying you
want to move to Argentina?

244
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:58,967
Well, I always regretted not taking
a year in college to live abroad.

245
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,551
I just finished a
big project at work.

246
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:02,822
I got some money saved up.

247
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:06,125
If ever there were a time in my life to
do something like this, it's right now.

248
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,743
Let's move to Argentina.

249
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,818
Oh, shut up.

250
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,968
You're scared
I might not be kidding.

251
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,116
Aren't you?

252
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,506
Nope.

253
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:21,183
Your move, Scherbatsky.

254
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:25,326
Okay.

255
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:28,186
Let's do it--
let's move to Argentina.

256
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,994
No es posible!

257
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:35,403
Nobody moves to Argentina.

258
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,580
The Argentinean peso has dropped
two-thirds in five years,

259
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,981
the government is opposed
to free market reforms,

260
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:45,407
and the railroad has been a mess since
the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.

261
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,551
I hooked up with an
Argentinean exchange student

262
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,395
in a Porta-John
outside Yankee Stadium.

263
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,250
Man, she was chatty.

264
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,790
Right? Right?

265
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:56,373
You caught the bouquet?

266
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:58,632
Barney.

267
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:00,937
The story's not over yet.

268
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,289
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

269
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:05,968
I don't know if I
can do this to you.

270
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,769
Do what?

271
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,823
Well, you say you want
to move to Argentina,

272
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,408
but you want to have kids.

273
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,694
Oh, right.
'Cause there are no kids there.

274
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,159
On Santa's map of the world,
there's a big black "X" over Argentina.

275
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,773
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

276
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,310
Okay, say we had kids.

277
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,865
They wouldn't have to grow
up in some suburb somewhere.

278
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,884
They would grow up on the road
having adventures with us.

279
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:31,134
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe
T-shirts they could collect.

280
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,220
Ted, you know that kids were
never a part of my plan.

281
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,156
But if I was going to
have someone's babies,

282
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,113
I'd have your babies.

283
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:43,565
That's when you run.

284
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,325
Tell me you ran, Ted.

285
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,449
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to
start having babies right this second.

286
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,477
Do you have a...?

287
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:55,805
No, I don't.

288
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:58,573
Well, we probably shouldn't.

289
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,206
Yeah.

290
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:07,926
- Risk it?
- Risk it.

291
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,235
No.

292
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:34,022
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you're all gather around,

293
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,690
Lily and Marshall are
going to cut the cake.

294
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,209
No. Robin, you're not...

295
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,532
No, say the story's not over.

296
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:42,778
Come on,
they're cutting the cake.

297
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,295
Say the story's not over!

298
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:49,128
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried
I've ever been that someone's pregnant.

299
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,286
Okay, Lily.

300
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,724
I'm really hungry, so let's just,
uh, aim for my mouth, okay?

301
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,296
Besides, the smearing the cake
thing's a cliché, remember?

302
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,922
No, it's going to be so funny.

303
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,259
Lily.

304
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,793
Lily, just feed me the cake.

305
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:11,987
Please, baby, I am so hungry.

306
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,332
Whoopsy-daisy.

307
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,434
And she's okay.

308
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:22,555
- She's all right.
- That was funny.

309
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,399
And it's time for
the honeymoon.

310
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:28,289
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.

311
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:29,516
We love you.

312
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,688
I love you.

313
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,514
Getting married, having kids.

314
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:36,874
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible, horrible mistake.

315
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,164
God, this guy's
giving me nothing.

316
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,845
All right,
have fun in Scotland.

317
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:45,306
If you see the Loch Ness Monster,
tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"

318
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,450
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.

319
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,704
Hey, kiddo.

320
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,468
You are going to miss out
on a lot of awesome stuff.

321
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:11,513
You'll be at home with the kid

322
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,415
while I am out awesome-ing
all over the place.

323
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:17,244
And you're going to get fat.

324
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,249
The story's not over, Barney.

325
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,709
Okay, time to get the
horn back to the bistro.

326
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,636
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.

327
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:28,103
Not a euphemism.

328
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:33,486
Right. Okay, let me just go change,
and we'll leave.

329
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,567
Whoa, whoa,
you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.

330
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:38,036
Solidarity, sister.

331
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,426
That is crazy. I have a change of
clothes and you don't. Suck it up.

332
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,139
Well, if we'd actually moved in
together, all my stuff would be here,

333
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,968
but we didn't, so...

334
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:56,934
Yeah.

335
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:59,929
We were all talk, weren't we?

336
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:05,918
We're not doing this, are we?

337
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,906
I don't want to have
kids in Argentina.

338
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,810
And I don't want to
have kids in Argentina.

339
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,504
So where does that leave us?

340
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,071
Well...

341
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,875
we could stay together and...

342
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:28,445
pretend this stuff
doesn't matter.

343
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,221
Or...

344
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,971
we could give back
the blue French horn.

345
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:44,156
You stole a blue
French horn for me.

346
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,099
I would have stolen
you a whole orchestra.

347
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,631
You did break up.

348
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:05,321
Yep.

349
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,753
You're not pregnant?

350
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,970
Nope.

351
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,719
An-And Marshall and
Lily don't know?

352
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,918
Well, afterwards, uh,
we came by to tell you guys,

353
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,848
but Lily was pretty
stressed out, so...

354
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,449
We decided not to say anything
till after the wedding.

355
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:23,944
You guys okay?

356
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:28,287
Well, it hasn't been the easiest
two weeks of our lives, but...

357
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,346
But we're okay.

358
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,919
The open bar helps.

359
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:36,002
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi.

360
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,955
Could I have this dance?

361
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,126
Well, we knew this day
would come eventually.

362
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,942
Take care of her, little man.

363
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:01,529
This is by far the drunkest
I've ever seen you.

364
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,275
Uh, driver.

365
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,600
Hello!

366
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:10,893
Ranjit.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,760
Hey, can we make a stop before
we head back to the hotel?

368
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:16,032
You do not have to stop.

369
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,876
You can be together as man
and wife right back there,

370
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,948
and because we are friends...

371
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,291
I will not watch.

372
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:31,018
Um, no,
we actually had something else in mind.

373
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:34,693
Okay.

374
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,500
Lily, go sit down.

375
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,635
Welcome to Wienerburger.

376
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,716
Hi.

377
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,370
Can we get a number one,
please, with no pickles?

378
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:47,884
And a number four
with no onions.

379
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,520
Let me guess.
Jefferson High prom?

380
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:51,856
No.

381
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,220
But thank you.

382
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:55,953
Actually, we just got married.

383
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:59,244
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

384
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,172
That's $7.80.

385
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,488
- Hey, dude.
- Yeah.

386
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:08,487
I don't know how to say this, but
your wife just threw up in the trash.

387
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,443
My wife.

388
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,809
So Marshall and
Lily were married,

389
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,926
and Robin and I were broken up.

390
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,731
And as hard as it
was at the time,

391
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,739
in the end we both
got what we wanted.

392
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,734
She did eventually go
on to live in Argentina

393
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,402
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,

394
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,370
even Japan for a little while.

395
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:36,043
And I... well, I met your mom.

396
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:38,778
I think for the most part if
you're really honest with yourself

397
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,505
about what you
want out of life,

398
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,238
life gives it to you.

399
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:48,386
Of course, at that moment, all I
really wanted was a scotch and soda

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,020
and a cigar.

401
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,430
I'm really sorry
about you and Robin.

402
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,305
I know I was always joking around
about wanting you two to break up,

403
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,110
but you were really
good together.

404
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:16,903
Yeah...

405
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:19,047
we were.

406
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:22,601
She just wasn't the one,
you know?

407
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,699
The one. Oh, Ted, no.

408
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,511
Do not tell me you're going to
start searching for "the one" again.

409
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,594
The only time I want to
hear you saying "the one"

410
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,537
is if it's followed by the
word "hundredth." What up?

411
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:37,128
No, I need a break
from all that, I...

412
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,745
I just want to get out there and
have fun for a while, you know?

413
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,139
Really?

414
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,063
'Cause...

415
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,306
you know, you've been in
a relationship for a year.

416
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,634
You're going to...
be a little rusty.

417
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,526
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...

418
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:58,438
you're gonna need, need,
need some help out there.

419
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,429
Could be.

420
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,550
Ted?

421
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,369
Yes, Barney.

422
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,229
Do you think...

423
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,924
Do you think maybe you might...

424
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,321
need a wingman again?

425
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,105
I do.

426
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,303
Yes!

427
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:27,884
Yes! We're back.

428
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,720
We are back.

429
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:33,224
And Ted, my boy,
it's going to be legend...

430
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,535
Wait for it.
