OLDER TED: Kids, the thing about
New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

3
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:18,324
<i>Sure it looks great on TV.</i>

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,461
<i>But in reality,
it's always just a big letdown.</i>

5
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:23,779
<i>But in 2005,
I attempted to do the impossible:</i>

6
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>To give my friends a great New Year's Eve.</i>

7
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:27,384
<i>I had an idea of how to do it, too,</i>

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,974
<i>and all it cost was
half my Christmas bonus.</i>

9
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:41,091
Yeah, that's right. A limo.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,595
- ROBIN: Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's taIk strategy.

11
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,690
Last New Year's,
we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

12
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,273
This year, we party together, or not at all.

13
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,091
Now, I sifted through
your party submissions,

14
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:01,675
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.

15
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,462
Yes, Barney,
your submissions were received,

16
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:06,365
and no, we will not be attending
any parties in your pants.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,449
(ALL EXCLAIM)

18
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:10,990
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.

19
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,106
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,956
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

21
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:15,615
and then narrow them down to one,

22
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:17,880
the most awesome party in New York City,

23
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:22,154
and that is where we will ring,
nay, rock in the new year.

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,568
All right, and party number one,
that's where we get to meet Marybeth?

25
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,929
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.

26
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,714
She seems like she might be into me.

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,096
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see...

28
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,104
(CLEARING THROAT)

29
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:38,360
People often ask me,
'Barney, how is it that you're so psyched...

30
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:41,518
- 'so much of the time?'
- By who? Who asks you that?

31
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:42,730
(LAUGHING)

32
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:45,182
And the answer is right here.

33
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:48,176
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,386
Now, people often think
a good mix should rise and fall,

35
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:55,039
but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.

36
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:57,786
Now, prepare yourselves
for an audio journey...

37
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:01,188
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

38
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:03,513
Bam.

<i>(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME
PLAYING ON STEREO)...</i>

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,351
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.

41
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:12,732
God. I'm reaching dangerous
levels of psychage.

42
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,893
Must do robot.

43
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:18,080
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!

44
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:20,124
Oh, driver?

45
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,868
Hello!

46
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,273
Hey, Ranjit!

47
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,538
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.

48
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,828
I've moved up in the world.

49
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:30,748
How do you guys know each other?

50
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:34,066
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.

51
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,151
Hey, what are we waiting for?

52
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:37,352
We got five parties to hit,
and three hours to do it.

53
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:38,724
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys,

54
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,626
but Derek should be coming by
any minute to pick me up.

55
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,831
<i>OLDER TED: Oh, yeah,
Robin was spending</i>

<i>New Year's with her boyfriend Derek.</i>

57
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:49,219
<i>Derek. He was, like, rich,
successful, handsome.</i>

58
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,226
<i>I hated that guy.</i>

59
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,365
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.

60
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,386
- ROBIN: Bye.
- Happy New Year.

61
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,394
- Bye.
- Here we go.

62
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:01,436
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.

63
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,083
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.

64
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,667
That just means were gonna have to party
that much harder.

65
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:09,210
Ranjit. Party number one.

66
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,436
- Party number one!
- Party number one!

67
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:19,523
I can't believe we're leaving a party
that had pigs in blankets.

68
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,170
If you think we can beat that,
you got some brass ones.

69
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,861
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.

70
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:27,274
If party number one turns out to be
the best, we'll just limo on back to it.

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,751
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancé, Marshall.

72
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:34,292
Hi. Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.

73
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:37,673

- Oh, hey. Well, you're friendly.

76
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,849
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?

77
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,880
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.

- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.

84
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:11,854
I love these shoes, but
the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

85
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,150
Can we swing by the apartment
so I can change?

86
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:15,968
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening...

87
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,030
of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.

88

are really barking.

89

It's true. I can hear them.

- Yeah!

We have to turn around. We left Natalya.

- Sorry.

You know, she is a guest in this country.

So, while you may choose
to turn your back on her,

I choose to turn my front on her. What up.

- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.

- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.

- Come on. It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.

- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

- Yes. Moby.

196

Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.

- I never leave home without it.
- That's how I feel about Janice here.

you said, 'Yeah.'
