00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,600
不管怎么样 她总是你老妈 而我...

川及(传奇)

抱歉 兄弟 只能这样了  不过千万别忘记教你的东西

喝醉的观众
A drunk audience.

表现不错

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,900
我们去过的活动徽章还在吗?
You still got that buttonfrom the festival we went to?

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,100
合法化! 1983年

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,700

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,700

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,800
派对 永不断
Never... stop... partying.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
孩子们 1983年 Barney眼看着 他的爸爸走出他的生命
Kids, in 1983,Barney watched his father walk out of his life.

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,100
而2011年 他们父子两人 首次重逢不欢而散...
And in 2011, when theirfirst reunion ended badly...

只要能再参与你的生命 我什么都愿意做

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,300
而这次 是Barney先离开
This time it was Barneywho did the walking.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,400
再见

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,000
我们以为那就是他们的结局了 不过 几周后...
And that was almostthe end of it. Except, a few weeks later...

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
我爸气死我了 猜猜今天谁给我打电话了
I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
快啊 猜猜看 
Go on, guess.Mmm.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,500
- 你爸爸? - 我老爸!
- Your dad? - My dad!

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
- Barney Stinson - 嗨 Barney 是爸爸
- Barney Stinson. - Hi, Barney. It's your dad.

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,800
想和我还有JJ一起去钓鱼吗 就周六早上
Look, would youlike to go fishing with me and J.J.on Sunday morning?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300

Ooh, hold on, let mecheck my personality.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
不去 绝不会去

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,200
Barney
Barney, look...

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,300
我知道 你对爸爸很失望...
I know you're disappointedthat your dad is just...

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
因为我不过是个 无聊的乡下驾驶教练
a boring old driving instructorfrom the suburbs.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
不过过去的我... "疯狂Jerry" ?
But that guy I used to be... "Crazy Jerry"?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
他可不是好人 酗酒 彻夜派对 到处睡女人
 He was bad news! Drinking, partying,sleeping around.

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,800
不可能永远糜烂下去
The party can't go on forever.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,200
你现在35岁了 我想你也开始意识到了 对吗
You're 35; I'm-I'm sureyou're starting to realize that, right?

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,800
你真是太对了
You do not knowhow right you are.

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,900
对个屁
Zero right!

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
我们还没有老到干不了事的地步
We're not getting too old for anything.

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,700
你确定? 我怎么觉得每年至少一次 我们会觉得自己太老了
You sure? I feel like we collectivelylearn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,700
我不得不接受这丑陋的真相
I have to face an ugly truth.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,700
Jerry Whittaker 我的亲生爸爸
Jerry Whittaker, my own father,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
可真是一点都不帅
is anti-awesome-etic.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,500
我知道 疯狂Jerry肯定还在
I know. Crazy Jerry's stillin there somewhere,

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
只不过是被20年来修草坪
but he's trapped under 20 yearsof lawnmower parties

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
和拼车烧烤给困住了
and carpool barbecues.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
哇 你对郊区还真是不了解
Wow, you know nothingabout the suburbs.

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,300
这周六晚 我要把疯狂的他释放出来
Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out.

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,800
我要让Jerry知道 他不该放弃原来的生活
I'm gonna

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,800
make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,900
我要让他过一个永生难忘的夜晚
by showing him the awesomest nightof all time.

57
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,500
既然是永生难忘的夜晚
And for the awesomest night of all time,

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
我需要一群永生难忘的朋友来配合
I'm going to needthe wesomest friends of all time, 

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
好了 我都认识些谁呢?
Okay, who do I know?

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
各位...
Guys...!

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,700
你们有谁认识乔治克鲁尼?
Do any of you knowGeorge Clooney?

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,300
好了 我爸爸快到了 今晚我要一切尽可能完美
Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,500
- 所以... - 所以你才把我们叫到这来嘛
- That's...  - why youbrought these guys.

64
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,400
不 所以我才叫这些人来
No. That's whyI brought these guys.

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,100
我对你们的身份做了点小小的改动
I've made some minor improvementsto your identities.

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,100
看了卡片就知道
- Uh. - Mm! - You'll find themon these cards.

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
- 改动? - 是啊 老兄
- Improvements?!- Yeah. Bro,

68
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
我们四个已经是最完美...
 we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudesand dudettes this side of...

69
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,000
好吧 还是看卡片吧
Okay, let's see the cards.

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,700
Robin 除非是车追露乳美女的新闻 否则没人会看
Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chaseor a nip slip.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,700
你现在的身份是专业品酒师
You are now a professional scotch taster.

72
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,800
Lily Jerry需要明白的是 有些生活方式不比一夫一妻差
Mm!

73
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,800
Lily, Jerry needs to learnthat other lifestyles are just as fulfillingas monogamy,

74
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
所以你和Marshall现在是开放婚姻
so now you and Marshallare in an open marriage.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,700
恶心!
- Whoo-hoo! - Gross!

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,700
还有 Marshall 不能说你失业了
Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed,

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,300
你现在是严重酗酒 沉溺女色的剧作家
so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright.

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,700
Ted 你就做你自己
And, Ted, just be yourself.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,700
怎么可能
Just kidding.

80
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,700
这里是一堆你绝对要避免的话题
Here's a giant pile of topicsyou should avoid talking about.

81
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,200
好吧 这肯定会很有趣
Well. Well, this couldactually be fun.

82
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,100
事实上 我想Oscar Wilde曾说过
In fact, I believe itwas Oscar Wilde who said,

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,100
"一个人最不诚实的时候 是他在谈论..."
"Man is least himselfwhen he talks..."

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
- Ted 看卡片 - 啊 好的
- Ted, card. - Ah. You're right...

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,200
"不准引用Oscar Wilde的话"
"No quoting Oscar Wilde."

86
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
最后一点 Robin 你和Ted是一对
Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,500
啊 天 为什么啊?
Aw, man! Why?

88
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,900
我身边不能有单身女性朋友
I can't have any single female friendslying around.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
我爸爸肯定会一直说 "你为什么不娶Robin?"
My dad'll be all,"Why don't you marry Robin?

90
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,300
"你们俩很般配 其实你自己知道  你和她在一起是最快乐的"
"You guys are cute together.Deep down, you know you were never happierthan when you were with her."

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
不用了 谢谢
- Uh... - no, thanks.

92
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
嘿 Barney 爱死我的新身份了 不过有个小问题...
Hey, Barney... lovethe new identities. Little thing... 

93
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
我不想当裸体的超级忍者
instead ofbeing a naked super ninja,

94
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,300
我想当"穿Prada的恶魔"里的 Meryl Streep
can I be Meryl Streepin The Devil Wears Prada?

95
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,900
那电影太棒了
- How good was that movie?

96
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,300
- 太好看了 - 哦 天哪
- ??? - Oh, my God.

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
还有...
- ??? - And...

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,500
所以要给你们新身份了
hence new identities.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Barney的爸爸总算来了
 And so Barney'sdad finally showed up.

100
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,800
Jerry 还记得Marshall吧 他是位知名作家
Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
剧作家 我们都是作家 只是有些人还不知道怎么写
Playwright.We're all writers, just some of us don't knowwhat our story is yet.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Lily 他的妻子
Lily, his wife.

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
大部分晚上是

104

我可不想让戒指 影响我们的幸福时光
Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.

105
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,300
那... 有点郁闷
That's... a little depressing.

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400

我们不在这喝 今晚我们要好好疯一下

想一下 应该先去哪个酒吧呢?

"好吧"可不逊 "逊毙了"是个同志酒吧
Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,900
- 各位 闭嘴 - 不 "闭嘴"也关门了
- Guys, shut up. - No, Shut up shut down.

真不敢相信 我现在对酒吧这么不熟悉
I can't believe I don't knowthe clubs anymore.

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,500
各位 就随便选一个啊 好吧?
Guys, just pick a club, okay?

143
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,900
不去"好吧"
Not Okay!

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
"好吧"逊毙了 是个同志酒吧
Okay is Lame! Gay bar.

145
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,200
其实 我曾偶然去过一次
For the record, I wasin there once by accident.

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,500
我很确定 其实正确读音是Lama
I'm pretty sure it'spronounced Lam茅.

147
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
没希望了 是不是?
It's hopeless, isn't it?

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
哇
 Wow.

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
这里的女生都可以当我们女儿了
A lot of these girlsare young enough to be our daughters.

150
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,600
我知道 老爹回来了

151
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,100
爷爷也回来了 今晚太震撼了
And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!

152
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
我可能对这个图章过敏
I might be allergicto this stamp.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
天哪 我暗恋的人在这
Oh, my God,my secret crush is here.

154
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,400

嗨 我想征求下女士的意见
Hi. I could usea woman's opinion.

158

我穿这件怎么样?
Is this working for me?

159
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,200
额 不太搭
Uh... no.

160
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,100
这件衬衫难看的唯一好处
The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is,

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,400
就是让人们忽略它多么不适合你
is that it distractsfrom how terribly it fits you.

162
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
我试的是裤子
I was trying on the pants.

163
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
哦
Oh. 

164
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,000
话没说完 我就走了 所以我们也没后续
I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it.

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,500
从那之后 我就...
You know, eversince then, I've always...

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,300
天哪 他过来了

- 你好 - 嗨
- Oh. Hello. Hi. - Hi.

A few years ago ata department store... ...did you embarrassthe hell out of me?

169
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
不好意思 是你的衬衫实在太丑
Oh, I'm sorry,you must have me confused with the shirtyou were wearing that day.

176
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,800
你欠我个人情
You owe me one.

177
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
这地方不错吧?
Man, isn't this place great?

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
难说 太吵了
Uh, I don't know.It's so loud!

179
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,000
典型的资产阶级
And so bourgeois.

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,800
我的很多剧本都是关于资产阶级
Many of plays areabout the bourgeois.

181

还有厌倦的
And ennui.

Lily 说说你们的开放婚姻吧

结束了一整天的会议
Okay. Well, after a long dayof style meetings

186
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,400
拍照
and photo shoots

187
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,700
还有一整天为难我的助理之后
and being way too mean to my assistant,

188
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
我有时候会和内衣模特上个床
I sometimes bangan underwear model.

189
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,000
- 我的天哪 - 我也四处风流
- My goodness! - I sleep around, too.

190
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,400
和她差不多 甚至有过之而无不及
Just as much. A little more, even.

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,200
那也只是因为你整天没别的事干
Oh, uh, only 'cause youhave nothing to do all day.

192
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,500
我们又要开始吵架了吗 写剧本是个实在的活
Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!

197
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,300
不 谢谢 Barney 我明早还要和JJ去钓鱼

可你做了那么多疯狂的事

你记不记得 一个魔术师最好的朋友是谁?

我... 我刚刚吐在了...
I... I just pukedon the hood of that...

314
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
那辆警车上
police car.

315
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
你为什么要这么做?
Well, why do all those things?

316
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,400
我以为如果我向你展示...
I figured ifI showed you what...

317
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,900
"派对永不断"是什么样子
"never stop partying"really looked like,

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,400
你就会明白自己不可能永远这样
you'd realize you can't do it forever.

319
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,700
算了
Oh, well.

320
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,600
你一整晚都对我撒谎 就为了你自私的理由?
You lied to me all nightfor your own selfish reasons?

321
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000

322
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,300
我想和你一起出来 你是我儿子

我没办法准时赶回去了

328
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,200
也许吧
