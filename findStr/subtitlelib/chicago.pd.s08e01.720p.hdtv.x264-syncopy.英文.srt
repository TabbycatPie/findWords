19
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,490
And I just wanted to

20
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,770
touch base with you

21
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,600
one more time.

22
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure what you're asking.

23
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm asking if there's anything

24
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,520
you would like to add

25
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,970
or modify.

26
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,120
No.

27
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,170
I stand by my original statement.

28
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,460
Yo, what's in the bag?

29
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,530
Nothing.

30
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,200
Hey, I'm police.

31
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,630
I asked you a question.

32
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,090
Officer Doyle had no probable cause

33
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,620
hopping out of the car and stopping Shawn Paige.

34
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,830
Doyle was the aggressor, not Paige.

35
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,510
That man was walking down the street

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,860
minding his own business.

37
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,170
So the two men inside of the recording studio

38
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,820
who shot and killed Doyle...

39
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,610
Doyle!

40
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,070
You believe they were acting in self-defense?

41
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,990
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,310
I need you to fight, Doyle. I need you to fight.

43
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,150
Okay.

44
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,470
Then I guess I need to file a motion to dismiss.

45
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
That's your call.

46
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,170
No, it's actually your call.

47
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,760
You were the only witness.

48
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,680
So if you think Doyle is to blame, there is no case.

49
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
Like I said,

50
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,820
I stand by my original statement.

51
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
It takes a lot of guts for a young Black cop

52
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,530
to take on the Chicago Police Department.

53
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,300
I'm right here! I'm right here!

54
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,940
I know what's been going on with Atwater past few weeks.

55
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,420
I got no idea what you're talking about.

56
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,250
Kenny.

57
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,020
Please don't make a jerk of me, okay?

58
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,680
We both know what you've been doing has gotta stop now

59
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,920
before someone gets hurt.

60
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,830
Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about,

61
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,410
but even if I did,

62
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,180
there's no way I could agree to that.

63
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,430
That kid Atwater broke the most sacred rule there is:

64
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,250
he snitched on the police

65
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,770
on a cop who died on the line of duty

66
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,890
with a wife and two little kids.

67
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,580
If that's not bad enough,

68
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,170
state's attorney's office just dropped the case.

69
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The two punks that killed Doyle,

70
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,050
a Chicago police officer,

71
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,250
are gonna walk free.

72
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,240
Atwater did what he thought was right.

73
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,440
No. He crossed the line.

74
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,070
Blue wall is there to keep us together.

75
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,560
It keeps us safe.

76
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,390
It's a bible, our Ten Commandments.

77
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,370
You of all people know that, Hank.

78
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,490
If someone chooses to violate that code,

79
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,640
he's gotta pay the price.

80
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
Way it's always been.

81
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,030
Way it always will be.

83
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,760
You know, Lisa, I signed a statement

84
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,090
with the state's attorney.

85
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,810
Your husband will be exonerated.

86
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,730
I can't believe it.

87
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,860
I really can't.

88
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,830
It's the best damn thing I've heard in a long time.

89
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,760
It's good news for you too.

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,650
That means that lawsuit against the city just got a lot better.

91
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,420
Proves that cop Doyle was in the wrong;

92
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,180
your husband Shawn was in the right.

93
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,320
Thank you.

94
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,340
Glad I could help.

95
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,340
You know, brother, this city needs more people like you.

96
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,780
People who actually care.

97
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,670
Know how to treat people like people.

98
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,680
I got you, little homie.

99
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,090
Feel real sorry about your father.

100
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,630
He was a good man. He did nothing wrong.

101
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,750
Then why'd you kill him?

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,490
I'm telling you, I'm starting to get paranoid.

103
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,900
Like, for real.

104
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Every time I see a cop, I get nervous.

105
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,660
I start thinking, my mind starts racing.

106
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,640
I told you I was literally on my knees

107
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,390
looking under the damn car. For what?

108
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,060
I don't know, but I was looking.

109
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,840
How many officers were in the car?

110
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,830
- What do you mean? - I'm just asking.

111
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,800
One. Why?

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Well, if someone was gonna plant something,

113
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm guessing, you know,

114
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,780
they would do it alone and leave their partner out of it.

115
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,630
You're saying that--

116
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,270
I'm saying that, you know, Doyle's crew, they play dirty.

117
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,720
Sorry for dragging you into all into this, Ruz.

118
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,630
This nonsense is starting to get to me.

119
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,100
Am I going crazy,

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,850
or is this actually happening?

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,480
- Hand me that rag. - What?

122
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,040
It's heroin.

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,590
What the hell?

124
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,320
Well, at least we know you're not crazy.

125
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,480
Damn.

126
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,590
Well, what's the plan?

127
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,970
You gonna inventory and write paper?

128
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,390
I don't know. I'm still thinking about it.

129
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,840
Did you get a good look at the patrol car?

130
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,700
You see V-tags, plates?

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,950
All right, we can pull POD footage,

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
scroll through the video. Who knows?

133
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
Maybe we catch this dirty prick actually planting the dope.

134
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,960
It's possible,

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,280
but these dudes are all over the place.

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,620
Doyle's probably got two cousins and an uncle working for IED,

137
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,370
which means no matter what we find,

138
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,680
the case still won't go anywhere, and you know that.

139
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,740
All right.

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,990
Well, you do what you gotta do,

141
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,630
but you remember that I'm here to help you, all right?

142
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,040
Any way you want.

143
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,160
Appreciate that.

144
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Police officers will spend more time in the streets

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,510
and in the neighborhoods.

146
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,640
Hey, Deputy Supe's giving a speech.

147
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,000
You mean apology.

148
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,300
She's pretty much telling us

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,130
we're a bunch of unenlightened idiots.

150
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,650
I wouldn't go that far.

151
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,200
She's just telling us what we already know.

152
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,480
Police have to do a better job at deescalating.

153
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,420
Sure, but she doesn't have to be so disrespectful.

154
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,410
We're all trying our best.

155
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,740
Not good enough, Hailey.

156
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,770
It isn't.

157
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,020
CPD did not kill George Floyd, I get that,

158
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,310
but we sure as hell killed Shawn Paige.

159
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,190
So maybe we should just reserve our judgement,

160
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,130
listen to what the sister has to say.

161
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah, I'm not...

162
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,980
We will once and for all tear down the blue wall.

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
Nice to meet you, Sergeant.

164
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,170
- Nice to meet you. - I know you're busy.

165
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,500
I really appreciate you coming in here

166
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,830
to meet me in person.

167
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,080
Deputy Supe calls, you come.

168
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,020
Please, call me Sam.

169
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,570
You want anything to drink? Coffee, water?

170
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,630
No thanks.

171
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,550
You know, I've been here just two weeks,

172
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,880
and all I keep hearing is your name.

173
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,170
Hank Voight this, Hank Voight that.

174
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,860
By all accounts, you are one hell of a cop.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
Well, that is very kind of you,

176
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,110
but I'm guessing you didn't call me down here to blow smoke.

177
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,470
No. I didn't.

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,470
I wanted to give you a heads up, cop to cop.

179
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,830
If you keep running your unit the way you've been doing

180
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,940
for the past seven years,

181
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,780
you're gonna be out of a job by Christmas.

182
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,950
Anything else I should know?

183
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,420
Yeah.

184
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,340
I'm on your side.

185
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,690
I want you to succeed, Sergeant.

186
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,230
If Hank Voight can change the way he polices,

187
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,620
if he can learn how to play by the rules,

188
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,930
the rest of the department will follow.

189
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,760
Look, thanks for the heads up,

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,630
but I gotta go if that's all right.

191
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,050
5-year-old girl just got shot.

192
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,160
Stay safe, Sergeant.

193
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,820
Ma'am.

194
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,350
Hang in there. You're gonna be okay.

195
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,410
We were walking back from the market,

196
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,620
and then I heard two loud pops,

197
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,020
and I saw Laura on the ground bleeding.

198
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,950
Okay, did you see the shooter?

199
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,770
No.

200
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,410
Did you see anything suspicious?

201
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,660
No, no, no, no, no. I just--

202
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,520
We were just walking, and then she got hit.

203
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,890
Listen, I need to be with my little girl right now.

204
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,760
- Okay, go. - Okay, what do we know?

205
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,050
Not much.

206
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,920
Jay and I heard the "Shots fired" call

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,670
come over the radio, so we rushed to the scene.

208
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,150
The little girl was bleeding out when we got here.

209
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,060
She got shot in the stomach.

210
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,890
Good news is, the ambo got here quick.

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,090
What happened? Robbery, drive-by?

212
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,260
Yeah, we don't know.

213
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,810
She was walking with her parents,

214
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,190
and then she got shot somehow.

215
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,430
Unfortunately, they didn't see much.

216
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,110
They heard two loud pops. Next thing you know,

217
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,440
their daughter's on the ground bleeding.

218
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,240
- So stray bullet? - Sounds like it.

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,700
All right, so start canvassing.

220
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Talk to witnesses, pull PODs, surveillance cameras.

221
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,680
Find someone who saw something.

222
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,200
Thanks.

223
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,070
I hope Kev didn't think that I...

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,010
I was bitchin' about the Deputy Supe's speech,

225
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,560
not trying to minimize what happened to Shawn Paige.

226
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,590
I think he totally knows that.

227
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,320
He's just venting.

228
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,970
He's going through so much right now.

229
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,960
- I wouldn't worry about it. - Okay.

230
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,740
Sir, do you live around here?

231
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,550
Yeah? Did you see anything unusual?

232
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,150
Anybody with a gun, anyone arguing?

233
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,900
No.

234
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,690
- Did you hear gunshots? - No.

235
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,640
- How long you been out here? - About an hour.

236
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,480
You've been out here for an hour and you didn't hear

237
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,880
two gunshots that hit a little girl

238
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,360
right over there 30 minutes ago?

239
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,170
I already told you.

240
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,360
Look, we're just trying to get some information.

241
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,830
And I ain't got any, so get the hell out my face, bitch.

242
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,000
What did you say to me?

243
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,370
Come on.

244
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah, y'all racist-ass cops

245
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
ain't welcome around here no more.

246
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,850
Hey, man.

247
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,640
You see the shooting today?

248
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,210
Maybe hear gunshots about 30 minutes ago?

249
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,130
See an argument, fight,

250
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,420
car drive by real fast?

251
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,600
Anything like that?

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
All right.

253
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,910
No, no, no, what are you doing?

254
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,170
Hey, stop. What are you doing?

255
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,460
He just threw a beer bottle at me.

256
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,260
Let it go.

257
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,510
It's not worth escalating this.

258
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,360
Let it go.

259
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,110
That's Agg Assault against a police officer.

260
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,430
All right, they can film all they want.

261
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,650
- I don't care. - I do care.

262
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm not risking my career over a damn beer bottle.

263
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,470
You let it go, okay?

264
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,770
- Okay, what do we know? - Nothing much.

265
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,220
No shot splatter, no shell casings,

266
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,980
no witnesses.

267
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,240
None that were willing to cooperate anyway.

268
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,010
I just talked to Med.

269
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,620
The girl, Laura Diaz, she's in critical,

270
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,440
but the good news is, doctors removed the bullet.

271
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,520
It's 9mm. It's with ballistics right now.

272
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,420
Not sure if it's connected,

273
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,950
but Laura's father was arrested for possession three years ago.

274
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,590
Also has some gang cards on file.

275
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,410
Looks like he runs with the Latin Players.

276
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,150
Maybe we were wrong.

277
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,020
Maybe it wasn't a stray bullet after all.

278
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,510
You're saying that I was the target,

279
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,070
and they hit Laura by accident?

280
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,070
No, what we're saying is,

281
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,330
we know about your affiliation with the Latin Players.

282
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,820
What the hell are you talking about?

283
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,530
Roberto, we're just trying to find the person

284
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,310
who shot your daughter.

285
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,690
We're here not here to investigate you.

286
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,810
We don't care who you run with.

287
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,360
I don't run with anyone.

288
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,000
I own a bakery in Little Village on 26th street.

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
I work there seven days a week.

290
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,860
We also know about your prior arrest.

291
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,580
I got pulled over by a cop for running a stop sign,

292
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,120
and I had two joints in my glove compartment, okay?

293
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,870
That don't make me no drug dealer, bro,

294
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,700
and that sure as hell don't make me no gangbanger.

295
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,110
Okay, it's our mistake.

296
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,730
But like I said,

297
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,400
we're just trying to find the person who shot your daughter.

298
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,710
So think hard.

299
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,170
Roberto, as difficult as this must be,

300
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,230
put yourself back in that moment in time

301
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,710
when you heard the gunshots.

302
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,300
Was there anybody around?

303
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,320
Anybody walking? Running?

304
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,520
Naw.

305
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,040
You see any cars? Motorcycles?

306
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,150
Bicycles?

307
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,990
I heard a car drive away, like, real fast,

308
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,210
but it was through the alleyway at the other end of the block.

309
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,450
All right, you remember the make and model, the color?

310
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,110
It was dark, man.

311
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,800
It was, like, black I think.

312
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,880
Thank you. That helps.

313
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,660
Yeah.

314
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,130
Yeah.

315
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,020
Listen, I'll do whatever I can, it's just...

316
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,110
go find this son of a bitch.

317
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,270
Okay, black car

318
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,150
drove off right after the gunshots.

319
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,630
Cool. Copy that.

320
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,150
All right, that's Halstead.

321
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,820
He's gonna pull more surveillance video.

322
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,590
- Okay. - Try to find a black car.

323
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,380
Good.

324
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,690
I heard they dropped the homicide charge

325
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,040
against those two bangers who shot Doyle.

326
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,310
It was a weak case.

327
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,510
Bangers or not, that night,

328
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,820
just two dudes minding their own business.

329
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah, look.

330
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,320
Kevin...

331
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,720
I know you've been going through a lot, okay?

332
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,540
But you gotta understand, these cops,

333
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,370
I mean, this is gonna rile them up even more.

334
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,950
The only thing they were hanging onto was that trial,

335
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,570
watching those two offenders get convicted of murder.

336
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,850
I get it, but that's their problem.

337
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,030
And like I've been trying to say,

338
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,880
those two dudes weren't really offenders.

339
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,180
Oh, come on, man, you don't have--

340
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,000
The charges got dropped.

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,180
Kevin, I'm trying to help you.

342
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,900
If you ever need to talk...

343
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm good.

344
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,110
Thanks.

345
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,830
This security camera caught our masked offender

346
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,000
running down the alley.

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,460
Then an unknown male chases after him,

348
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,150
confronts him, they fight,

349
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,640
our offender draws a weapon.

350
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,120
I'm guessing that's our 9mm.

351
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,480
He fires two rounds, misses his intended target.

352
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,580
And it hits a 5-year-old girl

353
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,210
named Laura Diaz a block away.

354
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,150
The question is: where was the offender coming from,

355
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,670
and who did he rob?

356
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,220
Can you enhance that?

357
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
Is that a church?

359
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,030
Chicago PD. Anyone here?

360
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,490
Hello?

361
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,740
Hello?

362
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,440
Police.

363
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,570
Hello? Jay.

364
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,220
Sir?

365
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,120
Sir, sir, it's okay. We're the police. It's okay.

366
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,520
You want us to call an ambulance?

367
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,410
- No. - Do you need medical help? You sure?

368
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,470
I'm okay.

369
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,040
All right, let's get you up, okay?

370
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,640
You got it? Come on.

371
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,600
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. - All right.

372
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,900
You wanna tell us what happened?

373
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,090
Hold on. I need a drink.

374
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,210
That's the last time I stash money for a drug dealer.

375
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,670
That's for damn sure.

376
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,780
I'm not proud of keeping dirty cash,

377
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,720
but I won't apologize for it either.

378
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,200
I did what I had to do to keep the doors open,

379
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,430
give the people in this parish a place to come,

380
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,200
a place to pray.

381
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,080
Yeah, look, we're not here to judge or absolve.

382
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,630
We just wanna know what happened.

383
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,680
I was in here doing paperwork.

384
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,580
I look up. I see some guy in a mask

385
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,140
pointing a gun at me, telling me to open the safe,

386
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,280
like he knew I was hiding all this cash.

387
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,650
I did what he said.

388
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,480
I gave him the money, and he ran out.

389
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,300
But then I realized the dealer would think I was involved,

390
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,140
so I ran after the guy. I tackled him.

391
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,450
He tried to shoot me,

392
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,490
but ... Anyway, he ran away and drove off.

393
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,760
Well then, he drove off,

394
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,870
so who tied you up and beat you?

395
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,850
The dealer.

396
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,120
I called him up. I told him what happened.

397
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,320
Next thing I know, he's in my office punching me,

398
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,870
calling me a thief.

399
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,200
All right, what's the dealer's name?

400
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,630
A little girl got shot

401
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,160
'cause you were hiding drug money in a church.

402
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,220
So you need to start talking now.

403
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,820
Carlos, I don't care about you,

404
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,550
the cash, the priest, or the church.

405
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,060
I just wanna find the guy

406
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,040
who did the robbery and shot that little girl.

407
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,030
Now you ask me, we're on the same side on this thing, bro.

408
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,610
What are you saying?

409
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm saying I'll find him, and then I'll put him in prison,

410
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,270
and I'm done.

411
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,680
You're free to do whatever you gotta do.

412
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,570
Okay, who else knew about the money?

413
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,240
Nobody.

414
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,170
No friends? Business associates?

415
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,810
They all criminals, man.

416
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,120
Why would I tell them where I hide my cash?

417
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,620
So you telling me only you and Father Allende

418
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,010
knew about the money in the church?

419
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,860
Yeah, that's why I beat his ass.

420
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,290
He's playing me like a fool.

421
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,130
No. His story checks out.

422
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,590
After the guy took the money, he ran out,

423
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,510
Allende chased after him, tackled the guy.

424
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,770
He turned around, got off two shots, almost killed the priest.

425
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,900
Got the whole thing on tape too.

426
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,770
Sound like an inside job to you?

427
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,740
So who else knew about the money in the church?

428
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm telling you, man, I don't know.

429
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,680
All right, listen.

430
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,760
If you think of something that might be useful,

431
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,110
give me a call.

432
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,350
We got a hit on that black car?

433
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,430
Yeah, pulled video from a traffic cam

434
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,620
two blocks south of the church.

435
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,560
You run the plates?

436
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,530
Yep, it came back to a 2004 Grand Cherokee.

437
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,470
It's registered to a female Hispanic, 29 years of age.

438
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,620
She goes by the name Anna Salgado.

439
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,160
She lives at 6438 South Homan,

440
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,620
and she does have a sheet, boss.

441
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,800
Got pinched for a drug misdemeanor.

442
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,660
She also has a brother doing three years for a felony

443
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,200
and a daughter, seven years old.

444
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,650
Guess who the father is.

445
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,130
Carlos Infante.

446
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,240
The banger hiding his cash at the church.

447
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,120
Nice work. All right, bring her in.

448
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,090
I already told you.

449
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,170
I don't know anything about no robbery at no church.

450
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,950
We got a warrant for your phone.

451
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,860
We read all your texts.

452
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,920
Look, I know what's going on.

453
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,150
What's that mean?

454
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,110
It means that I know you and your baby daddy,

455
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,090
Carlos Infante, have been beefing about money

456
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,040
'cause he hasn't been providing for your daughter.

457
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,180
But you're a good mom,

458
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,560
so you took matters into your own hands,

459
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,080
took what you thought was yours.

460
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

461
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,490
Come on, Anna.

462
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,370
You and Carlos were together a long time.

463
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,710
You knew he was hiding money at the church.

464
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,750
Maybe he told you,

465
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,460
maybe you overheard him talking one day,

466
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,040
but either way, you knew.

467
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,560
Now we know you're not a criminal, we know that.

468
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,460
You don't know how to rob people.

469
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,460
You told one of your friends about this, right?

470
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,650
A friend came through,

471
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,100
did the robbery, took the cash,

472
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,130
jumped in your black Jeep, drove away.

473
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,560
Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about.

474
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,460
You understand a little girl was shot

475
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,450
about the same age as your daughter?

476
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,820
She's fighting for her life.

477
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,340
Now you tell us who was driving your car,

478
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,370
we can work out a deal,

479
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,150
keep you out of prison--

480
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,210
keep you at home with your little girl

481
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,370
instead of her growing up in foster care.

482
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,070
Now who was driving your car?

483
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,470
Somebody must've stolen it, or maybe--

484
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't be stupid!

485
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm done talking! I want a lawyer.

486
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,740
- How'd it go? - Didn't say a word.

487
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,280
Yeah, and for good measure, she lawyered up.

488
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,890
- You got enough to charge her? - Not even close.

489
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,020
Look, we do know that she's involved.

490
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,600
She tipped somebody off.

491
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,110
So let's get eyes on her. Set up outside her house.

492
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,970
Find out who she's hanging out with.

493
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,290
I'm not gonna lie to you, man,

494
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm, like, a little impressed with this Anna girl.

495
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,230
I would've bet $1,000 she was gonna roll.

496
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,940
So that says what?

497
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,700
The shooter's gotta be her boyfriend or a relative?

498
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,240
Someone she cares about, right?

499
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,050
Someone she can't just snitch on.

500
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:06,870
'Cause I'm telling you,

501
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,530
Voight, he made her a hell of an offer.

502
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,110
No jailtime, gets to keep her daughter,

503
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,220
and this girl, man, she just...

504
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Stayed stoneface. She didn't even flinch.

505
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,280
I get it, bro.

506
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,510
She's a hero.

507
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,480
Didn't roll on her homies.

508
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,140
What you talking about?

509
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm just saying, if you wanna talk about it,

510
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,340
we can talk about it.

511
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,290
There's no point in dancing around it.

512
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,910
I don't actually know what the hell you're getting at right now.

513
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,490
- Now, come on, man, let's... - Kev.

514
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,350
Are you being serious right now?

515
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,430
Look at who you're talking to. It's me.

516
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,740
I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about this Anna girl.

517
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,950
She's a single mother; she's staring down a felony

518
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,390
and is keeping her mouth shut-- that ain't easy.

519
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,390
That's all I'm getting at here.

520
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,610
You did what you did, and I have no issues with it.

521
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,450
You sure about that?

522
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,330
Absolutely. Hear me when I say that.

523
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,180
Sorry, I--I just...

524
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,870
It's all right. It's all right.

525
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,330
My bad.

526
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,920
You got a lot going on.

527
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,980
Well, go home. Get some rest.

528
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,960
All right, I'll stay here for another hour or so.

529
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,510
I can set up the camera myself.

530
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,220
All right, all right, all right, all right.

531
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,690
- You gonna be good? - Yeah.

532
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,940
Kev, what'd you end up doing with the dope?

533
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,110
I dumped it.

534
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,020
I had to get rid of that.

535
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,300
Are you sure that was the right move?

536
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,460
It was the only move.

537
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,570
Just because people are marching in the streets

538
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,470
doesn't mean that the world has changed.

539
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,390
Cops are still blue,

540
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,640
I'm still Black.

541
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,570
In trying to explain the situation,

542
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,880
she echoed the same thing I've heard over and over again:

543
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,360
the George Floyd murder was the tipping point.

544
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,540
I agree.

545
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,970
We all saw that white cop with his knee on his neck.

546
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,050
Plus all the other stuff going on.

547
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,360
Again, the virus, the shutdown...

548
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,010
Hey, I'm police. What's up, guy?

549
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,210
- You ran the stop sign. - What are you talking about?

550
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,030
Sir, you ran the stop sign. That's the reason we pulled you over.

551
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,050
No, I didn't run a stop sign.

552
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
I guess y'all just bored?

553
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,760
Saw a brother driving a decent car,

554
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,490
figured you pull his ass over, have some fun?

555
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,000
Hey, take it easy. My partner said he saw you run a stop sign.

556
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
We had no idea if you were Black or white.

557
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,060
Step out of the car.

558
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,870
Look, I'm police.

559
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,530
My name's Kevin Atwater, badge number 52784.

560
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,820
I work with the intelligence unit.

561
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,020
Y'all can check whatever you want.

562
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,870
I said, step out of the vehicle.

563
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,310
Nah, I'm not stepping out of no damn vehicle,

564
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,450
but I will show you my badge nice and slow.

565
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,860
Okay, so y'all can--

566
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,020
Okay, look, fellas, I'm stepping out of the car.

567
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,560
Shut the door.

568
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,860
I'm shutting the door. My hands are high.

569
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,060
You see my star and my gun.

570
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,860
If you look in my left pocket, you'll find my ID.

571
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,410
He's telling the truth.

572
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,870
He's the police, Ron.

573
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,150
So what you a cop?

574
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,280
I got an anonymous tip

575
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,740
that a guy was selling drugs in this car.

576
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,690
What are you talking about?

577
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,290
The guy sold a kilo of heroin to a dirty cop in a blue Dodge.

578
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,100
You with Nolan's crew?

579
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,790
Well, search the car, Ron. Look wherever you want,

580
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,060
but you ain't gonna find a damn thing

581
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,670
'cause I already found the dope.

582
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,610
It was in the trunk.

583
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,360
Is this really what you wanna do,

584
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,560
Black man?

585
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,600
You wanted to see me?

586
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,030
Yeah.

587
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,970
Shut the door.

588
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,450
So I heard you got into a beef last night

589
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,430
with a couple patrol officers.

590
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,600
More complicated than that.

591
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,940
I'm sure it is.

592
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,330
One of Nolan's boys pulled me over last night

593
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,620
hoping to find dope in my car.

594
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,910
Dope?

595
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,150
They planted a kilo of heroin in my car.

596
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,340
Why didn't you tell me?

597
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,410
Didn't want to get you involved.

598
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,360
Okay.

599
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,520
So tell me, what's your plan?

600
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,110
Going to IED?

601
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,420
I can't prove they planted the dope

602
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,810
or that they're even harassing me.

603
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,720
So I'll just sit back and wait for one of these punks

604
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,310
to screw up and leave behind some actual evidence.

605
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,870
Don't really have any other options.

606
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,910
Sure you do.

607
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,280
Kevin...

608
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,720
The blue wall is a tricky thing.

609
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,690
It's not a person or an object. It's a code.

610
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,230
You never really see it.

611
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,880
I mean, it's there, but it's not there.

612
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
You understand?

613
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,470
It's like trying to fight a ghost, Kevin.

614
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,490
I know, Sarge.

615
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,860
I just wanna do this my way.

616
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,080
Okay, so where we at with Anna Salgado?

617
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,640
Not sure--I'm meeting up with Ruzek right now

618
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,100
to check out surveillance video.

619
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,950
Hit it.

620
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,930
You know these guys are pushing their luck.

621
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,720
- They need to know that. - I told you, I'm good.

622
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,070
- No. - It's over.

623
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,990
Are you gonna talk to this punk Gaffney,

624
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,660
or am I gonna talk to him, seriously?

625
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,500
Check it out.

626
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,510
All right, well, let's run it through facial rec.

627
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,480
Miguel Cortez, he's a career punk.

628
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
He's got five priors, two armed robberies,

629
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,090
two ag bats, one attempted murder,

630
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,610
six or seven drug charges.

631
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,770
- Hailey... - Yeah.

632
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,070
Pull up the surveillance video from the church.

633
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,450
Okay.

634
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,510
Is that Miguel?

635
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,050
Looks like him. Same height, same build.

636
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,190
- It's just not clear enough. - Yeah, but come on.

637
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,310
We all know it's him. It makes perfect sense.

638
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,630
He's dating Anna,

639
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,890
she's complaining about not getting child support,

640
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,590
she gets fed up,

641
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,260
she tells Miguel where the dope money's stashed at St. Angela's.

642
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,310
Yeah, and he grabs a gun and a mask.

643
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,290
He sets out to commit the easiest robbery of his life.

644
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:13,900
Exactly.

645
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,560
Hey, good news. After we ID'd Miguel,

646
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,490
we pulled video of his last known address.

647
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,580
Good.

648
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,490
That's Miguel entering his house

649
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,580
45 minutes after the robbery and shooting.

650
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,800
Same pants and shoes,

651
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,690
and he's carrying the same bag we saw in the other video.

652
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,640
So let's get a warrant. Scoop his ass up.

653
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
Right.

654
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,540
I've got up top.

655
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,480
Did you hear him?

656
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,030
Announce your office and hit that door.

657
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,100
Be ready.

658
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,290
Upstairs window.

659
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,170
We just got made.

660
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,110
Chicago PD!

661
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,040
Hey, put your hands on the table.

662
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,790
Hands on the table.

663
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,940
Ma'am, walk towards me. Walk towards me.

664
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,800
Keep your hands where I can see them.

665
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Sit down. Put your hands on the table.

666
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,100
- Hands on the table. - Come on.

667
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,360
I got you. Go.

668
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,510
All right, it's all right.

669
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,200
Stop, put your hands on your head and walk towards me.

670
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,190
- Ruz, I got a runner! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

671
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,070
It's over, Miguel.

672
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,290
Get your hands up.

673
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,440
Now.

674
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,240
Be smart, man.

675
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,400
Put your hands up nice and high.

676
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,940
Don't make this hard on yourself.

677
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,390
You wanna die?

678
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,400
'Cause I won't ask again.

679
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,570
Hands behind your back.

680
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,400
Here we go.

681
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,070
We got about 50K in here, maybe more.

682
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,300
Best part is,

683
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,270
Miguel left it in the church collection bag.

684
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,300
The St. Angela's logo on it and everything.

685
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,030
Nice.

686
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,410
Book it into evidence, will you?

687
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,520
Copy that.

688
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,410
You talked to Kev about all this Doyle business?

689
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,450
A little. You?

690
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm trying. He's shutting me out.

691
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,310
He's having a hard time, boss.

692
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,290
These guys, they're playing too rough.

693
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,970
They're just getting started.

694
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,770
He did what he had to do.

695
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,920
It's different for him. It just is.

696
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,720
You know, being a Black cop here in Chicago these days.

697
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,730
Can't be easy.

698
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,180
Go on in.

699
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,060
Ma'am.

700
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,540
We got a problem.

701
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,940
Kay, I don't know what you're talking about.

702
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,550
I just watched the bodycam footage of Miguel Cortez's arrest.

703
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,310
You kicked down the damn door without announcing your office.

704
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,670
That's because we got made.

705
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,580
I just spoke to the state's attorney's office.

706
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,040
They've determined the entry improper,

707
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,510
so all the evidence recovered is inadmissible.

708
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,010
Okay, look, I get it.

709
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,440
Nobody wants to hand out no-knocks these days.

710
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,480
We had a warrant to enter the premises

711
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,650
and apprehend the offender.

712
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,980
You're not hearing me.

713
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,400
You entered the premises

714
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,010
without announcing your office.

715
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,210
There were women and children in there.

716
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,010
It could've gone bad a hundred different ways.

717
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,380
But it didn't.

718
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,950
Like I said before, Sergeant,

719
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,370
I want you to succeed more than you know.

720
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,360
But the days of playing God are over.

721
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,320
The quicker you understand that, the better.

722
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,940
Right or wrong, there's nothing we can do.

723
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,900
All the evidence has been tossed.

724
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,680
You guys, I'm sorry. I saw the blinds move.

725
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,280
I don't know what I was supposed to do.

726
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,350
Adam, no, listen to me, you did the right thing.

727
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,760
What I'm trying to tell you is, it doesn't matter.

728
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,780
You get it?

729
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,240
The reality is,

730
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,210
no one's got the guts to stand up for police right now.

731
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,000
Not the mayor, not the white shirts in the ivory tower.

732
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,010
No one.

733
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,600
Get used to it.

734
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,740
Okay, so...

735
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,240
the only real evidence we have now

736
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,420
is that video of Miguel entering his house

737
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,280
carrying the bag.

738
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,390
Same bag he was carrying when he tried to shoot the priest.

739
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,980
Yeah, I get it, but try proving it's the same bag.

740
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,800
I mean, a black bag is a black bag.

741
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,940
We gotta start all over from the beginning,

742
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,520
build a whole new case.

743
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,260
So find more surveillance video,

744
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,780
new witnesses.

745
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,590
Meantime, I'm gonna talk to Miguel.

746
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,270
I can still let him know how much evidence we have.

747
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,500
For God's sakes, bro,

748
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,390
the collection bags are marked St. Angela's.

749
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,250
It doesn't get any better than that.

750
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

751
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,110
Your girlfriend told you about the money

752
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,550
because Carlos stopped providing for their daughter,

753
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
and honestly?

754
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't even blame her.

755
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,120
I mean, that guy makes a lot of money selling dope.

756
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,010
Least he can do is break off a few grand

757
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,700
every month for his little girl.

758
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,550
I told you. I didn't do it.

759
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,720
You stole the money, you ran out,

760
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,600
the priest chased after you,

761
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,390
he tried to tackle you,

762
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,950
so you opened fire.

763
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,830
That's what happened.

764
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,860
You know, the fact that you were so close

765
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,210
and you missed,

766
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,510
that tells me you probably just trying to scare the guy.

767
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,320
But see, the problem is, Miguel,

768
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,620
the reason we're all so upset

769
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,340
is one of your bullets hit a 5-year-old girl.

770
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,110
She's fighting for her life right now at Chicago Med.

771
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,050
Chicago is a-- it's a dangerous place.

772
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,650
You confess to the robbery

773
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,330
and the shooting,

774
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,190
you can cut yourself a deal.

775
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,040
You understand?

776
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,950
But you wait, play the long game,

777
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,350
you try and take this thing to trial,

778
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,710
state's attorney is gonna nail your ass to a cross.

779
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,920
- I want my lawyer. - What is the matter with you?

780
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,470
Yo, I'm done talking!

781
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,480
Heard what happened with the search.

782
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,610
- Yeah, well, it is what it is. - New world.

783
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,050
Everybody's paying attention to the fine print all of a sudden.

784
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,810
- Where is he? - In there.

785
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,930
Mr. Diaz, what can I do for you?

786
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,160
You tell me you caught the person who killed my little girl.

787
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,370
You're saying...

788
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,760
She died an hour ago.

789
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,880
Oh, my God.

790
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,040
I'm--I'm so sorry.

791
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,550
Did you arrest the killer?

792
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,220
We're still working on that,

793
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,540
but the good news is,

794
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,440
we know who did it.

795
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,000
We just need a little more evidence, build a better case.

796
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,850
If you know who did it, isn't that enough?

797
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,100
Doesn't that mean you already have a good case?

798
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,800
Sometimes the law is complicated.

799
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
No, it's simple.

800
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,590
It is real simple.

801
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,300
So who killed her? Who killed her?

802
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,420
- Who is he? - I can't tell you that.

803
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,330
Who is he? Where is he?

804
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,990
If you don't take care of this, I will!

805
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,140
Sir, please!

806
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,100
No. My little girl is dead.

807
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,780
And I want that son of a bitch who killed her to go down,

808
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,770
- to pay for what he did! - So do I.

809
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,800
And I promise you I will do everything I can.

810
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,620
But it's, it's just...

811
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,760
Grab Miguel and put him in a cage.

812
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,500
Boss, you sure that's a good idea?

813
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,400
- Excuse me? - Sarge, I mean...

814
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,520
come on, things are different now.

815
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,360
I'll do what you need me to do--

816
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,120
Laura Diaz just died.

817
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,700
Five years old.

818
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,070
The prick who pulled the trigger's sitting right in there.

819
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,290
Doesn't matter.

820
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,630
Of course it matters. He killed her.

821
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,180
I know he did, we all know he did,

822
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,200
but we can't just drag his ass down to a cage.

823
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,160
We done with all that--

824
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,530
- Oh, yeah, says who? - Guys, let's not do this.

825
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,520
Says me.

826
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,070
You calling the shots now, Kev?

827
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,150
No, but I know we can't keep bringing people down

828
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,700
to a cage and beating they ass

829
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,450
because we think they know something

830
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,880
or did something. Those days are over.

831
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,540
You don't like the way I do business?

832
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,400
I'm not woke enough for you?

833
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,660
You feel free to get the hell out.

834
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,470
Well, Sarge, this is your unit.

835
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,070
I'm proud to work here,

836
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,450
but things have definitely changed.

837
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,860
That means that we gotta change too.

838
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,780
Yeah, you wanna be a Boy Scout?

839
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,120
You wanna be a Boy Scout!?

840
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,530
Maybe you should get yourself another job!

841
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,020
I'll tell you what, you're right about one thing--

842
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,970
this is my unit!

843
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,510
And in my unit, we do what we gotta do

844
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,370
to put bad guys away!

845
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,400
Whatever it takes!
