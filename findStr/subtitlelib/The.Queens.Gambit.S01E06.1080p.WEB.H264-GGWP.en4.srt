356
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,125
likely die with my head on a chessboard."

[all laugh]

358
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,083
Miss Harmon, what do you say
to those in the Chess Federation

359
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,500
who accuse you of being too glamorous

360
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,166
to be a serious chess player?

361
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,708
I would say
that it's much easier to play chess

362
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,708
without the burden of an Adam's apple.

363
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,000
[all chuckle]

364
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,875
So, how are you feeling
about your match with Alec Bergland?

365
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,333
[Beth] I'm looking forward to it.

366
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,583
[reporter 2]
Does that mean you think you can beat him?

367
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,416
It means that I have to beat him.

368
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:13,166
Miss Harmon, do you feel good
about rematch with Grandmaster Borgov?

369
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,666
[Beth] Very good.

370
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,500
I slept on the plane,
so I arrived in Paris with no jet lag.

371
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,250
I'm very well rested.

372
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,541
At night, I stay in my room,
and study Mr. Borgov's old games.

373
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
Including the one against you
in Mexico City?

374
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,208
[in Russian] Especially that one.

375
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,000
[director, in French] The time control
is 40 moves in two and half hours.

376
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,416
Any questions?

377
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,000
Very well.

378
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,416
Good luck to each of you.

379
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,333
May the best man,

380
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,333
or woman,

381
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,583

to have an autograph?

[in French] Tomorrow, it's you…

390
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,375
…against Grandmaster Borgov.

Hello?

395
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,208
[woman] What, you thought you could sneak
into town without me knowing?

396
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,000
Who is this?

397
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,583
And now you insult me.

398
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,291
-Cleo?
-A very sad Cleo.

399
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,666
[laughs] I'm sorry. I was just…

400
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,916
-Where are you?
-Downstairs.

401
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,791
-Here?
-I thought you might come down

402
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,000
and join me for a drink.

403
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,125
I have a match tomorrow.

404
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,000
One drink, and then you go back up
and resume your rigors.

405
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,875
It's the final.

406
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,041
I should probably sleep.

407
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,250
Of course you should.

408
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,708
I understand.

409
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,750
But maybe tomorrow night?

410
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,083
Well, who knows
where I'll be so far in the future?

411
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,833
But, um, I wish you luck in your match.

412
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,125
Thank you.

413
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,500
You know, it's a lovely bar.

414
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,000
I think I'll go toast
your success on my own.

415
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,833

Hi.

419
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,000
So, the pretty girl has taste
to go with her other gifts, huh?

420
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,000
You make me sick, you know.

421
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,875
Thank you, so do you.

422
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,333
Now, just one drink.

423
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,416
I wanna get to bed early.

424
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,041
Okay.

425
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,208
So, what will you have then,
for your one drink?

426
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,750
Must be special if it is your only one.

427
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,291
What are you having?

428
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,833
It's called pastis.

429
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,916
Very Parisian, very ordinary.

430
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,041
Here, try it.

431
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,583
Tastes like licorice.

432
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,500
Mmm.

433
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,833
The anise.

434
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,833
I like it.

435
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,208
-[Beth] I could see myself living here.
-[Cleo] I could see it, too.

436
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,041
A little pied-à-terre
on the Rue des Capucines,

437
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,583
or the Boulevard Raspail.

438
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,625
In a few years, I'll be world champion.

439
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,541
I can live wherever I want.

440
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
It will be much sooner than that.

441
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,125
If I lived here…

442
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,666
I would go to plays, and concerts, and…

443
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,250
I would eat lunch
in a different cafe every day. [laughs]

444
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,666
And I would dress the way
that women do here, you know?

445
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,291
So smart with their nice dresses,
and their perfect haircuts.

446
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,666
You already have
so much more than they do.

447
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,000
And something that none of them have.

448
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:36,958
Talent.

449
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,666
And that can give you a life
that anyone would envy.

450
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,000
There's nothing keeping me in Kentucky.

451
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,875
The possibilities are endless.

452
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,291
And one of those possibilities
is staring at you.

453
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,000
No, they're looking at you.

454
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
I think not.

455
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,000
You are very beautiful.

456
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,250
-I don't see myself that way.
-Then you are blind.

457
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,291
Do you like to fuck?

458
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,833
-Cleo!
-What?

459
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,291
I make it easier for you.
Did you like to fuck Benny?

460
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,666
Sometimes.

461
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,208
How romantic. [scoffs]

462
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,875
And have you ever been in love?

463
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:23,791
Not with Benny.

464
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,708
Of course not.

465
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,875
No woman can compete
with Benny's love for himself.

466
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,791
So, we are still in love?

467
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,250
What's his name?

468
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,333
Townes.

469
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,833
To unrequited love.

470
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,791
And to stupid men.

471
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,416
Exactly.

472
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,916

[Beth] I wasn't drunk.

504
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,583
[Benny] Or hungover, then.

505

[Beth] I could have been stone-cold sober.

506

It wouldn't have made
the slightest difference.

How sweet it must be.

536
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,958
What is it I can do for you,
Mr. Chennault?

537
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,791
Uh, it's, uh, it's Wheatley.
He doesn't wanna sign.

538
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,333
Sign what?

539
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,000
Title for the house.

540
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,333
Can you get over here
so we can work it out?

541
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,958
I don't see why you would need me.
You're the lawyer.

542
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,958
And he said he would sign
whatever was necessary, so…

543
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,791
Oh, well, apparently,
he's changed his mind.

[Dick] Beth.

547
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,458
Mr. Wheatley has a proposal.

548
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,041
You can live here while you're looking
for something permanent.

549
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,458
I thought I could keep the house
if I made the payments.

550
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,583
Uh, Mr. Wheatley…

551
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,208
says you misconstrued him.

552
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,541
He, uh, claims he was just permitting you
to stay in the house, uh…

553
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,250
until you got settled.

554
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,916
That's not true.

555
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,666
He said I could have it.

556
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,250
Remember?

557
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,875
Can't you even look at me?

558
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,500
-You adopted me. Can't you talk to me?
-Alma.

559
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,666
-Alma wanted a child.
-[Beth] You signed the papers.

560
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,250
-You took on a responsibility.
-Alma wanted to adopt you, not me.

561
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,875
You're not entitled to everything I own,

562
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,041
just 'cause I signed
some papers to shut her up.

563
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,291
Not that it worked.

564
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,458
You adopted me.

565
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,083
I didn't ask you to.

566
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,166
-You're my legal father.
-The money in this house is mine!

567
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,875
No smart-assed orphan
is gonna take it away from me.

568
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,708
Oh, I'm not an orphan.
I'm your daughter.

569
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,166
Not in my book, you aren't.

570
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,500
I don't give a shit
what your goddamn lawyer says.

571
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,000
Or what Alma said, either.
That woman could not keep her mouth shut.

572
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,375
I thought the piano would help, it didn't.

573
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:23,875
So, here you are.

574
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,000
It's all so pathetic.

575
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,916
Did you ever hear her play?

576
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,333
Of course.

577
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,250
Yes, but did you ever really listen?

578
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:39,125
Alma was not pathetic,
she was stuck. There's a difference.

579
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,125
She didn't know how to get out of it.

580
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:42,750
Pathetic, well…

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,208

What do you want from Beth, Mr. Wheatley?

583
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,000
-I want her out. I'm selling the house.
-Sell it to me.

584
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:56,958
What are you talking about?

585
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:58,791
I'll buy it.

586
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,166
I'll pay whatever your equity is.

587
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,583
-No, it's worth more than that now.
-How much more?

588
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,791
I'd need 7,000.

589
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,416
Your equity is less than five.

590
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,750
It's seven. I'll show you the receipts.

591
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,000
Fine.

592
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,291
Seven thousand.

593
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,750
-You have that much?
-[Beth] Yes.

594
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:25,500
But I will be subtracting
what I paid to bury Mother.

595
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,791
I'll show you the receipts.
