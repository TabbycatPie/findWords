13
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,780
My name is Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,040
After five years in hell,

15
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,380
I have come home with only one goal--

16
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,550
to save my city.

17
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,740
Now others have joined my crusade.

18
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,790
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

19
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,980
But to the rest of Starling City,

20
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,310
I am someone else.

21
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,620
I am something else.

22
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,390
Previously, on "Arrow"...

23
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,130
My name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.

24
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,600
Welcome to Hong Kong.

26
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,810
Amanda Waller wants you working for her.

27
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,280
She will have her way.

28
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,110
You're Felicity Smoak.

29
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,460
I know a guy who might be interested

30
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,050
in hiring someone with your expertise.

31
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,780
Apparently there's another bidder for the company.

32
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,310
- Who? - Ray Palmer.

33
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,280
What are you doing here?

34
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,900
No! No! Sara!

35
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,650
Sara!

36
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,950
No! No!

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,320
Felicity, all I'm trying to do is make things easier on you.

39
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
By having me completely

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,860
reconfigure our phone system?

41
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,900
Do you even know how difficult it is

42
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,860
to ping a clone off a hacked transband multiplex?

43
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,700
No, but only because you weren't speaking English just now.

44
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,570
Sara?

45
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,090
I didn't know where else to take her.

46
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, my God!

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,000
- What happened? - I couldn't...

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,790
I couldn't leave her.

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,830
We have to call... we can...

50
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,430
take her to the hospital!

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
Ollie, it's not fair!

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,390
We just got her back, it's not fair!

53
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,570
I'm so sorry.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,150
I'm so sorry.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,380
We'll take our position here.

58
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,520
Who's your target?

59
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,050
I don't have a target.

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,640
- You do. - What?

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,870
Might have escaped your notice,

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,410
But Amanda Waller doesn't have a sense of humor.

63
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,510
Oh, really?

64
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,060
Then why'd she drag me off of Lian Yu

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,300
and bring me all the way to Hong Kong

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,340
- To become her hit man? - To become her operative.

67
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,820
Obviously she needs you for something

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,200
or she wouldn't be threatening my family

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,750
to assure your compliance.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,810
The target will be entering our line any moment.

71
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,610
The target will walk 10 paces through the roof garden

72
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,220
and arrive at his hotel suite.

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,830
That's your window.

74
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,340
I see it.

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,110
Now.

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,750
Tommy?

77
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,730
You know, Sara used to have a stuffed animal.

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,300
It was this old, worn out shark

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,200
that she got from the Starling Aquarium.

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,860
Every time something awful would happen to her,

81
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,010
I would always find her holding that stupid little shark

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,850
close to her chest.

83
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,700
And now that my sister's dead,

84
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,260
Again the only thing that I can think about

85
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,370
is finding that dumb stuffed animal

86
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,730
and putting it in her arms.

87
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,630
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,340
You have nothing to apologize for.

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,840
Hey, whoever did this,

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,220
I'm going to find them.

91
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,700
We're going to.

92
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,810
When I thought that Sara died on "The Gambit,"

93
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,310
the only thing that I could do

94
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,810
was scream at the ocean.

95
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,560
I had so much anger and rage,

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,310
and I didn't know what to do with it.

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,340
But I do now.

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,870
And I'm going to help you catch

99
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,660
whoever it is that did this.

100
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,670
You're already helping.

101
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,870
Laurel...

102
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,810
you told us where to look.

103
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm just supposed to sit here and wait?

104
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,430
No. Now you take care of yourself and your family.

105
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,050
Your father is going to need you.

106
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,920
Telling him now, it would kill him.

107
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,040
At least now if we wait until we catch whoever did this,

108
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,650
it'll be easier on him.

109
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,200
Ok.

110
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,350
Where are you going?

111
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,370
I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,860
But I know that a bar is the last place I should be.

113
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,540
Come on, pick up.

114
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,830
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

115
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,090
Thea, it's Oliver.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,160
I know you're still traveling, but I just, I could really...

117
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,290
I'd really like to hear your voice.

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,020
So please call me back.

119
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,700
What'd we get off the cameras?

120
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
Place is a drug haven.

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,940
They've all either been disabled

122
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,890
or paint-balled by local dealers.

123
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,730
Where are you going?

124
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,910
Where it happened.

125
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,390
Felicity told me.

126
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,350
You OK?

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,350
Killer stood there,

128
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,350
loose gravel on the rooftop.

129
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,150
- Oliver... - Sara was here.

130
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Scuff marks back to the edge.

131
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,210
You don't have to do this right now, man.

132
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,560
It's the only thing that I can do.

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,590
Listen, I get it. Military training.

134
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,480
Stay on task.

135
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,540
Your friend gets shot, you just keep fighting.

136
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,200
- But Oliver... - I'm fine.

137
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,030
Well, I'm here for you just the same.

138
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,280
Listen, Sara was my friend, too.

139
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,940
And if you think you're going after the person who did this solo,

140
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,630
You couldn't possibly be more wrong.

141
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,260
- Yeah? - Detective Lance called, he says it's important.

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,630
Do you think he knows about Sara?

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,030
What is it, detective?

144
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,070
You ok?

145
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,770
You look like someone peed in your cornflakes.

146
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,480
That kind of day, huh?

147
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,140
What's going on?

148
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,570
Another archer in town.

149
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,500
Dropping bodies.

150
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,200
- Seen this guy's work before? - I might have.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,380
You know where SCPD's finest might find him?

152
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,240
- Who's the victim? - John Burke.

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,810
Some corporate financier from Qurac.

154
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,610
Seems like he wandered into the wrong part of town

155
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,980
Tonight looking for a little local "Entertainment."

156
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,220
He ended up with an arrow to the chest.

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,880
You watch your back, all right? Whoever this guy is...

158
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,050
He's a killer.

159
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,780
Her hands are so small.

160
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,300
I never noticed before.

161
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,550
She was always so strong and brave.

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,370
I always envisioned her as this sort of

163
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,890
amazonian warrior.

164
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,640
Invincible.

165
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,090
Something I could never be.

166
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,360
I was so jealous.

167
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,280
Hi. I know I was supposed to come into work today.

168
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,180
I--the--I'm sorry.

169
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,970
There's been a death in the family.

170
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,960
Thank you.

171
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,960
You have any idea what other archer could have done this?

172
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,180
There aren't that many of us.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
Maybe 10 that I know of,

174
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,650
and most of them are in the League of Assassins.

175
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,670
Oliver, you don't think...

176
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,080
No. No.

177
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,440
They don't target their own.

178
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,900
- What'd you find out? - He hit again.

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,240
An abandoned warehouse on the corner of Third and Lemire.

180
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,790
Ninth floor. The victim was a construction foreman, Tim Kauffman.

181
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,270
Security cameras can't get an angle.

182
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,710
- Who's that? - Just some low level dealers

183
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,600
that set up shop in abandoned warehouses.

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,820
Doesn't look like much of an archer to me.

185
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,260
- He might be a witness.  - Where do you want me?

186
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,580
Will Lyla give you access to A.R.G.U.S.'s database?

187
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,960
To find out who did this, Lyla will give us access to A.R.G.U.S.

188
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,990
I need a list of everyone on their

189
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,430
radar--assassins and mercenaries who use a bow.

190
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,490
I'm on it.

191
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,780
What?

192
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,930
Uh, Thea hasn't called back yet.

193
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,320
You didn't eliminate the target!

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,880
That's not a target, that's my best friend!

195
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,510
Why am I pointing a gun at my best friend?

196
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,670
Is this some sort of test?

197
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Yes. One you failed!

198
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,390
Good. Flunk me.

199
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,510
You think it's a coincidence your friend just happened

200
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,910
to show up in Hong Kong?

201
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,860
- He's here looking for you! - What?

202
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,490
When you logged into your email, it set off an account alert.

203
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,640
Dead men don't check their email, Oliver.

204
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,250
Oh, so this is my fault?

205
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,950
Waller needs you. She can't let you be compromised

206
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,680
by some rich kid flashing your picture all over Hong Kong.

207
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,160
Whether you're the one who pulls the trigger or not,

208
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
she wants Tommy Merlyn off the board.

210
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,090
That is a cobalt encrypted workstation.

211
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,110
You better not be using it to tweet.

212
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,810
I was--I was, um, actually just...

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,470
Accessing an FBI database? What...

215
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,330
Roy, why are you looking for Thea?

216
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,740
Because I don't think she is where she says she is.

217
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,930
Why would she lie?

219
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,470
Roy, Oliver needs to see this.

220
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,800
No. This is my fault. He's going to kill me.

221
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,670
- What if she's in trouble? - What if she's not?

222
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,200
What if she just needs space?

223
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,340
She's had five months

224
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,330
and thousands of miles of space.

225
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,940
Oliver needs to see this.

226
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,790
You need to show it to him.

227
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,510
You have got to be kidding me.

228
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,960
What--where are you going?

229
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,440
There's someone I need to kill.

230
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,600
Did you do it to make a point?

231
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,890
Because I get it. Loud and clear.

232
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,760
You are rich. You are impulsive.

233
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,300
And frankly, you are the creepiest form of stalker

234
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,720
that I have ever had to deal with,

235
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,070
and believe me when I'm telling you that that is saying a lot,

236
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,800
and--what are you doing to our old offices?

237
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,390
Hi. I'll be right back.

238
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,810
You like it? Yeah, I'm just trying

239
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,970
to liven up the place a bit.

240
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm hosting an event tonight.

241
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,730
A pledge drive of sorts.

242
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,610
Got to make an impression, right?

243
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,030
Now, what can I do for you?

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,750
You can stop. You can stop sending me flowers,

245
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,630
And you can stop texting me and calling me and emailing me,

246
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,960
because I spam them, anyway.

247
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, is "spam" a verb now?

248
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,930
Because I am never, ever, ever going to work for you.

249
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,750
Actually, you already do.

250
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Only because you bought the store that I work at!

251
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,000
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did!

252
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,660
My boss just called and told me that you did.

253
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,490
Well, he's wrong--kind of.

254
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,320
I bought the holding company which owns and operates

255
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,050
all 20,000 tech village stores.

256
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,090
But I guess either way,

257
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,330
yes, I am your boss now.

258
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,280
So you can either work for me here

259
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,180
in a big office with a big salary,

260
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,740
or... you can work for me there,

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
in that awful uniform.

262
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,910
Or... I can quit.

263
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,380
Which is what I just did.

264
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,000
You know, most girls would be flattered

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,270
that I spent $1.2 billion to hire them.

266
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,980
Even if I do have a fairly genius plan

267
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,660
for revamping the stores.

268
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,210
In case you haven't noticed, I am not most girls.

269
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,500
And I don't need this.

270
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,320
Or you.

271
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,800
Or any of this.

272
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,760
Felicity, I--I piss people off on a daily basis.

273
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,400
It's part of business, and, well,

274
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,110
being the smartest guy in any given room.

275
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,880
I own that.

276
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,990
So I have enough experience with people being angry with me

277
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,390
to know when they're really angry at something else.

278
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,550
You right now are not angry at me.

279
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,570
What's your something else?

280
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, money won't fix this problem.

281
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,750
Money won't solve most problems.

282
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,850
Not the ones that matter.

283
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,300
But talking helps.

284
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,870
I know we barely know each other...

285
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm going to leave now.

286
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,610
Listen, whatever happened,

287
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,330
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,800
It helps to remember that... it gets better.

289
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,340
Someone was murdered here.

290
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,030
Tell me what you saw.

291
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,140
I saw nothing.

292
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,410
There was a black face mask,

293
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,340
like a--like a hockey mask.

294
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,810
Now, please, man--

295
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,060
Diggle, are you at A.R.G.U.S.?

296
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,990
I've got something.

297
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,370
Yeah, I'm here.

298
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,950
I got a list of archers 20-long, man.

299
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,360
How many of them wear masks?

300
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,700
Only one.

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,800
Simon Lacroix. Mercenary.

303
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,640
Goes by "Komodo."

304
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,050
Send Felicity everything.

305
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,780
Yep.

306
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,500
Oliver, I'm opening up the file now.

307
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,990
Is that him?

308
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,730
Simon Lacroix. Born in Sainte-Sophie, Quebec.

309
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,770
Raised by a single mom. Terrible credit score.

310
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,300
And wanted for murder in seven countries.

311
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,440
- I need his location. - One minute.

312
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,940
Put him on speaker.

313
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,040
Ok, indexing all active burner cell phones within the city limits.

314
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,190
There's got to be 10,000 phones.

315
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,840
Yes, but how many are making calls to dear old mom

316
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,300
in Saint-Sophie, Quebec?

317
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,820
I got him. He's on the move.

318
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,450
I found Lacroix.

319
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,760
I need to see what's happening.

320
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,420
Ok.

321
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,950
Blowing up street camera feed.

322
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,360
Oliver, what's happening?

323
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,380
Come on, Ollie.

324
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,530
- Get up. - Oliver? Are you OK?

325
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,680
Oliver?

326
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,540
Oliver? Are you OK?

327
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,060
He got away.

328
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I had him, Diggle.

329
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,930
The way you look, he almost had you.

330
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,350
Where's Roy?

331
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,630
He's out canvassing.

332
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,910
Tell me about the driver of the car.

333
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,080
His name is Erlich Kelso.

334
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,690
He just got out of Starling General--

335
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,350
And where are we with Lacroix?

336
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,240
He ditched his burner.

337
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,020
I'm searching the city for any calls made to Quebec.

338
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,250
We used that to track him once;

339
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,420
he's not going to let it happen again.

340
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,290
All right, so why don't we stop searching for Lacroix

341
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,330
and start searching for his target?

342
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,920
Because there must be a connection with his victims.

343
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,970
Already on it.

344
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,200
I mean, what if we just-- we go to a local morgue

345
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,570
and we find a body that looks like Tommy's?

346
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,600
At the Hong Kong morgue?

347
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,170
You've got a better chance of winning the lottery

348
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,840
and trying to pay Waller off.

349
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,340
I am not going to assassinate my best friend,

350
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,000
do you understand? There has to be another way.

351
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,810
There is.

352
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,830
But it involves Amanda Waller

353
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,370
finding someone else to execute your friend.

354
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,970
No no, not you, dad.

355
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,380
Look, I'm already in Hong Kong.

356
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,190
No! No, I didn't tell you I was taking the jet

357
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,000
because I knew you would freak out like this.

358
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,420
No, I don't know how long, OK? It doesn't matter.

359
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,910
Listen, if Oliver is still alive,

360
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,850
if he is still here--

361
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,090
Look, why don't you just go back to banging your Pilates instructor, OK?

362
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,980
I'll just be here searching for my best friend.

363
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,980
I'm sorry, miss. You can't go in there.

364
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,480
Laurel Lance. I'm with the district attorney's office.

365
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,270
Erlich Kelso is a witness of my ongoing investigation.

366
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,110
Mr. Kelso's under protective custody.

367
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,700
Not from me. And if you have a problem with that,

368
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,080
you can call your captain.

369
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,150
Tell him his daughter says hello.

370
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,150
Who are you?

371
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,630
I work in the D.A's office.

372
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,340
I already told the police, I don't know anything.

373
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,450
I still have to ask you a few questions.

374
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,980
- Why isn't this working? - It is.

375
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,100
It's running an N.S.A. algorithm aggregating

376
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,900
the victims' personal information using

377
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,510
every government database known, and unknown.

378
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,200
Well, it's taking too long. Sara's killer is still out there,

379
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,160
which means that every minute that we waste down here--

380
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,340
I know! You don't need to tell me,

381
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,350
as if I don't already know.

382
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,640
You're right.

383
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,020
And I apologize. I just need your A game right now, Felicity.

384
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,740
I don't have it!

385
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,050
My friend--our friend--

386
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,890
Was shot with arrows and fell off of a rooftop.

387
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,850
Her body is upstairs right above us in a freezer

388
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,390
Because we don't know what to do with it--

389
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,920
with her.

390
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,450
So I am so sorry, Oliver,

391
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,040
if I have feelings, but maybe if you did, too, we...

392
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,700
Sorry.

393
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,110
That was mean. But this is Sara we're talking about.

394
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,520
Your Sara.

395
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,460
How can you stand there being so cold

396
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,840
and rational?

397
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,040
'Cause I don't have the luxury of falling to pieces.

398
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,640
Everyone's looking to me to handle things,

399
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
to make the right decisions.

400
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,070
Everyone is looking to me...

401
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,330
to lead.

402
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,640
If I grieve,

403
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,580
nobody else gets to.

404
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,620
You're still a human being, Oliver.

405
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,000
You're allowed to have feelings.

406
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,490
I know sometimes that it's easier

407
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,980
to live under that hood.

408
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,130
I'm not.

409
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,790
Earlier today, I was looking at Sara,

410
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,820
I realized something.

411
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,420
One of these days it's going to be me.

412
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,570
And this...

413
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,190
this life that I've chosen...

414
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,750
it only ends one way.

415
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,300
So that's it?

416
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,570
You're just going to spend your life

417
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,150
hiding down here in this cave,

418
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,080
waiting to die? I'm sorry.

419
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,500
I'm not going to wait with you,

420
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,240
because if there's one thing that today has taught me,

421
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,680
is that life is precious.

422
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,920
And I want so much more in mine than this.

423
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,590
Let's start with the obvious.

424
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,820
Why would someone want to kill you?

425
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,120
I have no idea.

426
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,870
This whole thing, it's insane.

427
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,330
Mr. Kelso, despite what you may have heard,

428
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,290
homicides at the hands of a stranger

429
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,940
are incredibly rare.

430
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,530
Imagine how rare homicides by bow and arrow are.

431
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,140
Yeah, the guy was a sicko.

432
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,420
And you're a liar.

433
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,000
- I'm the victim here. - You're also a witness--

434
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,860
My witness. And you better give me something useful,

435
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,390
otherwise you're going to be facing an obstruction charge.

436
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,890
You know, I think I want to talk to your boss,

437
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,470
because you can't treat people like this.

438
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,290
Oh, really, you want to talk to my boss?

439
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,480
How's your arm feeling?!

440
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,930
What are you doing?!

441
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,590
John Burke and Tim Kaufman,

442
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,600
they were also shot by with arrows.

443
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,030
And they're too dead to tell me why.

444
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,160
Can't.

445
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,320
Burke and Kaufman!

446
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,460
What do the two of them have to do with you?

447
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,870
We were all working on a deal!

448
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,640
But nobody was supposed to know about it.

449
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,530
What kind of deal?

450
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,440
To build an oil pipe line,

451
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,110
for AmerTek. It's--

452
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,850
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

453
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,070
Hey, Thea, it's me. Again.

454
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,570
And I don't know if you're getting these messages,

455
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,110
but I would really like to talk to you.

456
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,840
So please, just...

457
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,150
call me back.

458
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,060
Bye.

459
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,830
Lyla has multiple teams trying to get an angle on Lacroix.

460
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,180
Where's Felicity?

461
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,380
She needed some air.

462
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,140
And what do you need, Oliver?

463
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,410
I just need Thea to call me back.

464
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,110
That's not going to happen.

465
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,840
Why? What do you mean?

467
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,300
It was during the siege.

468
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,380
We were going to run away together,

469
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,210
but I couldn't leave without helping you fight.

470
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,670
And when I came back, she was gone.

471
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,450
I didn't say anything because this is my fault.

472
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,410
She knew I was lying to her the entire time.

473
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about the letter.

474
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,530
I know that I should have.

475
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,170
OK.

476
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,120
Felicity, I really need to talk to you,

477
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,530
so please, can you...

478
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,210
call me back as soon as you get this.

479
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,980
Laurel! Baby, are you all right?

480
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,760
- Are you hurt? - I'm fine.

481
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,360
Baby, a guy just got skewered right in front of you.

482
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,640
I hope you're not fine.

483
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,740
And what the hell were you doing here in the first place?

484
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,770
The District Attorney's office--

485
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,790
Did not send you.

486
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,020
You lied to my officers and now what,

487
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,700
you're just going to stand there

488
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,330
and you're going to lie to me?

489
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,200
I needed to talk to him. It was important.

490
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,450
Look, sweetie, I know you want to help,

491
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,840
but you don't need to take these kind of risks,

492
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,170
You understand? Pretty sure your sister's

493
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,030
got that covered for the both of you.

494
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,490
Yeah.

495
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,400
Go home. We got this.

496
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,500
Ok?

497
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,390
I've got something. Meet me at Verdant.

498
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,030
AmerTek Industries.

499
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,760
It's an oil company based in Starling City.

500
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,350
Ok. Now that I've consolidated

501
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,650
all of Lacroix's victim's records,

502
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,360
I can run the algorithm, scan the data

503
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,900
and see who received money from AmerTek.

504
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,670
- How long does that take? - Not long.

505
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,680
Three to Kelso, one more to Burke,

506
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,510
two more to Kaufman.

507
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,080
All from a subsidiary from AmerTek in Qurac,

508
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,950
which just happens to be

509
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,720
the largest untapped oil field on the planet.

510
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,930
Yeah. Looks like AmerTek was trying to strike an oil deal.

511
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,700
And some paid Lacroix to stop it.

512
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,490
None of this explains how Sara was involved.

513
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,890
Sara once told me she worked in Qurac.

514
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,020
And by "worked," I mean she killed people for the League.

515
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,590
You're saying she might have brought her work home with her.

516
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,070
Who authorized the payments?

517
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,040
A board member of AmerTek called Tom Westin.

518
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,370
He's Lacroix's next target.

519
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,380
What's his location?

521
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,330
You will not believe where he's headed.

522
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,880
Where do you think you're going?

523
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,770
- I'm coming with you. - Absolutely not.

524
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,700
Oliver, the only reason

525
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,030
why you know where to find him is because--

526
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,040
You were reckless. And Lacroix almost put an arrow in you.

527
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,880
Let me handle this.

528
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,630
Don't you dare tell me to stay put and think that I'll listen!

529
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,760
You know me better than that.

530
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,790
Sara was trained by some

531
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,510
of the greatest killers in human history.

532
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,290
Lacroix put her down.

533
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,030
So what do you think he's going to do to you?

534
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,920
I don't care about anything except for getting him.

535
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,270
- And I will. - You couldn't before!

536
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,880
I won't let him escape again.

537
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,120
I promise.

538
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,600
Ray Palmer.

539
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,520
Good evening.

540
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,260
Nice to see you.

541
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,700
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Ray Palmer.

542
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,040
Thank you.

543
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,680
Thank you all for coming out tonight.

544
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,020
Given all that has befallen this city,

545
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,790
it's easy for us to lose hope--

546
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,960
to hide in our castles and

547
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,970
be thankful that our ledges are in the black.

548
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,250
Well, we, the city's most affluent businessmen and women

549
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,370
hold its future in our hands.

550
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,080
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

551
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,660
I will give away half of my net worth

552
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,490
to the benefit of our home.

553
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,720
And this will be my salary for the year.

554
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,710
So tonight, I invite you all to join me in this investment.

555
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,560
Not just with your money,

556
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,290
but with your ingenuity,

557
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,460
and most importantly, your time.

558
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,110
The city is my home, but it's yours, too.

559
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,350
So help make Star City our future.

560
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,860
Let go of the arrow.

561
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,170
I thought you'd be taller.

562
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,560
It's over.

563
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,240
Lower your bow and live.

564
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,220
We both know that's not going to happen.

565
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,250
- Who hired you?! - Who's she?

566
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,770
You don't want to do this.

567
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,600
Yes, I do!

568
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,940
Killing him won't bring her back.

569
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,620
I know it won't bring her back, she's dead!

570
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,410
I have stood where you are right now;

571
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,970
where you're so consumed with rage you can hardly breathe,

572
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,570
and you think that taking revenge will make it better,

573
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,030
but Laurel... it won't.

574
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,920
It only makes it worse.

575
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,890
No, he murdered Sara!

576
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,000
Who's Sara?

577
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,690
My sister, you son of a bitch!

578
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,180
Two nights ago,

579
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,080
you put an arrow in her chest.

580
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,360
Two nights ago

581
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,400
I was drunk in Bludhaven.

582
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,340
You're lying.

583
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,790
I'm proud of my work.

584
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,420
I wouldn't deny it.

585
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,950
Even with a gun in your face?

586
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,900
Laurel, you need to stop and listen to him.

587
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,750
No.

588
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,530
No, he killed my sister.

589
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,780
Laurel, Sara wouldn't want--

590
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,470
Don't you dare tell me

591
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,690
that this isn't what Sara would have wanted!

592
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,020
Don't you tell me to think of her,

593
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,970
because I am thinking of her!

594
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,840
Laurel, if you pull that trigger--

595
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,390
You took the bullets out of the gun!

596
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,230
We have to go.

597
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,300
Lacroix's alibi checks out.

598
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,280
Two murders in Bludhaven,

599
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,510
same MO.

600
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,130
Same night Sara was killed.

601
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,720
I almost killed Lacroix.

602
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,880
The only thing that matters is you didn't.

603
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,380
Laurel...

604
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,220
The trail's run cold.

605
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,530
I'm going to find whoever did this.

606
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,710
I will.

607
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,440
But I don't know when.

608
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,350
Your father deserves to know.

609
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,880
I don't know. Yeah. It looks pretty good, it looks pretty good.

610
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,010
Lacroix, with an "X." Yeah.

611
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,900
I don't know, the guy's French

612
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,360
or something, why you asking--

613
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,480
Oh, hold on, hold on. I got to call you back.

614
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,440
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?

615
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,260
Hold on.

616
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,610
What is it?

617
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,820
Just tell me. Tell me, what is it?

618
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,420
It's about last night.

619
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,100
At the hospital.

620
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,320
I lied to you.

621
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,650
And you deserve to know the truth, and--

622
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,540
Sorry, sweetheart.

623
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,680
Damn thing goes off every hour if I don't take my pills.

624
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,580
Laurel, what do you know?

625
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,390
You looked like you were in the middle of telling me something.

626
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,550
I just wanted to say that...

627
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,640
that I'm really sorry.

628
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,840
I know that I should have told you the truth,

629
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,990
I just...

630
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,090
I just got to--

631
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,910
Hey, I'm your dad.

632
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,350
I forgive you.

633
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,820
Come here.

634
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,580
I always forgive you.

635
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,420
It's all right.

637
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,160
She can rest now.

638
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,790
She's home.

639
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,860
It's a Jewish custom.

640
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,980
I know she wasn't,

641
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,300
but it feels right.

642
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,220
Laurel.

643
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,490
No, this isn't right.

644
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,020
This isn't-- it--

645
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,960
she doesn't even get a fresh grave?

646
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,510
It's so perverse.

647
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,590
She deserves a proper burial.

648
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,690
She's earned it.

649
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,510
No, it's not fair.

650
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,850
No one will ever really know who she was.

651
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,360
Oliver, it's not fair.

652
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
It's not fair!

653
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,580
Laurel, we'll know.

654
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,660
I know this doesn't count for much,

655
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,320
but me and Lyla, we're naming the baby Sara.

656
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,510
We will never forget.

657
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,910
Thank you.

658
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,870
How did I--

659
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,830
What the hell is going on here?

660
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,750
Where am I?

661
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,950
Please, please don't-- please don't hurt me.

662
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,990
Just--just let me go, please.

663
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,270
I promise, I--I won't tell anybody about this.

664
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,460
Would a fisherman throw his prized catch back into the sea?

665
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,020
What are you talking about?

666
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,640
Look, whoever you are,

667
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,250
you really don't want to do this.

668
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Do you have any idea who I am? Who my father is?!

669
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,630
You're Thomas Merlyn.

670
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,280
You've been looking for Oliver Queen.

671
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,400
How--how do you-- how do you know that?

672
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,690
A simple hack of a missing billionaire's email account.

673
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,450
I knew somebody would come looking for him,

674
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,010
but I thought it would be his...

675
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,810
mother.

676
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,500
His sister.

677
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,410
But you, the son of the CEO of Merlyn Global.

678
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,540
Jackpot.

679
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,620
My friend, you are going to make me

680
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,420
a very rich man.

681
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,060
So Oliver didn't...

682
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,090
He isn't...

683
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,620
Oliver Queen is dead.

684
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,470
He's rotting at the bottom of the ocean.

685
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,380
And you will, too,

686
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,820
if your father doesn't pay that ransom.

687
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,490
I'm in here, please help! Help!

688
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,760
Police! Hong Kong police!

689
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,080
- It's OK. - Thank you!

690
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,270
You're going home. You're safe now.

691
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,440
I'm going to catch whoever killed her.

692
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,590
I know you are.

693
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,390
And until you do, I'm back on the team.

694
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,480
What about your family?

695
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,810
Sara is family, Oliver.

696
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,180
Just like you, man.

697
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,190
So now what?

698
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,920
Now I got to go get Thea.

699
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,240
It's long past time she came home.

700
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,930
John.

701
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,280
I don't want to die down here.

702
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,730
So don't, Oliver.

703
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,050
You changed your mind?

704
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,070
I just decided I want more out of life.

706
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,650
Well done.

707
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,560
Thanks, Dad.
