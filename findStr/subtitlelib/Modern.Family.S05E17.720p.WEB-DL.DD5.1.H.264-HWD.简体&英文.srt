1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,710
好了  请你们吃完饭了
Okay, I've fed you.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,780
有谁想看篮球赛啊
Now, who's ready to watch some basketball?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,830
我为什么在看你
Why am I looking at you?

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,610
不知道
I don't know.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,560
不像你  我看穿着短裤
Unlike you, I don't need a reason

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,370
到处跑的哥们儿不需要理由
to watch a bunch of guys run around in shorts.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,600
你已经毁了我的奥运会跳水比赛
Don't ruin this for me like you did

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,800
别又毁了篮球
with Olympic diving.

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,160
-小卡呢  -录下来吧
- Cam?   - Recording it.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,570
米奇和我要带艾丽克斯和曼尼去看美术展
Mitch and I are taking Alex and Manny to an art exhibit.

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,630
但当然了  大家都可以一起去
But, of course, everybody is welcome to join.

12
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,950
那是战后抽象表现主义的回顾展
It's a retrospective on post-war abstract expressionism.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,950
等等  学校要求的吗
Wait. For school?

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,070
不是  是生活所需
No, for life.

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,110
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

16
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,110
我都不知道我们在那场"战后"
I don't even know who we fought

17
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,330
是跟谁打的
in the post war.

18
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,180
早就告诉你开一辆车就够了
Told you one car was enough.

19
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,860
看来只有我们两个啦
Looks like it's just the two amigos.

20
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,500
海莉呢
Haley?

21
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,070
真抱歉我吃饱了就要走  外公
Oh, sorry to brunch and bail, grandpa,

22
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,310
但我有个约会
but I've got a date.

23
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,560
跟谁啊
Uh, with whom?

24
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,370
我在学校认识的帅哥
A gorgeous guy I met at school.

25
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,020
是同学还是扫教室的
Ooh, goes there or cleans there?

26
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,710
老妈
Mom.

27
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,550
回答她的问题
Answer the question.

28
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,560
大家都要走了吗
So everyone's leaving?

29
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,530
不  我  我不走啊
No, I'm -- I'm not.

30
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,150
早知道就不请你们吃上好的培根了
I wish I had known this before I served the good bacon.

31
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,820
你又没请大家吃上好的培根
You did not serve the good bacon.

32
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,830
你不是要去买一条小裙子吗
Don't you have a tiny dress to buy?

33
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,880
是啊  没错
Yes, we do!

34
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,150
我们请歌洛莉亚带莉莉
We asked Gloria to take Lily

35
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,850
去买一条花童礼裙
to pick out her flower-girl dress.

36
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,450
没错  我们显然无法遵循所有婚礼传统
Yeah, we're clearly not following every wedding tradition,

37
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,530
但绝对会有一条裙子是我们
but there will damn sure be one dress

38
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,300
[西方婚礼中新郎到婚礼当天才可以见到新娘穿婚纱]

39
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,300
两个新郎到婚礼当天才能见到的
the grooms don't see until the big day.

40
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,600
我们也请克莱尔一起去
And we also asked Claire to go

41
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,950
因为我们认为她的理性
because we thought her sensible style

42
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,170
能与歌洛莉亚的豪放互补
nicely complements Gloria's flair.

43
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
这样莉莉就不会看起来太过...
That way Lily doesn't end up looking too...

44
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,730
或者太过...
or too...

第五季 第十七集

56
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,720
我的乖儿子
There's my boy.

57
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
我知道你在跟乔说话
I know you're talking to Joe,

58
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,310
不过听到这话还是很开心
but that still feels really good to hear.

59
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,390
好了  下班了哦
Okay, clocking out.

60
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,070
安迪  如果你愿意的话
You know, Andy, if you want,

61
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,590
你可以留下来看比赛
you can stay and watch the game.

62
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,470
否则  我就得一个人看了
Otherwise, I'll just be here by myself.

63
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,060
我在这儿呢
I'm right here.

64
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,350
我也很想看  普先生
I-I'd love to, Mr. P,

65
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,890
但我得去想想送我女友什么周年礼物
but I got to come up with an anniversary gift for my girlfriend.

66
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,240
我每年都为她准备不同的礼物
I make her something different every year,

67
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,690
比如剪贴本  或漂亮的围巾
like a scrapbook or a nice scarf.

68
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,300
今年
This year,

69
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,750
我想也许我可以为她烤些香蕉面包
I was thinking maybe I could bake her some banana bread.

70
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,350
我可是香蕉面包之王
Ohh, I am the king of banana bread.

71
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,500
你知道我的秘诀吗
You know my secret?

72
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,610
别放坚果
No nuts.

73
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,610
[No nuts 双关: 没有睾丸]

74
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,300
这不是什么秘密
Not such a secret.

75
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,390
我以前也总给克莱尔做东西
I used to make stuff for Claire all the time.

76
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,400
我相信是我的手艺牢牢锁住了她的心
Pretty sure my artistry is what locked her down.

77
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,780
今年我要搞点特别的
I got to make this year's special.

78
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,590
她在海岸警卫队
With her in the coast guard,

79
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,670
我都没什么机会去看她
I, like, hardly ever get to see her.

80
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,840
我刚刚想到
Well, this is just off the dome,

81
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,290
送她一段好玩的视频怎么样
but, uh, maybe send her a fun video?

82
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,100
她确实很喜欢《摇滚年代》
Ooh, she does love "Rock of Ages."

83
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,130
或者你也可以录一段自己的视频
Or you could make your own video --

84
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,670
搞点专属浪漫
something romantic and personal

85
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,010
有真正制作价值的
with real production value.

86
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,950
我家里有些相当不错的设备
I got some pretty choice equipment back at the house.

87
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,030
我很乐意帮你
I'd be happy to help.

88
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,570
-真的吗  -当然了
- Would you really? - Yeah!

89
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,760
太好了
Yes!

90
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,110
太棒了  马上开工
Great! Let's do it!

91
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,590
卢克  伙计  我晚点来接你
Luke, buddy, I'll pick you up later.

92
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,870
然后一起去看轮子
We can go check out some wheels.

93
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,870
[wheels还有车的意思]

94
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,100
我以为你要留下来看比赛呢
I thought you were gonna stay and watch the game.

95
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,220
我就知道你爱我
I knew you loved me.

96
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,790
出去
Get out!

97
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,920
走吧
Come on.

98
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,600
看轮子  怎么  你已经开始看车了吗
Wheels? What, are you looking at cars already?

99
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
是陶轮
Pottery wheels.

100
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,660
我得选个春季选修课
I have to pick a spring elective,

101
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,890
老爸认为我该选陶艺
and dad thinks I should take ceramics

102
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,060
因为会有很多女孩选
'cause lots of girls do.

103
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,700
你知道大多数姑娘不喜欢什么吗
You know what a lot of girls don't do?

104
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,320
修陶艺课的男生
Guys who take ceramics.

105
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,090
你们学校有木工场吗
You got a wood shop at your school?

106
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,460
我不会制造东西啊
I can't really build stuff.

107
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,280
我只会破坏  然后道歉
I mostly take apart and apologize.

108
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,870
你得学会制造东西才行
You got to know how to build things.

109
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,170
我会制造悬念
I can build suspense.

110
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,850
怎么制造
How?

111
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,210
你看
Well, get this.

112
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,450
去车库  马上
Garage. Now.

113
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,030
婚纱店是什么
What's a bridal store?

114
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,970
那里有你见过最漂亮的裙子
It's a place with the most wonderful dresses that you have ever seen.

115
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,270
我们要给你挑一条最完美的
We're gonna get you the perfect one

116
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,650
哪怕花上一天时间
even if it takes us all day.

117
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,450
找到了
Found it.

118
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,920
不  亲爱的  那是戏服
Oh, no, sweetie. That's a costume.

119
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
你不能穿着戏服参加婚礼
You can't wear a costume to a wedding.

120
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,000
为什么不行  贝拉是个公主
Why not? Belle's a princess.

121
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,020
她面对的是野兽
She faced the beast.

122
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,670
她勇敢反抗市民
She stood up to the townspeople.

123
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,480
那你做了什么呢
What have you done?

124
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,860
我  成功把车停进了那个
I...got us into that tiny,

125
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,430
小小的停车位上
little parking spot.

126
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,690
漂亮的裙子不止公主裙一种
Princess dresses are not the only pretty dresses.

127
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,140
我想当公主
I want to be a princess.

128
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,330
我想当公主
I want to be a princess!

129
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,690
别再说了
Stop that right now.

130
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,230
你的爸爸们想让你买一条花童礼裙
Your dads want you to have a flower-girl dress,

131
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,590
所以我们就要给你买一条花童礼裙
and that's what we're going to get you.

132
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,720
走吧
So march.

133
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,340
停车位上面标着"小车型专用"
It was...it was marked "Compact" and --

134
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,820
而我们开的是面包车  所以
and we're driving a minivan, so...

135
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,330
感谢你们请我们来
Hey, thanks for inviting us to this.

136
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,350
别客气
Oh, no problem.

137
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,030
我很吃惊  我们四人组居然没有
You know, I'm surprised that this particular foursome

138
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,890
经常一起出来  考虑到
doesn't hang out more often, considering --

139
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,380
这家里只有我们受过教育吗
We're the cultured ones in the family?

140
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,480
我不会这么说的
I wouldn't say that.

141
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
如果不是跟你们一起的话
Outside of this group.

142
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,870
你知道你爸爸
Did you know your father

143
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,070
去杂货店买书的事情吗
actually goes to the grocery store to buy books?

144
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,450
我知道  是啊
I did know that, yeah.

145
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,470
我还知道让我姐姐睡觉的
I also know that the best way

146
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,060
最好办法就是
to get my sister to fall asleep is to --

147
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,640
给她看有字幕的电影
Show her a movie with subtitles.

148
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,530
晚安  妈妈[法语]
Bonne nuit, mama.

149
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,990
我们应该庆幸且感激
We should be nice and grateful

150
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,540
我们今天能够在这个私人画廊
that we have this day to spend together

151
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,210
一起度过美好时光
in our own private salon.

152
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,210
[salon有画廊和美发沙龙两个意思]

153
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,200
别跟我妈说那话
Don't tell my mom that.

154
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,320
她会跳出来说要染头发
She'll show up and ask to get her roots done.

155
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,680
-曼尼  -那是真的  是真的
- Manny! - That's true. It's true.

156
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,090
谢谢  曼尼
Thanks, manny.

157
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,080
我好期待这场展览
I am so excited for this exhibit.

158
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,260
我超级崇拜康丁斯基
I'm such an admirer of Kandinsky.

159
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,150
他可是被誉为
You know, he was credited

160
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,010
创作真正意义上抽象作品的第一人啊
with painting the first truly abstract work.

161
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,010
是吗
Is that so?

162
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,780
说实话  跟这三个家伙
To be honest, I was a little nervous

163
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,080
一起出来  我有点紧张
about holding my own with those three,

164
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,490
所以我做了些关于康丁斯基的功课
so I did a little boning up on Kandinsky.

165
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,250
反正多记几个知识点是不会错的
Figured it couldn't hurt to have a few facts in my pocket.

166
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,190
我的后备计划是上手摸展品然后被赶出去
My backup plan was to touch a painting and get thrown out.

167
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,640
女士  你好  打扰一下
Miss, hi. Excuse me.

168
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
可以告诉我们康丁斯基的画展在哪里吗
Can you tell us where the Kandinsky exhibit is?

169
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,310
卫斯理・康丁斯基
You know, Wassily Kandinsky?

170
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,120
生于莫斯科  一个茶商的儿子
Born in Moscow, son of a tea merchant?

171
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,150
抱歉  那场画展是临时的
I'm sorry. That exhibit was temporary.

172
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,980
已经结束了
It's closed.

173
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,900
什么
What?

174
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,810
不是吧
No.

175
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,810
我喜欢这幅马蒂斯的画
Oh, I love this Matisse.

176
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,370
这是他最后的作品之一
You know this is one of his final works.

177
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,680
他健康状况恶化使他开始探索剪纸
His failing health led to his exploration of paper cutouts.

178
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,330
是啊  我记得他称之为"用剪刀作画"
Ah, yes. I believe he called it "Painting with scissors."

179
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,380
而且他跟毕加索生活在同一时代
And he was also a contemporary of Picasso.

180
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,160
你完全能看出他们是如何影响彼此的
You can definitely see how they influenced each other.

181
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,220
是吧  小卡
Right, Cam?

182
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
这画一下让我想起了...
Uh, well, you know, it really reminds me...

183
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,230
康丁斯基
Of, uh, Kandinsky.

184
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,690
为什么
How so?

185
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,730
看起来不大一样  但材质很相似
Well, not so much in look, more in texture.

186
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,680
不  小卡
No, no, Cam!

187
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,690
先生  请不要碰画作
No, please, sir, don't touch the art.

188
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,680
抱歉  我马上离开这里
I'm sorry. I'll leave the premises.

189
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,850
不  没关系
No, it's -- it's fine.

190
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,840
您后退几步就行了
Just take a few steps back.

191
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,500
贝丝  我愿意游过满是鲨鱼的深海
Beth, I would swim the deepest, sharkiest oceans

192
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,820
来和你在一起
to be with you.

193
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,730
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

194
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,910
停拍
Cut!

195
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,840
这样就穿帮了
Well, now we have a blooper reel.

196
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,440
我们在为安迪的女友拍视频情书
We're making a video love letter for Andy's girlfriend.

197
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,980
你爸爸用他的电脑来设置很棒的背景
Your dad uses his computer to put in cool backgrounds

198
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,720
而我表演为了和她在一起
while I act out all the things that

199
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,640
我愿意做的事
I would do to be with her,

200
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,260
比如游过深海  或者爬山
like swim an ocean or climb a mountain.

201
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,000
不如你像个正常人一样
Ooh, how about you buy a plane ticket

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,620
买机票去看她啊
and visit her like a normal person?

203
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,610
我也想啊  但她忙于海岸警卫队的工作
I would, but the coast guard keeps her really busy.

204
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,530
闭上眼  她喜欢吗
Eyes. Does she like it?

205
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,760
40人的队伍里只有两个女生和她聊天
She's probably so lonely with only two other women

206
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,970
她一定感觉十分孤单
to talk to in her whole 40-person unit.

207
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,740
所以你是说你女朋友
So you're saying it's just your girlfriend

208
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,640
和36个型男在一起吗
and 36 super in-shape dudes?

209
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,650
是37个  而且不是你想的那样
37. And it's not what you think.

210
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,170
海岸警卫队非常不赞成队内恋爱
The coast guard seriously frowns on fraternizing.

211
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,930
这是禁止的
It's forbidden.

212
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,310
禁果更甜好吗
That doesn't make it hot.

213
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,360
你的脸上也喷到了一点
Oh, I got some on your face.

214
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,970
你会发光的
You're gonna shine.

215
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,170
我去拿我的  克莱尔的粉饼
I'll go get some of my -- Claire's powder.

216
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,760
我的克莱尔  她是我妻子
My Claire. She's my wife.

217
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,190
你不是要去约会的吗
I thought you had a date to go on.

218
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,460
是啊
I do.

219
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,150
他什么时候来啊
When's he gonna get here?

220
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,110
快了吧
Whenever he does.

221
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,200
他也就晚了几分钟
He's just, like, a few minutes late.

222
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,770
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

223
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,540
真是无礼
That is so rude.

224
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,510
真正的男人会考虑到你的时间的
A real man would be more considerate of your time.

225
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,660
是啊
You're right.

226
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,460
所以每年《人物》杂志
That's why every year People magazine

227
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,900
都提名"最贴心"的男人
names the "Consideratest" man alive.

228
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,730
好吧  随你怎么取笑我
Oh, man, you can make fun of me all you want,

229
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,020
但你长大后
but when you grow up,

230
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,920
就会知道哪些品质能塑造一个真正的男人
you'll see what qualities make up a real man.

231
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,920
[make up也有化妆的意思]

232
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,030
有人说要化妆吗
Someone say "Makeup"?

233
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,140
是我
I did.

234
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,330
好了  开始吧
All right, here we go.

235
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,590
这样好多了
Oh, yeah. Much better.

236
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,590
我要在这下面打造阴影
You know what? I think I'm gonna shadow down here.

237
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,310
歌洛莉亚  你会爱上这条裙子的
Gloria, you are gonna love this one.

238
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,110
我觉得我们终于找到了最完美的裙子
I think we have finally found the perfect dress.

239
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,340
瞧瞧
Ta-da.

240
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,690
是不错啦  但我不喜欢蝴蝶结
It's nice, but I don't like the bow.

241
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,980
再试几件吧
Let's try more.

242
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,330
我们已经试了六条裙子
We've tried on six dresses already.

243
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,830
她对这条没意见  对吧  莉莉
She's fine with this. Right, Lily?

244
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,930
我无所谓
I don't care.

245
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,660
瞧  她很喜欢  搞定
See? She loves it. Done.

246
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,350
去试试有蕾丝花边的
Go try the lace one.

247
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,640
没搞错吧
Seriously?

248
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,360
真是没完没了啊
This is endless.

249
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,110
你为什么要拖延啊
Why are you dragging this out?

250
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,990
因为我们还没找到合适的裙子
Because we haven't found the right dress.

251
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,890
你肯定不是这么烂的顾客吧
You have got to be a better shopper than this.

252
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,420
我看见过你开着车就买了三件衣服
I have seen you buy three outfits while driving a car.

253
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
拜托  这很好玩啊
Come on. It's fun.

254
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,550
我没有女儿
I don't have any daughters.

255
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,620
我能买的只有男士晚礼服
All I get to buy is tuxedos,

256
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,960
它们看起来都一样
and they all look the same.

257
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,040
但是别告诉曼尼
But don't tell Manny that

258
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,310
因为我不想再听他讲晚礼服了
because I don't want to hear another lecture.

259
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,810
真有趣
It's funny.

260
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,320
我从来没关心过这种东西
I have never cared about any of this stuff.

261
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,220
我嫁给菲尔时都没有穿婚纱
I didn't even wear a wedding dress when I married Phil.

262
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,600
甚至都没有试穿过
Never even tried one on.

263
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,660
放松点  你看见我身后
Easy. That is the reaction

264
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,340
有个持枪男子才该是这种反应好吗
for when there's a man behind me with a gun.

265
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,350
我只是说我不在乎婚纱
All I said is I don't care about wedding dresses.

266
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,500
因为你没穿过
Because you've never been in one.

267
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,170
我要给你挑一件试穿
I'm gonna pick some for you to try.

268
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,750
不要了  没必要
Okay, no, no. No need.

269
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,520
来吧  会很漂亮的
Come on, you'll feel beautiful.

270
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,010
试穿后你就可以换回你的  男士服装
Then you can go back to your...boy clothes.

271
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,870
这件衬衫是给卢克买的  没法退
I bought this shirt for Luke and I couldn't return it.

272
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,820
我可没有一整天时间来试穿裙子
And I don't have all day to try on dresses.

273
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,400
我就有吗
Oh, and I do?

274
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,660
这对我来说会很好玩的
It'll be fun for me.

275
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,480
你是我的继女
You're my stepdaughter.

276
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
我比你大
I'm older than you.

277
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,110
瞧瞧  已经很好玩了
You see? It's already fun.

278
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,160
先来做一个简单的工具箱
We're gonna start by building a simple toolbox.

279
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,310
首先我教你怎么切割木头
First, I'm gonna show you how to cut the wood.

280
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,340
我知道这对你来说太过高深  小家伙
I know you're a little young for this, goober.

281
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,630
尽量吸收吧
Try to soak it all up.

282
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,500
这是什么
What's this thing?

283
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,390
台钳
A table vise.

284
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,820
台钳  台
Table vise, ta--

285
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,760
不
No.

286
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,520
我已经和米奇尔经历过这种事了
I already went through this with Mitchell.

287
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,270
我们来这里就是要预防那种事发生
That's what we're here to prevent.

288
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,400
你爸爸没教你这些吗
Didn't your dad teach you any of this stuff?

289
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,600
他说你唯一需要的工具就是幽默感
He says the only tool you need is a sense of humor.

290
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,860
如果你有个很搞笑的敲门笑话
'Cause who needs the jaws of life

291
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,630
那还需要什么救生颚啊
if you have a good knock-knock joke?

292
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,080
卢克  去那边拿护目镜
Luke, grab the goggles over there, please.

293
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,010
用心点
And try to pay attention.

294
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,720
我们测量两次
We measure twice,

295
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,140
切割一次
and we cut once.

296
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,490
外公  你能举起180磅的杠铃吗
Hey, grandpa, can you bench 180 pounds?

297
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,090
我说了用心点
I just said pay attention.

298
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,860
加上杆子其实有205磅
And that's actually 205 with the bar.

299
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,330
我一会儿举给你看
I'll lift that for you later.

300
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,850
我知道你心里还挂念着那个
I can see you're not gonna let up about that.

301
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,700
没有啦
Eh, I'm okay.

302
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,770
瞧瞧我的
Spot me.

303
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,310
如果大事不妙
Now, if this thing goes south,

304
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,230
你要打给911
I want you to call 911

305
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,760
告诉乔他的老爸死得光荣
and tell Joe his old man died as he lived --

306
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,620
救了一火车人
saving a trainload of people.

307
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,010
好了  这几下够了
All right. That's enough for now.

308
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,750
告诉我你对女人的一切了解
Tell me everything you know about women.

309
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,990
是啊  最后一句
Yeah, that last thing.

310
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,250
有趣  有趣  有趣
Funny. Funny. Funny.

311
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,260
我一定没跟上你们
I must be a little behind you guys.

312
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,350
他说的话
His words.

313
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,990
你感受到发生的事了吗
Do you feel what's happening here?

314
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,580
-我觉得好痛  -不是
- I feel pinching. - No.

315
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,590
我是这个超级组合里的薄弱环节
I'm the weak link of this super group.

316
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,010
他们知道  我也知道
They know it and I know it.

317
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,370
我们都在一大堆人中还没关系
It's fine when we're all in a big group,

318
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,690
但是一旦我们单独相处
but once we're separated from the herd,

319
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,950
我就露马脚了
the hooves come out.

320
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,000
你说的应该是爪子吧
Don't you mean "Claws"?

321
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,010
有爪子的动物不成"堆"活动  米奇尔
Clawed animals don't travel in herds, Mitchell.

322
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,610
得用"群"称呼
Packs, flocks, and prides.

323
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,730
我们为什么不能去农场
Why can't we be on a farm?

324
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,940
我会让你们觉得相形见绌的
I'd make you all look like such idiots.

325
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,000
知道吗
You know what?

326
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
我就去外面等着好了
I'm just gonna wait outside.

327
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,280
不  小卡  别这样
Wh-- no. Cam, come on.

328
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,650
你这样太蠢了
You're being silly.

329
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,590
老实说
To be perfectly honest,

330
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,630
我真的需要小卡留下来
I-I really needed Cam to stay.

331
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,430
他一走
The minute he goes,

332
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,710
我就成笨蛋了
I'm the dumb one.

333
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,740
我上过一次艺术史课
I-I took an art history class once,

334
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,600
但那只是为了看一群赤裸的意大利男人
but that was just to look at naked Italian dudes, so...

335
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,510
记住
Remember now,

336
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,970
你身处零度以下的气温中
you're in subzero temperatures.

337
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,470
唯一让你觉得温暖的
The only thing keeping you warm

338
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,950
就是激情燃烧的热度
is the heat of your fiery passion.

339
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,330
开始
And...go!

340
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,460
我美丽的贝丝
My beautiful Beth --

341
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,900
-再冷一点  -我美美美丽的贝贝丝
- Colder! - My b-b-beautiful B-Beth.

342
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,280
-再冷一点  -贝贝贝贝...
- Colder! - B-B-B-B--

343
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,500
太冷了
That's too cold.

344
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,090
太冷了
That's too cold.

345
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,160
贝贝贝丝
B-B-Beth!

346
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,660
就是这样
Now we're talking!

347
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,250
我觉得你好美
You're so beautiful to me!

348
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,450
太棒了
Yes!

349
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,690
我为什么这么想帮安迪
Why am I so intent on helping Andy?

350
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,480
我喜欢拍电影和爱情
I love filmmaking and I love love.

351
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,370
你可以说我喜欢拍摄爱情[在电影里做爱]
I guess you could say I enjoy making love on film,

352
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,380
现在我不用自己做了
and now I don't have to do it by myself.

353
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,710
贝丝  我从远方说想你
Beth, this is my long way of saying I miss you.

354
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,740
不是我说  这太别扭了
Th-- uh. You know, this is weird.

355
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,880
我都不知道该看哪里
I don't really know where to look.

356
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,670
不  不别扭
No, it's not weird.

357
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,510
深情地看着我的双眼感动我
J-just look deep into my eyes and sweep me off my feet.

358
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,770
好吧
All right.

359
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,390
亲爱的
Honey...

360
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,100
没错  这太别扭了
Yeah, that's weird.

361
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,740
是的
It is. Yeah.

362
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,170
海莉  亲爱的  帮帮我们吧
Haley, honey, can you help us?

363
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,410
没人帮得了你们
I don't think anyone can.

364
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,750
让安迪给你公主抱
Just let Andy hold you "Officer and a gentleman" style,

365
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,390
我在电脑上把贝丝的脸叠加在你脸上
and I'll superimpose Beth's face over yours on the computer.

366
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,390
这太扯了
That's insane.

367
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,080
我知道  我用这个无所不能
I know. I can do anything with this.

368
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,190
要是她觉得别扭
If she's not comfortable

369
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,910
告诉你们吧
You know what, guys?

370
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,120
这事真的太可悲了
This whole thing is really sad and pathetic.

371
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,700
女孩们都不喜欢男人这么主动
No girl wants a guy that tries this hard.

372
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,840
要是我收到这么个视频
If I got this video,

373
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,190
我会报警的
I'd call the police.

374
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,730
有的女孩会喜欢对她们好的男人
Some girls actually like guys who are nice to them.

375
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,300
有的女孩会喜欢36个那样的男人
Some girls like 36 of them.

376
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,440
有37个
There's 37 of them!

377
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,450
好了  就要这种激情
Okay, this is passion.

378
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,080
可以利用起来
We can use it.

379
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,430
安迪  抱她起来
Andy, pick her up.

380
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,460
来吧  把这条搞定
All right, let's just get this over with.

381
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,560
天啊  他真的把我抱起来了  爸爸
Oh, my gosh, he's actually picking me up! Dad!

382
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,340
马上就好
It's just for a minute.

383
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,360
现在注视着对方
Now lock eyes and...

384
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,500
开拍
Action.

385
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,490
亲爱的  我从远方说想你
Honey, this is my long way of saying I miss you.

386
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,400
我不必爬上高山
I don't have to climb a mountain

387
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,880
不必远过重洋去见你
or swim an ocean to be with you,

388
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,440
因为你一直在我身边
'cause you're always with me--

389
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,720
在我的脑海里
in my thoughts,

390
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,520
我的梦里
my dreams...

391
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,720
我的心里
my heart.

392
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,850
我值得我用尽所有的能力去爱你
You deserve more than I could possibly ever give you,

393
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,850
可你就是我的全部
but everything I have is yours.

394
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,210
我爱你
I love you.

395
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,220
停
Cut!

396
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,460
太美了
That was beautiful.

397
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,140
我真的感觉到了
I really felt that one.

398
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,050
你感觉到了吗
Did you feel that one?

399
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,560
我什么都没感觉到
No, I didn't feel anything.

400
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,810
我在问安迪
I was talking to Andy.

401
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,950
我知道  放我下来  变态
I know! Put me down, freak!

402
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,070
真让我怀念啦啦队的日子
That really takes me back to my cheerleading days.

403
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,410
一个承受着那么多痛苦的人
How could a guy with so much pain

404
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,910
是如何创作出这么充满希望的作品的
create such hopeful imagery?

405
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,150
要是我妈患上肺病晚期
I certainly couldn't paint like that

406
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,220
我可画不出来这样的作品
if my mother was dying of consumption.

407
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,270
她上次感冒
The last time she had a cold,

408
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,520
我连茶几的花都摆不好
I could barely arrange the flowers on the front table.

409
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,000
你知道我觉得什么最有意思吗
You know what I found so interesting?

410
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,610
是第一幅画和最后一幅
Was that the first painting and the last painting

411
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,530
简直太像了
were so similar,

412
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,200
我认为那是有意图的
and I think that that was intentional,

413
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,590
是对永恒人生的诠释
a comment on the perpetual motion of life.

414
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,030
第一幅就是最后一幅
The first painting was the last painting.

415
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,530
我们走了一圈
We walked in a circle.

416
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,360
你确定吗
Are you sure?

417
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,130
我要去找小卡
So...you know, I'm gonna go check on Cam

418
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,060
他一个人呆了很久了
because he's been alone f-for quite some time.

419
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,370
他可能在摸哪幅画呢
And, you know, he's probably touching a painting.

420
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,840
别  别走啊
N-no, don't go!

421
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,200
我们正聊得高兴呢
We're having such a good time.

422
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,900
就剩我们两个了
I guess it's just you and me now.

423
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,290
小卡走了没什么
It was okay when Cam left

424
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,000
我还有米奇尔这个笨蛋垫底
and passed the dunce cap to Mitchell,

425
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,550
可他走了的话
but with him gone,

426
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,690
就轮到我了
it went to me.

427
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,390
要是卢克在就好了
What I would've given to have Luke there.

428
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,560
卢克啊
Ah, Luke.

429
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,820
又可人又够蠢
Sweet as custard and just as smart.

430
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,520
搞定了
And presto.

431
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,420
太感谢了  邓菲先生
Thank you so much, Mr. Dunphy.

432
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,960
真不知道怎么感谢你
I wish I could repay you somehow.

433
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,750
别客气  下次见到你女朋友
Nah. Next time you're with your girlfriend,

434
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,830
想着我就好
just think of me.

435
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,810
没问题
Done.

436
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,480
走了
Later.

437
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
那是谁啊
Who's that?

438
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,830
我的约会对象
My date.

439
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,650
你约的午饭吗  这都5点了
Your lunch date? It's 5:00.

440
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,620
他睡过了
He fell asleep.

441
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,530
可他一睡醒就给我发短信了
But he texted me right when he woke up.

442
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,120
你觉得他休息够了吗
Well, then, you'd think he'd be well-rested enough

443
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,220
他连过来敲门的力气都没有
to walk to the front door.

444
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,270
男人鸣笛来鼓舞士气
Yeah, a gentleman honks to support the troops,

445
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,690
可不是召唤女朋友
not summon his girlfriend.

446
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,290
虽然我女朋友就是军人
Although my girlfriend is a troop,

447
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,770
所以对我来说  两者有点分不清
so in my case, it's a little confusing.

448
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,730
天呐  真唠叨
Oh, my god, it's still talking.

449
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,560
因为他知道你没有受到尊重
Because it knows you're not being respected.

450
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
-谢谢  -别客气
- Thank you.  - You bet.

451
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,830
你们不懂真实世界里的
Ugh. You guys don't understand how dating works

452
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,850
约会是怎样的
in the real world.

453
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,200
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

454
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,490
看看安迪今天为贝丝做的一切
Look at everything Andy did for Beth today.

455
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,760
我活着就是为了让她高兴
I just live my life to make her happy.

456
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,170
我要去把这个交给邮差
I'm gonna give this to the mailman

457
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,480
他会把它给海岸警卫队
who's gonna give it to the coast guard,

458
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,890
明天这个时候
and by this time tomorrow,

459
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,610
海岸警卫队的某个人
someone in the coast guard's

460
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,570
会把它交给我女朋友
gonna be giving it to my girlfriend.

461
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,240
能想象她看到这个时
Can you imagine the smile on her face

462
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,780
挂在脸上的笑容吗
when she takes it all in?

463
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,660
我要走了  你俩好好回味吧
Okay, I'm gonna go while you two replay that in your minds.

464
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,770
天呐
Oh, my gosh.

465
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,850
你想重演《地心引力》吗
Would you like to re-enact "Gravity"?

466
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,060
好啊  我演桑德拉・布洛克
Yes. Sandra Bullock!

467
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,790
该死
Dang it!

468
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,390
不错  抢得够快
Good call. That was quick.

469
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,770
我等了你一个下午就这待遇吗
That's what I get after I waited for you all afternoon?

470
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,670
你真美
Uh...you look good?

471
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,830
这我知道
I know that.

472
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,940
你几个小时前就该来接我了
You were supposed to pick me up hours ago.

473
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,170
你可是我醒了以后  第一个
You were, like, the first or second person

474
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,580
或第二个发短信的人
I texted after I woke up.

475
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,980
真感人
Aww! That's so sweet.

476
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,270
你想没想过要走到门前去敲门啊
Did it even occur to you who comes to the door?

477
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,180
还要走到门前
Comes to the door?

478
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,490
做个绅士
A gentleman.

479
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,170
你可以至少帮我开下车门吗
Could you at least open the car door for me?

480
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,950
我们能走了吗
Now can we go?

481
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,380
够了
You know what?

482
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,460
去再睡一觉吧
Go take another nap.

483
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,400
我宁可等一个
I'd rather wait for someone

484
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,740
愿意为我穿越风雪
who'd walk through a blizzard for me

485
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,130
而且鸣笛只为了鼓舞士气的人
and only honks to support the troops!

486
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,780
我没明白你的意思
I don't understand you.

487
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,280
我也不明白
Neither do i!

488
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,860
克莱尔  你太美了
Claire, you look beautiful.

489
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,270
你真闪耀
You're glowing.

490
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,960
我不闪耀
I'm not glowing.

491
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,960
我是在冒汗
I'm sweating.

492
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
拜托
Come on.

493
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,510
看着镜子里的自己
Look at yourself in the mirror.

494
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,640
别告诉我你没有感到高贵而特别
Don't tell me that you don't feel gorgeous and special.

495
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,630
你说得对
You're right.

496
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,820
我在发光
I am radiant.

497
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,930
我就好像是
Oh, it's like I'm in a...

498
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,780
在童话或者梦里
in a fairy tale or a dream.

499
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,430
说谎
Lies!

500
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,800
你是装出来的
You're faking it.

501
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,360
抱歉
Well, I'm sorry!

502
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
想想是谁把我养大的
Look who raised me.

503
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,850
我是我爸的女儿
I am my father's daughter...

504
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,720
还兼任半个儿子
and also kind of his son.

505
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
那件衬衫不是买给卢克的
And I lied about that being Luke's shirt.

506
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,090
我给自己买了三种颜色的
I bought it for myself in three colors.

507
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,870
我就是想配合你而已  歌洛莉亚
I am trying to help you out here, Gloria,

508
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,910
可这不是我
But this just isn't me.

509
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,410
你确实帮了我
You did help me.

510
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,360
真庆幸我没有女儿
I am glad I didn't have daughters.

511
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,110
至少我带曼尼逛街时
You know, at least when I take Manny shopping,

512
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,570
我们一天都会很愉快
we make a day of it.

513
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,960
我都不用让他转动身体
I don't even have to ask him to twirl

514
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,060
因为他会主动转起来
because he just does it.

515
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,600
走了  莉莉
Vamos, Lily!

516
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,660
莉莉
Lily?

517
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,880
-莉莉  -莉莉
- Lily? - Lily?

518
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,000
她是不是  没有
Is she-- no.

519
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,390
没有吗  她走了  她走了
No? She's gone. She's gone.

520
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:09,990
-莉莉  -等等  等等
- Lily! - Wait. Wait.

521
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,710
莉莉  莉莉  莉莉
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

522
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,390
别走  裙子
No, the dress!

523
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
-莉莉  -莉莉
- Lily? - Lily?

524
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,840
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

525
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,840
我穿高跟鞋跑不动
I can't run in these shoes!

526
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,890
现在你想穿男孩子的鞋了吧
I bet you wish you had boy shoes now, huh?

527
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,110
莉莉
Lily?

528
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,230
-克莱尔  等一下  -怎么了
- Claire, stop! - What?

529
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,280
-看  -我的天
- Look! - Oh, my god.

530
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,280
好的  跑  跑起来  快点
Okay, run, run. Come on. Come on!

531
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,750
她看起来好开心
She looks so happy.

532
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,830
是啊
She does.

533
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,600
她真的好开心
Oh, she really does.

534
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,270
他们一定会杀了我们
They're gonna kill us.

535
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,030
什么样的公主
What sort of princess?

536
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,430
就是那个和野兽跳舞
The kind that dances with beasts

537
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,630
[加斯顿: 美女与野兽中的镇上土豪]

538
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,630
不嫁给加斯顿的美女
and won't marry Gaston.

539
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,770
-真的吗  -怎么了
- Really? - What?

540
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,550
她只喜欢这一件
It's the only dress she likes.

541
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,890
莉莉想在婚礼上打扮成贝尔
Lily wants to come to the wedding as Belle.

542
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,470
也说得通
Makes sense.

543
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,920
她在胡娇的家宴上穿成了小探险家多拉
She went to Pepper's Seder as Dora the explorer.

544
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,730
好吧
I-it's fine.

545
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,890
你确定吗
Are you sure?

546
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,310
是的  没事
Yes. Yes.

547
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,790
只要她开心就好
A-As long as she's happy.

548
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,610
在男同性恋婚礼上阻止别人成为
A gay wedding is hardly the place to stop someone

549
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,380
她想成为的样子确实不太合适
from being who they want to be.

550
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,240
他们说可以
They said it's fine.

551
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,800
我终于开心啦
Yay! I'm finally happy!

552
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,280
怎么了
What?

553
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,780
我看到你转动身体了
I saw you twirl.

554
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,870
我才没有
Oh, I did not.

555
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,540
你有
Yes, you did.

556
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
多漂亮的小姑娘啊
Such a pretty girl.

557
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
闭嘴
Shut up.

558
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,670
你才是姑娘
You're a girl.

559
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,540
我们的女儿怎么样了
How about that daughter of ours?

560
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,600
她跟着自己的心情走了吧
She marches to the beat of her own drum, huh?

561
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,460
是啊
Yeah. Exactly.

562
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,660
所以  为什么我们要那么在意
S-so, why are we so concerned

563
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,040
两个书呆子怎么看我们
what two nerdy teenagers think of us?

564
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,510
真正的大智慧
Isn't the true mark of intelligence

565
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,030
不就是承认自己不知道什么吗
being able to admit what you don't know?

566
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,760
小声点  曼尼过来了
Shh. Here comes Manny.

567
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,870
天哪  他没听到我说的吧
Oh, my god. Did he hear me?

568
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,570
伙计们
Hey, guys.

569
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,430
没什么
Nothin'.

570
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,900
你来这里干什么
Hey, what are you doing out here?

571
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,130
是你们两个今天邀请我们来的
You guys invited us so we could spend the day together.

572
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,860
但你们在这里
It felt wrong that you two are out here

573
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,380
只有我和艾丽克斯在里面怪怪的
and I was in there all alone with Alex.

574
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
跟不上她的节奏了  对吧
Couldn't keep up, could you?

575
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,250
她什么都知道
She knows everything.

576
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,340
她把一个讲解员都弄哭了
She made a docent cry.

577
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,760
没关系  我们也是假装懂的
It's okay. We're faking it, too.

578
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
是吧
Well, duh.

579
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
你们在这里啊
There you guys are.

580
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,460
没什么
Nothin'.

581
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,060
我们正要回去呢
Uh, we were just headed back in.

582
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,380
是啊  我们就在外面透透气
Yeah, I'm getting a second wind.

583
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,710
不  不  没关系
Oh, no, no, no. That's okay.

584
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,570
不如我们去找点东西吃吧
Uh, what do you say we go check out some food trucks?

585
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,390
真的吗
Really?

586
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
如果你们很想进去我也可以
I'll go back in if you guys want,

587
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,060
但我真的很饿
but I'm actually really hungry.

588
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,750
-随你便  -你说了算
- Yeah, whatever you want.  - Okay, well, whatever you need,

589
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,280
好吧  谢谢你们
Yeah.Thanks, guys.

590
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,110
要我说实话
If I'm being honest,

591
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,510
我必须得出来了
I had to get out of there.

592
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,310
我在那装了一整天傻真是太累了
I was exhausted from having to dumb it down all day.

593
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,900
真的吗  脖子
Really? The neck?

594
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,920
是啊  脖子上一吻  什么门都能开
Yeah, a kiss on the neck opens all kinds of doors.

595
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,040
最后一个
Last one.

596
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,780
干得好  小冠军
Great job, champ.

597
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,350
谁说你什么都做不出来的
Who said you can't build anything?

598
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,390
我爸爸  警察  医生
My dad, the police, a doctor.

599
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,300
你有天分
You got a gift.

600
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,020
相信我  学点工科
Trust me. Take shop.

601
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,710
我想我会的
I think I'm gonna.

602
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,390
你怎么会知道这么多事情呢
Hey, how'd you get to know so much about everything?

603
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,570
大多是我爸爸教我的
From my dad, mostly.

604
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,330
他教我如何用电钻
He taught me how to use a drill,

605
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,640
如何换轮胎
change a tire,

606
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,340
如何在兄弟叫你帮忙搬家的时候装病
fake an injury when a buddy asks you to help him move.

607
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,180
所有男人的生活技能
Everything a man needs to get by.

608
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,370
我很高兴我这些技能能传下去
I'm just glad I have someone to pass it on to.

609
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,720
你有曼尼啊
You've got Manny.

610
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,430
曼尼认识我的时候基本已经定型了
Manny came to me kind of fully cooked.

611
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,730
培养米奇尔的时候我还太年轻
And I was an idiot with Mitchell,

612
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,270
再等这个家伙长大
and by the time this guy gets old enough,

613
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,750
谁知道我还能记得些什么
who knows how much I'll remember?

614
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,820
这些年是我传播智慧的黄金年龄
These are my prime wisdom-giving years.

615
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,530
还有什么问题吗  卢克
You got any more questions, Luke?

616
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,670
只有一个
Just one --

617
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,710
我能尝一口吗
can I have a sip?

618
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,100
啤酒  当然  管他呢
The beer? Sure. What the hell.

619
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,340
太棒了  我第一次喝啤酒
Awesome. My first drink of beer.

620
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,090
我记得当初我第一次给米奇尔
I remember the day I gave Mitchell

621
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,830
喝啤酒的情景
his first taste of beer.

622
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,290
他面部扭曲地一直喝
He winced and carried on

623
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,910
就好像有人在从他的腿上取出一枚子弹
like someone was digging a bullet out of his leg.

624
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,260
我不忍心把菲尔的那一刻夺走
I couldn't take that moment away from Phil.

625
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,340
等等  等一下
Hang on. Wait a second.

626
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,490
让我看一下
Let me see that.

627
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,280
这啤酒不能喝了
No, this beer's skunked.

628
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,080
不好了
It's no good.

629
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,420
肯定是冰箱又出问题了
Damn fridge must be on the fritz again.

630
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,580
不是吧
Aw, man.

631
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,320
真的吗
Really?

632
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,560
不好意思  伙计
Sorry, buddy.

633
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,580
大概是时候打给你爸爸了  是吧
It's probably time to call your dad anyway, right?

634
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,220
好吧
Okay.

635
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,830
等一下
Wait a second.

636
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,160
我想给你些东西
I want to give you something.

637
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,400
但这些是你的
But those are yours.

638
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,530
如果不能给外孙些工具
What's a grandfather for

639
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,950
那要外公有什么用呢
if he can't give his grandson a couple of tools?

640
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,270
谢谢  外公
Thanks, grandpa.

641
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,840
好样的
Good job!

642
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,360
乔
Joe...

643
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,920
我知道你现在还只关心咪咪
I know you're all about the boobs right now,

644
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,180
但相信我
but trust me...

645
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
脖子才是重点
The neck.

646
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,790
别放手
Don't let go!

647
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,600
别担心  乔治・克鲁尼  我不会的
Don't worry, George Clooney, I won't!

648
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,370
你太帅了
You're too handsome!

649
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,470
注意远方太空垃圾来袭
Watch out for incoming space junk!

650
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,300
在哪
From where?

651
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,390
你的拉链开了
Your zipper's down!

652
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,980
真的吗
Oh, is it?

653
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,140
-是啊  -不好意思
- Yeah, it is. - Just... sorry.

654
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,500
安迪在这里干什么
What's Andy doing here?

655
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
他们在给他女朋友制作一个视频
They're making a video for his girlfriend.

656
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,120
是吗  叫什么  《太空蠢货》吗
Yeah? What's it called, "Dorks in space"?

657
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
其实挺感人的
Oh, it was actually sweet.

658
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,660
真奇怪
It's weird.

659
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,710
他有些地方很特别
There's something about him.

660
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,430
你懂我意思吗
You know what I mean?

661
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,340
懂  他跟老爸很像
Yeah, he's just like dad.

662
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,970
在太空里没人能听见你叫
In space, no one can hear you scream.

663
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,950
什么
What?!

664
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,400
在太空里没人能听见你叫
In space, no one can hear you scream!

665
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,890
我听不到你说什么
I can't hear you!

666
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,740
在太...
In spa--

667
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,530
我懂了
Oh, I just got it.

668
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,230
这个很逗  很逗
That's good. That's good.

669
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,220
谢谢
Thank you.

670
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,280
这确实很有原创性
There's no denying it is original,

671
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,430
但能看出波洛克对作者的影响
but you can see the influence of Pollock.

672
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,050
这个花样看似很随机
While the pattern seems haphazard and random,

673
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,960
但它也揭示了一种意图  一种目的
it belies a purposefulness -- a-an intentionality.

674
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,500
你知道吗  我觉得我看到的
You know, I think what I'm responding to

675
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,440
是相邻颜色的碰撞
is the clashing juxtaposition of color --

676
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,050
艳丽的黄和深色的背景
The bright yellow against the dark background.

677
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,280
就像黑暗世界中的一抹阳光
It's like a ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak world.

678
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,460
但我不太同意
If I may take a contrary position...

679
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,440
我认为它代表着
...I think it speaks to the absurdity

680
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,470
人类愚蠢而枉然的尝试
and folly of human endeavor.

681
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,130
就好像我们对完美的徒劳追逐
Like our futile struggle for perfection.

682
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,700
我知道
I get it.

683
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,690
我的衣服沾上了芥末酱
I got mustard on my shirt.

684
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,460
别说了
Get over it.

685
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,240
虽然我们在开玩笑
I know we're joking,

686
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,230
但抛弃这点不谈
but all kidding aside,

687
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,440
这真的让我想起康丁斯基...
it really does remind me of Kandinsky's --
