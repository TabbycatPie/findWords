總統的做法很聰明

42
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,610
為他的民調加了分

我倒是找到了段主席幕僚長的色情報復視頻

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,000
我想跟你上司談談宣戰委員會的事
I wanna talk to your boss about the Declaration of War Committee.

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,930
我希望
I'd appreciate it

54
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,490
你別提起我戰斗記錄的細節
if you didn't bring up the details of my combat record.

55
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,880
一個從沒服過役的人
A man who's never served.

56
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,410
哪怕戰爭咬上他的屁股
Wouldn't know what a real war was

57
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,090
他都認不出來
if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.

58
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,030
美國應該盡早聽聽他立功的來龍去脈
Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,670
我找不到合適的語言形容那天發生的事
I don't have the right words for what happened that day.

60
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,840
但毋庸置疑他是位英雄
But he was a hero, no question.

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,340
康威上尉的行為是英勇的
Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,380
一位英雄
A hero.

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,320
塔利班劫持了陸軍上尉克雷格·斯夸爾
Army Captain Craig Squire had been captured by the Taliban,

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,350
他被關在坎大哈省
held hostage in the Kandahar province.

65
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,570
我們發現情報有誤
We realized the intel was bad.

66
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,860
我們找到他時  已開始遭受火力
By the time we found him, we'd started taking fire.

67
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,690
那里就像是死亡花園
It was like a death garden or something.

68
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,960
康威上尉跑下飛機  把斯夸爾救了出來
Captain Conway got out of the plane and got Squire out.

69
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,470
別問我過程有多艱辛
Don't even ask me how.

70
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,930
這次選舉太重要了
This election is too important.

71
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,660
是選弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
You have a choice between Francis Underwood

72
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,950
還是選真正的英雄
and a real hero.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,110
當你濫用"戰爭"這個詞  事情就會變成這樣
This is what happens when you throw around a word like "War."

74
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,500
全都亂作一團
All hell breaks loose.

75
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,150
他救了斯夸爾  他救了我們所有人
He saved Squire. He saved all of us.

76
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,730
戰爭不是兒戲
War is real.

77
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,190
本視頻由"美國人尋求真理"出資制作
Paid for by Americans for Truth.

78
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,630
我不知道我們得說多少遍
I don't know how many times I have to go through this,

79
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,460
但我的競選團隊跟那條廣告一點關系都沒有
but my campaign had nothing to do with that ad.

80
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,750
是超級政治行動委員會做的
That was a super PAC.

81
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,840
-我知道  但是  -但那些士兵
- I know, but-- - But those soldiers, though.

82
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,410
他們才是英雄
They're the ones.

83
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,500
這個國家欠他們太多了
This country owes them a lot.

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,660
-但那條廣告成天在播  -你想知道原因嗎
- But that ad is on all the time. - You wanna know why?

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,890
因為弗蘭克·安德伍德沒能保護這個國家的安全
Because Frank Underwood has failed to keep this country safe.

86
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,920
詹姆斯·米勒之死
The death of James Miller,

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,770
所謂的哈里發國對東首都電信的攻擊
the so-called ICO attack at Capital East Telecom network...

88
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,430
等等  你是說哈里發國不是罪魁禍首
Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying ICO wasn't responsible?

89
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,670
我是說這不重要
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

90
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,470
網絡通訊在總統眼皮底下癱瘓掉了
The Internet went down on the president's watch.

91
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,650
-你不覺得哈里發國  -聽著  弗萊德
- Don't you think ICO was-- - Now listen, Fred--

92
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,480
不  哈里發國才是真正的威脅
No, ICO is a real threat.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,700
還有很多人在等
There's a lot of people waiting

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,330
說好每個人問一個問題的
and I promised one question per person.

95
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,630
能跟你談話很高興
It was great talking to you,

96
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,970
明天別忘了去投票
and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,620
我們進行了多久了
Now, how long have we been going, anyway?

98
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,370
-四個小時  -四個小時
- Four hours. - Four hours.

99
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,130
那么還得再戰二十個小時
That means we got 20 hours to go

100
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,510
我還沒來得及感謝波利跳的朋友們
and I haven't even had the chance to thank my friends at Pollyhop

101
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,060
感謝他們促成了這一切  并直播這一活動
for making this all possible and live streaming this event.

感謝本杰明·格蘭特和他的團隊
Benjamin Grant and his crew.

103
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,480
好了  下一個問題是什么
All right. What's the next question?

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,070
安妮  緬因州的安妮  你想問什么
Annie? Annie from Maine. What's on your mind?

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
弗萊德是我們的人嗎
Was Fred one of ours?

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,710
我覺得是  我們得繼續挑那條廣告的刺
I think so. We're gonna keep hitting the ad.

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,450
莉安安排好了提問的人  你到了嗎
LeAnn's got callers lined up. Are you there yet?

108
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,200
快了  然后再回飛機上
Almost. Then back on the plane.

109
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,490
-我要繼續了  -還是在俄亥俄嗎
- I'm about to go on. - Ohio, still?

110
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,450
是啊  他看上去怎么樣  康威
Oh, yeah. And how's he looking? Conway?

111
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,770
他才直播了四個小時  他堅持不下去的
Well, he's only four hours in. It's not sustainable.

112
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,930
但他是不是氣勢逼人
But is he commanding?

113
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,630
他很傲慢  弗蘭西斯
He's arrogant, Francis.

114
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,850
-總統先生  -我得掛了
- Mr. President? - I have to go.

115
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,570
好  葛底斯堡見
Okay. See you in Gettysburg.

116
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,880
你是說  要是安德伍德
You're saying it doesn't matter

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,780
知道賄賂的事也沒關系
if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?

118
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,140
我是說  那無論如何都不好
Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.

119
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,240
他要么是從他自己黨派的人那兒偷來了總統之位
He either stole the presidency from his own party,

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,870
要么是在腐敗的政府中做了副總統
or he was vice president in a corrupt administration.

121
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,850
但我們應該讓委員會做好本職工作
But it's important that we let the committee do its job.

122
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,510
感謝你的來電  安妮
So thanks for your call, Annie.

123
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,020
夏威夷德拉海灘的亞瑟·卡波  亞瑟  你好嗎
Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii. Arthur, how you doing?

124
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,150
他們為什么想跟你說話
Why did they want to talk to you?

125
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,300
抱歉  誰  你的問題是什么  亞瑟
I'm sorry, who? Uh, what's your question, Arthur?

126
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,910
約書·馬斯特森和扎克瑞
Josh Masterson and Zachary...

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,700
我忘了他姓什么  殺害吉姆·米勒的恐怖分子
I forget his last name. But the terrorists who killed Jim Miller.

128
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,040
好  那個
Right. Uh, well...

129
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,440
我只知道他們的一系列要求
All I know is what they said in their list of demands.

130
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,530
他們相信我會當選  成為總統
And they believed I would be elected president.

131
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,650
但說真的  為什么  為什么是你
But really, why? Why you?

132
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,150
我與他們的談判
I successfully negotiated

133
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,600
成功救出了卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,490
-但沒救成吉姆·米勒  -我沒得到機會
- But not Jim Miller. - I wasn't given the chance.

135
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,900
他回答問題的方式  你怎么看
What's your read on him, the way he answers those questions?

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,390
-他有所隱瞞  -是嗎
- He's hiding something. - Right.

137
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,670
但這無所謂
But it doesn't matter.

138
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,880
他很現代  讓總統不那么高高在上
He's modern. He makes the presidency accessible.

139
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,590
你難道不想看到總統候選人通宵連線嗎
I mean, don't you want to see the candidate stay up all night?

140
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,440
你是說弗蘭西斯老了嗎
Are you calling Francis old?

141
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,640
多謝各位熱情的掌聲  女士們先生們
I appreciate the applause, ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,110
但我知道你們是在為你們想見的那個女人鼓掌
but I imagine it's for the woman you really came to see.

143
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,900
"這是危機四伏的時刻"
"These are dangerous times."

144
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,500
現在確實危機四伏
These are dangerous times.

145
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,410
副總統候選人
...of the United States,

146
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,200
克萊爾·安德伍德
Claire Underwood.

147
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,070
要知道  他只比我大幾歲
He's only a couple years older than me, you know.

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,140
謝謝  謝謝你們  內華達
Thank you. Thank you, Nevada!

149
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,250
我非常感謝你們一大早來到這里
I really appreciate you all coming out here this morning.

150
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,590
零售式競選真是無可替代
No substitute for retail politics.

151
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,480
尤其是她的形象
Especially her brand.

152
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,120
謝謝
Thank you.

153
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,030
能請你給我拿杯水嗎
Could you get me some water, please?

154
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,470
大家好啊
Hello, everyone.

155
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,240
非常感謝
Thank you so much.

156
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,430
謝謝你們  你們真是太好了
Thank you very much. That's very kind.

157
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,460
非常感謝
Oh, thanks so much.

158
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,350
別鼓掌了
Oh, now stop that.

159
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,590
停下吧  別鼓了  夠啦夠啦
Stop it, stop it. Enough, enough, enough. Enough.

160
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,110
我都臉紅了  這么吹捧我
It's embarrassing, all of that adulation.

161
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,840
你好  很高興見到你  謝謝你能來
Hello, nice to see you. Thank you so much for coming out.

162
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,380
非常感謝
Much appreciated.

163
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,720
-杰克  -演講很成功  總統先生
- Jack! - Great speech, Mr. President.

164
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,090
你真是把我的心里話說出來了
It's like you're saying what I'm thinking.

165
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,210
這就對了  謝謝
Well, that is the idea. Thank you.

166
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,150
不過話說康威的事有點讓我擔心啊
Uh, I'm a little worried about the Conway thing, though.

167
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,380
提起了好多問題
Bringing up a lot of questions.

168
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,290
但沒得到多少回答
But not a lot of answers.

169
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,300
我們也不想在大選投票日前一天
Yeah, and we don't need to keep hearing about that article

170
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,580
老提起那篇文章吧
the day before the election.

171
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,470
有什么辦法嗎
What are we doing about it?

172
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,580
我們聚在這里了  杰克
Well, we're here, Jack.

173
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,220
我們要多握手  能扳回一個算一個
We are fighting back one handshake at a time.

174
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,190
格溫多林  你今天真是太美了
Gwendolyn, you look absolutely stunning.

175
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,690
能麻煩給我照張相嗎  史蒂夫
May I get a photograph, please, Steve?

176
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,210
麻煩你  千萬別把他照進去
Could you do this, please? Make sure you cut him out.

177
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,840
接下來是來自德州科珀斯克里斯蒂的杰弗
We have Jeff from Corpus Christi, Texas.

178
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,330
你今天怎么樣  杰弗
How are you doing today, Jeff?

179
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,720
我們看到那條營救行動的廣告了
We saw the ad. About the rescue.

180
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,690
杰弗啊  這個話題我前面已經說過了
You know, Jeff, I feel like we have been through this already.

181
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,690
您救了我哥哥的命  先生
You saved my brother's life, sir.

182
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,740
克雷格·斯夸爾
Craig Squire.

183
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,270
斯夸爾上尉  就是你哥哥
Captain Squire. That's... that's your brother?

184
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,280
上尉
Captain.

185
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,270
還記得我嗎
Remember me?

186
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,740
我記得  我當然記得
I do remember. Of course I remember.

187
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,710
我以為你不愿重提舊事
I didn't think you wanted talk about it.

188
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,070
我們挺過來了  就夠了  是不是
We lived through it. That's enough, isn't it?

189
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,100
我一直沒機會感謝你  告訴你
I never got to thank you and tell you...

190
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,910
斯夸爾上尉  換了你也會救我的
Captain Squire, you would've done the same.

191
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,230
我不知道  我當時在那里
I don't know. I was in there.

192
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,470
他們朝我身上扔尸體  一個接一個
They were tossing bodies on top of me, one after the other...

193
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,340
我死定了
I was already dead.

194
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,720
不對  就好像我已經死了一次
That's not right. It's like I've been dead once already.

195
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,510
但那些尸體  就那么堆在一起
But the bodies... the way they were stuck together.

196
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,320
又那么熱  還有味道
And the heat and the smell...

197
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,050
但你還記得你把我拉出來的時候嗎
But you know when you were pulling me out, remember?

198
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,390
我其實記不太清楚了
I... I don't remember much, actually.

199
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,110
一切都發生得太快了
It all happened pretty quick.

200
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,840
我知道你聽見了
I know you heard it.

201
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,720
你得打斷這個問題
You have to get him out of this question.

202
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,770
他不喜歡提這些事  你知道的
You know he doesn't like talking about this. You know that.

203
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,430
-漢娜  -得了
- Hannah, - Come on, man.

204
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,820
-我們談談  -你肯定聽見了
- let's talk. - I know you did.

205
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,060
我當時只想盡快把咱們救出去
I was just trying to get us out of there as fast as I could.

206
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,860
克雷格  我們活下來了
Craig, we're here.

207
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,850
-我們挺過來了  -是  可是
- We made it. - Yeah, but...

208
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,150
你得繼續生活
You gotta live your life.

209
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,890
謝謝您接我們的電話
Thanks for taking our call.

210
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,230
謝謝
Thank you.

211
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,250
他說的程度還不夠  他沒讓康威...
He didn't call him out enough. He didn't get Conway to--

212
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,200
聽著  他盡力了
Look... he did what he could.

213
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,240
他聽到了什么  他那是什么意思
What did he hear? What did he mean by that?

214
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,780
不知道  那是威爾和他之間的事
I don't know. It's between Will and him.

215
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,850
他早就想讓威爾出來說清楚了  不過
He's wanted Will to come clean about it for a long time, but...

216
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,740
沒能如愿
it didn't happen.

217
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,070
所以  看在克雷格的分上
Which is why, for Craig's sake,

218
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,870
我們得讓他們再連線一次
we need to get them back on the phone.

219
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,100
哈維小姐  你跟了我們幾個月了
Miss Harvey, you've been on us for months.

220
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,190
抱歉沒能成功  
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

221
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,190
如果這意味著交易取消  沒事
If this means the deal's off, okay.

222
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,800
我們總能找個去處
We can always find a place to go.

223
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,980
讓我再跟他談談  我們可不希望他
Just let me talk to him again. We wouldn't want him to--

224
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,270
天啊  我哥哥經歷得夠多了
Jesus Christ! My brother has been through enough.

225
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,400
我們不干了
We're done.

226
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,270
請你離開
I need you to leave.

227
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,740
他做得很好
He's doing great.

228
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,320
是嗎
Is he?

229
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,200
那廣告對我們有好處
That ad's playing for us.

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,730
聽著  我是同意了
Look, I... I agreed to this.

231
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,680
-但我了解我丈夫  -我知道
- But I know my husband. - I know you do.

232
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,240
那些問題是意料之中的  對嗎
And those questions were to be expected, yes?

233
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,960
斯夸爾改了主意是好事
It's a good thing Squire changed his mind.

234
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,110
我們今晚可以調出一些帶子  拼湊點什么出來
We can pull some tape and put something together tonight.

235
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,600
明早上放出來
Hit some markets in the morning.

236
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,270
等到了投票的時候
When it's time to vote...

237
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,770
威爾救了他的命
Will saved his life.

238
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,550
太過了
This is too much.

239
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,210
我不想再聽到關于那場戰爭的問題了
I don't want any more questions about the war.

240
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,560
不行的
That's not gonna work.

241
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,660
聽著  我可以給你看數據
Look, I can show you numbers,

242
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,620
可以給你看這對我們多有利
I can show you how well it's all playing for us.

243
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,710
我只是說  馬克  這是...
What I'm saying, Mark, is that this--

244
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,590
我做這行很久了  漢娜
I've been at this a long time, Hannah.

245
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,160
知道嗎  當馬歇爾告訴我你有空時
You know, when Marshall told me you were available--

246
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,560
馬歇爾和我是老相識了
Marshall and I go way back.

247
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,010
這時機對我們所有人都合適  對嗎
The timing is right for all of us, right?

248
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,670
我們非常感激
We're very grateful.

249
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,390
那他就會告訴你  我通常不會
Then he will tell you, I don't get involved,

250
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,440
在這么晚的時候插進來
not this late in the game, unless

251
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,440
除非我知道我能發揮影響
I know I can make a difference.

252
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,550
所以不管威爾和斯夸爾發生了什么
So whatever happened to Will with Squire, whatever...

253
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,590
-不是  -我不想知道  也不需要知道
- It's not-- - I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.

254
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,350
但不管那些事讓他承受著怎樣的痛苦
But whatever pain he's carrying about what happened...

255
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,690
對我們是有利的
it's working for us.

256
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,940
所以  我需要你
So, this is what I need from you.

257
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,510
回去那里
To go back out there

258
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,020
確保他能撐到明早
and just make sure he makes it through until morning.

259
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,830
他有機會做一個好總統
He has a chance to be a fine president.

260
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,740
一個偉大的總統
A great president.

261
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,420
那更好了
Even better.

262
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,570
因為我們需要這樣的總統
Because we could use one.

263
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,980
斯夸爾沒出現在那廣告里是有原因的
There's a reason that Squire didn't appear in that ad.

264
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,130
我還在確認細節
I'm just nailing down the specifics.

265
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,680
-讓道格加入吧  -他在去費城的路上
- Let's bring Doug in on this. - He's on his way to Philly.

266
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,830
而且恕我直言  先生
And with all due respect, sir,

267
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,600
他的技能在這里并不適用
his skill set doesn't necessarily apply here.

268
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,330
你知道道格跟我多久了嗎  莉安
Do you know how long Doug has worked for me, LeAnn?

269
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,720
不太清楚
Not exactly, no.

270
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
幾乎是一輩子了
Well, it's just this side of forever.

271
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,620
我了解他的一切
I know everything about him.

272
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,620
他的優勢  他的弱點  他的技能
His strengths, his weaknesses, his skill set

273
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,260
以及他心里在想什么
and the contents of his soul.

274
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,040
希望您不是在質疑我的忠誠
I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.

275
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,250
我只是想了解為我工作的人  莉安
I just like to know about the people who work for me, LeAnn.

276
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,690
-我很坦誠的  -我根本不信
- I'm pretty straightforward. - I don't believe that for a second.

277
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,730
我第一次跟道格坐下來談
The first time I sat down with Doug,

278
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,440
更像是他的坦白而非對話
it was more of a confession than a conversation.

279
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,080
他跟我說了他酗酒的事  他的過去
He told me about his drinking, his past.

280
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,020
他對我徹底敞開了心扉
He was completely open with me.

281
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,520
我不覺得我們能指望克雷格·斯夸爾
I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.

282
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,620
那我們還有什么好說的
Then why am I still talking to you?

283
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,830
我沒有掩飾內心  先生
I'm not hiding the contents of my soul, sir.

284
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,040
去找凡妮莎·莫里森
Reach out to Vanessa Morrison.

285
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,780
我已經聯系總監了
I already reached out to the director.

286
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,360
對  但道格還沒有
Yes, but Doug hasn't.

287
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,970
讓他去做  你在康威結束他的小節目前
So have him do it and then you come up with something else

288
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,940
想點別的點子出來
before Conway is done with his little sideshow.

289
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,640
關于接下來的演講
And in terms of what comes next,

290
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,790
我調整了開場白  縮減了正文的篇幅
I adjusted the opening remarks and cut some from the stump.

291
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,220
正文不用改了
The stump is just fine.

292
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,630
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

293
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,770
請給我接第一夫人
Get me the First Lady, please.

294
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,790
這個嘛  簡單來說就是
Well, the... the short answer is

295
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,720
在民主體制下  每個人都有相同的權利
in a democracy, everyone has the same rights...

296
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,230
和相同的機會
the same opportunities.

297
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,780
喂
Hello.

298
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,220
我們身邊的人知道風險有多大嗎
Do the people around us understand what it takes?

299
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,680
我知道康威的聲勢起來了
Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,

300
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,610
但這不代表接下來的一天里我們不能扳回來
but it doesn't mean we can't surmount it in the next 24 hours.

301
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,790
他們知道我們付出了多少才走到今天
Do they know what we have done to get this far?

302
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,810
湯姆現在就坐在我對面
Tom is sitting across from me right now.

303
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,630
我才不管你對面坐著誰  克萊爾
I don't care who you're sitting next to, Claire.

304
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,890
我們都在拼盡全力  全速拉票
We're all doing everything we can as fast as we can.

305
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,880
我不喜歡  我不喜歡追趕別人
I don't like it. I don't like chasing this.

306
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,260
你下一站去哪
What's your next stop?

307
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,400
-我們20分鐘到斯克蘭頓  -你得養養嗓子
- We, uh... We're in Scranton in 20. - You need to save your voice.

308
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,780
我們戰場上見
I'll see you on the battlefield.

309
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,420
總統怎么樣
How's the President doing?

310
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,150
他還把自己當個年輕人
He's acting like he's still 30 years old.

311
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,330
我們都是
We both are.

312
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,250
這是好事  還是壞事
Is that good... or bad?

313
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,050
得看我們是輸是贏了
That depends on if we win or lose.

314
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,310
因為我是個老兵
Because I'm a vet

315
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,510
我還是沒弄清楚到底怎么回事
and I'm still not clear on exactly what happened.

316
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,500
我覺得具體情況
You know, I think everything

317
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,630
當時在場的士兵已經說得很清楚了
has been said by the soldiers who were there.

318
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
不對  你的飛機
No. 'Cause your plane,

319
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,510
是被擊落還是按計劃去營救
was it shot down or was it a planned rescue?

320
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,330
是計劃的
Planned, yes.

321
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,590
但是后來計劃不得不調整了
Until the plan had to change.

322
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,620
-我想你懂的  -我不懂  先生
- I think you get the idea. - No, I don't get it, sir.

323
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,970
-你是飛行員吧  -對
- You were a pilot, right? - Yes.

324
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,130
那你為什么會出艙執行地面任務
So why were your boots even on the ground?

325
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,080
我們的情報有誤
Our intel was flawed.

326
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,970
情報有誤  我只得介入  沒辦法
Our intel was flawed and I... I had to step in. I had to.

327
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,160
你好  麥克
Hi, Mike.

328
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,400
我丈夫是個謙虛的人
My husband is a humble man.

329
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,030
你是不會聽到他那天英勇救人的全部過程的
You're never going to get the details of his bravery that day.

330
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,580
至少他自己不會說
At least, not from him.

331
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,950
在我看來  他的戰友說得好
To me, his comrades say it all.

332
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,300
威爾是個有能力應對任何狀況的人
Will is a man who is equipped to deal with whatever comes at him.

333
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,650
而現在  我想和你說一件更重要的事
And now, I'd like to put in a word on a more practical matter,

334
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,500
這些新集中選民的投票中心
these new centralized voting centers.

335
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,150
因為最近我們收到了許多來電和疑問
Because we've had lots of calls and questions.

336
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,840
無論你支持哪位候選人
Whichever candidate you support,

337
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,770
你一定要去投票  這至關重要
it's essential that you get out to vote.

338
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,030
搭鄰居的車  或者聯系當地的黨務辦公室
Ask a neighbor for a ride or call your local party office.

339
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,230
這場競選太激烈  決不能掉以輕心
This race is too close for complacency.

340
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,320
我選你
You got my vote!

341
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,810
-安德伍德  -非常感謝
- Underwood! - Thank you so much.

342
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,490
謝謝  謝謝你們
Thank you. Thank you.

343
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,510
太謝謝你們了  謝謝
Thank you so much. Thank you.

344
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,720
謝謝
Oh, thank you.

345
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,080
能麻煩你再給我拿杯蜂蜜茶嗎
Could you also get me a tea with honey, please?

346
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,000
-你這樣還能演講嗎  -我沒事
- Are you gonna be all right to speak? - Yeah, I'm fine.

347
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,920
-聽聽你的嗓子  弗蘭西斯  -別說了
- Listen to your voice, Francis. - Stop.

348
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,010
你這幾天一直連軸轉地跑
You have been running yourself into the ground,

349
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,540
好幾天都沒睡了
you haven't slept for days.

350
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,730
要不你給演講開個頭
Why don't you kick off the speech,

351
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,710
然后交給我  我給大家解釋
let me take over, and then I will explain to...

352
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,180
解釋說總統失聲了嗎
That the president's lost his voice?

353
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,250
不行  你不能這么說
No, you're not gonna say that.

354
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,010
這么關鍵的時候  可不能出這種大新聞
We're not gonna have that headline as we enter the final stretch.

355
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,280
尤其那個蘭斯洛特似的小白臉在那兒嘚吧個沒完
Especially since Sir Lancelot is out there yapping all day long.

356
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,800
我倒不覺得康威是蘭斯洛特
I'm not really sure that Conway's a Sir Lancelot.

357
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,970
是嗎  那你覺得誰是
Oh, really? Then who would you assign that role to?

358
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,370
吐得我真心疼  過來一下
God, I hate to waste that. Excuse me.

359
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,490
隊伍里有個年輕人
There was a young man in line,

360
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,120
在大廳另一邊  差不多靠著第二扇門
on the other side, sort of against that second door.

361
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,340
大概一米八
Six foot tall...

362
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,130
-讓我們單獨說句話吧  -好啊
- Maybe just give us a moment. - Sure.

363
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,240
你能不能試試搞到聯系方式
Can you see if you can get some contact information?

364
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,580
要是能的話把他叫出來  謝謝
Or pull him out if you can. Thank you.

365
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,230
我不是想接管  我是說我們應該以搭檔形象示人
I didn't mean take over. I just meant let's appear as a ticket.

366
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,990
-"團結還是分裂"  -弗蘭西斯
- "Are we united or are we divided?" - Francis--

367
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,300
"就在葛底斯堡這里  最血腥的戰役之一"
"Here at Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles--"

368
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,770
我會背你的講稿
I know your speech.

369
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,900
但你能結尾嗎  你得知道怎么結尾  克萊爾
But can you finish? You have to know how to finish, Claire.

370
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,370
我十分榮幸地向大家介紹
I have the distinct honor of introducing you to,

371
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,170
如果一切順利的話
God-willing and the creek don't rise,

372
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,530
美國現任也是下一任總統
the current and next President of the United States of America,

373
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,380
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood!

374
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,990
謝謝
Thank you.

375
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,050
謝謝  溫特斯議員
Thank you, Congressman Winters,

376
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,070
謝謝  賓夕法尼亞
and thank you, Pennsylvania.

377
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,330
還要感謝我的競選搭檔  妻子
And my running mate, my wife,

378
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,530
摯友和伴侶  克萊爾·安德伍德
and my friend and my partner, Claire Underwood.

379
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,700
跟道格·斯坦普講話我總是有時間的
I've always got a few minutes for Doug Stamper.

380
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,720
再次抱歉  讓你久等了
Again, sorry to keep you waiting.

381
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,690
真的不用給你拿點什么嗎
You sure I can't offer you something?

382
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,330
我不喝酒  州長
I don't drink, Governor.

383
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,330
我有蘇打水  湯力水
Well, I got club soda, tonic...

384
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,900
你說你會建立投票中心
You said you were going to establish voting centers.

385
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,540
沒錯  我試過了
I was. I tried.

386
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,020
說出來你都不信  選區負責人
I got pushback from the precinct captains

387
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,230
給了我多大阻力
like you wouldn't believe.

388
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,870
-你說你會派警衛隊  -那我也試過了
- You said you were gonna deploy troops. - I tried that, too.

389
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,760
我跟美國公民自由聯盟的羅杰·弗蘭克提了
I floated the order past Roger Frank at the ACLU.

390
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,960
他跟黑人聯盟的巴尼·萊納德說了
He mentioned it to Barney Leonard at the Black Coalition.

391
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,080
兩小時內  我就接到八個怒氣沖沖的電話
And within two hours, I got eight angry phone calls

392
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,470
告訴我  要是保護遠郊地區
telling me exactly what would happen

393
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,780
而不保護費城  會發生什么
if I chose to protect exurban areas instead of Philly.

394
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,000
你最好別騙我  州長
You don't want to lie to me, Governor.

395
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,570
我剛從巴尼·萊納德的辦公室過來
I just came from Barney Leonard's office.

396
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,410
-你想改口嗎  -拜托
- You wanna change your story? - Please.

397
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,940
巴尼會告訴你  他威脅挑起種族暴亂
Barney's gonna tell you that he threatened a fucking race riot.

398
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,920
你眼睛都不眨一下地
You fucking lied, straight up,

399
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,870
對美國總統撒謊了
to the President of the United States.

400
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,760
道格
Doug.

401
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,640
道格
Doug.

402
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,750
-請接巴尼·萊納德的辦公室  -把電話放下
- Barney Leonard's office, please. - Put the phone down.

403
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,160
我是道格·斯坦普
It's Doug Stamper.

404
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,910
對  我需要再找他一次
Yes, I need him one more time.

405
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,130
好吧  掛電話吧
Fine. Hang it up.

406
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,470
我會安排警衛隊的
I'll get you your troops.

407
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,450
你想知道真相嗎
You want the truth?

408
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,640
不感興趣  我已經知道了
Not interested. I had that coming in.

409
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
結束了
It's over.

410
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,610
安德伍德明天必輸無疑  他完蛋了
Underwood's gonna lose tomorrow. He's done.

411
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,800
他一完蛋  你也完了
And when he's done, you're done.

412
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,990
你將一無所有  到那時  你就會消失
You'll have nothing left. And then, you'll just disappear.

413
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,760
感謝你抽時間  州長
Thank you for your time, Governor.

414
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,830
要是想把賓州的
What would it take to

415
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,250
國民警衛隊收歸政府所管  需要怎么做
federalize the National Guard in Pennsylvania?

416
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,450
總統讓我給他找些
The president asked me to get him some information

417
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,970
艾瑞克·羅林斯的資料
about Eric Rawlings.

418
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,580
-誰  -葛底斯堡集會的
- Who? - From the Gettysburg event.

419
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,020
我來交給他
I'll give it to him.

420
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,380
穆罕默德·卡拉比  34歲  敘利亞公民
Muhammed Kalabi, 34, Syrian national.

421
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,070
當地線人確認  他的身份可信度很高
Local assets confirm his ID with high confidence.

422
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,900
卡拉比和哈里發國聯系非常緊密
Kalabi has strong connections to ICO.

423
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,830
去年秋天的貝魯特爆炸案
Bombing in Beirut last fall.

424
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,280
貝魯特事件一個月之前
A month before Beirut,

425
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,880
在開羅和艾哈邁迪在一起
with Ahmadi, in Cairo.

426
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,950
先生  現在在美國
Currently, sir, there are four Muhammed Kalabis

427
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,390
有四個穆罕默德·卡拉比
in the United States.

428
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,310
其中兩個和哈里發國的卡拉比年齡相仿
Two are approximately the same age as the ICO Kalabi,

429
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
其中一個三周前從阿富汗經加拿大
and one entered the United States three weeks ago

430
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,030
進入美國境內
from Afghanistan by way of Canada.

431
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,100
他是去看他在田納西州諾克斯維爾
He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee

432
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,830
一家書店工作的女朋友
who works at a Knoxville bookstore.

433
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,110
你為什么告訴我這些
So why are you bringing me all this?

434
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,110
你問有什么選擇  先生
You asked for options, sir.

435
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,090
在選舉日當天逮捕穆罕默德·卡拉比
To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?

436
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,460
凱茜  要是他告訴當局
Cathy, what's gonna happen

437
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,280
他不是恐怖分子怎么辦
when he tells the authorities he's the wrong one?

438
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,820
但那就是在選舉日之后了
But that would be after the election--

439
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,160
三四天前也許還可行  凱茜
Well, that might have played three or four days ago, Cathy,

440
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,530
但現在已經太遲了
but now it's too late.

441
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,960
你三四天前就拿到這個了嗎
Did you have this three or four days ago?

442
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,470
如果我拿到了肯定會給你看的  先生
I would have brought it to you, sir.

443
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,850
好吧  先這樣吧
All right, well, let's leave it at that.

444
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,300
請道格進來
Send in Doug.

445
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,700
國務卿要走了
The secretary is just leaving.

446
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,920
這是斯夸爾營救行動的全部資料
That's all we have on the Squire rescue.

447
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,900
很不幸  還不夠多
It's not enough, unfortunately.

448
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,040
先生...
Sir...

449
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,690
馬修斯那邊  我覺得他不會照辦
when it comes to Matthews, I don't believe he'll deliver.

450
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,110
我們奪下主動權吧  我們得保護投票站
Let's take this from his hands. We need to protect the polls.

451
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,770
你不用下命令
The request won't come from you.

452
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,550
你會與這事毫無關聯
The way this thing is built, you're nowhere near it.

453
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,810
稍等一下
Hold on a second.

454
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,370
賓州的票數怎么樣了
How are the numbers in Pennsylvania?

455
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,440
勢頭不錯  但還在誤差范圍內  先生
They're good, but they're well within the margin of error, sir.

456
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,430
我們不希望看起來
So we don't want to look like

457
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,780
像是把一支武裝國民警衛隊
we're shoving an armed unit of National Guards

458
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,950
強加給了吉姆·馬修斯  對嗎
down Jim Matthews' throat, right?

459
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,910
-對  -巴尼·萊納德打給我了
- Right. - So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.

460
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,880
你逼得太緊了  道格
You pushed too hard, Doug.

461
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,910
但聽著  我們有四年來對付馬修斯
But look, we'll have four years to take care of Matthews,

462
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,530
我們會收拾他的
and we will.

463
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,450
但如果有別的辦法呢
But what if there was another way?

464
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,020
我敢說  如果大家都坦誠面對自己
I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves,

465
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,050
沒有一個人會說他真的信任安德伍德總統
can say they truly trust President Underwood.

466
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,630
憑什么要信任他
Why should they?

467
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,550
我們國家面臨了如此多的威脅
With so many threats to our country,

468
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,390
現在比任何時候都更得選出...
now it's more important than ever to elect...

469
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,850
四年來重點的偏頗
...four years of misguided priorities,

470
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,150
使共和黨變回了追逐私利的黨派
backing the GOP into soliciting private and special interests.

471
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,190
你知道嗎
You know what?

472
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,100
怎么了
What?

473
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,160
-我想當那種人  -哪種人
- I wanna be that person. - What person?

474
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,690
那種做一個小時就能拍屁股走人的人
The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.

475
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,920
不是那樣....
That's not what this--

476
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,680
道格  我的性經歷跟你一樣久
Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.

477
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,280
你打給我的時候  我就是這種感覺
And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.

478
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,510
我就想  "好啊"
And I thought, "Great."

479
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,490
可我來了  你在哪里
But I'm here now. Where are you?

480
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,680
我送你回家吧
I should take you home.

481
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,630
不了
No.

482
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,290
-不必勞煩你  -別這樣
- You don't have to. - Come on.

483
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,470
-我自己打車回  -我要送你回家
- I'll take a cab. - I'm taking you home.

484
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,870
你怎么了
What is going on with you?

485
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,030
你說得對  我不該打給你
You're right. I shouldn't have called.

486
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,000
我該回去工作了
I gotta get back to work.

487
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,670
關于新建成的投票站外
Reports are pouring in of protests being staged

488
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,680
發生抗議活動的新聞報道不斷涌入
outside of many of our newly established voting centers.

489
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,500
這引出了一個問題  美國人民
Which begs the question, are Americans fed up

490
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,290
是否已經厭倦了政客們無休止的鬧劇
with our politicians' seemingly unquenchable thirst for conflict?

491
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,500
一邊是安德伍德呼吁正式...
Between Underwood's call for a formal...

492
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,560
想好了嗎
Make a decision?

493
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,990
共和黨的候選人又都是軍人出身
...and the strong military ticket on the Republican side?

494
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,930
巴素·海頓  雙份  不加冰
Basil Hayden's, double, neat.

495
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,460
巴素·海頓
Basil Hayden?

496
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
我這兒可沒有  伙計
You're killing me, buddy.

497
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,880
-你有什么  -布萊特是最好的了
- What do you got? - Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.

498
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,930
那就這個吧
I'll have that.

499
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,000
-女人  -工作
- Woman? - Work.

500
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,670
是啊  沒什么是永恒的
Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.

501
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,730
請那邊那兩位
Those two down there,

502
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,360
還有所有進店的人  花光為止
and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.

503
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,260
這是給你的
That's for you.

504
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,280
我睡不著
I couldn't sleep.

505
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,360
你的喉嚨不舒服嗎
Is it your throat?

506
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,150
足夠嗎
Is it enough?

507
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,970
我們的努力
What we're doing?

508
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,060
我...
I...

509
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,360
是的
Yes.

510
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,560
那為什么我們沒有遙遙領先
Then why aren't we farther ahead?

511
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,620
大多數的民調顯示... 
Most of the polls have us--

512
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,720
我不相信民調
Oh, I don't trust the polls.

513
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,480
除了極少數外  我不相信任何人或任何事
With few exceptions, I don't trust anyone or anything.

514
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,310
投票沒開始前一切都是未知的
We won't know for sure until the vote's begun.

515
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,690
但他們的投票率肯定會降低的
But turnout for their side is sure to be down.

516
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,930
我們今天差點就打敗康威了
We almost had Conway today.

517
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,250
但我們確實傷到了他
And we did some damage.

518
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,530
或許我們不知道他在隱瞞什么
And maybe we don't know what he's hiding,

519
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,720
但公眾知道他有所隱瞞
but the public knows there's something out there.

520
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,830
他睡覺有時會哼歌
He hums in his sleep sometimes.

521
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,220
哼歌
Hums?

522
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,900
哼什么
Like what?

523
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,710
不知道
I don't know.

524
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,980
聽不出來
Nothing recognizable.

525
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,510
他經常哼嗎
Does he do it often?

526
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,040
有時哼
Sometimes.

527
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,660
哼給我聽聽什么樣
Do it for me. What's it sound like?

528
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,580
我給你拿點潤喉的東西
Let's get you something for your throat.

529
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,490
不用  我沒事  你接著睡吧
No, I'm fine. You go back to sleep.

530
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,480
我們明天會成功的  弗蘭西斯
We're gonna get there tomorrow, Francis.

531
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,950
我在一場籌款會上
So, I'm... I'm at this fundraiser.

532
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,470
在阿默甘西特海灘的一幢豪宅里
It's a beautiful house on the beach in Amagansett,

533
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,410
我和一位美女跳了一整夜舞
and I've been dancing all night with this incredible girl,

534
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,520
我完全配不上她
way out of my league.

535
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,660
但當時很晚很晚了
But it's late, very late,

536
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,010
我是個很負責的年輕人
and I'm a very responsible young man, so...

537
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,250
我溜上樓拿我的外套
I sneak upstairs to get my jacket.

538
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,810
但我沒想到...
But lo and behold...

539
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,710
她跟了上來
she's following me.

540
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,330
我看到了走廊鏡子里的自己
And I see my reflection in the hallway mirror and...

541
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,410
我渾身冒汗
I'm just sweating like a pig.

542
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,080
心跳加速
My heart's racing.

543
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,870
她從我身后走來
And she walks up behind me.

544
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,090
我轉身時
And as I turn...

545
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,750
看到了月光映在她的面龐上
I see the moonlight on her face...

546
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,390
一切仿佛都慢了下來
and everything just slows down.

547
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,660
我們就是這樣認識的
And that's how we met.

548
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,900
我和漢娜
Me and Hannah.

549
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,240
很高興并非只有我還在熬夜
Well, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one up this late.

550
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,110
總統先生  你有問題要問我嗎
Mr. President, do you have a question for me?

551
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,070
不  我沒有  但我可以給你個機會
No, I don't. But I thought I would give you the chance

552
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,200
問我一個問題  只有一個
to ask me a question. Just one.

553
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,090
我不確定我想問你問題
I'm not sure I have any questions for you.

554
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,360
別害羞  威爾
Don't be shy, Will.

555
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,660
畢竟  機會難得
I mean, after all, this is a rare opportunity.

556
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,070
只有你和我
Just between you and me.

557
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,870
只有你和我  還有其他今晚
It's just you and me and all the other Americans out there

558
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,450
失眠的美國人
having trouble sleeping tonight.

559
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,610
那是因為他們知道
Well, that's because they know

560
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,740
明天的投票會決定他們的未來
that tomorrow's vote will decide their future.

561
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,800
這就是關鍵問題  對吧
So that's the question then, isn't it?

562
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,380
未來屬于誰
Who does the future belong to?

563
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,240
我覺得只有上帝能回答那個問題
Well, I don't think anyone but God can answer that one.

564
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,830
我們只能在此生盡可能地證明自己
All we can do is make a case for ourselves while we're here.

565
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,960
好吧
Okay.

566
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,590
我想問你
Here's my question.

567
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,450
我成功的談判
I successfully negotiated

568
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,000
讓卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒得以釋放
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

569
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,640
但你插手進來
Then you stepped in.

570
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,310
你沒讓我完成任務  為什么
You didn't let me finish the job. Why?

571
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,780
你真想讓我回答那個問題嗎  威爾
Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?

572
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,660
-我不確定你想這么做  -我很想
- Because I'm not sure you do. - Oh, I do.

573
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,230
因為他們知道自己能夠占你便宜
Because they knew they could take advantage of you.

574
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,500
他們發現了
They saw it.

575
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,400
-怎么說  先生  -他們察覺出來了
- How's that, sir? - They felt it.

576
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,290
無論你在海外遭遇了什么
Whatever happened to you overseas,

577
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,510
你都不必感到內疚或慚愧
there's no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.

578
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,010
我為國盡忠了  我那么做
I served my country. I did what I did...

579
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,680
是因為我別無選擇
because it's what I had to do.

580
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,680
不像某些人
Not like some others.

581
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,520
我成年以來一直擔任公職  威爾
I've been in public office my entire adult life, Will.

582
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,810
其實我曾與你這種人是同學
The truth is, I went to school with guys like you.

583
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,620
英姿颯爽  心懷善意的人
Good looking guys with good intentions...

584
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,420
跟你一樣
just like you.

585
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,650
這是我的真心話
And I mean that sincerely.

586
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,140
我還想讓你知道  無論明天結果如何
And I want you to know that whatever happens tomorrow,

587
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,080
我從未質疑過你的意圖
I never doubted your intentions.

588
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,760
現在對你來說很晚了  總統先生  休息去吧
Must be late for you, Mr. President. Get some sleep.

589
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,160
恐怕我們倆今晚都很難睡得著
I doubt either of us will be getting much sleep tonight.

590
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,780
謝謝你接聽我的電話
But thank you for taking my call.

591
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,190
也謝謝你來電
Well, thank you for calling.

592
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,140
現在只剩下一個問題  一個很重要的問題
Now, there's only one more question, and it's a big one.

593
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
只能由你們自己回答
And you're gonna have to answer it yourselves.

594
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,350
誰會成為下任美國總統
Who's gonna be the next President of the United States?

595
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,730
我知道我會投給誰
I know who I'm voting for.

596
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,760
我想感謝辦成這次24小時節目的各位
I'd like to thank everyone who made the last 24 hours possible.

597
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
全體技術人員和工作人員
All the... the technicians and crew.

598
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,400
如果我們能像他們一樣齊心協力  那我保證
And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise,

599
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,760
我們真的會為世界上最偉大的國家
we will truly make this the first of many, many new days

600
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,000
開啟嶄新的未來
for the greatest country in the world.

601
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,110
早安  美國  天佑美國  謝謝
Good morning, America. God bless America, and thank you.

602
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,710
下線了  好了  各位
And we're out. Okay, guys.

603
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,210
你很棒
You did great.

604
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,550
-你做到了  -是啊
- You did it. - Yeah.

605
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,010
大家都很滿意
Everyone is so pleased.

606
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,650
我知道很辛苦  但你挺過來了
I know it was tough, but you got through it.

607
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,970
-我很為你驕傲  -謝謝
- I'm really proud of you. - Thank you.

608
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,880
只是些我需要回答的問題
Just some questions that I needed to answer.

609
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,210
我知道  但你做到了  你做到了
I know. But you did it. You did it.

610
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,950
-真棒  -非常棒
- Great job. - That was great.

611
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,590
-很出色  -謝謝
- Amazing. - Thank you.

612
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,660
測試  測試  一  二  三
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

613
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,430
測試  一  二  三
Testing. One, two, three.

614
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,860
稍稍加大增益  混響再強點
A little more gain. A skosh more reverb.

615
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,740
測試  測試  很好  很好
Testing, testing, testing. That's good. That's good.

616
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,420
我想感謝美國人民
I would like to thank the American people

617
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,980
今晚十分踴躍的支持
for their overwhelming support tonight.

618
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,400
作為下任總統  我非常重視這份職責
As your next president, I do not take this mandate lightly.

619
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,200
其實  壓力非常大
In fact... it is heavy as hell.

620
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,490
你倒是比安德伍德更有機會勝選
You got a better chance than Underwood does.

621
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,370
你的高跟鞋很高  布莉姬特
Those are very high heels, Bridget.

622
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,620
安德伍德一敗選  委員會就會解散
When Underwood loses, the committee goes away.

623
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,480
你的話讓我心痛
You're breaking my heart.

624
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,320
我本來還期待
I was looking forward to

625
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,270
聽你說說道格·斯坦普的料
hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.

626
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,410
我本來也期待跟你說的
Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.

627
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,840
我是來道謝的
I came here to thank you.

628
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,250
我從網上撤掉了那個
I took it down... off the Internet.

629
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,200
跟你談這事很奇怪  畢竟
It's weird, talking to you about this. I mean...

630
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,460
你看過
you saw it.

631
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,480
我弟弟本可能看到的
My brother could've seen that.

632
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,140
我會讓你想起你弟弟嗎
Do I remind you of your brother?

633
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,270
他要年輕[當下]一些
He's a little more present.

634
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,060
我的工作是展望未來
Well, it's my job to look ahead.

635
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,820
祝你好運
Good luck with that.

636
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,430
-非常感謝  -謝謝  先生
- Thank you so very much. - Thank you, sir.

637
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,260
我們拿到了昨晚的數據
We have the overnight numbers.

638
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,370
告訴我異常數據
Give me the outliers.

639
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,060
紐約掉了兩個點  新罕布什爾漲了兩個點
Minus two in New York. Plus two in New Hampshire.

640
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,160
都不算壞
Both not bad.

641
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,080
我一直不喜歡"不好不壞"這句話
"Half-empty, half-full" is an expression I have never cared for.

642
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,010
你昨晚的電話有作用
The call you made last night, it's helping.

643
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,470
今早登上了頭條
We grabbed the headlines this morning.

644
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,800
-道格  -是  先生
- Doug? - Yes, sir.

645
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,970
幫我聯系加夫尼的薩莉·安
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back in Gaffney

646
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,660
告訴我目前的投票率
and get me the turnout so far.

647
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,530
我可以告訴你全州投票率
I can get you the numbers for the state.

648
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,800
我不要全州的  我要加夫尼的投票率
No, I don't want that. I want the Gaffney turnout.

649
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,430
你收到陸續發來的全州數據就給我們
State numbers come in, you give them to us as they come.

650
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,410
任何異常都要告訴我們
Anything out of the ordinary, you let us know.

651
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,040
除此之外  沒其他事了  道格
Other than that, we're done. Oh, and, Doug?

652
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,350
-是  先生  -你知道去哪找我們
- Yes, sir. - You'll know where to find us.

653
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,800
你擔心我們剛看到的選民嗎
You're worried about the crowd we just saw.

654
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,750
不是人數  而是熱情程度
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.

655
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,860
我看不見得
I don't think so.

656
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,880
杰里  我得待會兒回你電話
Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.

657
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,760
這份九點的投票率是我們票倉的還是搖擺州的
This 9 a.m. turnout in our base precincts or swing?

658
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,930
票倉的
Base.

659
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,630
該死
Shit.

660
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,760
我的數據不同  你要不要...
I've got different numbers. You're gonna need--

661
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,190
我反復確認過了
I did confirm. Twice.

662
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,460
道格  是我  盡快回我電話
Doug, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this.

663
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,620
你只負責車險還是都有
You handle just automobile insurance or all kinds?

664
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:18,310
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《雙重賠償》

665
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,170
都有  火險  地震險
All kinds. Fire, earthquake,

666
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,570
失竊險  公眾責任險
theft, public liability.

667
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,100
集體險  工業險等等  也即將覆蓋
Group insurance, industrial stuff, and so on right down the line.

668
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,050
意外險
Accident insurance?

669
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,170
意外險  當然  迪特里克森夫人
Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

670
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,910
希望你能告訴我那腳鏈上刻了什么
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.

671
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,450
-我的名字而已  -未請教
- Just my name. - As for instance?

672
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,920
-菲莉斯  -菲莉斯  我想我喜歡這名字
- Phyllis. - Phyllis, huh? I think I like that.

673
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,280
咱們來這段
Let's do this one.

674
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,650
我開車繞著街區來回好多次了
I'd drive it around the block a couple of times.

675
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,210
聶夫先生  不如你明天晚上八點半左右來吧
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

676
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,990
他那時候在家
He'll be in then.

677
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,230
-誰  -我丈夫
- Who? - My husband.

678
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,240
你不是想和他談嗎
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?

679
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,780
本來是  但是...
Yeah, I was. But, uh...

680
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,730
我都有點忘記我的來意了  明白我的意思嗎
I'm sort of getting over the idea, if you know what I mean.

681
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,790
這個州有最高車速限制  聶夫先生
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff.

682
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,290
每小時四十五英里
Forty-five miles an hour.

683
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,600
-我開了多快  警官  -大概每小時九十英里
- How fast was I going, Officer? - I'd say around 90.

684
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,070
看來你要從摩托車上下來  給我開罰單了
Suppose you get off that motorcycle and give me a ticket.

685
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,250
我這次就給你一個警告
So I'd let you off with a warning this time.

686
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,720
如果我不吸取教訓呢
Suppose it doesn't take.

687
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,300
那估計我就得給你一拳了
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.

688
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,970
如果我嚎啕大哭  把頭靠在你肩膀上呢
Suppose I burst out crying and put my head on your shoulder.

689
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,000
如果你把頭靠在我丈夫的肩膀上呢
Suppose you try putting that on my husband's shoulders.

690
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,010
美夢破滅了
That tears it.

691
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,730
我就是沒心情
I'm just not in the mood--

692
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,900
不  拜托  這是傳統
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.

693
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,010
如果道格需要我們  他會打電話的
If Doug needs us, he'll call.

694
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,870
是  但是這次不一樣  發生了太多事
Yes, but it's different this time. There's so much going on--

695
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,590
-我知道  就當我迷信吧  -我們在這里
- I know, but call me superstitious. - We're in here.

696
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,710
但我們贏的每一次的選舉都會這么做
But we have done this every election we have ever won.

697
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,630
-拜托  -我不確定我是否明白你的意思
- Come on. - I wonder if I know what you mean.

698
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,100
我不確定你是否真不確定
I wonder if you wonder.

699
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,980
那是一個炎熱的下午  我還記得
It was a hot afternoon, and I still remember

700
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,550
那條街上金銀花的氣味
the smell of honeysuckle all down that street.

701
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,030
我怎么知道謀殺...
How could I have known that murder...

702
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,110
有時聞起來就如金銀花一般
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?

703
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,070
也許你就會知道  凱耶斯
Maybe you would've known, Keyes,

704
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,130
就在她提到意外險的那一刻
the minute she mentioned accident insurance.

705
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,280
但我沒發覺  我感覺好極了
But I didn't. I felt like a million.

706
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,360
怎么了
Yes.

707
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,830
我回辦公室看我是否有郵件
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.

708
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,290
什么叫并不相符
Well, what do you mean they don't match?

709
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,130
在我的家鄉
In my home state?

710
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,640
你和莉安最好馬上給我過來
Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.

711
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,850
怎么了
What's the matter?

712
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,400
我們今天早上得到的一些選區的數字
There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts

713
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,360
有些問題  它們并不相符
that we're getting from this morning. They don't match up.

714
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,110
這在南卡羅萊納從沒發生過
It's never happened before in South Carolina.

715
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,820
你沒什么要說的嗎
Well, you have nothing to say about that?

716
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,960
我相信是搞錯了
I'm sure the numbers are wrong.

717
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,740
你才不那么想呢
You don't believe that for a second.

718
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,810
我說不過你
I can't win with you.

719
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,560
不管我說什么
No matter what I say.

720
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,160
你送我回家過幾次
How many times did you walk me home?

721
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,160
什么
What?

722
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,910
不知道  大概就幾次吧
I don't know. Probably a handful.

723
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,930
不  并不是幾次
No, it wasn't a handful.

724
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,010
一個月有18次
It was 18... in a month.

725
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,310
我順路
It was on my way home.

726
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,090
-你什么意思  -沒什么  我正好順路
- And what are you saying? - Nothing. It was on my way home.

727
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,020
不  不是順路
No, it wasn't just on your way home.

728
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,600
我們想去藝術博物館
We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.

729
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,980
-但那兒關門了  那天很冷  -對
- It was closed. It was freezing that day. - Yeah.

730
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,600
-你房間里播著這部電影  -是的
- And this was on in your room. - It was.

731
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,360
我讓你吻我  我逼你吻我
And I asked you to kiss me. I made you kiss me.

732
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,190
不  你沒有逼我吻你  我想吻你的
No, you didn't make me kiss you. I wanted to kiss you.

733
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,760
不管怎樣  我知道我們
And anyway, I knew we were

734
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,350
會攜手共度余生
gonna spend the rest of our lives together.

735
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,870
是的
And we are.

736
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,680
無論如何  絕不后悔
No regrets, no matter what.

737
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:35,850
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

738
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,650
你那是什么意思  "無論如何"
What do you mean by that, "No matter what"?

739
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,960
-你覺得我們會輸  -不
- You think we're gonna lose? - No!

740
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,610
不
No.

741
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,340
我們是一起的嗎
Are we together?

742
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,250
是的  我們是一起的  無論如何
Yes, we're together. No matter what--

743
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,400
不  沒有"無論如何"  我們是一起的嗎
No, not "No matter what." Are we together?

744
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,090
我們是一起的  弗蘭西斯
We're together, Francis.

745
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,310
那就再不要跟我提起失敗了
Then don't ever bring up losing around me again.

746
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,960
-是那個男孩  -謝謝  凱耶斯先生
- That's the boy. - Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

747
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,380
這是家什么公司
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

748
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,340
我們是保險公司
Are we an insurance company

749
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,930
還是一群給那種白癡
or just a bunch of dim-witted amateurs

750
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,270
開保單的弱智
to write a policy on a mug like that?

751
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,850
等一下  凱耶斯  他不是我評估的
Now, wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.

752
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,220
費城的投票率比他們說的要低
The turnout in Philly is lower than they're saying.

753
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,920
-低多少  -我們的關鍵選區低30%
- How much lower? - 30% in our key precincts.

754
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,850
30  怎么會這樣
Thirty? How?

755
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,570
不只是賓州  大家都沒來投票
It's not just Pennsylvania. People aren't voting.

756
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,870
他們的人  我們的人
Their people, our people.

757
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,650
等等  如果康威拿下了賓州
Wait. If Conway's got Pennsylvania,

758
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,690
那他也會拿下俄亥俄
then he's got Ohio.

759
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,710
如果他拿下俄亥俄  我們就輸了
If he's got Ohio, then we lose.

760
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,580
-這是怎么發生的  -我去告訴他們
- How did this happen? - I'll tell them.

761
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,470
這件事不用你做
That is one thing you are not doing.

762
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,530
都辦妥了
That was all there was to it.

763
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,040
沒有疏忽  沒有忽略
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.

764
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,880
沒有什么會暴露我們
There was nothing to give us away.

765
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,390
然而  凱耶斯
And yet, Keyes,

766
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,810
當我沿街走去藥店時
as I was walking down the street to the drugstore,

767
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,220
我突然意識到一切都會出錯
suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.

768
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,920
這聽起來有點瘋狂  凱耶斯
It sounds crazy, Keyes,

769
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,680
但這是真的  幫我
but it's true, so help me.

770
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,200
我甚至聽不到自己的腳步聲
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

771
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,850
就好像一具行尸
It was the walk of a dead man.

772
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,030
那是我度過最長的一夜  凱耶斯
That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes.

773
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,860
第二天事情見報后  就更糟了
And the next day was worse when the story broke in the papers.

774
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,040
他們開始在辦公室里談論
They started talking about it at the office.

775
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,490
第三天  你開始調查
And the day after that, when you started digging into it.

776
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,320
我一直把手揣在口袋里
I kept my hands in my pockets

777
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,550
因為我以為它們在顫抖
because I thought they were shaking.

778
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,630
我戴了深色眼鏡好讓別人看不到我的眼睛
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes,

779
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,380
然后我又把眼鏡摘了
then I took them off again

780
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,570
他們就不會好奇我為什么要戴了
so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

781
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,810
-我努力想振作起來  但是...  -謝謝
- I tried to hold myself together but... - Thank you.

782
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,720
我能感覺到我的神經在崩潰
...I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.

783
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,890
給我接南卡羅萊納
Get me Sally Ann

784
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,510
切諾基縣書記官薩莉·安
in the Cherokee County clerk's office in South Carolina.

785
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,690
我等著
I'll hold.

786
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,690
他們把賓州的投票率高估了30%
They overestimated the turnouts in Pennsylvania by 30%.

787
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,790
你好啊
Hi, y'all.

788
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,430
不要叫我"閣下"
Well, now, do not call me "Sir."

789
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,630
我是弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
This is Francis Underwood.

790
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,590
我們認識這么久了  不用來這套
We've known each other too long for that.

791
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,410
那么  薩莉  今天的投票率怎么樣
So, Sally, how was turnout today?

792
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,640
我就想知道切諾基郡的數據
Well, I was just really actually looking for Cherokee County.

793
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,630
是的  我只是想親耳聽到
Yes, I just wanted to hear it for myself.

794
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,720
很好  謝謝
Great. Thank you.

795
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,220
代我們跟亨利和孩子們問好
And we send our love to Henry and the boys.

796
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,080
再見
Goodbye.

797
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,230
-有點低  -你說"低"是什么意思
- It's low. - What do you mean, "low"?

798
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,350
就是很低
Low.

799
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,410
我剛在想那條腳鏈
I was thinking about that anklet.

800
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,650
你現在在想什么
And what are you thinking about now?

801
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,270
我不想再想了  寶貝
I'm all through thinking, baby.

802
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,630
我只是過來說再見
I just came to say goodbye.

803
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,800
再見  你要去哪
Goodbye? Where are you going?

804
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,300
要走的是你  寶貝  不是我
You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.

805
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,290
我要在這個街角下電車
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.

806
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,190
別賣關子了  不管是什么  直說吧
Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.

807
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,550
好吧  我來告訴你
All right, I'll tell you.

808
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,960
我一個朋友有個有趣的理論
Friend of mine's got a funny theory...

809
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,450
你知道這意味著什么  是吧
You know what this means, don't you?

810
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,350
這是我們的地盤
This is our house.

811
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,350
我們絕不會離開
We are not leaving.

812
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,120
終點站是個墓地
The last stop's a cemetery.

814
00:50:34,180 --> 00:51:34,180
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}南北戰爭后  聯邦政府就開始大規模  系統地向退伍軍人提供一系列福利
相關的行政部門經過多次重組  從1930年的胡佛政府開始
退伍軍人相關的福利發放工作  統一由"退伍軍人部"負責
1944年由富蘭克林·羅斯福簽署的《士兵法案》  幾經修改
目前仍是向退伍士兵提供福利的最重要的一個聯邦法案
2017年特朗普政府提交的預算草案中  退伍軍人部的預算為1823億美元
而且美國公眾對軍人也非常尊敬  他們享受很多優待  優惠和優先
但許多軍人從戰場上歸來后  無法適應普通人的生活
發展出精神或心理上的疾病  出現酗酒  吸毒等問題  甚至自殺
而退伍軍人部作為一個龐大的聯邦機構  運作效率低下  官僚之風盛行
屢屢爆出丑聞后  在官僚體制下  一些相關的責任人卻未得到懲處
2017年4月27日  美國總統特朗普簽署行政命令
在退伍軍人部內成立一個新機構  加強對相關事務的監管
