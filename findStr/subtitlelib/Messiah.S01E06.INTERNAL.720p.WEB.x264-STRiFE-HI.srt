What are you?

347
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,139
Now look at your neighbor.

348
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,391
Look at your neighbor.

349
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,770
Be brave enough to see yourself.

350
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,524
Your own reflection cast back at you.

351
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,360
Each... reflected in each.

352
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,828
Look where you stand.

353
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,415
In a shining city on a hill.

354
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,210
In the land of the free and the brave,

355
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,880
standing for liberty and justice.

356
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,008
How true do those words ring for you?

357
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,635
When did you bring liberty?

358
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,221
Where did you cause justice?

359
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,946
<i>I stand at the gate of a nation...</i>

360
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,325
<i>a nation where power is not invited.</i>

361
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,995
I stand at the gate.

362
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,082
And I look out upon you.

363
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,669
And you look back to me.

364
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,173
But all I can do is reflect what I see.

365
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,969
If you have come to receive,

366
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,721
you will go away poor.

367
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,226
If you have come here to understand,
you will leave here lost.

368
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,020
For those who have understood...

369
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,731
for those who have received...

370
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,315
it is time.

371
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,029
<i>Returning to your scripture
will not save you.</i>

372
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,826
<i>Bending to your knees
will not please anyone.</i>

373
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,788
That time has passed.

374
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,832
This time is now.

375
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,585
You are the judged.

376
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,506
You are the chosen.

377
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,636
I'm here to break the mirror,
so you shall see on what side you stand.

378
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,556
What you see...

379
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,308
will be your choosing.

380
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,207

381
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,752
