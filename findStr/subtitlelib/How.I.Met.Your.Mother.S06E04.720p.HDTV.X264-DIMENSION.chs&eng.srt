老爸老妈浪漫史
第六季  第四集

10
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,840
我的目光没法从那个女孩脸上移开
I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.

11
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,210
脸  奇了怪了
Face. Huh.

12
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,880
这可是你目前给咪咪起的最怪异的代号了
That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.

13
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,220
不  泰德
No, Ted,

14
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,150
我真的是在看她的脸呢
I'm really looking at her face.

15
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,520
那可真是贴心呢
Aw... that's actually really sweet.

16
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,720
鼓鼓的脸蛋
Puffy cheeks,

17
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,990
黏糊糊的睫毛
smudged mascara,

18
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,730
红红的鼻头
slightly red nose...

19
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,590
那姑娘肯定哭过
That girl was just crying.

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,900
她看起来那么伤心
She's so sad

21
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,400
又没什么防御能力
and defenseless.

22
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
你们谁带套套了
Anyone have a condom?

23
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,670
不是吧  你
Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!

24
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,930
够了  你知道吗
That's it! You know what?

25
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,200
给你5分钟面壁思过去
Five-minute time-out!

26
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,940
拐角的那个位置  现在就去
Corner booth! Now.

27
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,670
告诉你们件事
Hey, get this.

28
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,810
你们知道我那个法学院的朋友马克斯吧
You know my friend Max from law school?

29
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,540
他现在在市中心的格莱格牛排屋
<i>He's at Gregor's</i> <i>Steakhouse downtown,</i>

30
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,610
伍迪・艾伦就坐在两桌以外的地方
<i>and Woody Allen is sitting</i> <i>two tables over.</i>

31
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,610
他想让咱们一起过去瞧瞧
<i>He wants us</i> <i>to come check it out.</i>

32
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,450
我想去  没准会好玩呢
I don't know, it could be cool.

33
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,980
我还没见过伍迪・艾伦呢
I've never seen Woody Allen.

34
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,050
不是吧  罗宾  身为纽约人
What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker

35
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,490
你怎么能从没见过伍迪・艾伦呢
and never have seen Woody Allen?

36
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,860
我见过其他的很多名人啊
I have seen plenty of other famous people.

37
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,400
上个礼拜我还见到了莫瑞・波维奇呢[美国脱口秀主持人]
Last week I saw... Maury Povich.

38
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
孩子们  你们知道脱口秀主持人莫瑞・波维奇吧
<i>Kids, you know</i> <i>talk show host Maury Povich.</i>

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,230
你们简直无法想象见到他是多么的易如反掌
<i>It was uncanny</i> <i>how often we saw this guy.</i>

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,700
姐们  大家都见过莫瑞・波维奇
Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.

41
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,470
莫瑞・波维奇简直无处不在
Maury Povich is everywhere.

42
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,770
抱歉  罗宾  除非你见过伍迪・艾伦
I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker

43
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,010
否则你不能算是真正的纽约人
until you've seen Woody Allen.

44
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,010
姐就是活脱脱的一个纽约人
I am, too, a real New Yorker.

45
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,280
义正严词的样子真可爱
That's adorable.

46
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,080
可惜你不纯呢
You're from Canada.

47
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,410
我可来了6年了
I have been here for almost six years.

48
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,150
又不是刚刚才下船
It's not like I just got off a boat.

49
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,220
船
A boat!

50
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,820
"船"这个发音好像没有错
Oh, wait, that <i>is</i> how you say it.

51
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,520
我认为除非你跟
I'd say you're not a real New Yorker

52
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,960
急需用车的人抢过计程车
until you've stolen a cab from someone

53
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
才称得上真正的纽约人
who needs it more than you do.

54
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,190
不  除非你可以在地铁上
No, you're not a real New Yorker

55
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,890
不顾周围人想法放声大哭时
till you've cried on the subway

56
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,060
你才能算是真正的纽约人
and not given a damn what anyone thinks.

57
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,530
不  除非你能赤手空拳拍死小强的时候
No, you're not a real New Yorker

58
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,530
你才能算是真正的纽约人
until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands.

59
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,730
这些规定很可笑  好不好
Those rules are all stupid, okay?

60
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,440
我从来没干过这些蠢事
I've never done any of those things.

61
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,770
但那天结束时
<i>By the end of this day,</i>

62
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,210
罗宾把这些事做了个遍
<i>Robin would have done</i> <i>all of those things.</i>

63
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,070
面壁时间已到
Okay, time's up.

64
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,540
大家讨论什么呢
What are we talking about?

65
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,840
伍迪・艾伦在格莱格吃饭呢
Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's,

66
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,910
罗宾觉得我们应该去看看
and Robin thinks that we should go see him.

67
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,910
干嘛要去看
Why would I do that?

68
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,680
我周二会在扑克俱乐部见到他
I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.

69
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,150
拜托  如果我们打车
Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab,

70
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,380
15分钟就能到
we'll be there in 15 minutes.

71
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,150
真正的纽约人会知道坐地铁更快捷
A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster.

72
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,220
先做1号线 再倒2-3号
You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.

73
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,360
周末公车更多
Well, the bus runs more often on weekends.

74
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,730
坐M-7或者M-5线均可
Take the M-7 to the M-5.

75
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,130
公车  每次我坐公车
The bus? Every time I take the bus,

76
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,730
车上都有一个大家避而远之的疯子
there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near.

77
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,630
这就是我从不坐公车的原因
That's why I have never taken the bus.

78
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,300
而且
Plus...

79
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,640
哥跑的比公车还快
I can <i>run</i> faster than a <i>bus.</i>

80
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,970
伙计  这可是隔着7英里呢[约11千米]
Dude, that's, like, seven miles.

81
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,470
你绝对做不到
You can't do that.

82
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,040
你绝不可能跑得比公车快
You can't beat the bus!

83
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,650
我绝对快过公车  出租车或是火车
I can beat a bus or a cab or a train!

84
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,410
是不是有人突然想看《绿鸡蛋和火腿》这本书
Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?

85
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,410
[《绿鸡蛋和火腿》苏斯博士用50个单词写成的美国童书  罗宾暗讽马修说话方式像书中推销员]

86
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,620
机器这种东西总被过高估计
Machines are overrated,

87
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
需要有人来杀杀它的锐气
and someone needs to take them down a peg.

88
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,790
你们全错了
You're all wrong

89
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,290
我有个办法能快速到那  比你们谁都快
I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you,

90
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,290
而且我还可以先坐下吃个
even if I sat down and ordered

91
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,760
鲜嫩多汁的大牛排再比
a big, juicy steak first.

92
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,460
诀窍是什么
How?

93
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,160
半熟偏生的牛排
Medium rare.

94
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,490
不过现在又不是重点讨论这个
But that's not important right now.

95
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,860
听着  我比你们都更熟悉这个城市  好不好
Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?

96
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,330
神啊  拜托
Oh, my God! Oh, wow!

97
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,440
好啦  好啦  大家停一停
All right, all right, hold on, hold on!

98
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,870
咱们还是别争了
Let's just forget about it.

99
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,910
有什么好比的  又没办法证明到底谁比较快
Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway.

100
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,480
先到的人是赢家
First person there wins!

101
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,180
怎么去不是问题
Doesn't matter how you get there!

102
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
姑娘你继续悲伤  大爷我马上回来
Stay sad! I'll be back!

103
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,080
你好  我能看下菜单吗
Hi. Can I see a menu, please?

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,780
不急
No rush.

105
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,220
孩子们  我应该告诉你们
<i>Kids, I should tell you,</i>

106
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,520
那天莉莉迫切地想要一场胜利
<i>Lily really needed</i> <i>a win that day.</i>

107
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
莉莉想赢的原因

108
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,660
当马修和莉莉打算要个孩子的时候
<i>When Marshall and Lily</i> <i>decided to have a baby,</i>

109
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,530
他们以为很快就会心想事成
<i>they assumed it</i> <i>would happen right away.</i>

110
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,860
肯定是两条杠
It's gonna be positive.

111
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,000
埃里克森家族的播种能力超强
Eriksen man are hella fertile.

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,030
莫里斯叔叔16岁的时候
When Uncle Morris was 16

113
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,130
只因为在后座把他女朋友手握的太紧
he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight

114
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,970
就让他女朋友怀孕了
in the backseat of a car.

115
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,410
现在我知道当时我是多么年幼无知了
Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.

116
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,170
一条杠
Negative.

117
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,580
几周过后
<i>As the weeks went by,</i>

118
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,740
马修的自信丝毫不减
<i>Marshall's confidence</i> <i>never wavered.</i>

119
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,810
所以莉莉开始胡思乱想起来
<i>Then it started to mess</i> <i>with Lily's head.</i>

120
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,220
又没怀上
Negative?

121
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,320
我们都知道错不在我
Well, we know it's not <i>me.</i>

122
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,390
一起都会好起来
Everything's fine.

123
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,660
这种事情需要时间的嘛
These things take time.

124
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,120
肯定不是埃里克森家族人的错
Not with an Eriksen.

125
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,130
一定是你出了什么问题
Something must be wrong with <i>you.</i>

126
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,860
再说了  我妈很讨厌你
Also, my mom hates you.

127
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,430
你知道吗
You know what?

128
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,630
为保万无一失  我决定再尿一遍
Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.

129
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,900
什么
What?

130
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,670
你不会这么做的
No, you wouldn't.

131
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,040
谁来救救我
Somebody help me!

132
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,870
谁来救救我啊
Somebody help me!

133
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,380
莉莉忍无可忍  又不知该如何发泄
<i>Lily was so fed up</i> <i>with not getting anywhere,</i>

134
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,410
或许赢得比赛就是她最好的出口
<i>maybe winning this race</i> <i>was just what she needed.</i>

135
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,590
蠢货
Idiot!

136
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,500
我会证明给他们看
<i>I'll show them.</i>

137
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,830
我的身体能打败一切交通工具
<i>My body can outrun</i> <i>any motorized vehicle.</i>

138
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,040
我简直就是与蒸汽机抗衡的约翰・亨利[19世纪工人领袖]
<i>I'm like John Henry</i> <i>when he beat the steam engine.</i>

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,140
我需要的  只是一首美妙的乡村音乐
<i>All I need is</i> <i>a great folk song.</i>

140
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,750
孩子们  快过来*
*Gather round, ye children

141
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,210
给你们说个故事*
*To hear the tale so sweet

142
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,550
说的是一个敢靠双腿*
*Of a man who dared to race machines

143
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,350
挑战机器的英雄*
*With nothing but his feet

144
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,590
大屁股  让开
Suck it, Grand-butt!

145
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,090
伟大的马修*
*Marshall

146
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,790
与机器大作战*
*Versus the machines

147
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,030
加油*
*Hyah!

148
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
出租车
Ooh, taxi!

149
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,700
抱歉  我有急事
Excuse me, I got a thing.

150
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,610

I'll crank up the smooth jazz.

305
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,380
英雄的力气在逐渐消耗*
*Our hero's strength was fading fast

306
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,510
随着交通灯*
*Just as the light

307
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,920
转成*
*Turned...

308
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
转成*[这红灯有完没完]
*Turned...

309
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,520
转成*
*Turned...

310
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,460
绿灯*
*Green

311
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,960
他转而回想*
*He then thought back

312
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,390
曾经数次*
*To all the times

313
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,160
被机器摧残*
*He'd lost to a machine

314
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,760
给点力啊  花花公子频道
Come on, Playboy Channel.

315
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,300
机顶盒虽然可怕*
*The cable box is fearsome

316
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,840
但订书机威力更猛*
*But the stapler's mighty sting...

317
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,170
给点力啊  成人频道
Come on, Spice Channel.

318
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,540
又被机顶盒小劈了一把*
*The cable box's bite again...

319
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,980
哥已经累到*
*Getting too tired

320
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,750
唱不动了*
*To sing.

321
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,530
使用的是复合钢管结构
...uses a hybrid steel tube structure...

322
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,360
孩子们  那天我终于意识到
Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization.

323
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
如果你在公车上没有看到那个疯子
If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
那就是你疯了
...it's you.

325
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,540
好消息是  我已经在半路上了
The good news is, I was halfway there,

326
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,810
没什么能阻挡我的脚步
and nothing could stop me.

327
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,260
这比赛太疯狂了
This is crazy.

328
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,290
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

329
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,790
好吧  很明显这是个暗示
Okay, this is clearly a sign.

330
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,960
我们就算打平手吧
Let's just call it a tie.

331
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,330
别比了
Forget about the race.

332
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,400
回酒吧去
Head back to the bar.

333
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,330
对极了
Absolutely.

334
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,530
就这样  比赛继续
Just like that, the race was back on.

335
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,730
白痴
Idiot.

336
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,740
与此同时  下一节车厢里
Meanwhile, one subway car over...

337
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,190
我的天
Oh, God.

338
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,560
在地铁上大哭

339
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,630
看什么看
Oh, bite me!

340
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,670
完全不顾周围人的想法

341
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,240
再快点  驾  驾
Faster. Mush! Mush!

342
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,740
我要赢得这场胜利  一定要赢
I need this win. I need this win.

343
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,910
巴尼想赢的原因

344
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,480
我把我手下半数的员工全炒了
And firing half my department freed up the money

345
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,910
然后给自己涨了一倍工资
to double my own salary.

346
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,610
还有昨晚我搞的那个波士顿女孩超正点
And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night,

347
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,080
而且即使我不锻炼
and I'm getting more muscular,

348
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,420
身材也很好  肌肉照样练出来
even though I've stopped working out,

349
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,120
还有  我有一群超赞的牌友
and I've got this amazing poker group.

350
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,990
实际上  巴尼根本不需要这场胜利
Actually, Barney did not need a win.

351
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,660
我身上超香香的  闻闻看
And I smell incredible. Smell me.

352
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,790
真的  闻闻看
Just, seriously, smell me.

353
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,430
他的确闻起来很香
He did smell incredible.

354
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,700
停
Stop!

355
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,870
太慢了  换我来
Too slow. Switch.

356
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,620
亲爱的
Sweetie?

357
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,590
你还好吗
Are you okay?

358
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,550
不好
No.

359
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,490
我受够了这个城市  它赢了
I am done with this city. It wins.

360
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,030
我想搬到一个新的地方  重新开始
I just want to move somewhere new and start over.

361
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,200
我知道你今年过得很不顺
You've had a rough year.

362
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,060
但你很坚强
But you're tough.

363
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,000
我这么喜欢你
And I love you like crazy.

364
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,140
如果你走了  我肯定会追随你的
If you left, I'd have to follow you.

365
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,870
那么马修肯定会追随我
And Marshall would follow me.

366
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,070
而泰德又会追随马修
And Ted would follow him.

367
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,270
唯一的好处是  我们能甩掉巴尼
The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney.

368
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,640
来抱抱
Bring it in.

369
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,150
他说什么
What did he say?

370
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,680
听不清
No clue.

371
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,020
那是莫瑞・波维奇吗
Hey, is that Maury Povich?

372
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,530
莉莉
Hey! Lily.

373
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,130
抱歉  宝贝
Sorry, sweetie.

374
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,730
我发誓在终点线的那端
I swear I'll be a great friend

375
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,700
我会是个好朋友  但是刚列车员说了
at the finish line, but the conductor just said

376
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,430
这趟车是直达布鲁克林的
you're going express to Borough Hall,

377
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,500
你玩完了  宝贝
which means you're screwed, sweetie.

378
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,240
再见了  衰人
So long, sucker.

379
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,810
来抱抱
Bring it in.

380
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,510
该死的
Damn it.

381
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,450
我是莉莉  请求帮助
Hey, it's Lily. Help me.

382
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,720
没有一个乘客愿意听我说话
And not a single passenger would listen to me.

383
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,690
难道我这个老师有这么不称职吗
I mean, am I a bad teacher?

384
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,220
还是我的话无聊到让人犯困
Do I just put people to sleep?

385
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,890
伙计
Buddy?

386
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,460
伙计
Hey, buddy?

387
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,190
需要帮忙吗
Need a hand?

388
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,360
机器赢了
The machines have won!

389
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,900
机器赢了
The machines have won.

390
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,370
伙计  成熟点
Dude, mellow.

391
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,000
我做不到  我跑不了这么远
I can't do it. I can't run that far.

392
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,810
哪种交通工具我都跑不过
I can't outrace anything.

393
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,770
我不行
I-I can't...

394
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,410
我连我老婆肚子都搞不大
I can't get my wife pregnant!

395
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,010
等等
Wait.

396
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,350
这就是你坚持要跑这么远的原因吗
Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?

397
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,150
我的身体一直让我失望  我只是想
My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted

398
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,860
证明它还是能做点什么的
to prove that it could still do something,

399
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,060
但结果还是让我失望
but it can't.

400
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,890
伙计  你们才试了两个月
Dude, you've been trying for two months,

401
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,830
又不是两年  这没什么大不了的
not two years. That's nothing.

402
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,230
没什么大不了的应该是你吧
Well, you should talk.

403
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,860
你自己看不到50个好评
You know, you're the one who's freaking out

404
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,300
却因为区区一个中评
because you have one mediocre review

405
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,230
而垂头丧气丧失信心
and, like, 50 great ones.

406
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,870
是64个好评  那又如何
64. But whatever.

407
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,100
而且你还得到了设计新总部的机会
And you're designing a frickin' building.

408
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,570
知足吧  伙计
I mean, come on, dude.

409
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,510
听起来你们俩需要把过去  清零
Sounds like you guys need to clear everything,

410
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,010
减去  自我否定
subtract the negativity,

411
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,850
加上  从新的角度看问题
and add some perspective.

412
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,550
马修
Marshall!

413
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,550
马修  快上车
Marshall, get in!

414
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,220
好久不见
Hello.

415
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,610
到了
There it is.

416
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,710
马修和莉莉呢
Where are Marshall and Lily?

417
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,640
谁管他们啊
Who cares?

418
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,700
赢了  我赢了
I won? I won!

419
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,970
不
No!

420
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,840
真不敢相信是我赢了
I can't believe I won!

421
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,470
到底发生了怎么事
How did that even happen?

422
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,610
事情经过是这样的
<i>Here's how it happened.</i>

423
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,810
好  他上车了  快走快走
Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Got it.

424
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,480
-泰德挡住咱们的道儿了  -碾过去
- Ted is in the way. - Run him over.

425
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,610
遵命  碾过去
Running him over.

426
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,150
别这样  莉莉  你到底怎么了
No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?

427
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,920
没怎么  我只是极其非常想赢得这次比赛
Nothing. I just want to win this really badly.

428
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,420
以至于在我最好的朋友需要我的时候
So badly that I just ditched my best friend

429
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,820
抛弃了她
when she needed me.

430
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,430
宝贝  你还要从泰德的身上碾过去
Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.

431
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,630
为什么我这么热衷于这次比赛
Why did I get so crazy about this?

432
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,560
或许跟我一直扬言说我能跑7英里
Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying

433
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,970
是同一个理由吧
that I could run seven miles.

434
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,940
我一直试图对于我们至今没怀上这件事
I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive

435
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,810
保持一种积极乐观的态度  但宝贝
about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared

436
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,840
其实我真的很害怕
that we're not pregnant yet.

437
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,110
感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

438
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,540
我一直以为是我的问题
I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.

439
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,110
我一直以为是我的问题
I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.

440
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,350
这才刚过了两个月
It's only been two months.

441
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,450
我们太执迷了
We are crazy.

442
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,410
简直就是执迷不悟
We're totally crazy.

443
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,550
这是我们二人世界
This is the last time

444
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,150
最后的一段时光了
it's ever going to be just the two of us.

445
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,350
我们难道不应该好好享受吗
Shouldn't we be enjoying that?

446
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,750
我们应该回到巴黎
We gotta go back to Paris.

447
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
去跳交谊舞
And take ballroom dancing.

448
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,120
还应该好好学学滑雪
And really learn how to ski.

449
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,330
而不是一起来就在小木屋里爱爱
Not just up and get faced in the lodge.

450
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,100
还要一起去康尼岛  我至今还没去过呢
And see Coney Island. I've still never been.

451
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,100
[康尼岛  美国最早的大型游乐城]

452
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,360
瞧  在生儿育女之前
See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do

453
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,400
我们不有一堆事情要做吗
before we start having kids.

454
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,070
一堆待完成的事情
Oh, a cradle list.

455
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,240
我
I'm...

456
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,110
我很高兴我们这么努力  等那一刻真的来临时
so glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited

457
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,240
我一定会兴奋不已  但这不是比赛
for when it happens, but this isn't a race.

458
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,850
这不是比赛
This isn't a race.

459
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,920
兰吉特  别去格莱格餐厅了
Ranjit, screw Gregor's.

460
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,650
我们要去康尼岛
Let's go to Coney Island.

461
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,020
遵命  不去格雷格餐厅  直奔康尼岛
Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.

462
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,820
至于罗宾打败我和巴尼这事
<i>As for how Robin beat</i> <i>me and Barney,</i>

463
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,990
直至今天  你们巴尼叔叔还不愿意承认
<i>to this day, your uncle</i> <i>Barney won't admit it...</i>

464
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,330
但据我了解是这样的
<i>but here's what I saw:</i>

465
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,900
巴尼发现在罗宾的脸上
<i>I saw Barney</i> <i>notice Robin's face...</i>

466
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,830
或者这让他意识到了什么
<i>and maybe realize something.</i>

467
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,100
巴尼声称他不小心绊倒
<i>Barney says he tripped,</i>

468
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,710
但是感觉却像他故意冲过来拦着我
<i>but it sure felt</i> <i>like</i> <i>he tackled me on purpose.</i>

469
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,340
当罗宾说她赢了那会儿
<i>And when Robin won,</i>

470
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,940
我发誓  他笑了
<i>I could have sworn</i> <i>I saw him smile.</i>

471
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,180
-我赢了  -不
- I won! - No!

472
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,080
所以我说  计程车  当然是因为
So I said, "The cab, of course because

473
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,120
我知道你在背后耍的小把戏
I know what you did back there.

474
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,090
哥懂
Yeah.

475
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,650
闻闻看
Check it.

476
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,990
我拉着个破三轮狂奔了26个街区
I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks,

477
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,230
身上还是这么香香
and I still smell incredible.

478
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,490
你闻闻
Smell me.

479
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,400
我才不要
I'm not gonna...

480
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
-不要  -闻闻
- Not gonna... - Smell me.

481
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,630
他的确闻起来很香
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

482
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,800
等等
Wait a minute.

483
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,340
伍迪・艾伦在哪儿呢
So, where is Woody Allen?

484
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,610
就在那边
He's right there.

485
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,210
靠  马克斯  那是莫瑞・波维奇
Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.

486
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,480
我总是把他们两个搞混
I always get those two confused.

487
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,350
严格来说  那天应该只有一位赢家
<i>Technically, there was only</i> <i>one winner that day.</i>

488
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,590
但在那场比赛中  每个人都发现了自己内心真正所需
<i>But in that race, everyone</i> <i>found exactly what they needed.</i>

489
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,020
的确
<i>It's true,</i>

490
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,220
在几个月之内
<i>she wouldn't see Woody Allen</i>

491
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,290
她都见不着伍迪・艾伦
<i>for another couple months,</i>

492
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,030
但罗宾就是这样成为
<i>but that's how Robin became,</i>

493
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,560
如果非要给这个词下个定义  那就是
<i>by just about any definition</i> <i>of the term...</i>

494
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,530
赤手空拳拍死小强

495
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,470
一个真正的纽约人
<i>...a real New Yorker.</i>
