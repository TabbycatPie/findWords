requirement, but no.

"take journalism, iris.

Reporters have all of the fun."

Guess what, barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

Journalism is boring.
I'm bored.

- Some big award.

- to explain the science stuff

While I very much
appreciate the award,

knowing that

any quality time together

avoiding me because of eddie.
