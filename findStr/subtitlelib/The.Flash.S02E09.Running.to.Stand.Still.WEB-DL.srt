1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:06,105
<i>And I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,506
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,208
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,745
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

6
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:16,448
<i>I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

8
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,186
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats.</i>

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,957
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

10
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,493
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,929
Previously on <i>"The Flash"</i>...

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,231
You're just letting us go?

13
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,866
Just remember
who it was made sure

14
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,634
you didn't
get thrown on that plane.

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,436
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

16
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,138
Captain Singh mentioned there
may be positions available

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,773
on your anti-meta-human
task force.

18
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,108
Why do you want to do this?
- Mark Mardon killed my dad.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,881
James Jesse, your honor,
aka, The Trickster.

20
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,883
You're going to prison
either way, James.

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,585
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my father.

22
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,487
If he finds out
that he might have a son

23
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,989
that grew up
without knowing him,

24
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,390
it would crush him.

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,025
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her.

26
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,595
You're next.

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,326
Go ahead.
Kill me.

28
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,863
But... My daughter...

29
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,265
Is innocent.

30
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,900
Please...

31
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,569
Let...

32
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,938
Jesse...

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,040
Live...

34
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,377
Go on.

35
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,180
Say something!

36
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,587
Merry Christmas.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,598
Whoo.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,633
I had to fight some
old lady for the last one.

39
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,635
They didn't have
any Green Arrow dolls.

40
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,670
Don't know why you'd want
a toy of that crazy man.

41
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,272
I can't figure out
what to get Barry.

42
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,976
I was thinking
you could give him this.

43
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,611
Oh, that's nice.

44
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,479
But I kind of want to get him
something more meaningful.

45
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,450
I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

46
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,685
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

47
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,722
Oh, I know, babe.
I miss Eddie too.

48
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:40,392
How about you get Barry
a really nice watch?

49
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,528
Like grandpa Ben gave to you.

50
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,496
That ain't a bad idea.

51
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,231
You know, my dad only
gave me this watch

52
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,033
because I was always late.

53
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,635
You?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,638
He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message,

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,673
like this watch or the time
he bought me free weights

56
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,775
because he said
I was too skinny.

57
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,644
I told him, "When I have a son,

58
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm only giving him
fun presents."

59
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:05,017
This thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,722
Because it's from family.

61
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,725
You sure you're all right?

62
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,161
Yeah, yeah.
I promise.

63
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,569
You know, we should really be
more professional.

64
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,771
You do realize
you initiated that.

65
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,941
Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

66
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,044
I'm just saying, you know,
anyone could walk in,

67
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,914
like, Joe or captain...

68
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,115
Yo.

69
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,018
But I have, like,
a 4:00 to 12:00, but...

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,821
I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right.

71
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,724
I'll see you for Christmas.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

72
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:51,430
I'm so happy for you.
Truly.

73
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,966
Thank you.

74
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:57,236
It means a lot to me
that you like her.

75
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,671
I don't know.

76
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,709
Wells, um, he left me
that message where he said

77
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,044
that I'd never really be happy.

78
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,847
And for a while I really started
to believe him,

79
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,383
but, now... I...
I don't know.

80
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:15,320
Maybe there is a way to...

81
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,155
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

82
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,523
I'm so sorry.

83
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,692
I can't keep this
in anymore, Barry.

84
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,494
I know I was so mad
at you and dad

85
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,396
for not telling me that
you were The Flash,

86
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,298
but when I found out about this,

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,799
I didn't know what to do.

88
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,534
What?
What's going on?

89
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:34,406
When Francine came back,
my dad told me not to trust her

90
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,108
and he was right.

91
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,679
I didn't know how much.

92
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,349
When my mother left us,

93
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,019
she was pregnant.

94
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,454
She had a son.

95
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,758
Joe's son.
My brother.

96
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,897
What's his name?

97
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,400
Wally.

98
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,503
Wally West.

99
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,705
When I found out,
I told her to leave

100
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,174
and never come back
and to never tell my dad,

101
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,676
but Barry, I feel...

102
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,045
I feel like this
is hollowing me out.

103
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,447
Every time I look at dad,
I feel like I'm hurting him.

104
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,349
I don't...
I don't know what to do.

105
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,651
I think you know
what you have to do.

106
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,453
I can't.
It's gonna kill him.

107
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,088
No, it won't.

108
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,158
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

109
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,060
Thank you.

110
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,196
Yeah.

111
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:37,235
Hey, look.
Snow.

112
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,373
Maybe it'll be
a white Christmas.

113
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,608
That'd be nice.

114
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,214
I was thinking that
if we could inject

115
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,284
an unstable neutrino burst
into the individual breaches,

116
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,519
it might cause them
to seal on their own.

117
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,054
And stop Zoom from
travelling back and forth

118
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,456
between our worlds.

119
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,057
At least then we wouldn't
have to worry about him

120
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,827
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

121
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,595
It means a lot.
- What does?

122
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,131
You looking after Barry.

123
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,999
He's been through a lot
the last few weeks.

124
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,737
Barry's not the only person
here I want to keep safe.

125
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,005
Oh, dear lord,
just kiss already.

126
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,676
Oh, the thirst is real.
- Is everything all right?

127
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,144
Yeah, I keep checking,

128
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,012
but all is quiet
on the meta-human front.

129
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,248
Hey, you think Zoom decided
to take Christmas off?

130
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,683
What's Christmas?

131
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,619
Oh, well,
it's this holiday we have

132
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,354
where we cut down trees
and sing songs

133
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,656
to celebrate the birth
of a baby 2,000 years ago,

134
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,893
and then the Romans killed him
so we give each other gifts...

135
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,461
That's your explanation?

136
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,831
I know what Christmas is.
- Oh, right, of course.

137
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,600
Um, you know, Joe
and Barry and Iris

138
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,135
are having people over
for Christmas Eve,

139
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:46,371
and they said we could
invite whoever we want.

140
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,540
Who... who do you want?
- You.

141
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,676
I want to invite you, I mean.

142
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,945
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

143
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,014
Uh, no, I have not.
I told him to rest.

144
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,516
He's just as stubborn
as all the rest of

145
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,217
my male patients in this place.

146
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,752
I'm gonna
leave you two alone, okay?

147
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm gonna go find Harry.

148
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,722
Holy Hannah!

149
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,525
Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,661
Everything okay?
- Sure.

151
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,797
Why wouldn't it be?

152
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,800
Why wouldn't it be?

153
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,607
Man, it's really coming down.

154
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,477
The news didn't
say anything about snow.

155
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,312
Maybe it's a Christmas miracle.

156
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,957
Let it snow.

157
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,526
We got a code...
Aah!

158
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,001
Knock, knock.

159
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,042
So.

160
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,278
Early parole.
You interested?

161
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,684
Don't mean to be a noodge,
but the exit is upstairs.

162
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,720
Just need one more thing.

163
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,799
You got to be kidding me.

164
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:24,469
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

165
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,683
Please tell me
this is not happening...

166
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,051
It's official, Santa hates us.

167
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,821
This sudden blizzard
took out cameras

168
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,256
and the security system.

169
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,091
I mean, thank god
nobody was killed,

170
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,593
but there's no trace
of Mardon, Jesse, or Snart.

171
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,563
Speaking of which,
with Mardon back on the scene...

172
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,764
Yeah?

173
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,866
Patty might not be
thinking so clearly.

174
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,101
What do you mean?

175
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,803
What does Mardon
have to do with Patty?

176
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,510
We should have expected this.

177
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,714
The unexpected drop
in barometric pressure

178
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,216
had to mean
Mardon was back in town.

179
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,350
Patty...

180
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,286
Jesse was on full
communication lock down,

181
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,654
but that doesn't mean Mardon
and Snart weren't in contact.

182
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:20,225
Patty, Joe told me about Mardon.

183
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,794
I can't talk to you about this.

184
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,863
Hey, Patty, it's okay.

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,732
Got it.

186
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,434
Look, Barry, you're a sweet guy,

187
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,169
but you have no idea what's
really going on in this city.

188
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,372
I mean, you don't even
know that Harrison Wells...

189
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,775
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to bring you up to speed.

190
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,476
That's ironic.

191
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,146
Patty, Patty,
look I care about you a lot.

192
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,515
I don't want to see you
do anything reckless.

193
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,983
I'm a cop.

194
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,718
Going after criminals
is in my job description.

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,453
It's not reckless.

196
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,523
And powers or not, Mardon's
gonna answer for what he's done.

197
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,391
Patty...

198
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,661
♪ Deck the halls ♪

199
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,130
♪ With body parts
from a girl named Holly ♪

200
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,067
♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪

201
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,502
I don't remember those
being the lyrics.

202
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:08,840
I am tremendously creative.
That I can tell you.

203
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,208
You'd better be.
I didn't break you out...

204
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,676
I didn't break
either of you out,

205
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,311
because I was looking to make
some new friends.

206
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,114
That is not the holiday
spirit, Marky-Mark.

207
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,516
Christmas is a time
for togetherness.

208
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:22,170
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves? Hmm?

209
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,089
So why did you break us out?

210
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,358
Well, I owed you one,

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,627
and this guy, he's just crazy.

212
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,261
It's a compliment.

213
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,930
And we all want the same thing.

214
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,166
Fashion advice?
- To see The Flash dead.

215
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,369
Well, that was more of a
New Years resolution,

216
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,670
but, hey, I'm flexible.

217
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,173
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

218
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,643
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

219
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,011
Three against one.

220
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,847
Plus, the one
isn't quite what he was.

221
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,217
See, another speedster
dressed all in black

222
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,786
nearly took him out
a few weeks ago.

223
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,888
He's vulnerable.
He's weak.

224
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,258
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

225
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,130
With my power, his flair,
and your smarts,

226
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,132
we can put him
in the ground for good.

227
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,234
Tell me your plan.
- Tell me you're in.

228
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,603
I'm thinking about it.
- What's the matter?

229
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,339
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

230
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,778
You wanna dance?
- Boys, boys, boys!

231
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,147
Play nice!
Mellow out, Mardon.

232
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,849
Don't have a snit, Snart.
Here's an idea.

233
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,986
We all go out, have a few
drinks, kill some carolers.

234
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,321
We'll all feel better.

235
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,024
All right.

236
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,061
So what's it gonna be, Snart?

237
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,432
Oh, yeah.

238
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,201
The Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

239
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,836
There's three of them
and one of you.

240
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,337
I do not like those odds.

241
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,506
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

242
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:52,143
Oh, oh, light bulb up here.
I have an idea.

243
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,746
Most weather phenomena
are marked, no pun intended,

244
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,615
by the change of electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

245
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,884
We could just
map out those fluctuations...

246
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,419
To pinpoint his location.

247
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,088
Right, it would just be
a matter of removing all...

248
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,856
The electricity
from his immediate surroundings.

249
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,257
Both:
Attracting it to one spot.

250
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,659
The same way
a lightning rod does.

251
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,561
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

252
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,229
A wand?

253
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,997
Have we already had
this conversation?

254
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,601
Kind of.
- What does that mean?

255
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,670
All right, so the last time
Mardon attacked,

256
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,706
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed

257
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,141
all of Central City.

258
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,777
So why are you not all
sleeping with the fishes?

259
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,479
Earth-2 has "The Godfather"?

260
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,948
Every Earth
has "The Godfather," Vito.

261
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,983
So I ran back through time.

262
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,419
One day into the past
and I got a do-over

263
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,454
and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

264
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,223
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

265
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,624
That's what
the other Wells said.

266
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,893
So the good news is,
in that timeline,

267
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,228
you created the wand
and it worked.

268
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,829
So you just got to do it again.

269
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,264
For the first time.

270
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,666
Yeah, no pressure.
- I can give you a hand.

271
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,503
Best of both worlds?
- I like that.

272
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,274
You good, Harry?

273
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,044
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

274
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,679
Holiday blues?

275
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,615
It can't be easy knowing Zoom
still has his daughter.

276
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,550
Yeah, all right,
look, I'll be right back.

277
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,285
I have something
I have to deal with.

278
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,762
Hey.

279
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, the last time
the two of you

280
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,401
were looking at me like that,

281
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,136
it was when you both
took my convertible

282
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,437
on a joy ride
and wrapped it around

283
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,173
that big oak tree
on Fairmont Drive.

284
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,776
Dad, um...

285
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,812
All right, Joe, we have
something we need to tell you.

286
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,548
No, um...

287
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,818
I have something
that I need to tell you.

288
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,721
It's about Francine.

289
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,765
When she left us...

290
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:58,136
She was pregnant.

291
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,092
Did she have the baby?

292
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,628
Yes.

293
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,065
His name is Wally.

294
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,434
Wally West.

295
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,439
Short for Wallace.

296
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,477
That's what we were gonna
name you if you were a boy.

297
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,579
I only found out
a couple weeks ago.

298
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,450
Dad, I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

299
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,788
That's why she reached out to us
after all these years.

300
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,992
She wanted us to know before...

301
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:58,396
Before she died.

302
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,267
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

303
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,137
I got to get to work.

304
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,373
Dad, listen, dad.

305
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,809
I'm... I'm sorry.

306
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,314
Just let me sit with it.

307
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,992
Do you think that
he's gonna be okay?

308
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,161
I do, yeah, I think...

309
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,497
It's just a lot to take in.

310
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,134
He just needs a little time
to process it.

311
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,536
Ho, ho, ho.

312
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,548
Mmm. Cocoa isn't cocoa without
the mini marshmallows.

313
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,617
And you're out.
I checked.

314
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,019
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,487
Breaking into my home?

316
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,656
Careful. I made an upgrade
to the cold gun.

317
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,692
If I release my grip
from the handle,

318
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,826
the core goes critical.

319
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,995
You might make it,

320
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,098
she won't.

321
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,039
Read your article on the
disappearing middle class.

322
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,342
Strong point of view.
Nice prose style.

323
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,977
Yeah, well, who needs a pulitzer

324
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,479
when you have a homicidal
maniac's seal of approval.

325
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,715
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

326
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,150
Everyone in this room
had a rough childhood.

327
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,885
Get over it.
- Why are you here, Snart?

328
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,822
I got the Noel Spirit,
wanted to give you a gift.

329
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,358
Mardon broke Jesse
and me out to kill you.

330
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,027
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

331
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,062
Me, I'm gonna pass.

332
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,364
Why?
You grow a conscience?

333
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,566
Mardon wants revenge.
Jesse wants chaos.

334
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,369
I'm just not invested
like they are.

335
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,270
You mean there's no money
in it for you?

336
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,573
I was never much
for non-profit work.

337
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,608
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

338
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,077
Nah, consider me more
of a secret Santa.

339
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,048
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

340
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,586
You are full of it, Snart.

341
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:05,089
I think my friends and I
saved your sister's life

342
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,191
and you can't stand
owing me a marker.

343
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,526
I hate to break it to you,

344
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,895
but that... that right there
is called honor.

345
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,932
Go on, make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

346
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,801
Help me stop them.

347
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,671
Sorry, I'm not interested
in being a hero.

348
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,541
Well, you're doing
a pretty lousy job

349
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,310
of being a villain this week.

350
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,846
Merry Christmas, Barry.

351
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,391
Hey.

352
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,464
I was just thinking
about a big drug bust

353
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,467
that me and Singh
made about ten years ago.

354
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:54,272
Afterward,
we went for a steak lunch

355
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,908
to treat ourselves
for a job well done

356
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,010
and while we were ordering,

357
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,446
I got this feeling in my chest.

358
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,348
Like my heart
was being squeezed.

359
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,150
I knew something wasn't right.

360
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,985
So I called your school

361
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:13,124
and the nurse said to me that
she was just about to call me.

362
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,126
Iris was on her way
to the hospital.

363
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,627
When her appendix burst.

364
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,363
And I knew it.
I could feel it, right here.

365
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:23,534
I knew my kid needed me.

366
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:27,171
So if I have that feeling
as a parent,

367
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,006
why didn't I feel it
from my son?

368
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,043
Joe, it's not your fault that
you didn't know about him.

369
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,846
Yeah, it was.

370
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,149
When Francine left rehab
that last time,

371
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,351
I should've looked for her.

372
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,286
I'm a cop.
I could've found her.

373
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,021
Brought her back here.

374
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,356
Tried again.
Tried harder.

375
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,791
You were protecting Iris.

376
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,727
I've been telling
myself that for 20 years.

377
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,662
A 20-year lie,
but I wasn't protecting her,

378
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:56,033
I was protecting myself.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

379
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,402
I couldn't...

380
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:02,940
I hated not being able
to help Francine.

381
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:07,245
So it was easier
for her to be dead.

382
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:11,549
Out of my life.
Out of our lives.

383
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,085
But it wasn't for Iris.

384
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,786
I was being selfish.

385
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:19,690
And that poor boy
paid the price.

386
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,559
Joe...

387
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,463
He never had a father...

388
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,899
To read to him at night,
show him to throw a football,

389
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,768
to make him feel safe.

390
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,704
And loved.

391
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,443
Who taught him
how to be a man, Barry?

392
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,047
"Him."
I can't even say his name.

393
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,021
What have I done?

394
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,324
Joe, look,

395
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,560
you have been there for me

396
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,930
every day since I met you.

397
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,932
You have.

398
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,703
You would have done
the exact same thing for him

399
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,408
if you could have, I know it.

400
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,577
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,682
Where's your partner, Spivot?

402
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,851
I don't know,
I'm not his babysitter.

403
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,622
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not sure where Joe is.

I'm back!

409
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,243
Get Taru down here now.

410
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,245
I want to know
how he's doing this.

411
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,814
<i>Citizens, you know,
the holidays can be a time</i>

412
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,117
<i>for gentle reflection

413
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,485

<i>for disemboweling our enemies.</i>

417
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,263
We don't have
a Trickster on Earth-2.

418
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,731
He's one of a kind.

419
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,866
<i>My stocking won't be

420

421
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,607

422
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,244
<i>Want to roast chestnuts?</i>

423
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,079
I want all tactical units

424

425
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,783
I want watch commanders
coordinating deployment.

426
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,285
Spivot, I need you to...

427
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,886
Spivot!

428
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,721
Are there any clues as to
where he is based on the video?

429
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,257
None that I can see.

430
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,826
Guys, there's a reflection

431
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,863
of something in his cornea, see?

432
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:43,768
What is that?
- Not sure.

433
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,636
That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

434
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,605
Come again?
- It's a doll.

435
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,006
A stuffed children's toy.

436
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,708
I gave one to my daughter
when she was six.

437
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,077
Mr. Jiggle Wiggle was
manufactured by Okamura Toys...

438
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,345
Yahtzee!

439
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,247
Okamura once had a shipping
facility in Central City

440
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,182
that shut down four years ago;
it's been abandoned ever since.

441
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,052
What if Weather Wizard's there?
The Wand's not finished.

442
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,620
The Trickster is.

443
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,837
What are you doing here?

444
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,106
Same thing as you.
Trying to catch a murderer.

<i>Put that in your pipe

452
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,108
<i>closed casket funerals.</i>

453
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,642
There's nowhere for me
to run us to!

454
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:02,246
So what should we do?
- Hold me.

455
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm seeing someone.
- Me too. Don't let go.

456
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,764
Detective.

457
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,399
It was all just a trap for you.

458
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,067
Mardon and Jesse aren't even here.

459
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,403
They're still on the loose.
- How did you know to come here?

460
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,771
Because there was a reflection

461
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,105
in Jesse's eye
of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

462
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,408
And that's the thing
that my dad...

463
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,109
It doesn't even matter.

464
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,379
That's why you came here alone
without any backup?

465
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,781
Because of your father?

466
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,749
You don't know
anything about me.

467
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,751
I know that you're being reckless.

468
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,386
And I'm sure
the people in your life

469
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,222
care enough about you to not
want to see you get hurt.

470
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:48,893
Except Mardon
didn't kill my father.

471
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,461
I did.

472
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,897
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

473
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,231
so I worked there after school.

474
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,967
Except one day
I decided not to show up,

475
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:01,772
because I was being stupid
and silly with my friends.

476
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,074
I didn't even call to tell him
that I was ditching.

477
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:08,078
So he brought
the deposits to the bank,

478
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,748
not me.

479
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,718
He was shot and killed
by Mardon, not me.

480
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,656
That's why you became a cop.

481
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,524
Joined the meta-human
task force.

482
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,626
It'll be legal
when I kill Mardon.

483
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,830
I have made my whole life about
getting justice for my father,

484
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,932
even if it meant
I didn't have a life

485
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,733
and now I met
a really great guy,

486
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,902
and that doesn't even
feel real to me

487
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,873
and I'm scared he's gonna
find out how angry I am.

488
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,042
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

489
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,411
Sometimes it's just easier
to say things

490
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,680
to someone with no face.

491
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,682
Thank you for saving me.

492
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,251
You know, even if you get
this guy that wronged you,

493
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,753
it doesn't always
make things better.

494
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,323
It has to be better than this.

495
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,238
Patty, it's me.
Again.

496
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,740
I'd really love to talk.
I'm worried about you.

497
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:14,645
Anyway, just give me a call when
you get a chance, all right?

498
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,715
Thank you.
Bye.

499
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,750
Barry.
- Yeah?

500
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,086
How's it look?

501
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,854
Wow, eerily familiar.

502
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,523
How's Patty?

503
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,324
She is, um,

504
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,960
hiding a lot of pain
behind her smile.

505
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,629
They say couples start
to resemble each other

506
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,531
after a little while.

507
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,100
The thing is, I mean, she only
opened up to Flash, not me.

508
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,434
So even if I could got her
on the phone,

509
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,969
I don't know what to say.

510
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,138
Well, it's been my experience

511
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,340
that just being around you
can be a big help.

512
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,842
Thank you.

513
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:52,049
I want an iPhone,
an iPad, and an iTouch.

514
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,919
Ho, ho, ho, dial it back,
Mr. Greedy.

515
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,788
Those are a little out
of Santa's price range.

516
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,025
How about this?

517
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:05,396
Now remember,
don't open it until tomorrow.

518
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:08,632
It's a surprise.

519
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,983
Have you decided?

520
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,086
I need more time.
- Don't we all.

521
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,822
Decide.
- I need more time.

522
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,225
Maybe if I go up there

523
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:39,563
and kill a few of your new friends...

524
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,866
No!
- One more day.

525
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,937
I'll tell your daughter
you said, "hello."

526
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,582
What's that? Is that Mardon?
- That's definitely him.

527
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,985
Atmospheric pressure
just dropped 200 hectopascals.

528
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,586
Where?
- Central City Square.

529
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,821
The tree lighting ceremony.

530
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,623
There's thousands of people there.

531
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:22,339
Oh, glad to see you.
Maybe you can help me.

532
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,841
Help get back in to a jail cell?

533
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,776
It'll be my pleasure, Mark.
- No.

534
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:26,944
No, see, I'm trying to decide

535
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,412
if I should kill
everybody down there

536
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,248
with a deadly hail storm, or,
little trickier,

537
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,517
with acid rain,
what do you think?

538
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,653
Ah, let me think, um...

539
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:36,954
How about neither?

540
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,923
You see this wand here?
Guess what?

541
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,396
Um... Guys?
He's flying.

542
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,598
He can fly?
Since when can he fly?

543
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,334
Well, he's using his
powers to alter the air pressure

544
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,836
around him to create
pockets of updraft that can...

545
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,772
No, he can fly.

546
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,373
Barry, get him.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,006
You didn't really think
I'd let you hurt

548
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,841
all these people, did you?

549
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,876
No, of course not,

550
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,680
but bet you're gonna let me
hurt you.

551
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,151
Feliz Navidad!

552
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,588
Time for a real
war on Christmas.

553
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,756
What is this?

554
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,125
That is a box with a bomb in it.

555
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:53,063
Yup, I've handed out
about 100 of them today

556
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,599
it feels so good to give.

557
00:28:55,601 --> 00:29:00,037
You see, right now,
there are 100 random children

558
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,805
who've each taken home a box

559
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,407
just like that one

560
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,243
and are shoving it
under their Christmas tree.

561
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,245
There's no way
for you to to all of them,

562
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,114
even if you knew where to look.

563
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:13,217
Oh, no, please don't do this.

564
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,819
What? Me?
Kill 100 families?

565
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:18,822
No, that's up to you.

566
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,758
I'm happy just
to take your life.

567
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,559
So this is how it's gonna be.

568
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:26,697
You are gonna stand there
and let me end you.

569
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,032
Very publicly

570
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,335
and very painfully

571
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,537
and I'll let everybody live,

572
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,206
but if I see even

573
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,310
a little flicker
of electricity on you...

574
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,813
The casket makers in this town

575
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,649
are gonna have
a very Merry Christmas.

576
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,218
So, Flash...

577
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,487
What's it gonna be?

578
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,189
Huh?

579
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,031
There you go.

580
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,507
They're gonna kill Barry!
- Unless we find those bombs.

581
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,476
Cisco?
- Jay, there's no way.

582
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,544
There is a way.

583
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,946
To find 100 randomly-placed bombs?

584
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,915
We don't have to find 100.

585
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,751
We just have to find one.
And then we get rid of them all.

586
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,085
How?
- A breach.

587
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,720
That's right.
We sent Grodd away.

588
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,222
We can do the same to these
bombs, all of them.

589
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,423
Do you have a drone
in your workshop?

590
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,691
Yeah.
- Does it fly?

591
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,193
Yeah.
- Good.

592
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,228
I'm taking it.
You're not getting it back.

593
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,763
I'll warm up the van.

594
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,681
I'm cross-referencing
credit card statements with

595
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,116
toll road usage and families
with children under ten.

596
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,318
Hold up...

597
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,086
Make a U-turn.
Two streets back.

598
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,730
Your toys.
Give them to me.

599
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,498
Mom!

600
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,335
Flash, you all right?

601
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,103
You don't look so good.

602
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,405
I know...

603
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,474
I'll give you a jolt.

604
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,616
Oh!

605
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,754
Harry, what is the plan?

606
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,156
One of the 52 breaches opened
by the singularity

607
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,359
is 1/4 mile
directly above the city.

608
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,961
We are gonna use your drone

609
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,831
to put this bomb
into that breach.

610
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,333
Okay, how does that work?
One down, 99 to blow.

611
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,769
Basic physics, Ramon.
Magnetism.

612
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:49,172
Magnetism. Magnets of opposite
poles attract one another.

613
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,741
Help me out, Garrick.

614
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,309
If we can change
the dimensional frequency

615
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,977
of this bomb
and get it through that breach...

616
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,146
It'll drag all the rest of
the bombs right along with it.

617
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,382
I'll drive.
Okay, hold on.

618
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,223
I'm done.

619
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:08,358
He's all yours.

620
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,527
Oh, god...

621
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,534
To think this city worships you!

622
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:23,407
But, when I kill The Flash,

623
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,910
they'll realize I'm the man
who saved Central City!

624
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,095
It's working.

625
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,397
Was that you?
- No! Gut him!

626
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,599
All right, I'm gutting already.

627
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,803
Barry, the bombs are gone.

628
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,939
Uh-oh...

629
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,989
How do you like
the magnets, bitch?

630
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:23,100
Detective, it's taken care of.
They can't hurt anyone else.

631
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,573
What are you doing?

632
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,476
What are you doing?
- This is for my father.

633
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,444
No, no, no, detective!

634
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,119
Detective, no.
You can't do this.

635
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,855
He killed my father
for a couple hundred dollars.

636
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:48,191
What was so important that my
father had to lose his life?

637
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,726
Mardon will get
what he deserves.

638
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,429
He deserves to die!
- Not like this!

639
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,865
You don't have it
in you, pretty lady.

640
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,034
I've been asking myself that
for the last four years,

641
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,835
and now I know.

642
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,470
No, Patty!

643
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,840
You pull that trigger,
your life ends too.

644
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,942
You will go to prison.

645
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:09,046
Everything and everyone that
you could have had in your life

646
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,747
will be taken from you.

647
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,750
Again.

648
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,386
Mardon can't take anything else
from you unless you let him.

649
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,626
I didn't know your father, but
I know he wouldn't want this.

650
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:25,362
Not over him.

651
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:29,166
Please.
Please.

652
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,837
Mark Mardon,
you're under arrest.

653
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:40,410
That was beautiful.

654
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,684
Barry, hey.
- Hey.

655
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,687
Everyone's heading over
to our place for Christmas.

656
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,322
You okay?

657
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,458
Yeah, no,
nothing a little meta-human

658
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,561
regenerative healing
capabilities won't cure.

659
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,496
How'd it go with Francine?

660
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,598
It was good.
It was really good, actually.

661
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,570
I mean, I spent so long
lying about her being dead

662
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,438
that I started
to believe it myself.

663
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,241
But the truth is, those feelings
were always there.

664
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:14,778
That anger, that regret,
the guilt...

665
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,948
I just didn't realize how much
I needed to forgive her.

666
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,019
And now...
There's room for another West.

667
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,554
Did you meet him?

668
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,791
No.
He still doesn't know.

669
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,459
That'll come.

670
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,262
Wow. You have a son.
- I know, right?

671
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,630
It's crazy.

672
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,000
Speaking of which, take this.
- What?

673
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,870
No, no, no, no,
I can't take that.

674
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:45,876
I've always said that one day
I would give this to my son...

675
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,085
And now I have.

676
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,788
Merry Christmas.

677
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,991
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

678
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,760
Love you.

679
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,428
I love you too.
- See you at the house.

680
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,430
Yeah.

681
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,380
I know that you're not him...

682
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,418
But he's not here
and I have to say this for me.

683
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,922
In that video message,

684
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:35,425
you said that...

685
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,895
That I would never
really be happy...

686
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:46,169
And I've been trying...
I've been trying really hard.

687
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,041
After what Joe said,

688
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,176
and helping Patty,

689
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:56,680
I realize that
you're still in my heart.

690
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:03,086
How much I hate you

691
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,088
for what you've done.

692
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,530
I don't want to hate you
anymore, I can't.

693
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,699
Can't hate you anymore.

694
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,438
I forgive you.

695
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,447
You need me for something?

696
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,783
No, no, I'm good.

697
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:39,055
You know, you should come over
for Christmas tonight.

698
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,459
You shouldn't be alone.

699
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,495
It's a nice offer.

700
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,465
I can't celebrate
without my daughter.

701
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,367
All right.

704
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,348
Strong enough?
- We'll see.

705
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:10,153
I'll be right back.

706
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,254
Hey.
- Oh!

707
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,555
What do you have there?

708
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,658
Mistletoe.
- What's Mistletoe?

709
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,394
Oh, um,
it's a hemiparasitic plant

710
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,696
from the Genus Santalaceae family

711
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,307
in North America, I think.

712
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:24,067
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have Mistletoe on Earth-2.

713
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,936
Right, of course.

714
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:30,974
Um, we also have this
tradition over there.

715
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,814
We have that tradition here too.

716
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,115
Aww.
- Finally.

717
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,684
Oh, let me get that.

718
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,052
Eggnog, please?
- Yeah.

719
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,620
Hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

720
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:44,988
Aw, thank you for having me.

721
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,389
Merry Christmas.
This is for you.

722
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,591
Thank you.
- Of course.

723
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,026
Hey.
- Hi.

724
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,461
I've been really
worried about you.

725
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,129
I've been calling.
- I know...

726
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,031
And I'm really sorry.

727
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,500
I just have been dealing
with something by myself,

728
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,236
but I want to tell you about it.

729
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,572
I think that I'm ready to.

730
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,507
Someone reminded me
of what's important,

731
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,977
so if you want to hear, I
would like to share it with you.

732
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,679
That would be
the best gift I could get.

733
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,214
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,850
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

735
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,019
I hope it's as
sweet as this one.

736
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,921
It's matching.

737
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,422
Thank you.
- Of course.

738
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,624
Detective Spivot.
- Hi!

739
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,060
What brings you here?
- Merry Christmas.

740
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:29,032
Well, uh, I'm...
Barry's girlfriend.

741
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,701
About time.
- Cheers.

742
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,204
Are we expecting anybody else?

743
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,040
Not that I know of.
- Maybe Harry changed his mind.

744
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,817
Hi, I'm Wally.
I'm Francine's son.

745
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:58,261
I'm... I'm... I'm Joe.

746
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:01,264
This is Iris.

747
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,367
Hi.
- Hi.

748
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:10,140
Uh, I just wanted to...

749
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,075
I don't know.

750
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,778
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

751
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,247
No. No, no, no.
Come in.

752
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,801
Time's up, Wells.

753
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,570
What's it gonna be?

754
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,906
I know what you're doing.

755
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,843
I know why you keep sending
villain after villain

756
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,712
from our Earth to this one.

757
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,115
You want Barry to get faster.

758
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:56,386
You want him to get stronger.

759
00:40:56,388 --> 00:41:00,590
You want him to become more
powerful, more full of...

760
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,959
Speed force.

761
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,933
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

762
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:12,168
The more power he has,

763
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,338
the more I can take

764
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,309
and you're going to help me.

765
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,478
Let me see her first.

766
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,115
Daddy?

767
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,323
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

768
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,791
Please help me.

769
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,559
Don't let him
take me back there.

770
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,595
I won't...

771
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,897
Now decide.

772
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:45,735
In return for
your daughter's life...

773
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,238
I'll do it.

774
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,844
I'll help you steal
The Flash's speed.
