17
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,230
Can't move.

21
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,020
{\an9}Ladies and gentlemen, we finally have our hands

22
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,450
on the meta-human cure.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,980
Cool, cool. It's not like I spent weeks

24
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,570
in the frozen tundra or anything.

25
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,960
No, no, no. I think that just people are

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,880
waiting for the inevitable "But"

27
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,940
that follows such a big statement.

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,130
Mmm, no, it's done, and thanks to Caitlin,

29
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,430
we even have a way to deliver our silver bullet,

30
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,790
so no, no "Buts."

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,900
I believe there is a big "But" coming.

32
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,010
But we need to test the cure on a meta-human.

33
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,290
There it is.

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,290
What we need is to save

35
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,850
the metas that Cicada is targeting

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,220
because he's not gonna stop killing innocent people.

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,680
- Is the cure dangerous? - Well, it's an untested serum

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,600
that alters biology on a cellular level,

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,570
so until we try it out on someone,

40
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,750
we have no way of knowing.

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,410
When we started working on the cure,

42
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,390
we decided that it would always be a choice, not a weapon,

43
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,620
so all we need is a volunteer.

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,370
Well, there's quite a conundrum, right?

45
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,700
A meta-human volunteer

46
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,650
when the meta-humans in this city

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,650
have been chased away by us or killed by Cicada

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,800
or incarcerated at Iron Heights Prison, so...

49
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,060
Nobody from either group is gonna volunteer.

50
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,010
No, these criminals are not going to relinquish

51
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,590
their powers, although...

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,610
There's gotta be somebody somewhere.

53
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,020
Yes, on another Earth.

54
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,010
Oh, I'll call Harry, see if there's anybody from Earth-2

55
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,290
-who wants to volunteer. - Yes.

56
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,080
Not really what I was suggesting.

57
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,010
Hold on, you don't have to call Harry.

58
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,910
Wait, why not?

59
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,010
Because there's already a meta here from Earth-2,

60
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,040
one who might not want his power...

61
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,790
although it might be pretty difficult to talk to him.

62
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,560
King Shark

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,140
you really think you can cure him?

64
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,180
That's the idea.

65
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,890
Oh, Lyla, this is, um...

66
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,630
my daughter, Nora.

67
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,650
- Your daughter? - Yeah.

68
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,370
- I'm from-- - The future, I'm guessing.

69
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,470
Weird, right?

70
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,670
No weirder than waking up one day

71
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,260
to find out that your son used to be your daughter.

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,480
So, why King Shark?

73
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,740
Dark matter levels vary from meta-human to meta-human,

74
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,070
but Shay Lamden's case is the most extreme we've seen,

75
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,490
so we think if we could reverse the effects of a high level

76
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,550
mutation like his...

77
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,350
You can help all meta-humans.

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,830
Look, we know King Shark has limited speech,

79
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,510
but we're wondering, could we try and talk to him?

80
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,510
If we're gonna do this, we're gonna need his permission.

81
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,080
Well, you're in luck, Cisco.

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,090
Lately, he's been quite talkative.

83
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,390
Look at these pictures.

84
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,440
So peaceful.

85
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,050
So beautiful.

86
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,450
- So peaceful. - It is, isn't it?

87
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,690
You know, I never understood why Wally went there.

88
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,530
- Now I do. - Well, it makes me wonder.

89
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,210
I mean, is my baby brother ever coming back from Tibet?

90
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,850
Well, all I can say is that he is more at ease

91
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,420
than he has ever been.

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,460
And if that means he wants to stay away from...

93
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,600
the crazy that is Central City,

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,050
then, you know what? So be it.

95
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,200
Yeah.

96
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,100
Well, I am glad that you're back, Dad.

97
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,990
We're all glad that you're back.

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,770
Even Captain Singh is glad that you're back.

99
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,250
- Wha-- - I'll get it.

100
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,460
No, no, no. No, you will not.

101
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,420
You will not.

102
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,520
You have been on crying baby duty for far too long, Joe West.

103
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
So happy you're back.

104
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,400
All right, all right.

105
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,260
Are we ever gonna talk about this couch you bought?

106
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,980
Another day, Joe. Another day.

107
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,000
Very expensive.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,540
I mean, it's nice. Listen.

109
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,770
So, Cecile...

110
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,900
Has brought me up to speed.

111
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,670
Cicada-- been very busy.

112
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah, well...

113
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,910
You know, Team Flash will figure out a way to beat him.

114
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,400
But Jonesy was helping him right under our nose,

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,860
and that got me thinking,

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,790
Cicada's eluded capture for so long

117
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,450
that I'm thinking that

118
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,230
he's still getting help from somebody.

119
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,260
I want more coffee.

120
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,100
I'm gonna make some more coffee.

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,900
Yeah, I'll bring you a fresh cup.

122
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,260
Normally, we don't bring in outside help

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,810
but we got wind that the top ichthyologist in the country

124
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,580
was doing research on cases just like King Shark's.

125
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,530
Actually, I think you may know her.

126
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,510
Dr. Lamden?

127
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,500
You're working for A.R.G.U.S. now?

128
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,910
Couldn't say no. And please, call me Tanya.

129
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,640
What about Nautilus Laboratories?

130
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,260
Director Michaels offered me the opportunity

131
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,110
to work with another Shay Lamden,

132
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,620
one afflicted with the same dark matter anomaly

133
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
as my late husband,

134
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,660
only this Shay system was causing his neural pathways to regress.

135
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,530
I'm teaching him how to communicate effectively.

136
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,210
Are you saying his mind is becoming more shark-like?

137
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,610
It was, but not anymore.

138
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,520
I stopped the regression of King Shark's mind

139
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
using a cerebral interface that stimulates his neural outputs.

140
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,640
I call it a telepathic crown.

141
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,170
Kinda like the M.A.D. 2.0 we built.

142
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,010
That's brilliant.

143
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,820
My husband, the Shay Lamden of Earth-1,

144
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,550
was a wonderful man.

145
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,450
Now, I have the chance to help another Earth's Shay Lamden,

146
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,600
by giving him back his human mind.

147
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,920
And since Shay's current state

148
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,900
requires him to be in the water more,

149
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,980
these earbuds allow me to hear him under water

150
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,930
and vice versa.

151
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,590
The telepathic crown allows Tanya to get through to King Shark

152
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,760
and curb his violent behavior.

153
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Can we use the crown to talk to him?

154
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,370
Yes, but why?

155
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,650
We think we can make him human again.

156
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,090
It's taken a lot of work, but we think we figured out a way

157
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,010
to transform dark matter-infused cells

158
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,540
back to their non-meta state.

159
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,850
Now, all we need to do is test it,

160
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,820
so we came looking for a volunteer.

161
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,010
That could really work?

162
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,860
So, can we ask him?

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,830
Shay, a team from S.T.A.R. Labs is here.

164
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,160
They have something you may want--

165
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,470
a meta-cure for your condition.

166
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,980
Trust me, their preliminary analysis

167
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,200
on reversing meta-gene transfigurations

168
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,510
proves there is a strong chance it could work,

169
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,140
especially in ichthyological prospects.

170
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,190
No, I'm not just showing off.

171
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,880
It's their research.

172
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,290
Shay has a wonderful sense of humor.

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,310
So, are we supposed to call him King Shark or Shay?

174
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,240
Yes, I'm still here. Uh-huh.

175
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,020
I agree.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay.

177
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,440
You believe this cure could help?

178
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
Where do we begin?

180
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,670
This is Agent Michaels.

181
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,690
I need every available soldier at the aquarium now!

182
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,920
- Dad? - I'm fine.

183
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,390
W-What was all that feedback? I thought he was under control.

184
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,200
I don't know.

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,370
Nothing like that has ever happened before.

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,780
Maybe his neuroregression finally reached the point

187
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,850
where the crown could no longer affect him.

188
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,800
Shay could be lost forever.

189
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,450
No, no, no. We don't know that.

190
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,540
Why don't you come to S.T.A.R. Labs with us.

191
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,810
We can use the M.A.D. 2.0 to boost the crown's efficiency.

192
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,340
We need to find King Shark before he hurts anyone.

193
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,030
A.R.G.U.S. backup protocols have been activated,

194
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,240
but King Shark could be anywhere.

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,660
We'll re-task the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

196
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,430
to work in circuit with A.R.G.U.S.

197
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,670
What's on your mind?

198
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,890
Just wondering if we need to rethink

199
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,440
how we're going to catch him.

200
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,670
Stop, that did not happen.

201
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,210
Yes, it did. -

202
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,070
Look, my lips went numb, and then they swelled up

203
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,980
so bad it looked like I had plastic surgery.

204
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,220
- What did Wally do? - He laughed, of course.

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,560
The baby laughed.

206
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,870
At least now I know I'm allergic to Szechuan peppers.

207
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,930
Dad, do you mind if I work here today, actually?

208
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,980
Might give us some time to catch up.

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,590
Well, you know I'm never gonna turn that down, so...

210
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,940
Uh, but, Cecile tells me that you have

211
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,310
a fancy new office?

212
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,660
Yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, the plumbing

213
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,380
is really lousy and I can't have water

214
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,960
dripping on my laptop, right?

215
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,140
Well, hey, uh, the guy that expanded our guest bath--

216
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,230
he did a really great job and he's really affordable.

217
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,800
Let me give you his number.

218
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,370
No, Dad, it's fine, really.

219
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,590
Iris, if you don't take care of this quickly,

220
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,720
it could snowball.

221
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,430
Here. Let me just send it to you.

222
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,730
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

223
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,370
Actually, yeah, you know what? That's a great idea.

224
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,890
Why don't you send it to me and I'll head over there

225
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,160
and see what I can do.

226
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,670
- Thanks, Dad. - Okay.

227
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,250
Love you.

228
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,450
Love you more.

229
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,910
So, if we wanna boost the crown's powers,

230
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,380
we gotta get it to talk to the M.A.D. 2.0.

231
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,490
What about a logarithmic code?

232
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,250
Exactly. You see, this is why we need

233
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,150
more scientists on the team.

234
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,840
Shay tells me that all the time.

235
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, the guy knows what he's talking about.

236
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,980
All right, so, why don't you use

237
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,090
my workstation, and I'll get this going.

238
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,550
- Fascinating, right? - Yeah, it should be.

239
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,120
It's the merging of technology

240
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,830
and human consciousness.

241
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,020
And shark, but no, no, no.

242
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,250
I'm referring to your relationship with Shay Lamden.

243
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,220
What do you mean, "Relationship"?

244
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,180
C'est clair.

245
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,230
The way your posture relaxes when you're speaking of him

246
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,100
and the way your voice modulates...

247
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,750
- it suggests a familiarity... - Hm.

248
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,090
Or something more.

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,080
We're both marine biologists, so we have a lot in common.

250
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,310
I guess you could say we've grown very close.

251
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,500
But he's just my patient.

252
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, of course.

253
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,320
Look at that. We have liftoff.

254
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,920
They are actually talking. You see?

255
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,570
I knew these two crazy kids were gonna make it work.

256
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,380
They aren't just synching up.

257
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,980
The M.A.D. 2.0 is acting like an antennae,

258
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,100
amplifying the crown's psychic signal

259
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,550
beyond anything I could have imagined.

260
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,890
We heard geek screaming. How are things going in here?

261
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,840
I just need to synch the helmet to my earbuds,

262
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,390
and we're good to go.

263
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,560
Left that in the Cortex,

264
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,340
in the main console, by the monitor to the left.

265
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,760
You know what?

266
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,670
Come with me. I'll show you.

267
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,270
- Great work, Cisco. - Oh, well, takes a village.

268
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,720
But every village needs a genius

269
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,680
and that's me, so thank you.

270
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,220
Now we just have to find King Shark and talk him down.

271
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,940
Why don't we get the cure injector to Caitlin

272
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,970
and make sure it's ready to go.

273
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,660
Well, remember, we gotta talk to him first.

274
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,120
Right.

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,470
We got a hit on King Shark. He's at the wharf.

276
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,150
Caitlin, are you sure he's here?

277
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, he's there.

278
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,100
He's heading straight right for you.

279
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,780
Nora, you're up.

280
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,140
Done.

281
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,910
Okay, systems are synched.

282
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,620
Shay? It's me, Tanya.

283
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,920
These people are only here to help you.

284
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,550
Please listen to them.

285
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,150
It's okay.

286
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,340
I think it's working.

287
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,090
I think you're right.

288
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,110
Let's ask him--

289
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,510
Shay, stop! Please.

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
Please. I don't know what's wrong with him.

291
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,720
Barry?

292
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,190
Guys, what's happening? Where's Shay?

293
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,170
Shay?

294
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,440
What is it?

295
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,590
What's going on?

296
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,210
Is Shay okay?

297
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,850
Yeah. He's human again.

298
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,940
Where am I? Who are you?

299
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,020
- Hey, hey, hey. - No, enough!

300
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,990
- Just get off me! - It's okay.

301
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,460
They're friends.

302
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,230
Tanya.

303
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,460
Yeah, it's... it's me.

304
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,140
I'm...me?

305
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,710
How?

306
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
We call it the cure.

307
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,070
It's a serum that suppresses dark matter in meta-humans.

308
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,740
You're the first person to take it.

309
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,670
Well, except you didn't take it.

310
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,230
We, um, we gave it to you.

311
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,970
My--my head is still swirling around.

312
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,520
Are you saying I'm human again?

313
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,200
Forever?

314
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,530
Almost.

315
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,460
We developed a cure to work on the human part of a meta-human.

316
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,790
The animal part of your brain fought back a little bit.

317
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,470
There's still some dark matter in your pituitary gland,

318
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,760
but with this new data, we should be able to

319
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,890
address the cure and the next dose should be permanent.

320
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,690
Monsieur Lamden, I should introduce myself.

321
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,560
Sherloque Wells. You've probably heard of me.

322
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,810
I have a question. I've been debating in my brain.

323
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,000
What drives the King Shark?

324
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,970
Is it the shark, or is it the man?

325
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,450
If you're asking should I be held accountable

326
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,610
for my actions, my answer is simple.

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,950
Yes, I should.

328
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,910
I don't remember how many people I hurt,

329
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,910
or who, but that's no excuse.

330
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,310
What do you remember?

331
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,270
Fragments. Glimpses.

332
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,430
One day, I was a scientist.

333
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,830
The next, I was trapped in that body

334
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,520
and everything felt heightened,

335
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,940
like my emotions were on steroids.

336
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,020
And the rage-- there was so much rage.

337
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,790
That makes sense. A shark's amygdala triggers

338
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,030
a huge emotional response when it feels attacked.

339
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,510
Perhaps that's why you escaped today.

340
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,190
You were frightened.

341
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,140
I don't know. Today felt different.

342
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,090
I don't remember much before I started using Tanya's crown,

343
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,300
but since then,

344
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,650
my mind and memory have been much clearer.

345
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,680
And I especially remember the kindness that you showed me.

346
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
What--

347
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,040
What happened?

348
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,340
The dark matter in his system is replicating.

349
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,990
Tanya, I'm sorry.

350
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,800
Shay, I'm sorry, but until this is over,

351
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,910
we can't let you leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

352
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,910
Call me as soon as the cure

353
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,400
is ready to inject him a second time.

354
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,050
We have to know if this works.

355
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,340
- Barry? - Yeah?

356
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,900
When you said you wanted me to call you

357
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,330
it was so that we could ask Shay

358
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,890
if he wants to take the cure, right?

359
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,830
- Caitlin-- - 'Cause you know,

360
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,050
out in the field, you didn't really give him

361
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,180
much of a choice.

362
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,540
But that was kinda hard to do

363
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,560
when King Shark had you dead to rights.

364
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,660
We had a way of communicating with him,

365
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,920
and you barely gave that a shot.

366
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,030
And we could have tried again.

367
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,510
I saved you, man. What did you want me to do?

368
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,280
- Risk your life? - That's not the point.

369
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,600
It should be. We're a team.

370
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,170
We're supposed to have each other's backs.

371
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,740
And we agreed, as a team,

372
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,770
to wait for his permission, but you didn't even do that.

373
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,550
And look what happened.

374
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,250
You're alive,

375
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,550
and Shay seems to like being human,

376
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,990
so that's a win-win.

377
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,720
Is that what you think a hero does?

378
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,170
Forces other people to do what you want them to do?

379
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,420
He was gonna eat you, Cisco.

380
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,570
What was I supposed to do?

381
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,060
We agreed that the cure would never be used as a weapon.

382
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,500
Tell me something.

383
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,060
Did you change your mind in the moment,

384
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,690
or was this always part of the plan?

385
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,530
Dad?

386
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,000
I went by your office

387
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,140
to talk to you.

388
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,450
Dad, look. I, um--

389
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
Don't. Don't try it.

390
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,210
I heard about this crazy time loop you all got stuck in.

391
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,860
Cisco and Nora told me

392
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,830
what happened in every version,

393
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,200
and although I don't remember any of them,

394
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,890
just knowing what did happen--

395
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,320
You weren't scared?

396
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,220
I don't know.

397
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,610
I mean, I broke into Cicada's home.

398
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,280
Dad, I fought him.

399
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,250
And as terrifying as that was, I mean,

400
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,700
at least I could react to it, you know?

401
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,330
But now--now that he knows who I am,

402
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,350
who my family is,

403
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,880
I mean, he could show up at any moment.

404
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,560
I just, I--

405
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,910
I feel--

406
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,980
Powerless.

407
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,660
Yeah, I just--

408
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,890
I don't know, I can't go back there.

409
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,520
Okay, get up.

410
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,220
Dad, I just told you...

411
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,870
I don't want to go back there, you know?

412
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,570
I'm not taking you there.

413
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,410
Then where?

414
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,690
Someplace where I can show you

415
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,750
how powerful you really are.

416
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,830
Pack it up. Come on.

417
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,220
We gotta talk.

418
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,220
Don't you know you shouldn't

419
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,050
interrupt others while they're brooding?

420
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,360
Trying to get my Oliver Queen on here.

421
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,460
I ran some more tests on Shay.

422
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,490
The reason he doesn't remember anything that happened

423
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,260
this morning is because he experienced a severe brain wave

424
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,750
disruption in his frontal lobe.

425
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,840
That's the feedback that we all heard.

426
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,870
So, that's why he snapped on us

427
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,700
like it was "Jaws: The Revenge"?

428
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
A frontal lobe that compromised would of course

429
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,070
result in lack of control over emotions and judgment.

430
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,910
So you think maybe the crown might have done this?

431
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,710
No, that's the thing. The crown is not the problem.

432
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,290
The way the neurotransmitters work in this device

433
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,650
never would have caused that.

434
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,630
So what you're saying is

435
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,630
the telepathic crown was working the whole time?

436
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,270
Yes, so that begs the question,

437
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,170
what caused King Shark to go berserk?

438
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,870
Guys, hey.

439
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,030
I just wanted to apologize for earlier.

440
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,060
I was definitely too harsh.

441
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,840
No way.

442
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,950
Caitlin.

443
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,120
Hello, Flash.

444
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Cisco's cerebral scan is clear.

445
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,380
Mine is as well. We are both back to normal.

446
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,040
No more strings on us.

447
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,250
Killer Frost says she's sorry for that ice blast.

448
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,650
That was Grodd, too.

449
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,300
Now she's ready for some payback.

450
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,380
Yeah, me too.

451
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,440
Do we have a 20 on our Simian Svengali?

453
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,050
Data and company are working on it,

454
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,660
but Grodd's psychic abilities are helping him conceal his location,

455
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,090
so he could be anywhere by now.

456
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,720
I thought every square inch of A.R.G.U.S.

457
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,770
was supposed to be power dampened 24 hours a day.

458
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,500
It is.

459
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,560
Then how does an 800-pound gorilla escape?

460
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Let me show you.

461
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,670
I went through our security footage.

462
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,090
This is from the night of May 22nd, 2018.

463
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,420
- That's the night-- - Of the Enlightenment.

464
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,400
DeVoe's dark matter wave took down all tech

465
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,110
in the surrounding areas.

466
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,200
Luckily, our generators kicked in.

467
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,060
- But not for a second. - One second.

468
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,450
That's all Grodd needed

469
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,890
to psychically implant instructions in a guard.

470
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,250
Instructions to secretly shut down

471
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,120
the power dampeners in his cell,

472
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
and find out any other information he needed to know.

473
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
So that's why King Shark flipped out?

474
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,590
Because Grodd was trying to mind control him?

475
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,060
Likely as a distraction.

476
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,030
Grodd's only ever controlled human minds before.

477
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,970
He must have had a hard time controlling King Shark

478
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,920
because of the animal part of his brain.

479
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,210
So King Shark was trying to resist Grodd's iron will?

480
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,530
Respect.

481
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,550
If Grodd's had his powers for a year,

482
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,200
why wait until now to escape?

483
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,640
It's probably no coincidence that the first thing he did

484
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,530
was steal the telepathic crown.

485
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,870
Tanya did say she's been working on the crown for a while.

486
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,640
Grodd probably knew this was his perfect opportunity.

487
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,780
And it was thanks to our tech.

488
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,750
All right, well, now that Grodd has the crown,

489
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,550
what's gonna happen when he uses it?

490
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,940
It'll amplify his mental abilities a thousand-fold.

491
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,670
Instead of just being able to mind control a few people at a time...

492
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,580
He'll be able to control the whole city.

493
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,220
Forgive me. I'm intruding.

494
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,730
Or am I?

495
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,750
I see him out there and I see you in here in the shadows.

496
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,480
Why is that, I wonder?

497
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,770
Can you blame me?

498
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,900
You saw his hand transform.

499
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,420
Yes, right. "Shark Week!"

500
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,460
Not something you see every day, but no,

501
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,690
I thought your hesitation occurred

502
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,780
before that moment, not after.

503
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,970
It was a slight hesitation, but it was there nonetheless.

504
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,740
Again, why do you think that is?

505
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,570
I don't know...

506
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,270
No? Well, perhaps I could be so bold as to offer

507
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,530
a suggestion that it is not the hand

508
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,670
of which you were frightened, but rather,

509
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,180
it was seeing the face

510
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,370
of the man that you love.

511
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,150
I don't love Shay. We're friends.

512
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,580
All right, well, let's take a look at that too, shall we?

513
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,380
So this is a friend from another Earth,

514
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,430
for whom you left a high-paying job

515
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,600
and for whom you have dedicated

516
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,860
every waking moment of your life trying to help.

517
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,370
It doesn't quite add up.

518
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,150
I can't love Shay.

519
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,040
He's my dead husband's doppelganger from Earth-2.

520
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,190
How crazy would I have to be to fall in love with him?

521
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,360
No crazier than marrying the same woman

522
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,970
from five different Earths...

523
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,960
I know.

524
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,190
I'm very good at marrying people,

525
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,190
but not so great at staying married.

526
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,950
Along the way, though,

527
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,170
on these countless Earths and countless doppelgangers,

528
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,120
I learned there is one thing

529
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,470
that makes all of us unique.

530
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,170
And if that

531
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,120
is what you fell in love with, well then,

532
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,820
perhaps a face doesn't matter that much.

533
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,230
You missed a beautiful sunset earlier.

534
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,960
Too bad.

535
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,230
- It's my favorite time of day. - Mine, too.

536
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,010
I almost forgot what one looked like.

537
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,440
Did you know sharks are colorblind?

538
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,780
When I was King Shark, my world was dull and gray.

539
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,250
And then I met you, and everything changed.

540
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,490
I thought you were avoiding me.

541
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,170
I was, but not anymore.

542
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,540
Tanya, are you disappointed in me now that I'm--

543
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,190
No, not at all.

544
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,780
They say every sunset is unique.

545
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,190
Do you think that's true?

546
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,030
Yes, I do.

547
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,290
Dad, this is not going to work.

548
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,770
You haven't even tried it yet.

549
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,200
Look, I get it.

550
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,010
I'm supposed to take out my frustrations on that bag

551
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,330
and somehow get over it, but it's not that easy.

552
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,720
To confront what ails you?

553
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,680
No, it's not. It's hard.

554
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,650
I had to go all the way across the world to do it.

555
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,020
Are you talking about Tibet?

556
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,550
I thought you went there to see Wally.

557
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,280
I did, but that's not the only reason I went.

558
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,030
I went there to heal.

559
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,220
Is that why you were gone for so long?

560
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,430
Wally convinced me to come east with the baby.

561
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,670
He said it would help me repair my mind,

562
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,280
my body, restore this old soul of mine.

563
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,060
So with Cecile's blessing,

564
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,620
that's what I did.

565
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,640
And did it work?

566
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,030
I bent, baby girl.

567
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,360
But Cicada ain't going to break me.

568
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,510
Ain't going to break you either.

569
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,920
Come on.

570
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,080
Come on, Iris. Show Cicada what you got.

571
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,370
Break him, Iris.

572
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,280
Break him!

573
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,850
What's happening?

574
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,470
Our fuzzy friend is crawling up the Broome Belfry.

575
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,800
What is it with him and that tower?

576
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,880
'Cause it's at the exact epicenter of the city...

577
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,850
Making it the perfect place to broadcast from.

578
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,300
He's going to use the crown.

579
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,820
And get inside everyone's head in the city.

580
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,040
Hear your master, Humans.

581
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,760
Soon, you will only know my will--

582
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,050
the will of Grodd!

583
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,320
How long before everyone's under Grodd's mind control?

584
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,080
A few minutes, maybe less.

585
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,330
We need to dismantle that crown and get it away from him.

586
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,270
I can try talking to him.

587
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,360
He's always had a sweet spot for me.

588
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,700
- Good. - The hell you will.

589
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,070
Nope, Killer Frost is gonna be a hard sell on that one.

590
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,920
We're immune to his mind control, right,

591
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,340
because we're speedsters?

592
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,480
No.

593
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,310
Okay, the Flash Museum just straight up got a lot of stuff wrong.

594
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,400
Wait, but do you have any extra anti-mind control headsets lying around?

595
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,380
There's a few in the workshop,

596
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,230
but it didn't work so well last time.

597
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,710
Yeah, but now there's two of us.

598
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,480
I need you to run at him as fast as you can

599
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,110
- without reversing time. - Okay.

600
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,080
- That'll get his attention. - What are you gonna do?

601
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,560
An old trick.

602
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
Get the crown!

603
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,900
Dad?

604
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,930
We can't move.

605
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,250
The mental dampeners are working,

606
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,070
but Grodd's too strong.

607
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,150
I'm trying to hack into the crown, but Grodd won't let me.

608
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,370
He's gonna kill them.

609
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,070
Not if you turn me back.

610
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,860
I can stop Grodd.

611
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,750
He can't read my mind...at least,

612
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,100
not when I'm a shark.

613
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
Can you do that?

614
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,750
I mean, if we accelerate the cell cycle,

615
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,080
do something that will prompt a return

616
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,490
to the dark matter cellular form.

617
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,520
Right, right, perhaps a vibration or a jolt, right?

618
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,460
Yes, if it was strong enough,

619
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,410
but there would be permanent consequences.

620
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,320
If we re-saturate your meta-genic cells,

621
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,400
that will eliminate the possibility

622
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,450
for you to transform them back into human cells.

623
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,240
He won't be able to use the cure.

624
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,250
Shay, if you agree to this,

625
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,730
you'll never be human again.

626
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,790
Tanya, I can save Flash, the people of this city, you,

627
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,890
and make up for some of the horrible things I've done.

628
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,560
I have to do this.

629
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,030
I'm afraid of losing you.

630
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,650
You won't.

631
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,700
Well, is there anyone in this room that can provide a vibrational jolt?

632
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,970
I'm doing it.

633
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,400
My mind grows.

634
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,290
Soon, Grodd will rule this city,

635
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,780
this world.

636
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,540
And you...

637
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,570
gone forever.

638
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,040
King Shark?

639
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,520
King Shark wants you gone!

640
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,050
Oh, no.

641
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,160
Guys, King Shark's not moving.

642
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,690
When a shark is turned upside down,

643
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,420
it enters tonic immobility.

644
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,180
He's in a state of paralysis.

645
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,440
How do we wake him up?

646
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,300
Don't sharks have electroreceptor organs

647
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,830
called ampullae of Lorenzini?

648
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,240
It's how they detect electromagnetic fields, right?

649
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,560
Yes, it's how they navigate.

650
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,170
And it will also attract electricity, right?

651
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,860
So if we can get enough electricity to him, we can...

652
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,970
- Electrify his ass back up. - Electrify his ass right up.

653
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,070
- Barry! - Yeah, we heard.

654
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,780
Time for another old trick.

655
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,250
You okay?

656
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,700
- Yes! - Yes!

657
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,030
Nothing to it.

658
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,210
Long live the king.

659
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,980
I know Grodd almost turned all of our brains into scrambled eggs,

660
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,690
but that Kaiju battle was the stuff of dreams.

661
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,310
Seriously, way better than anything

662
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,800
I read in The Flash Museum.

663
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,730
Now that Grodd is safely locked up,

664
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,460
what's stopping him from getting out again?

665
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,330
A medically-induced coma,

666
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,070
one safely administered by Caitlin

667
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,620
and the A.R.G.U.S. medical staff.

668
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,320
Exposure to the crown kickstarted

669
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,430
Grodd's mental abilities into high gear.

670
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,900
They're growing even now.

671
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,590
Fortunately, I realized that if Grodd's brain remains inactive,

672
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,440
he can't access his mental powers.

673
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,400
Add in newly-enhanced AI power dampeners

674
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,840
that upgrade to keep up with Grodd's power.

675
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,760
You're welcome, by the way.

676
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,010
Anything it takes to keep the city safe.

677
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,380
Speaking of keeping the city safe,

678
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,600
we couldn't have done this without Shay.

679
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,330
How'd you guys convince him to turn back into King Shark?

680
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,360
We didn't.

681
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,790
He volunteered.

682
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,320
And you can never turn him back into a human?

683
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,740
I don't think so.

684
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,240
So he's gonna stay King Shark forever?

685
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,010
Well, the good guys won once again,

686
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,140
and yet you do not seem like you're really celebrating.

687
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,360
Why that is?

688
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,420
After all that's happened today,

689
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,090
I just wonder how it will effect--

690
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,450
Your relationship?

691
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,510
Well, that's a big question, I must admit.

692
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,730
But you know what?

693
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,460
You will figure it out, both of you, together.

694
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,200
If so, we'll have you to thank.

695
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,510
- Oh, no, no, no, no. - Me especially.

696
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,770
No, no, no. I did nothing.

697
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,450
No, you're right, I did help quite a bit.

698
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,740
The point here is simply this,

699
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,820
and that is that whether it's man or shark or...

700
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,600
man-shark,

701
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,050
the heart wants what the heart wants.

702
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,230
And so, you must be open to that.

703
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,060
Sounds like you've solved life's greatest mystery.

704
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,360
Well, that's what I do.

705
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,080
If so,

706
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,870
I hope one day, you find what you're looking for too--

707
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,930
maybe in another doppelganger.

708
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,960
Of course.

709
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,470
I'll leave you to it.

710
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,190
Tanya, you look sad.

711
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,430
Why?

712
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,100
We found each other today,

713
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,550
and now that connection is--

714
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,450
Still here.

715
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,140
Shay, what you did--

716
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,750
I would do it again for you, my love.

717
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,570
Time to bend.

718
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,830
King Shark versus Gorilla Grodd?

719
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,580
Are you kidding me? I missed that?

722
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,750
Are you sure you don't want something a bit more grown up?

723
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,030
Um, you take that back.

724
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,210
This snack is a delicacy no matter how old you are.

725
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,640
Guys, hey.

726
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,670
I just--Swedish Fish?

727
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,830
I love those.

728
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,560
look, I know today has been crazy,

729
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,010
and I just wanted to make sure that we're good,

730
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,310
I know Grodd made you blast me in the face

731
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,620
but I also know I kinda deserved it--

732
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,760
same with being ice blasted.

733
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,140
I shouldn't have used the cure as a weapon

734
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,920
and forced it on King Shark.

735
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,690
I promise it won't happen again.

736
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,320
Apology accepted.

737
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,660
Goober.

738
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,890
And we know something good did come out of today.

739
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,870
We know the meta-human cure works.

740
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,190
And now we can use it to help all of the metas

741
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,770
in Central City and beyond.

742
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,670
Maybe we start with Cicada.

743
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,650
I'm sorry, what?

744
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,050
I know, I just--

745
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,010
people can surprise you.

746
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,660
Today definitely reminded me that.

747
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,580
And like you've been saying, everybody deserves a choice

748
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,350
to be whoever they want to be--

749
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,840
that includes our enemies.

750
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,980
I think we should offer the cure to Cicada.
