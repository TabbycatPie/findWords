抱歉你卷进了这些事中

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,110
我相信你一定是个诚实的好姑娘

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,990
-我要消失了 -你不能这么做
- I'm gonna disappear. - But you can't do that!

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,630
-我不是在征求你的意见  -你不能消失
- I wasn't asking. - You can't disappear!

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,210
你得和我一起回家

等戈登警探找到杀害我父母的凶手
When Detective Gordon finds the man who killed my parents,

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,050
你得作证
you have to testify.

9

暂时留他俩一命
I want these two alive for now.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,910
你怎么敢用我神圣的母亲来对付我
How dare you use my sainted mother against me?

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,860
你要为此付出代价
You'll suffer for that.

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,210
快点道别吧
Say your good-byes quickly.

13

鲍勃会好好照顾你的

早上好
Good morning.

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,260
你起得早啊
You're up early.

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,050
我都没睡
I haven't made it to bed yet.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,490
据说有人撞见你和汤普金斯医生
Word is you got caught with Doc Thompkins

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,760
在更衣室里
in the locker room.

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,440
只是公事
Strictly business.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,120
-有菲什的消息吗  -没有
- Any word on Fish? - No.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,120
俱乐部被血洗了  没找到菲什
Club's all shot up, blood everywhere, no sign of Fish.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,530
要怪也是怪她自己
It's her own damn fault.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,860
她道上混的  知道这些风险
She played the game, she knew the risks.

36
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,670
抱歉  哈维  我知道你喜欢她
Sorry, Harv, I know you have a thing for her.

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,450
我谁都不喜欢
I don't got a thing for nobody.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,750
我喜欢我自己
My thing is for me.

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,310
如果说有谁能从那种困境中爬出来
If anyone can make it out of a scrape like that,

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,130
只有菲什  她指甲利着呢
it's Fish-- the woman's nails.

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,040
来吧  还有案子
Come on, we got a case.

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,350
好  什么案子
Yeah. What do we got?

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,070
为民除害型凶杀
Public service homicide.

44
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,340
被害人是个混蛋
Vic's a douche.

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,240
弗拉斯  这位是戈登
Flass. Gordon.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,680
戈登  这位是弗拉斯
Gordon. Flass.

47
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,000
弗拉斯在缉毒组工作
Flass works Narcotics.

48
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,880
所以这么珠光宝气  还穿一身肯定很贵
Hence the bling and the, uh, no doubt expensive

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,940
但看着很廉价的意大利西服
yet somehow cheap-looking Italian suit.

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,030
布洛克  还是乱穿衣服
Ah, Bullock, still dressing in the dark

51
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,510
闻起来像个酒馆妓女
and smelling like a taphouse whore.

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,910
弗拉斯的线人告诉他的尸体在这儿
One of Flass's connections tipped him off on the body.

53
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,740
跟戈登讲讲这小子吧
Why don't you tell Gordon about the kid.

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,590
平奇・利特菲尔德
Pinky Littlefield.

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,670
一个叫上城刺客组织的毒贩
Dealer from a crew known as the Uptown Assassins.

56
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,090
他在这个街区活动
He works this block. Well...

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
至少生前是
least he did.

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,770
他身上有毒品吗
Any drugs on him?

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,950
一点也没找到
Didn't find any.

60
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,470
要我猜  最多就是交易谈崩了
My big wild guess: deal gone bad.

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,950
这种人  早晚是这个下场
Kid like this, bound to happen sooner or later.

62
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,510
如我所说
Like I said,

63
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,090
为民除害型凶杀
public service homicide.

64
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,630
好了  如果你们不用人手把手教了
Well, boys, I've got another case I've got to attend to,

65
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,330
我还有别的案子要处理
so if you don't need any more hand-holding.

66
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,280
我送你出去
I'm gonna walk you out.

67
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,960
警员们可能找到了一个目击证人
Hey, unis think they may have found a witness.

68
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,220
夜间清洁工
Night janitor.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,470
他们正带他过来
They're bringing him over.

70
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,590
吉姆  温克勒先生
Jim, Mr. Winkler.

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,370
先生
Sir.

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,940
不用这么正式
No need for the formalities.

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,930
叫我利昂吧
Call me Leon.

74
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,730
利昂
Leon.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,970
很感谢你能站出来
We really appreciate you stepping forward.

76
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,420
我妻子路易莎常说  不挺身而出
My wife Louisa always says, if you don't step forward,

77
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,550
就是后退
you step back.

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,260
听起来是个睿智的女人
She sounds like a smart lady.

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,630
没错
Yes, she is.

80
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,450
要我录口供吗
So, uh, do I give a statement?

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,290
描述一下凶手
A description of the killer?

82
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,790
我不了解这种事的规矩
I'm not sure how this works.

83
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,740
能不能麻烦你来一趟警局
Would you be willing to come down to the precinct,

84
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,210
和速写师弄一张画像出来
work with a sketch artist?

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,210
这是抓住凶手最好的办法了
That really is the best way to catch the killer.

86
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,350
会帮我们大忙的
It'd be a huge help.

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,550
行啊
Of course.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,930
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

89
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,020
是  亲爱的  我还在警局呢
Yes, sweetheart, I'm still at the precinct.

90
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,640
我知道
I know.

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,010
当然了  是啊
Of course, yeah.

92
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,700
-好  -速写师来了吗
- Okay. - They send in the sketch artist yet?

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,030
没  还没来
No, not yet.

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,980
路易莎  我得挂了
Louisa, I have to go.

95
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,420
再见
Bye-bye.

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,500
但你确实看见凶手了  对吧
But you did see the killer, right?

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,540
是的  之前我也是这么跟警探说的
Uh, yes, that's what I told the detectives earlier.

98
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,690
抱歉  您是哪位
I'm sorry, who are you?

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,830
怎么会出这种事
How the hell did this happen?

100
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,570
房间内外的监控都被关掉了
Security cameras inside and outside the room were turned off.

101
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,320
爱德  知道是什么凶器了吗
Ed, you got any thoughts on the weapon?

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,070
什么东西能撞沉巨轮
What's strong enough to smash ships

103
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,360
却见不得日光
but still fears the sun?

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,780
别扯什么谜语了  爱德
Can it with the riddles, Ed.

105
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,380
我今天没这闲情逸致  以后也不会有
I don't have the patience today or any day.

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,950
-冰  -正确
- Ice. - Correct.

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,170
从伤口的大小来判断
Gauging by the small circumference of the wounds,

108
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,770
我认为凶器是一把冰锥
I believe the weapon is an ice pick.

109
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,080
碳钢材质  15厘米长
Carbon steel, six inches long.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,400
插得很深  以致压迫周围的组织
Driven in deep enough that it marked the surrounding tissue

111
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,250
使伤口形成了一个独特的六边形
with an imprint of a distinctive hexagonal handle.

112
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,750
你家厨房里一般用不到这个
It's not your standard kitchen fare.

113
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,510
还有个好玩的事  先生们
Fun fact, gentlemen:

114
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,830
温克勒先生的伤口
Mr. Winkler's wounds here

115
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,820
和今天早上被害人身上的完全一致
are the exact same as the wounds on the victim from this morning.

116
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,170
那个毒贩利特菲尔德
The drug dealer? Littlefield?

117
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,490
就是他  同一把凶器
Him. Same weapon.

118
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,530
这样说来凶手大概也一样
Same killer, one would suppose.

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,420
可恶
Damn it.

120
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,390
在警察地盘上杀人
Right in our house.

121
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,320
好了
Okay.

122
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,890
你叫什么
What is your name?

123
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,800
你明知故问
You know who I am.

124
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,890
就是走个程序
It's just a formality.

125
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,290
我
I...

126
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
再确认一下
like to be sure.

127
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,840
鲍勃  是吧
Bob, hmm?

128
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,670
是罗伯特的昵称吗
Is that short for Robert?

129
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,670
你有家人吗  罗伯特
You have any family, Robert?

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,150
两个可爱的女儿
Two lovely daughters.

131
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,400
我把你登记为玛利亚・梅赛德斯・穆尼
I'm putting you down as Maria Mercedes Mooney,

132
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,670
也就是菲什
aka Fish.

133
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,520
今天就是要让你诚心诚意悔过
We'll be extracting a very sincere apology from you today.

134
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,030
应该花不了多久
Shouldn't take too long.

135
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,900
你女儿多大了  罗伯特
How old are your girls, Robert?

136
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,880
我敢打赌  她们肯定都很丑
I bet you they're some ugly little creatures.

137
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,060
别这样  菲什
Now, come on, Fish.

138
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,700
没必要这么无礼
No call for rudeness.

139
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,520
只有我朋友才能叫我菲什  亲爱的
Only my friends call me Fish, darling.

140
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,410
而你和我
And you and I,

141
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,180
可不是朋友
we're not friends.

142
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,990
还不是
Yet.

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,090
哥谭
第一季  第十三集

144
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,850
你去带他下来
You go get him.

145
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,700
我得找下焚化炉的钥匙
I got to find the keys to the incinerator.

146
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,510
马可
Hey, Marco.

147
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,840
菲什・穆尼在哪
Where's... Fish... Mooney?

148
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,060
还有谁会相信我们警察能保护人民安全
How is anyone gonna trust us to keep them safe?

149
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,070
连警局里的人都保护不了
We can't protect people in our own house.

150
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,070
好消息是这地方都是罪犯
Upside is the place crawling with criminals,

151
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,500
可供选择的嫌犯非常多
so we got beaucoup suspects to choose from.

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,730
这算什么好消息
That's an upside?

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,940
监控录像被关掉了
Security cameras were turned off.

154
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,700
可能是警察干的
Could've been a cop.

155
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,490
很可能就是
Probably was.

156
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,470
你想都别这么想
You do not even think something like that.

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
一旦让外面那些人
The second that those guys out there

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,020
听到你认为凶手是警察
hear that you're looking at a cop,

159
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,680
他们一定会搞死你
they are gonna turn on you.

160
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,540
布洛克说得没错  你要是把矛头指向他们
Bullock's right; you start pointing fingers,

161
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,420
你的复职都会搭上
you could jeopardize your reinstatement.

162
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,820
要有确凿的证据
You need concrete evidence

163
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,790
才能考虑指责其他警察杀人
to even think of accusing another officer of murder.

164
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,250
我先去查值班警卫工作日志
I'll start with the guard duty logbook.

165
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,440
-吉姆  -温克勒是我的证人
- Jim... - Winkler was my witness.

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,900
我绝不会让凶手逍遥法外
No way I'm letting this ride.

167
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,740
我叫他来的  我一定找到凶手
I asked him to come in here, I'm gonna find his killer.

168
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,010
不管他是谁
No matter who it is.

169
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,850
一定要谨慎行事
Proceed with caution.

170
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,780
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,890
要我同意后才能采取行动
No big moves without my say-so.

172
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,330
我觉得
I do believe

173
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,170
这个街区我们已经转了两遍了  布鲁斯少爷
this is the second time we've been around this block, Master Bruce.

174
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,810
塞琳娜喜欢在这附近转悠
Selina likes to hang out here.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,500
值得反复找
It's worth doubling back.

176
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,800
再说了  你应该心满意足了
Besides, you got what you wanted.

177
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,970
我照你说的出了城
I went out of town like you asked.

178
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,960
去了好几周
For weeks.

179
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,180
这儿不是不安全吗
Yeah, well... It wasn't safe here, was it?

180
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,080
那些刺客又不是来抓我的
The assassins weren't after me.

181
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,290
他们要抓的是她
They were after her.

182
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,310
听好了  一旦有危险
Yeah, and we'll be back on that plane straight back to

183
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,750
你立马跟我上飞机回阿尔卑斯山
the bloody Alps the first sign of trouble, I tell you.

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,450
布鲁斯少爷
Master Bruce.

185
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,360
布鲁斯少爷  回车里来
Master Bruce, get back in the car now.

186
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,730
就沿着这条街走一圈
Can we walk around the block just once?

187
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,960
然后我就上车
Then I'll get back in the car.

188
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,210
求你了  阿尔弗雷德
Please, Alfred.

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,820
走一圈  就回家
Once around the block and then home.

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,800
谢谢你
Thank you.

191
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,610
你以后有的是时间
Got the rest of your life like that

192
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,430
被女人鬼迷心窍
to get whipped into a frenzy by the females.

193
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,270
怎么现在就这么着急开始了
I don't know why you want to start now.

194
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,590
不是这样的
It's not like that.

195
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,070
滚开
Out of my way.

196
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,820
艾薇
Ivy?

197
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,110
小心  布鲁斯少爷
Steady, Master Bruce.

198
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,810
她好像有兽疥癣
Looks like she's got the mange.

199
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,560
我说是谁呢
Look who it is.

200
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,380
亿万富翁布鲁斯・韦恩
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

201
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,410
你是谁  他保镖吗
Who are you, his bodyguard?

202
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,960
如果需要的话我就是  女士
If needs be, miss, yes.

203
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,300
包里什么东西
What's in the bag?

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,930
是给塞琳娜的
It's for Selina.

205
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,130
你见过她吗
Have you seen her?

206
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,550
当然  你愿意的话我可以帮你给她
Sure. I can give it to her if you want.

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
要不你帮我给她传个话
Perhaps you could pass on a message for me.

208
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,510
告诉她我在找她
Tell her I'm looking for her.

209
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,650
20块
20 bucks.

210
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,370
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

211
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,250
20块
20 bucks.

212
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,150
小姐  给
There we are, miss.

213
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,700
你的朋友还真讨人喜欢啊  布鲁斯少爷
Delightful friends you have, Master Bruce.

214
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
回家吧
Home.

215
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,240
你就这点能耐吗
That's all you got?

216
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,770
你快让我无聊死了  小子
You are gonna bore me to death, fella.

217
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,210
真是厉害
That's impressive.

218
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,390
想要不同的手法吗
Different strokes, eh?

219
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,180
就拿我来说吧
You know, me,

220
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,810
我就不能吃辣
I can't stand hot spicy food,

221
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,670
可我妻子非常喜欢吃辣
but my wife, you know, she loves it.

222
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,500
越辣越好
Hotter the better.

223
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,320
我们该从哪开始好呢
Now where, oh, where are we gonna begin?

224
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,520
锯掉一只手很让人崩溃啊
Now, taking off a hand, that's devastating.

225
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,010
可我发现
But I've found

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,110
把膝盖敲碎...
that taking out a knee...

227
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
没事吧  菲什
You okay, Fish?

228
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,330
这本工作日志少了一页
A page is missing from this logbook.

229
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,720
光是这一条
Now, that in and of itself

230
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,140
就足以把你开除出警队
is grounds for dismissal from the force.

231
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,340
我要问的是
So my question to you is

232
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,370
今早在审讯室外值勤的是谁
who was on guard duty outside of interrogation this morning?

233
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,520
不知道啊
No idea, man.

234
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,290
没人愿意交代
Nobody's talking.

235
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,760
他们在互相包庇
They're protecting their own.

236
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,490
或者他们就是不爽你
Or they just don't like you.

237
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,950
面对现实吧  哈维
Face it, Harvey.

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,150
杀死利昂・温克勒的凶手是个警察
Leon Winkler's killer is a cop.

239
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,780
证据不足
Not proven.

240
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,410
少来了  你了解这些人的
Come on, you know these guys.

241
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,690
你认识这些人很久了
You've known them since way back.

242
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,950
给我点筹码  给我个切入点
Give me some leverage. Give me an angle.

243
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,600
你真的想和凶手共事吗
You really want to work with a murderer?

244
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,850
有人在哥谭市警局被杀了
Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.

245
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,900
肯定要有人因此被解雇
Somebody's gonna get fired for this.

246
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,080
不会是我
Not me, pal.

247
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,890
格罗佛
Grover.

248
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,800
我们有个可靠的线人说
We got a reliable guy

249
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,940
是你撕掉了值班警卫工作日志上的那一页
says it was you pulled the page from the guard duty logbook.

250
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,420
不可能  你这话是哪听来的
No way. W-where did you get that?

251
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,480
-你听谁说的  -阿尔瓦雷斯说的
- Who said that? - Alvarez.

252
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,420
如果他这么说  那他就是在撒谎
If he said that, that son of a bitch is lying.

253
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,470
他为什么要撒谎
Why would he lie?

254
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,020
六年前  我和他妻子有过一腿
Look, six years ago, I had a thing with his wife, okay?

255
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,890
六年前
Six years ago.

256
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,170
他是个记仇的混蛋
He is a vindictive bastard.

257
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,130
这我们不管
Well, look, that's none of our business, huh?

258
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,960
从我们的立场来看
Look at it from our point of view.

259
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,060
我们得找到罪魁祸首
We got to find the culprit.

260
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,550
上头下令要我找出来
Brass demands one.

261
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,260
可不是我啊
But it wasn't me.

262
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,730
那是谁
Then who was it?

263
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,690
特拉华  有人看到特拉华吗
Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware?

264
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,320
看到他去车库了
Saw him go to the garage.

265
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,290
特拉华
Delaware.

266
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,310
你肯定会后悔的
You're gonna regret that.

267
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,050
今早在审讯室门外值勤的是你吧
You were guarding interrogation this morning, weren't you?

268
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,220
给我滚开
Screw off.

269
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,850
吉姆
Jim.

270
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,800
你在搞什么
What the hell are you doing?

271
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,110
你就不能悄悄地拘捕他
You couldn't bring him in here quietly,

272
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,590
然后带他去没人看到的地方吗
put him in some back room?

273
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,890
你这是要当众示威吗
You making some kind of statement?

274
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,260
没错
Damn right I am.

275
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,960
我警告过你了  你却当耳边风
I warned you and you didn't listen.

276
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,920
我有证据  和昨天早上在案发现场
I have evidence: the same drugs I found in Littlefield's shoe

277
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,400
我在利特菲尔德鞋里找到的毒品一样
at the crime scene yesterday morning.

278
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,440
这份证物属于一宗正在进行的秘密缉毒案件
That evidence is part of an ongoing undercover narco investigation.

279
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,060
你觉得我们会信这种鬼话吗
You expect us to believe that?

280
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,180
吉姆  缉毒组已经深入调查
Jim, narco's been knee-deep in

281
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,100
上城区毒品交易好几个月了
the Uptown drug trade for months.

282
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,310
我安排了很多卧底  他们为了这个案子
I've got a matrix of undercovers that have put their lives

283
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,220
都是拼上了命的
at stake for this investigation.

284
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,550
你刚刚那一出要是传出去
Your little stunt gets out,

285
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,340
整个行动都会暴露
you unravel the whole operation.

286
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,580
再说你的搜查也是非法的
Not to mention, the search was illegal.

287
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,130
那我们就无视特拉华与温克勒被杀的关联吗
So we're ignoring Delaware's involvement in Winkler's death?

288
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,280
是这样吗  警监
Is that what we're doing, Cap?

289
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
不是  但你这样不行  吉姆
No. But this isn't the way, Jim.

290
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,430
我要把案子交给内务处了
I'm turning over the case to Internal Affairs.

291
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,490
内务处
I.A.?

292
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,850
给那两个地下室里的酒鬼
Two old drunks in the basement.

293
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,590
你和布洛克将不再负责温克勒的凶杀案
You and Bullock are no longer investigating the Winkler murder.

294
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,020
那利特菲尔德的案子呢
What about the Littlefield murder?

295
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,930
等等  那是不是也属于
Or, wait, is that also a part of

296
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,040
一宗正在进行的缉毒案件
an ongoing narco investigation?

297
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,490
那案子归你  伙计  有什么需要尽管开口
All you, buddy. Let me know if you need any help.

298
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,110
抱歉发生了这种误会
I'm sorry about the confusion.

299
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,910
有什么事吗
Can I help you with something?

300
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,980
知道吗  柯林格小姐  最早的贺卡
Did you know, Miss Kringle, that the earliest greeting cards

301
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,070
可以追溯到15世纪的德国
dated back to Germany in the 1400s?

302
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,480
我挺忙的
I have a lot of work to do.

303
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,790
这是给你的
This is for you.

304
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,060
上面没什么奇怪的话吧
Doesn't say anything weird, does it?

305
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,000
完全没有  小姐
No, ma'am.

306
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,350
悠着点
Take it easy.

307
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,650
悠着点
Take it easy.

308
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,310
我没事  布奇
I'm fine, Butch.

309
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,600
给  敷敷
Here, try this.

310
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,510
你还好吗
You okay?

311
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,240
我快饿死了
I'm starving.

312
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,490
你真个汉子
You are one tough cookie.

313
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,950
谢谢你  布奇
Thank you, Butch.

314
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,090
听我说  我们得赶紧跑路了
Listen, we should hit the road.

315
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,690
估计不到一小时  法尔科内就会发现...
I figure we've got about an hour before Falcone...

316
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,300
找不到企鹅  我哪也不去
Oh, I'm not going anywhere until I find Penguin.

317
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,900
是他把莉莎的事告诉法尔科内的
He's the one that told Falcone about Liza.

318
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,640
老大  你大概不记得了
Boss, I don't know if you remember,

319
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,790
昨晚我们的人全被清光了
but as of last night, we don't have any men.

320
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,050
法尔科内会让全城的人找我们的
Falcone's gonna have the whole city looking for us.

321
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,740
不杀了企鹅  我哪也不会去的
I'm not going anywhere until I cut Penguin's throat.

322
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,240
一  二  三
One... two... three.

323
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,330
觉得如何  母亲
What do you think, Mother?

324
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,430
太美了
Oh, it's beautiful.

325
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,570
真有档次
So classy.

326
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,930
好像歌剧院一样
Like an opera house.

327
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,200
大吊灯
A chandelier.

328
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,530
和家里似的
Like home.

329
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,240
有人落下了一条丝巾
Someone left a scarf.

330
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,640
多衬我的裙子啊
It's beautiful with my dress.

331
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,870
谁捡到就是谁的
Finders keepers.

332
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,200
现在你是这家夜店的老板了吗
And now you are in charge of this club?

333
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,750
你把我准备的惊喜都毁了
Spoiled my surprise.

334
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,390
别这样  小可爱
No. Oh, no, no, liebchen.

335
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,500
别生气啊
No, don't be angry. No.

336
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,740
真是个好消息
Such good news.

337
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,240
我儿子有了自己的夜店
My boy has a club.

338
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,630
将会有一家夜店
Will have a club.

339
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,730
现在还有一些问题没有解决
There's still a few loose ends to tie up,

340
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,780
但是很快它就会是我的了
but... soon it will be mine.

341
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,640
我太为你感到骄傲了
I am so proud of you...

342
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,970
简直无法言喻
I could spit.

343
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,870
听着  吉姆  有些事我得告诉你
Listen, Jim, there's something I got to tell you.

344
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,420
几年前  弗拉斯和他的人
A few years ago, Flass and his people

345
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,780
开始逮捕毒贩  侵占他们的藏货屋
started busting drug dealers, taking over their stash houses,

346
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,180
然后拿来自己经营
running them themselves.

347
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,600
现在
Now?

348
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,390
你现在才告诉我
You tell me this now?

349
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,710
我是随机应变的那种
Look, I respond to crises as they arise.

350
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,390
我不像你那样提前做计划
I'm not a forward planner like you.

351
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,040
我当时没告诉你
I didn't tell you then

352
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,450
因为我怕你又头脑发热起来
because I didn't want to get you all riled you up,

353
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,130
现在我告诉你是想阻止你
but I'm telling you now because I want you to stop.

354
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,990
弗拉斯是有人的
Flass is protected.

355
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,140
谁
By who?

356
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,740
有权势的人
Serious people.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,120
很高层  大财主
Really high up. Big money.

358
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,450
说不定  局长也有份
For all I know, the commissioner gets a piece, too.

359
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,270
你敢惹弗拉斯  就连阿卡姆也别想回了
You mess with Flass, you can forget going back to Arkham.

360
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,250
这些家伙可不是闹着玩的
These guys do not play.

361
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,450
那些藏货屋
These stash houses--

362
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,950
你能查到它们的地址吗
think you can get me a location on them?

363
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,940
你没有听我刚才的话吗
Did you not hear a word I just said?

364
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,310
藏货屋可以给我们将弗拉斯与利特菲尔德
The stash houses could give us evidence linking Flass

365
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,310
被杀关联起来的证据
to Littlefield's murder.

366
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,310
咱们用利特菲尔德拿下他
We nail him for Littlefield,

367
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,750
也就可以拿下温克勒的案子
we can nail him for Winkler.

368
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,620
我不能坐视不管  哈维
I can't let it be, Harvey.

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,130
你早该明白了
You should know that by now.

370
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,570
米克  是哈维
Mick, it's Harv.

371
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,810
还记得你和唐尼在搞的那事吗
You know that thing you and Donnie were working on?

372
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,060
弗拉斯那个
The Flass thing?

373
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,600
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

374
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,720
做藏货屋的好地方
Prime spot for a stash house.

375
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,770
是呀
Yeah.

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,900
特拉华
Delaware,

377
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,920
把盒子交出来
hand over the boxes.

378
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
你就是学不乖  对吧
You don't learn, do you?

379
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,050
给我滚开
Get out of my face.

380
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,790
没必要动粗啊  先生们
No need to rough each other up, gentlemen.

381
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,310
我有搜查令
I got a warrant.

382
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,700
给了我们搜查与扣押的权利
Giving us the legal right to search and seizure.

383
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,190
看来这间仓库是上城刺客的
Seems this warehouse was being used as a home base

384
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,940
主基地
by the Uptown Assassins.

385
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,230
你指望我们相信你有一张签署过的搜查令
You expect us to believe you got a signed warrant

386
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,950
来收缴你自己的藏货屋吗
to clear your own stash house?

387
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,450
是局长下的令
On the commissioner's request.

388
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,150
法官签署过的
Signed by Judge Bam-Bam.

389
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,000
看来你不占理啊
Guess you don't have a leg to stand on...

390
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,540
凶案组的
homicide.

391
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,380
-咱们下一步怎么办  -下一步
- So what's our next step? - Next step?

392
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,560
我们没有证据证明弗拉斯与贩毒或两桩凶案有关
We got nothing to tie Flass to the drugs or the murders.

393
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,990
一桩凶案
Murder.

394
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,570
就一起
Just one.

395
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,090
内务处刚判定温克勒的死为自杀
Internal Affairs just ruled Winkler's death as a suicide.

396
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,830
他们准备将尸体还给他妻子了
They're releasing the body to his wife.

397
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,480
利昂是那么快乐
Leon was so very happy.

398
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,110
这不可能的...
This just can't be right. Can't be...

399
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,150
自杀
A suicide?

400
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,710
他用冰锥捅了自己的后背
He stabbed himself in the back with an ice pick?

401
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,360
这太荒谬了
That's absurd!

402
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,260
这么快就出结果说明局长插手了
A ruling this quick means the commissioner was involved.

403
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,180
去他的局长
Screw the commissioner.

404
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,800
你追查下去会危及我们所有人的工作
Going forward with this puts all of our jobs at risk.

405
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,930
听着  我想帮你  吉姆
Look, I want to help you, Jim.

406
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,270
哥谭市警局里是有人想帮你的
There are people here in GCPD who want to help you.

407
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,620
-那他们为什么不帮呢  -他们帮了
- So why don't they? - They have.

408
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,180
我也帮了
I have.

409
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,410
而我们也吸取了教训
And we learned the hard way.

410
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,770
对弗拉斯这种人  光说说可不够
With men like Flass, you need more than words.

411
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,180
要有结果
You need results.

412
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,650
而这次这是不可能的了
And that's not gonna happen this time around.

413
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,370
所以帮所有人一个忙
So do us all a favor

414
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,400
去查下一个案子吧
and move on to the next vic.

415
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,980
拜托了
Please.

416
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,910
你要去哪里
Where you going?

417
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
一小时后回来
Back in an hour.

418
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,660
听听  真是经典啊
Listen to this. This is classic.

419
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,230
够了  拜托
Stop it. Come on.

420
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,140
有什么的
Come on.

421
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,180
"亲爱的柯林格小姐
"Dear Miss Kringle,

422
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,370
你的眼睛如青草一般翠绿
your eyes are as green as a meadow.

423
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,250
你的微笑如太阳一般耀眼
Your smile is as bright as the sun.

424
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,040
你的肌肤如雪花一般洁白
Your skin is as white as a snowflake.

425
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,870
看来你的生活非常有趣"
It seems like your life is fun."

426
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,070
-不是吧  -你好啊
- Really? - Oh, hey!

427
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,280
作者本人来了哦
It's the writer himself. Whew.

428
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,140
写得可真不错啊  变态
It's a real piece of work you got there, perv.

429
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,990
我劝你还是别辞了工作去干这个吧
I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you.

430
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,430
收到
Roger, dodger.

431
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,470
-收到  -别说了
- Roger, dodger? - Stop it.

432
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,860
真是个怪胎
What a creep.

433
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,040
一二三  一二三
One, two, three. One, two, three.

434
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,420
一二三  一...
One, two, three. One...

435
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,970
你终于掌握了
Now... now you are getting it.

436
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,610
你块头这么大  还真是优雅
You are so graceful for such a big man.

437
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,510
他是不是很优雅呀  奥斯瓦尔德
Isn't he graceful, Oswald?

438
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,010
是啊  母亲
Yes, Mother.

439
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,760
吉姆
Jim.

440
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,220
欢迎
Welcome.

441
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,520
请吧
Come in.

442
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,640
派对上又来了一位帅哥
Another handsome man at the party.

443
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,470
我真幸运
I am so lucky.

这位是吉姆・戈登
This is Jim Gordon,

445
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,910
我和您提过的那位警探朋友
the detective friend I was telling you about.

446
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,480
真高兴见到奥斯瓦尔德的朋友
Oh. So nice to meet a friend of Oswald's.

447

我是格特鲁德・卡佩普特

448
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,330
很高兴见到您  卡佩普特太太
Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Kapelput.

449
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,710
母亲  吉姆和我还有要事得办
Mother, Jim and I have very important business.

450
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,060
不嘛  真遗憾  太遗憾了
No. Oh, sad. Oh, how sad.

451
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,780
现在庆祝未免有点早了吧
A little soon to be celebrating, don't you think?

452
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,990
别傻站着啊
Well, don't just stand there.

453
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,820
坐吧
Sit.

454
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,080
不会说很久的
This won't take long.

455
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,700
我坚持  坐下
I insist. Sit.

456
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,580
我很高兴你打电话给我  吉姆・戈登
I'm so very glad you called, Jim Gordon.

457
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,690
我们太久没见面了
It's been far too long since we've seen each other.

458
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,260
我还想你是不是忘了我了
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.

459
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,340
我需要你帮个忙
I need a favor.

460
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,940
你对一位名叫阿诺德・弗拉斯的
Do you know anything about a narcotics detective

461
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,430
缉毒警探有所了解吗
by the name of Arnold Flass?

462
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,010
我听过这个名字
I've heard the name.

463
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,330
我因为一起凶杀案正在调查他和他的人
I'm investigating him and his crew for murder,

464
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,960
但是我碰壁了
but I've hit a wall.

465
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,620
他的关系网太强大了
He's too well-connected.

466
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,760
我想着既然马罗尼在经营毒品生意
I figured since Maroni runs the drug trade,

467
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,340
也许你能找到有弗拉斯把柄的人
maybe you could find somebody with the goods on Flass?

468
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,100
-但是...  -嘘  不用再说了
- But... - Shh. Say no more.

469
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,750
这个忙我帮了
Favor is done.

470
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,630
我去打几个电话
I'll make some calls.

471
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,450
我欠你的该怎么还呢
And what do I owe you in return?

472
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,980
朋友间是互不相欠的  傻瓜
Friends don't owe friends, silly.

473
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,200
而是出于意愿互相帮助
They just do favors because they want to.

474
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,430
因为是朋友嘛
Because they're friends.

475
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,270
-不能有人受伤  -当然
- Nobody gets hurt. - Of course.

476
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,500
不会有人受伤
No one gets hurt.

477
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,150
来点香槟
Champagne.

478
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,850
天哪
Oh, dear me.

479
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,420
发生了什么
What happened here?

480
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,350
通知法尔科内
Call Falcone.

481
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,190
那还用说
No kidding.

482
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,060
谢谢你们
Thank you.

483
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,330
谢谢你们  伙计们  棒极了
Thank you, boys. Lovely.

484
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,550
不要  我还在跳呢  安静
No. I-I am dancing still. Shh.

485
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,040
-你们可以走了  -怎么就让他们走了
- You may go. - Oh, why you make them go?

486
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,800
盖布  你去帮助我的好朋友吉姆的时候
Gabe, on your way to help my dear friend Jim,

487
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,950
能好心顺便送我母亲回家吗
could you be a gentleman and take Mother home?

488
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,260
当然  老大
Sure thing, boss.

489
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,550
来吧  卡太太
Come on, Mrs. K.

490
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,920
一座宫殿
A palace.

491
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,760
我儿子有一座宫殿
My boy has a palace.

492
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,070
真是个好孩子
Such a good boy.

493
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,850
别担心
Don't worry.

494
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,360
我会回来的
I will be back.

495
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,920
女士们先生们  朋友们
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,

496
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,650
来自世界各地的名流们
celebrities from around the world,

497
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,000
我叫奥斯瓦尔德・科波特
my name is Oswald Cobblepot.

498
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,630
终于等到了这一天
Here we are at last.

499
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,780
我带着深深的诚挚和喜悦
It is with deep and sincere pleasure

500
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,370
欢迎你们来到我新夜总会的
that I bid you welcome to the official grand opening

501
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,080
盛大开业典礼
of my newest night spot, the...

502
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,830
不错啊
Not bad.

503
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,430
我觉得你的表现力得更强势点
I do believe you need to project more.

504
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,230
好让观众更加兴奋
Just to create a bit more excitement for the audience.

505
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,810
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

506
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,910
欢迎来到菲什・穆尼夜店
welcome to Fish Mooney's!

507
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,370
就像那样
Like that.

508
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,210
什么样的怪人会跟自己下棋
What kind of weirdo plays chess with himself?

509
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,290
你不是有个管家陪你玩的吗
Don't you have a butler to do that kind of stuff with you?

510
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,590
他在做午饭
He's making lunch.

511
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,170
我收到你的信息了
I got your message.

512
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,080
我很高兴你没事
I'm glad you're safe.

513
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,630
阿尔弗雷德逼我出了城
Alfred made me go out of town.

514
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,760
瑞士  我们在那里有座房子
Switzerland. We have a house there.

515
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,030
算是座牧屋吧
Chalet, I guess.

516
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,120
牧屋
A chalet?

517
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,490
实际上就是座房子
It's basically a house.

518
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,650
你干吗要见我
Why did you want to see me?

519
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,130
我们是朋友  对吧
We're friends, aren't we?

520
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,260
你满世界开着车找我
You've been driving around looking for me,

521
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,000
托人捎信  怎么了
sending messages. What's up?

522
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,410
我有个礼物要给你
I got you a present.

523
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,770
看上去很像我们去的那个瑞士城镇
It looks like the town we stayed in.

524
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,500
谢谢你
Thank you.

525
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,530
还有  我想问你...想不想
Also, I wanted to know if, um... if you wanted to stay here

526
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,500
住在我家
in my house.

527
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,600
为什么
Why?

528
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,330
我觉得我们能互相帮助
I figure we can help each other out.

529
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,240
你能帮我找到杀害我父母的凶手
You can help me find the man who killed my parents,

530
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,480
我可以给你个更好的地方住
and I can give you a better place to live.

531
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,050
这里怎么就更好了
What's better about it?

532
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,690
听着  小子  别激动过头了
Listen kid... chill.

533
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
我来是想叫你别再来找我麻烦了
I came here to tell you to stop hassling me.

534
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,030
找你麻烦
Hassling you?

535
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,570
对
Yeah.

536
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,060
你开始招我烦了
You're beginning to bug me.

537
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,480
我们不是朋友吗
I thought we were friends.

538
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,320
听着  我撒谎了
Listen, I lied.

539
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,080
我没看到是谁杀了你父母
I... didn't see who killed your parents.

540
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,530
我没看到他的脸
I didn't see his face.

541
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,720
我不明白
I don't understand.

542
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,780
我撒谎是为了不被关进少管所
I lied so I wouldn't get locked up in juvie.

543
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,670
你给我买礼物  捎信  或是套近乎
So it's no use buying me presents or sending me messages

544
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,560
都是没用的
or trying to hang out.

545
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,990
毫无意义的  因为我帮不了你
There's no point because I can't help you.

546
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,310
平奇・利特菲尔德两周没付钱了
Pinky Littlefield was light two weeks running.

547
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,120
不付钱是要付出代价的
If you don't pay up, there's consequences.

548
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,830
弗拉斯杀他  是为了震慑他人
Flass killed him to send a message.

549
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,110
求你  我就知道这么多了
But please, please! I swear that's all I know.

550
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,950
你确定
You sure?

551
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,770
我发誓啊
I swear, man, I swear!

552
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,290
我相信你
I believe you.

553
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,280
但我需要更切实的证据
But I think I'll need something a bit more tangible.

554
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,970
不要啊  求你了
No, no, no! Please, no!

555
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,990
不要  求你
No! No! Please, no!

556
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,660
我发誓啊  我发誓
I swear, man! I swear!

557
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,730
现在觉得演艺圈好混吗
How are you liking show business now?

558
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,910
求您  穆尼女士
Please, Miss Mooney.

559
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,840
您这是在犯下错误
You're making a mistake.

560
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,150
我求您  让我说句话
I-I beg of you, let me speak.

561
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,630
我知道我们有分歧
I know we've had our differences.

562
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
我们可以联手
We could combine our forces.

563
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,660
想想我是怎么骗过所有人的吧
Think how'd we fool everyone.

564
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,380
我跟你联手吗
Me... work with you?

565
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,340
是我捡到了你
I found you.

566
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,030
是我成就了你
I made you.

567
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,850
你走进来的时候  不过是个心怀大志的小人物
When you walked in here, you were a sad little wannabe.

568
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,330
你还记得吗  布奇
Remember that, Butch?

569
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,720
你是那么害怕
You were so afraid.

570
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,150
抖得厉害
Shook like a leaf in fall.

571
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,990
你就是个下人
You're a servant.

572
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,450
伞童
An umbrella boy.

573
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,630
你就是...无名小卒
You're... A nobody.

574
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,890
我这个无名小卒还是每次都高你一招
This nobody still outfoxed you at every turn.

575
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,770
我一直都是法尔科内的人
I was working for Falcone the whole time!

576
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,820
你却完全没发现
And you didn't have the sense to see it!

577
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,550
你们好
Hello.

578
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,830
看来今天大家都想来穆尼的场子呢
Seems like Mooney's is the place to be today.

579
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,470
快走  走啊
Come on, come on!

580
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,950
-不要  -走吧
- No! - Come on!

581
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,240
走啊
Go, go, go!

582
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,530
来
Here.

583
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,300
你得走了
You got to go!

584
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,750
我拖住他们
I'll slow them down.

585
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,620
-不行  -走吧
- No, no! - Go!

586
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,660
又见了
Hello again.

587
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,290
她哪去了
Where is she?

588
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,310
怎么样  姑娘们
What do you think, girls?

589
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,700
要杀了他
Should we kill him...

590
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,710
还是带回家玩玩
or should we take him home to play with?

591
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,910
尼格玛先生
Mr. Nygma?

592
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,230
柯林格小姐
Miss Kringle.

593
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,550
打扰你了吗
Am I interrupting?

594
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,500
是的  我在清除我外卖里的洋葱
Yes. I'm surgically removing the onions from my takeout,

595
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,740
如果你没别的事...
so if you don't mind...

596
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,010
尼格玛先生  我欠你个道歉
Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology.

597
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,170
卡片不是我给阿诺德的
I didn't give Arnold the card.

598
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,280
是他自己在我桌上看到的
He found it in my desk.

599
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,710
他这人的幽默感很奇怪
He has a strange sense of humor.

600
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,930
我觉得你的卡片
I thought your card was...

601
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,400
很
very...

602
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,210
贴心
thoughtful.

603
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,460
算是吧
I guess.

604
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,730
总之  抱歉
Anyway, I'm sorry.

605
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,170
柯林格小姐  你愿意...
Miss Kringle, would you...

606
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,610
不不  别再说话了
No, no, no, no, no. Please, don't say anything else.

607
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,810
别说了
Just, please.

608
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,170
有希望哦
There's hope.

609
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,730
这是什么
What's this?

610
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,040
凶器和特拉华供出弗拉斯杀人的录音带
Murder weapon and a tape of Delaware rolling on Flass.

611
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,500
那小子挺滑头
Smart cookie, that one.

612
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,880
弗拉斯把冰锥给他  让他扔掉
Flass gave him the ice pick to throw away.

613
