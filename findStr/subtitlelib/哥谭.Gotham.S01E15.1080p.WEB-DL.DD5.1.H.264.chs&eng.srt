我向你们保证  小子们

So, what is this, our third date?

48
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,690
我想是的
I believe that's correct.

49
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,520
约会三次了  我还没去过你的公寓
Three dates, and I still haven't been to your apartment.

50
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,780
你对我公寓的哪个房间比较感兴趣

-我也说不好  厨房怎么样  -很小

60
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,180
今早才确定下来的
I heard this morning.

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,350
我不想毁了晚餐  一直谈这事
I didn't want to spoil dinner with a whole big discussion about it.

62
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,460
这事怎么会毁了晚餐
Why would it spoil dinner?

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,950
我要来哥谭市警局工作了
I'm coming to work at the GCPD.

64

我是你们的新法医

65
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,700
你开玩笑的吧
You're kidding.

66
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,210
太好了
That's great.

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,810
真的吗
Is it?

68
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,840
当然  就是我建议你来警局工作的
Of course. I mean, I was the one that suggested you work there.

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,020
对  可是现在成真了
Yes, but now it's real.

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,030
很好啊
So? Good.

71
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,750
好不好到时就知道了
We'll see, won't we?

72
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,950
晚安
Good night.

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,090
高中英语老师

75
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,930
他身上有跟上一个被害人完全相同的手术切口
Same exact surgical incisions as our last victim.

76
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,960
猜猜他没有肾上腺的几率有多大
What are the odds he's got no adrenal glands?

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,690
凶手拿肾上腺做什么
So, what's he doing with them?

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,190
为什么
Why?

79
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,580
你怎么回事  救我

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,050
那样不好
It wouldn't be right.

88
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,850
当然
No. Of course.

89
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,810
我没事的  阿尔弗雷德
I'll be fine, Alfred.

90
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,860
你不用担心
You don't have to worry.

91
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,990
谁说我担心了
Who said I was worried?

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,980
我天黑前就回来
I'll be back before dark.

93
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,420
我之前去走过这条路
I've been on this hike before, you know.

94
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,550
但都有你父亲陪
Not without your father.

95
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,670
过来
Come here.

96
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,790
他会赞同的

97
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,050
你这样延续传统
Carrying on the tradition like this.

98
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,590
我父亲和我会待一夜
My father and I stayed overnight.

99
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,890
我们会早起看日出
We woke up early to watch the sunrise.

100
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,440
这不一样
It's not the same.

101
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,130
那明年吧
Well, maybe next year, then.

102
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,810
去吧
Well, off you go then.

103
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,210
然后  最糟糕的是
And then, the worst of it...

104
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,170
马罗尼把我锁在一辆汽车里
Maroni had me locked me inside a sedan

105
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,970
想活活挤死我
and tried to crush me alive.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,410
您也能想象我多么担心
So, well, you can imagine my concern.

107
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,880
马罗尼不是那种说放手就放手的人
Maroni's not a man to let things go,

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,410
我担心他会来报复我
and I fear he will come after me in retaliation.

109
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,520
你不打算把这里收拾一下吗
Were you planning to clean up the place?

110
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,270
什么
What?

111
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,720
当然  如果您希望的话
Oh, um, I... I can... if you like.

112
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,900
需要收拾一下
It needs it.

113
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,310
那是血迹吗
Is that blood?

114
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,690
大概吧
Perhaps.

115
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,610
但法尔科内阁下
But Don Falcone...

116
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,720
顺便
While you're at it...

117
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,620
也重新装潢一下
maybe you could do something about the design.

118
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,390
装潢
The design?

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,910
这里一股菲什・穆尼的气息
It reeks of Fish Mooney.

120
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,890
你觉得灯怎么样
What do you think about the lamps?

121
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,110
法尔科内阁下  您或许没听清
Don Falcone, maybe you didn't hear me.

122
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,470
我需要您的保护
I need your protection.

123
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,800
马罗尼一定会想杀我的
Maroni will surely try and kill me.

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,580
嗯
Yes.

125
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,340
灯得换掉
The lamps should go.

126
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,330
法尔科内阁下  求您
Don Falcone, please!

127
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,970
马罗尼想活剥了我  您却让我重装修
Maroni wants my scalp, and you'd have me redecorate.

128
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,030
这间夜店能挣大钱
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

129
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,320
没有钱  我们就没有势力
Without money, we lose influence.

130
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,900
没有势力  我们就失去控制权
Without influence, we lose control.

131
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,500
没有控制权  马罗尼一定会杀死你
And without control, Maroni killing you is no longer a hypothetical.

132
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,280
毫无疑问
It's a foregone conclusion.

133
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,620
所以我要重开这间夜店
That's why I want to reopen it.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,580
你来打理
Under your care.

135
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,820
我可以拥有这间夜店吗
I can have the club?

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,500
这归我了
It's mine?

137
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,550
这是你应得的
You've earned it.

138
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,680
你再也不用偷偷摸摸  监视马罗尼了
Your days of sneaking around, spying on Maroni, are over.

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,480
你现在是我的人了
You're with me now.

140
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,440
光明正大
Publicly.

141
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,770
以后一切都不一样了
Things are gonna be much different.

142
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,730
好好收拾下这里  重新开张
So spruce up the place, get it open.

143
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,020
至于马罗尼  我来处理
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

144
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,850
那是什么
What do you got?

145
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,920
被害人教英语的学校的年鉴
Year book where the victim taught English.

146
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,440
告诉你
Tell you one thing--

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,830
我当年上高中时女生可没这么漂亮
girls didn't look like this when I was back in high school.

148
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,900
别激动
Easy...

149
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,010
就是说说
I'm just sayin'.

150
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,280
你好啊  吉姆
Hi, Jim.

151
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,080
小莱  你还记得哈维吧
Lee. You remember Harvey, right?

152
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,520
你好啊  小莱
Hi, Lee.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,180
小莱是我们的新法医
Lee's our new M.E.

154
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,200
开玩笑吧
You're joking.

155
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,860
-没有  -太好了  你们见过了
- No. - Oh, good. You've met.

156
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,790
我和戈登警探已经认识了

166
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,840
你运气真差啊  兄弟
You have no luck at all, do you, brother?

167
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
你什么意思
What do you mean?

168
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,510
找到个那么好的姑娘
You find a fine lady like that,

169
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,850
结果她来和你一起工作了
and she comes to work with you in the same building?

170
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,790
真是太可惜了
It's a damn shame.

171
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,490
为什么
Why?

172
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,170
办公室恋情总是以眼泪收场  眼泪
Office romance always ends in tears-- tears!

173
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,410
不会变成那样的
It's not gonna be like that.

174
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,670
相信我  我有体会
Trust me. I know.

175
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,880

我的上帝姥姥
Holy Mother Mary.

178
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,500
-你找到了  -简直活灵活现

179
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,590
就是他  就是他  泳池的那个人
That's him. That's him. That's the guy from the pool.

180
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,100
他叫杰拉尔德・克兰
His name is Gerald Crane.

181
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,630
是名生物学老师
He's a biology teacher.

182
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,510
学校还有几小时才放学
School doesn't let out for hours.

183
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,320
走吧
Let's go.

184
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,090
我是凯利
I'm Kelly.

185
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,800
菲什
Fish.

186
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,090
鱼[菲什]
Fish?

187
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,620
没错  就是菲什
That's what I said: Fish.

188
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,210
那么  我们在哪
So... where are we?

189
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,460
这是什么地方
What is this place?

190
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,410
有人觉得是监狱
Some people think it's a prison.

191
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,460
有人觉得是地狱
Some think it's Hell.

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,610
我大多数时候只是觉得冷
I just think it's cold, mostly.

193
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,890
早餐
Breakfast.

194
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,310
不
No.

195
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,040
得让老大先吃
You got to let the boss eat first.

196
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,010
大家叫他梅斯
People call him Mace.

197
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,610
他是管事的
He's the one in charge, hmm?

198
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,570
好了  好了
Okay. Okay.

199
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,740
杰拉尔德有天突然打电话说不来了
Gerald called in one day and said he wasn't coming in.

200
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,830
我再就没有他消息了
That's the last I heard of him.

201
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,460
让我猜猜  这是大概三周前的事
Let me guess, that was about three weeks ago?

202
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,700
-是啊  -邻居说他是那时搬的家
- Yeah. - That's when neighbors said he up and moved out.

203
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,370
警员搜查过了  什么都没有
Unis searched the place. Nothing.

204
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,380
关于克兰你能告诉我们些什么
So what can you tell us about Crane?

205
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,180
他是个好老师
He was a good teacher.

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,280
很专注  还是位好父亲
Focused. And a good father.

207
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,480
他很关心他儿子  乔纳森
He was very protective of his son Jonathan.

208
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,740
但是他也很安静  阴郁
But he could be quiet, too. Somber.

209
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,480
应该和他妻子有关
Think it had to do with his wife--

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,400
她六七年前死掉了
she died six or seven years ago.

211
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,650
她怎么死的
She died? How?

212
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,230
车祸
Car accident.

213
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,100
克兰有没有谈过恐惧或是恐惧症
Did Crane ever talk about fear or phobias?

214
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,840
怎么了
Why?

215
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,060
有人针对恐惧症患者吗
Is someone targeting phobics?

216
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,740
是的
Yeah.

217
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,300
杀害他们吗
Killing them?

218
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,300
你能想到什么吗
Does this mean something to you?

219
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,590
那些被害人
These victims,

220
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,680
他们有没有丢失肾上腺
were they missing their adrenal glands?

221
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,840
你怎么知道的
How'd you know that?

222
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,570
这是一篇杰拉尔德
This was an academic paper

223
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,090
几个月前写的学术论文
that Gerald wrote a few months ago.

224
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,780
他拜托我帮他校对
He asked me to proof it for him.

225
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,840
杰拉尔德有个理论
See, Gerald had a theory

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,680
说恐惧是人类进化中的瑕疵
that fear was an evolutionary flaw in humans.

227
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,140
战争  强奸  偷窃  谋杀
War, rape, theft, murder--

228
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,630
都因恐惧而起
it was all caused by fear.

229
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,780
他十分沉迷于其中
He was obsessed with it.

230
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,180
那么克兰杀了那些人
So Crane killed these people

231
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,270
并取走肾上腺是为了测试一个理论
and took their glands to test a theory?

232
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,000
不  杰拉尔德并不想证明他对恐惧的观点是对的
No... Gerald wasn't trying to prove he was right about fear.

233
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,920
他想要治愈自己的恐惧
He was trying to cure himself of it.

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,450
克兰治愈恐惧的方法是
Crane's idea of curing fear

235
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,190
自己进行预防注射
was to inoculate himself against it.

236
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,410
-就像治疗疾病那样  -没错
- Like a disease? - Exactly.

237
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,130
但是为了这么做
But in order to do so,

238
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,440
他得收集到引发恐惧的浓缩激素
he needed a condensed source of the hormones that cause fear.

239
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,790
恐惧症患者
Phobics.

240
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,590
克兰掠夺人的恐惧吗
Crane's preying on them?

241
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,870
以恐吓来强化人的恐惧
Spiking their fear by scaring them

242
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,610
然后为了提取激素而杀了他们
and then killing them in order to harvest the hormones?

243
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,700
见鬼
Damn!

244
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,350
这种东西他需要多少
How much of this stuff does he need?

245
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,300
什么意思
What do you mean?

246
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,800
他还要杀多少人
How many more people is he gonna kill?

247
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,780
当然  问得好
Oh. Of course. Good question.

248
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,080
我想这要取决于他的害怕程度吧
Depends on how scared he is, I guess.

249
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,090
他害怕什么
What's he scared of?

250
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,650
在斯科蒂的恐惧互助组里
In Scottie's phobia support group,

251
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,540
他说他害怕失败
he said he was afraid of failure.

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,080
谁不害怕失败  肯定还有别的恐惧
Who isn't? It's gotta be something else.

253
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,490
-你听说了吗  -听说什么
- Did you hear? - Hear what?

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,280
我们这儿来了一位新法医
That we got a new medical examiner.

255
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,090
比上一任好太多了
Much better than the old one.

256
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,710
而且她很香
And she smells nice.

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,310
看到没  吉姆  这就有情敌了
See, Jim? Competition already.

258
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,510
看看这个
Look at this.

259
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,700
克兰准备了两例接种规程
Crane developed protocols for two inoculations,

260
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,430
他自己和另一个人  对象B
himself and somebody else-- Subject B.

261
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,890
不知道那是谁
I wonder who that is.

262
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,170
爸爸
Dad...

263
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,410
爸爸
Dad?

264
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,150
你没事吧
You okay?

265
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,700
我好极了
I'm glorious.

266
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,190
成功了  乔纳森
It's working, Jonathan.

267
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,470
我说过会成功的
I said it would.

268
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,220
就要轮到你了
And it's almost your turn.

269
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,650
你将会永远摆脱恐惧
You will be free of fear forever.

270
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,160
我会把你治好的
You'll be cured.

271
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,790
准备好了吗  乔纳森
Are you ready, Jonathan?

272
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,390
准备好了吗  儿子
Are you ready, son?

273
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,620
-谢谢你邀我来  -这是我的荣幸
- Thank you for having me. - My pleasure.

274
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,010
我们是朋友吧
We're friends, right?

275
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,970
-当然是  -那我就不说客套话了
- Of course. - Then let me talk to you as a friend.

276
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,850
你想一起吃午餐  一起走走
You want to have lunch, take a walk,

277
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,070
我很乐意
I'm happy to.

278
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,970
但光凭三明治和散步是无法阻止我杀企鹅的
But a sandwich and a stroll ain't gonna keep me from killing Penguin.

279
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,520
那个卑鄙小人死定了
That little rat is dead.

280
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,390
那好吧
So be it.

281
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,550
科波特先生  这样行吗
Mr. Cobblepot, will this do?

282
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,100
我们不上这酒
We will not be serving that.

283
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,860
不不不
No, no, no.

284
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,160
我让你们丢掉帘子  不是再挂回去
I said lose the drapes, not tie them back!

285
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,660
还有十个小时就开张了
We're opening in ten hours!

286
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,560
-抱歉  -老大
- Sorry. - Hey, boss...

287
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,560
做好了
They're ready.

288
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,980
{\an8}奥斯瓦尔德夜店

289
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,210
刚打出来的
Still warm from the printer.

290
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,830
今晚不能有差错  盖布
Nothing can go wrong tonight, Gabe.

291
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,230
今晚不止是开幕仪式
This is more than an opening.

292
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,160
更是我的重要时刻
It's my moment.

293
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,060
请帖印得非常好
They're perfect.

294
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,650
把请帖送去给名单上的每一个人
Take these to everybody on the list.

295
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,030
除了这张
But not this one.

296
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,370
这张我要亲自去送
This one I want to deliver in person.

297
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,310
我只想说句话
I just want a word.

298
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,030
我没有恶意
I mean no harm.

299
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,850
别再往前走了
That's close enough.

300
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,840
没有恶意吗
No harm, huh?

301
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
你是这里的老大吗
So, you're the boss in here?

302
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,680
是的
I am.

303
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
为什么是你
Why you?

304
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,140
这里有不少大块头啊
I see a lot of tough guys around here.

305
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,350
这是这里唯一一把刀
This is the only blade in the place.

306
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,660
就在我手里
And I'm holding it.

307
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,100
好吧
Fair enough.

308
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,900
我想跟你做个交易
I want to make a deal with you.

309
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,370
-交易  -是的
- A deal? - Yeah.

310
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,970
我有些本领  兴许你用得到
I think I might have skills that could be useful to you.

311
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,310
是吗
Really?

312
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,580
什么本领
What skills, exactly?

你保护我不受这些禽兽伤害  我就让你见识一下
You protect me from these animals, and I'll show you.

315

你觉得你值得保护吗
You think you're worth protecting?

316
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,800
绝对值得
You have no idea.

317
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,790
有什么能帮你的吗
Can I help you?

318
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,860
不见得  你能吗
I don't think so. Can you?

319
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
你要怎么样
What do you want?

320
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,390
我想要  穷人有的  富人要的
What I want, the poor have, the rich need,

321
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,720
如果你吃了它  会翘辫子的东西
and if you eat it you'll die.

322
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,720
这是...
Is this...

323
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,500
你这是让我猜谜语吗
Are you asking me a riddle?

324
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,720
-你喜欢谜语吗  -不喜欢
- Do you like riddles? - No.

325
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,170
那你要放弃吗
So do you give up?

326
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,070
-朋友...  -虚无
- Friend, lookit... - Nothing.

327
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,340
答案是"虚无"  穷人有  富人要
The answer is nothing. The poor have it, the rich need it,

328
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,760
-如果你吃了它  -你是谁
- and if you eat it... - Who are you?

329

那你就该知道你站得太近了
Then you know that you're standing too close.

333
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,920
你知道吗  雄性帝企鹅为了给蛋保暖
Did you know that male emperor penguins keep their eggs warm

334
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,010
会把蛋放在脚上
by balancing them on their feet?

335
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,770
厉害吧
Isn't that neat?

336
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,210

Take your time.

344
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,300
很高兴见到你  老朋友
It's good to see you, old friend.

345
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,620
你来这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

346
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,310
我想邀请你来我办的派对

上次合作多愉快
It worked so well the last time.

353
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,940
我不需要你帮忙
I don't want your help.

354
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,560
上次就不该求你办事
It was a mistake to ask.

355
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,760
我不希望你来这里
I don't want you coming here.

356
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,710
你不该这样对我  吉姆

与朋友在黑暗中同行
And walking with a friend in the dark

360
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,770
总好过一个人在光明里独行
is better than walking alone in the light.

361
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,470
祝你好运  早日结案
Good luck with your police work.

362
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,670
还有
And...

363
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,200
拜托
please...

364
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,680
再考虑考虑我的邀请
Reconsider my invitation.

365
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,410
没有你  感觉不对劲
It won't be the same without you.

366
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,590
你信任我吗
Do you trust me?

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,930
你真是个好孩子
You're being a very good boy.

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,820
别挣扎
Yes, don't struggle.

373
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,220
看着我  看着我的眼睛
Look at me, look in my eyes.

374
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,120
布・韦   托・韦

375
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,890

378
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,220
那好  我得回去忙了
Good, well, I got to get back, so...

379
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,830
等下
Yeah.

380
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,890
小莱
Lee.

381
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,850
在这里我们这样不好
We can't do that here.

382
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,590
为什么  你上次还当着全警局的面亲我呢
Why? Last time, you kissed me in the middle of the bullpen.

383
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,770
你当时可不在这儿上班
You weren't working here then.

384
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,290
-有什么区别吗  -这样不专业
- That makes a difference to you? - It's not professional.

385
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,780
希望不会啊
Well, I should hope not.

386
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,790
小莱
Lee...

387
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,530
你好啊  布洛克
Hey, Bullock.

388
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,490
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

389
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,610
什么事
What's up?

390
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
没你的感情生活要紧
Nothing that can't wait on your love life.

391
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,730
一点公事而已
Just business.

392
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,510
抽根雪茄怎么样
How does a cigar sound?

393
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,900
我存了些上等的古巴雪茄  一直想抽呢
I've got some beautiful Castros I've been waiting to try.

394
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,070
卡麦  别兜圈子了
Carmine, talk straight with me.

395
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,640
你到底想怎样
Why are you doing this?

396
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,950
确实  企鹅挣钱有两下子
Granted, Penguin is a money-maker.

397
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,400
但你为什么这么花心思想留他一命
How come you're laying all this grease on me to keep him alive?

398
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,800
你有何用意
What's your angle?

399
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,540
他很聪明  我喜欢手下有这种
He's clever. And I like to have a clever man beside me

400
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,100
知道自己分量的聪明人  这你懂的
who knows his place in life. You know how that goes.

401
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,130
是啊  完全懂
Yeah. All day.

402
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,320
他也够聪明
He's clever enough to know

403
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,920
知道他这样的小怪物
that a freakish little man like him

404
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,290
是当不了老大的
is never going to be the boss.

405
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,030
有道理
True enough.

406
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,730
难不成你给我几根雪茄
So I'm supposed to give you a prime asset like that,

407
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,140
我就把这么个人才让给你
and you're gonna bring out some nice old cigars?

408
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,510
我给你的开价当然要可观得多
Of course I'll show my gratitude to you in a more formal way.

409
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,430
这不是钱的问题
This is not a money thing.

410
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,620
这是个人恩怨
This is personal.

411
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,790
我理解
I understand.

412
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,940
你知道斯坦利・特布尔首席法官吗
Do you know Chief Judge Stanley Turnbull?

413
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,340
当然知道
Of course.

414
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,510
他是法院里最他妈难对付的混蛋
He's the meanest son of a mother bitch in the courthouse.

415
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,560
不错
Yes.

416
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,720
强硬又正直的人
A hard and righteous man.

417
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,160
也很有影响力
Powerful, too.

418
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,010
还抓了我好几个哥们
Put down some good friends of mine.

419
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,730
你把他的狗头拿来给我
You bring me his ugly head

420
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,480
再加20万
and, say, 200 grand,

421
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,430
咱们就成交
and you got a deal.

422
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,380
我给你的可比他的狗头强多了
Oh, I'll give you a better deal than his head.

423
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,710
我的老天
On my mother's life.

424
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,030
特布尔法官
Judge Turnbull.

425
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,090
他跟一个小情郎出去鬼混
He was out with a young man.

426
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,970
我把他药倒了抓来了这里
I had him drugged and brought here.

427
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,310
现在他是你的人了
Now he's all yours.

428
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,160
我的
Mine?

429
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,710
当然  我也用得着他
I mean, we'll share him...

430
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,860
不过  说起来
of course, but, uh, in spirit,

431
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,610
他是你的人了
he's yours.

432
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,600
朝镜头笑笑
Now smile for the camera.

433
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,230
太棒了
It's beautiful.

434
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,940
我们肯定疏忽了什么
We must be missing something.

435
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,380
那你哥们企鹅呢
What about your pal Penguin?

436
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,220
他怎么了
What about him?

437
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
他帮我们办了弗拉斯的案子
He helped us with Flass.

438
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,140
没准这案子也能帮上忙
Maybe he'll help us with Crane.

439
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,890
不  我不会回去找他的
No. I'm not going back to him.

440
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,670
-值得一试  -不值得
- It's worth a try. - No, it's not.

441
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,370
那我们就只能干等着再死人了
Then we wait for another body to drop,

442
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,880
因为光在这儿坐着可抓不到他
because we're not gonna find him here.

443
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,160
你说的对
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,490
我们追随克兰是抓不到他的
We're never gonna be able to track Crane.

445
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,160
我们得赶在他前面
We gotta get ahead of him

446
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,700
弄清楚他的动机
by finding out what's driving him.

447
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,920
我们知道他的动机
We know what's driving him.

448
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,320
-他对恐惧的痴迷  -是啊
- He's obsessed with fear. - Yeah.

449
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,250
但为什么
But why?

450
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,150
他怕什么
What's he afraid of?

451
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,210
他遭遇了什么事  才变成这样
What happened to him that made him this way?

452
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,990
他妻子因车祸丧生
His wife was killed in a car crash.

453
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,660
嗯
Yeah.

454
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,380
查查这个
Check that out.

455
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,430
查到了  凯伦・克兰
Got it. Karen Crane.

456
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,240
嗯
Yeah.

457
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,050
这里显示她死于家里着火  而非车祸
Says here she died in a house fire, not a car accident.

458
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,120
你觉得那个同事是撒谎了吗
You think the coworker was lying?

459
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,240
另有三个人给出了相同的说法
Three other people said the same thing.

460
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,860
克兰一定是因为什么原因而撒谎了
Crane must've lied about it for some reason.

461
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,980
大火时发生了什么
What happened in the fire?

462
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,630
文章说着火的时候
Article says she was sleeping upstairs

463
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,710
她在楼上睡觉
when the fire broke out.

464
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,050
丈夫杰拉尔德和儿子  8岁的乔纳森
Husband Gerald and son Jonathan, eight,

465
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,490
都在楼下
were downstairs.

466
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,180
克兰妻子死的时候他也在家
Crane was in the house when his wife died?

467
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,730
却没去救她  怪不得他要撒谎
And didn't save her. No wonder he lied.

468
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,700
他觉得羞愧
He's ashamed.

469
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,010
他因为恐惧  而眼看妻子死去
His fear is the reason his wife died.

470
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,380
所以他才这么做
That's why he's doing this.

471
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,450
克兰家的老地址  走吧
Address for the old Crane house. Let's go.

472
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,720
{\an8}深夜起火
女子殒命

473
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,250

站住
Stop there!

478
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,870
我们已经开始了
We've started the protocol.

479
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,620
就一定要做完  否则对你没好处的
It must be completed, it will be harmful for you otherwise.

480
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,950
我...不能再做一次了
I can't... I can't do it again.

481
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,690
想想啊  小乔  再也不用害怕了
Think of it Johnny-- no more fear.

482
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,220
我都不像你那样害怕
I'm not-I'm not even afraid like you.

483
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,010
我们都害怕
We're all afraid.

484
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,940
这世上的每个男人和女人
Every man and woman on the planet.

485
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,890
我们都站在深渊边缘
We're all standing at the edge of the abyss,

486
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,380
吓得无法动弹
paralyzed by fear.

487
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,480
来吧  儿子
Now, come on, son.

488
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,520
相信我

帮助全人类
And mankind.

491

全人类啊  小乔
Mankind, Johnny.

492
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,850
你得勇敢点  好吗
Now you must be brave, hmm?

493
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,390
来吧  儿子
Come on, son.

494
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,690
你愿意跟我一起完成吗
Are you with me?

495
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,540
那我们回家吧
Then let's go back to the house.

496
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,870
很快就能结束了  我保证
It'll all be over before you know it, I promise.

497
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,770
走吧
Come on.

498
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,080
加把劲
Ah, come on.

499
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,130
加把劲啊
Come on.

500
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,370
什么事  博士
What's up, Doc?

501
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,390
我叫梅斯
The name's Mace.

502
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,290
真好听  但我喜欢给朋友起外号
That's cute, but I like to give my friends nicknames.

503
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,240
你就叫博士吧
And yours is Doc...

504
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,510
因为你块头虽大  眼睛里却充满智慧
'cause you have such a wise look in your eyes for such a big man.

505
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,480
脾气真像爆竹啊
A real little firecracker, huh?

506
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,480
爆竹只炸一次
A firecracker goes off once

507
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,900
然后就没用了
and then just lies there.

508
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,780
我是国庆节的烟火
What you're looking at is the Fourth of July.

509
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,460
坐过来
Come sit by me.

我还有几件事想跟你商量
Well, I have a couple of riders I would like to talk to you...

512
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,110
别说了  宝贝儿
Hush, now, baby.

513
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,320
你话太多  要惹我不开心了
You talk too much and you'll make me mad.

514
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,330
我想想
Huh, let's see...

515
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,970
第一件事
That's rider number one.

516
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,740
就是别叫我"宝贝儿"
Don't call me "Baby."

517
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,750
我叫菲什・穆尼
My name is Fish Mooney.

518
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,260
我现在是老大了
I'm in charge now.

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,130
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

523
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,860
爸爸  他们一进来就会逮捕你的
Dad, they are going to arrest you once they come in here.

524
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,850
我们得赶快走了
We have to go now!

525
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,190
还有时间  我们可以完成的

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,250
我们得完成
We have to finish the protocol.

529
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,730
-必须这样  -爸爸  那太多了
- It's the only way. - Dad, that's too much.

530
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,520
必须如此
It's the only way.

531
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,690
听我说  爸爸
Look, Dad...

532
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,230
时间不够了
there's not enough time.

533
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,030
没事的
It'll be fine.

534
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,570
-我爱你  儿子  -别
- I love you, son. - Stop!

535
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,540
手举起来
Hands where we can see 'em!

536
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,570
手举起来  否则我们开枪了
Hands in the air or we'll shoot!

537
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,490
你以为我怕你们吗
You think I'm afraid of you?

538
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,110
-别再往前走了  -怕你们的枪吗
- Not another step! - Afraid of your guns?

539
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,520
我无所畏惧
I have no fear!

540
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,880
抓他  我去看孩子
You take him. I'll get the kid.

541
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,580
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

542
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,910
叫救护车
Call an ambulance!

543
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,370

It's all right!

545
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,010
你好啊  布鲁斯少爷
Hello, there, Master Bruce.

546
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,750
你好慢啊
Well, you certainly took your time.

547
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,450
出来的路上去吃饭喝酒了吗
What, did you stop off for a pie and a pint on the way out, did you?

548
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,760
你在这儿多久了
How long have you been there?

549
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,790
不好说...一小时了吧
Well, I don't know, about... about an hour.

550
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,550
你开始爬山的时候就来了
Just when you started climbing up that very nasty hill.

551
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,260
多谢帮忙了
Thanks for your help.

552
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,280
又不是我害你掉下去的
Yeah, I never got you down there, you know.

553
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,360
你没事吧
You all right?

554
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,930
过来
Come here.

555
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,710
我好冷
I'm cold,

556
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,470
好累  还扭伤了脚踝
I'm tired, and my ankle's sprained.

557
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,280
我想回家
I just want to go home.

558
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,020
你想回家
You want to go home?

559
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,430
还是想等等  看日出
Or do you want to wait and watch the sunrise?

560
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,810
就像跟你爸爸一起那样
Like you did with your dad.

561
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,030
阿尔弗雷德
Well, Alfred...

562
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,540
如果你没问题  我们就留下吧
...we can only stay if you think you can handle it.

563
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,120
如果我没问题
If I can handle it?

564
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,360
伙计  这地方跟我待过的
Mate, this place is positively cushy

565
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,400
一些地方相比简直是天堂了
compared to some of the places I've slept at.

566
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,240
喝茶吗  小猴子
Cup of tea, you cheeky monkey?

567
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,620
企鹅
Penguin.

568
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,860
你去哪
Where you going?

569
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,050
马罗尼阁下
Don Maroni.

570

见到您真是荣幸
It's such a pleasure to see you.

571

572
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,070
之前还在我车的后备箱里  这就有自己的夜店了

573
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,170
这地方不错  企鹅
The place looks good, Penguin.

574
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,410
人不少啊
Hell of a turnout.

575
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,580
-是啊  -要坐吗
- Yeah. - How 'bout a table?

576
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,020
喝点东西
Drinks?

577
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,280
我请
My compliments, of course.

578
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,820
挺贵的啊
Expensive stuff.

579
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,710
我瞧瞧
Let me see.

580
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,550
我跟法尔科内谈了谈
I had a little chat with Falcone.

581
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,280
我来是想告诉你我们之间没事了
I came here to let you know that all is kosher between us.

582
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,700
只要你不再把我的秘密抖露给法尔科内
Long as you don't go giving Falcone any more of my secrets.

583
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,580
当然
No.

584
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,130
不会的
Nothing like that.

585
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,290
当然
Of course not.

586
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,790
拿个杯子吧
Grab a glass.

587
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,940
你最好祈祷那老头子法尔科内长命百岁
You better hope that old man, Falcone, lives a long life.

588
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,360
因为他一死
'Cause the second he's out the picture,

589
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,880
你也得上西天
so are you.

590
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,810
小布少爷
Master B.

591
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,080
日出了
Sunrise.

592
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,090
你还好吗
How are you?

593
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,850
我听说你的疑犯死了
I heard your suspect was killed.

594
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,000
他拿枪对着我和哈维
Came after Harvey and me with a gun.

595
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,310
-没办法  -我很遗憾
- Didn't have a choice. - I'm so sorry.

596
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,470
他儿子呢
What about his son?

597
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,330
医务人员稳定了他的情况
Paramedics were able to stabilize him.

598
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,840
我这就去医院看望他
I'm heading over to the hospital now, to check in on him.

599
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,640
有消息告诉我
Well, let me know how he is.

600
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,590
嗯
I will.

601
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,640
安顿下来了
So, settled in here, huh?

602
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,890
差不多了吧
Uh, almost.

603
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,020
你觉得会喜欢这里吗
Think you're gonna like it here?

604
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,350
目前还喜欢
I do. So far.

605
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,680
很好
Good.

606
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,280
我有马戏团的门票
Um, I have tickets to the circus.

607
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,290
要一起来吗
Do you want to come with me?

608
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,020
-马戏团  -是啊  他们不错呢
- The circus? - Yeah. They're good.

609
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,390
没有什么可怜的大象
No, uh, sad elephants.

610
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,050
马戏团  好啊
The circus. Sure. Why not?

611
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,950
小莱
Look, Lee...

612
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,670
在警局不能接吻
no kissing, here, on the job.

613
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,140
好吗  我认真的
Okay? I'm serious.

614
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,830
好
Okay.

615
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,990
真的吗
Okay?

616
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,290
如果你这么在意你的硬汉形象的话
If your hard-ass reputation is worth that much to you.

617
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,090
-这是工作场合  -警察也有感情啊
- This is a place of work. - Cops have feelings, too.

618
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,320
显露感情没什么不专业的
It's not unprofessional to show your feelings.

619
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,180
是不专业  这种感情就不专业
Yeah, it is. Those kinds of feelings, yeah.

620
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,640
那好吧
Fine. Be that way.

621
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,450
开玩笑呢
I'm just joking.

622
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,830
我会小心的
I'll be discreet.

623
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,340
好了  大家都凑过来
All right, everyone gather round!

624
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,110
之前这里毫无秩序
Up until now, there's been no order in here.

625
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,570
毫无...规矩
No... structure.

626
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,630
以后要改改了
Things are gonna change.

627
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,870
她回来了
She's back.

628
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,590
我的眼睛
My eyes.

629
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,180
他们挖了我的眼睛
They took my eyes.

630
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,310
那孩子被注入了高剂量的浓缩激素
The boy received a massive dose of condensed hormones--

631
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,840
皮质醇  肾上腺素
cortisol, adrenaline--

632
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,930
还有一种我们尚未查清的混合物
and another compound we're still trying to identify.

633
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,430
这种组合药剂险些要了他的命
The combination nearly killed him.

634
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,740
但他会没事吗
But he's gonna live?

635
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,310
是的
Yes.

636
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,610
但我们给他做了断层扫描
But we ran a CAT scan

637
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,870
以检查他是否遭遇了脑损伤
in order to determine if he suffered any brain damage.

638
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,960
检查结果
The results...

639
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,200
我们前所未见
we've never seen anything like them before.

640
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,170
激素本身早已排出
The hormones themselves have long since worn off,

641
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,290
但其效力
but the effects,

642
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,550
似乎还存在
they seem to be lingering.

643
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,450
什么意思
What are you saying?

644
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,720
他还处于恐惧中
That he's still in fear?

645
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,160
不仅是恐惧
Well, not just fear.

646
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,490
乔纳森的脑活动显示
Jonathan's brain activity shows

647
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,820
他一直处于极度恐惧之中
he's in a constant state of intense terror.

648
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,640
这要多久会消退
How long until this goes away?

649
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,490
这个...
Well...

650
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,600
问题就在这里  警探
that's just the thing, Detective.

651
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,170
我们不确定它会消退
We can't be certain it ever will.

652
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,620
想象你最怕的东西
Imagine the thing you fear most in the world.

653
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,340
想象你满眼都是那个
Imagine that it's all you see.

654
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,240
每时每刻
Every waking hour.

655
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,880
不不  不要
No, no, no!

656
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:31,031
