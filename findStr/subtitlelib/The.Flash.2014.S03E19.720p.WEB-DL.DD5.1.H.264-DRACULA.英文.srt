1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,760
Despite your feeble efforts to change the future,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,880
you can't.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,160
Everything's the same.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,790
The future has not changed.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,100
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,600
and save you are in the future,

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,860
then that's where I need to go.

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,170
Caitlin. Somebody help!

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,490
She's gone.

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,100
Stop. That's not what she want--

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,110
Don't care.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,780
2024.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,830
According to the future article in the time vault,

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,670
I'm still in Central City.

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,400
There's no mention of Savitar.

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,090
I'd probably trapped him in the Speed Force by then.

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,000
That's the time I need to travel to.

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,490
2024.

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,930
If I trapped him, I must've figured out who he was, right?

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,910
Iris?

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,540
What are you doing?

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,820
Um, sorry, I was just thinking.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,900
About what?

26
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,720
Same as you. The future.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,100
And my dad.

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,800
What about him?

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,200
I need you to make me a promise, okay?

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,450
If things don't go our way...

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,660
- If Savitar kills me-- - He won't.

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,770
- If he does-- - He won't.

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,450
If he does, Barry,

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,190
promise me that you will be there for my dad.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,400
Don't let him push Cecile away.

36
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,660
Don't let him spiral out of control.

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,450
Make sure that him and Wally--

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,990
Stop, okay? We're not gonna talk about this.

39
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,980
You're not gonna die. I told you, I have a plan.

40
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,330
Barry, I need you to promise me, okay?

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,490
I'm serious.

42
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,680
Promise me...

43
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,980
that you're gonna make sure that my dad is okay.

44
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,070
I promise.

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,420
S.T.A.R. Labs.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,180
We, uh...we should go.

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,300
- You think? - Yeah.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,090
Oh, probably should've made that out of carbyne.

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,810
Rookie mistake.

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,010
You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,330
You know, you probably should've spent

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,780
a little more time finding a cure for what ails me.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,250
I care about you, Caitlin.

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,250
Show me.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,890
- Julian! - Come on, come on!

56
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,730
Oh, boys...

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,290
where are you?

58
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,300
What are you doing?

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,530
Buying us some time.

60
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,360
*Swing low*

61
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,740
*Sweet chariot*

62
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,190
*Coming for to carry me home*

63
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,950
Hey, dummies.

64
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,850
My palm scan still works.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,760
I don't want to have to do this.

66
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,340
I know you don't.

67
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,330
But I do.

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,640
Stop!

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,770
Aw, come to save the day?

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,100
Good, now I can get rid of you, too.

71
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,080
Caitlin, you can fight this.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,360
I know. But I don't want to.

73
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,430
Anything?

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,550
I searched the whole building. She's gone.

77
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,900
Hey, Julian, how about next time you decide

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,230
to release my friend's inner ice demon,

79
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,740
you do it sometime in July?

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,230
I know you're not being serious.

81
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,760
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,350
Iris was right. Even H.R. was right.

83
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,390
We should've taken her to a hospital.

84
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,480
Brilliant idea, yes.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
Expose her meta-human status to the world.

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,010
That would've been great, wouldn't it?

87
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey, guess what? She's gonna do that anyway.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Guys!

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,720
Arguing isn't gonna help us find her.

90
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,530
Maybe we should just take five.

91
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,390
Yeah.

92
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,010
Yeah, probably right.

93
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm gonna do this.

94
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,990
I'm gonna run to the future.

95
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,520
Wait, what?

96
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,210
You want to do this now?

97
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,010
Barry, Caitlin is still out there.

98
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,720
I know, but we're running out of time.

99
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,950
If I can find my future self,

100
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,350
I can find out who Savitar is--

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,410
how we defeated him.

102
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,000
Besides, I can run to the future

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,900
and be back like I never even left.

104
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,380
All right, what do you need us to do?

105
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,520
Just keep everybody else away from the pipeline.

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,350
Barry, last time you went to the future, it was by accident.

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
How are you supposed to get there now?

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,730
With your help.

109
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,080
You sure this is gonna work?

110
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,860
I calculated the force from the explosion

111
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,670
that propelled me to the future last time.

112
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,780
At your fastest speed,

113
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,680
you can create three times that force.

114
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,700
It's more than enough to get me where I want to go.

115
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,510
All right.

116
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,940
Just run as fast as you can.

117
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll try to keep up.

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,850
Good luck, man.

120
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,170
2024.

121
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,990
I made it.

122
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,720
What is it, throwback Thursday?

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,500
Haven't seen that outfit in a while, have we, honey?

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,900
Haven't seen him in a while, either.

125
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,420
Guess we get to...

126
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,700
relive the past.

127
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,330
Kick his ass like we used to.

128
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,990
You've been gone for a while,

129
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,630
so let me remind you...

130
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,700
this is my town.

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,740
Our town, baby.

132
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,720
That's right.

133
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,740
Our town. My mistake.

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,540
Not anymore.

135
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,710
What was that?

136
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,130
Did you say something, Flash?

137
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,830
You're in for a world of pain.

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,540
You better run, Flash.

139
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,260
Next time, we're gonna put him in something

140
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,970
he can't get out of.

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
I knew it was you.

142
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,950
Cisco.

143
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,460
Barry Allen.

144
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,460
How did you know I was here?

145
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,880
I had a feeling.

146
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,510
A feeling I have not felt in a long time.

147
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,970
And so I hacked into the security cameras,

148
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,860
and I saw you fighting Top and Mirror Master

149
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,440
in your O.G. suit

150
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,930
with the white emblem--

151
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,960
2017 edition, of course.

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,540
Being here...

153
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,690
this is no accident, is it?

154
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,330
I came here for some information.

155
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,010
And then I'm-I'm going back.

156
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,370
What's the information?

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,930
Time travel.

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,350
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,790
You say something, you might mess something up, right?

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,710
Don't worry, my powers of deduction have improved

161
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,340
since 2017.

162
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,660
2017...

163
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,570
Savitar.

164
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,100
I need to talk to me.

165
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,060
Do you know where he is?

167
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,510
So H.R. stopped the S.T.A.R. Labs museum?

168
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,260
H.R. went on to other things.

169
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,440
What about Caitlin?

170
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,420
Once she became Killer Frost,

171
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,430
she never stepped in this building again.

172
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,050
So I shut down this place?

173
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,720
My friend, you shut everything down.

174
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,260
S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash--

175
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,500
you didn't want us around.

176
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,570
- So you pushed us away. - Why?

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,580
You said it was because of what we represented.

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,490
That we were a constant reminder to you of what you lost.

179
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,510
But you weren't the only one who lost something.

180
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,390
Are you sure he's here?

181
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,940
He never leaves this place.

182
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,530
Well, what are you doing? Aren't you gonna come with me?

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,820
Man, I shouldn't even be here.

184
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,620
Look, just get what you need,

185
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,300
but don't leave without saying good-bye.

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,340
All right.

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,590
Why are you here?

188
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,760
I need your help.

189
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,170
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

190
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,750
You can't save her.

191
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,840
Yes, I can.

192
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,980
And I'm going to.

193
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,340
No, you can't. Go home.

194
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,980
Just tell me who's in the suit.

195
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,860
All right? That's all I need.

196
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,860
You tell me that, we'll be able to track him down.

197
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,990
We'll learn his weakness.

198
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,480
We'll stop him before he even tries.

199
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,200
Just tell me who Savitar is.

200
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,310
I can't.

201
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,020
What--why?

202
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,290
Because I don't know the answer.

203
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,610
Sorry you ran all this way for nothing.

204
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,290
You want some advice, go home.

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,490
Spend as much time with Iris as you can.

206
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,710
Because pretty soon...

207
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,150
you'll never see her again.

208
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,610
You sure you can't stay?

209
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,510
I'm not gonna get what I came for.

210
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,340
- Look, we could really use you. - Cisco...

211
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,800
I mean it. Mirror Master and Top

212
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,640
are not the only villains in the city.

213
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
Barry, we don't have a Flash here.

214
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,090
Not anymore, okay?

215
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,070
Well, Cisco...

216
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,590
I can't.

217
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,950
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,350
Look, it's good to see you in any time.

219
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,300
All right?

220
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah.

221
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,350
You too.

222
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,300
You okay? What's wrong?

223
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,450
I don't know.

224
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,210
A portal won't open.

225
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,250
I can't get back.

226
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,130
I can't get back to the past.

227
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,970
What's happening, Cisco?

228
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I don't know.

229
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,490
Why can't I open a portal?

230
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,800
Wasn't I running fast enough?

231
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,340
Well, I'm not sure.

232
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,170
We don't have the telemetry for the suit.

233
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,810
Okay, well-- we got to figure this out.

234
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,570
I have to get back.

235
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,140
We're gonna get you back home. Not to worry.

236
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,340
Look, good news--

237
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,520
good news, you can always go back

238
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,440
to the exact time in which you left,

239
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,890
no matter how long you stay here.

240
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,210
Maybe it was Scudder or Dillon.

241
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,120
They seemed a little different than the last time I fought them.

242
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,200
I mean, look around you.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,400
Everything's different.

244
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,460
Except you.

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,140
Maybe this means we can get the team back together.

246
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,690
Why haven't you done that?

247
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,830
I've tried.

248
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,280
Believe me, I've tried.

249
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,990
But you see, Caitlin's not the only thing Killer Frost took.

250
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,590
No hands, no vibes.

251
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,730
And without my powers...

252
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,630
without you...

253
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,560
What--what about everybody else?

254
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,910
Julian, Wally?

255
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,160
Joe?

256
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,110
It's been a while, gentlemen.

257
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,180
Especially you, Flash.

258
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,210
More than you know.

259
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,550
Allen?

260
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,330
Yeah, it's me, Julian.

261
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,620
From the past.

262
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,460
2017.

263
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,180
2017.

264
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,970
The year it all began.

265
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,350
I'll assume you're here for some answers then, are you?

266
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,440
Something like that.

267
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,720
Well, you brought him to the wrong place, mate.

268
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,590
I just wanted him to understand.

269
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,060
Julian...

270
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,210
Can I see her?

271
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,010
I tried to find her something more humane, but...

272
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,870
this is the best I could do.

273
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,440
Caitlin?

274
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,640
It's me.

275
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,740
Barry Allen...

276
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm--

277
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,910
From the past.

278
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,910
I can tell.

279
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,220
There's no hate in your eyes...

280
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,900
yet.

281
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,830
So to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?

282
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,770
Come to see how things turn out for Team Flash?

283
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,300
I wanted to see what happened to my friend.

284
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,480
I am not your friend, Flash.

285
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,900
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

286
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,730
I should have saved you.

287
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,790
I'm glad that you did this to me.

288
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,750
Caitlin wasn't.

289
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
I failed her.

290
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,260
But I won't when I go back.

291
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm gonna find you.

292
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,740
And I'm gonna help you.

293
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,780
You're no match for the God of Speed.

294
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,680
You didn't tell him, did you?

295
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,640
Well, secrets always were our thing, weren't they?

296
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,650
When I became Killer Frost,

297
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,180
Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.

298
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,810
We made one hell of a team.

299
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,640
Why would you help him?

300
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,660
Because he gave me the thing that you couldn't:

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,930
the cure to my illness,

302
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,730
embracing who I really am.

303
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,530
You know who he is.

304
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,500
Who is he?

305
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,240
Tell me who he is.

306
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,380
I'll never tell.

307
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,160
You are gonna be so surprised when you find out.

308
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,390
You know, I think your prot¨¦g¨¦  went toe-to-toe with Savitar.

309
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,560
Maybe he can help you out.

310
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,930
I need to see Wally.

311
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,860
Hello?

312
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,670
Hi, um, I'm looking for Wally West?

313
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,420
I recognize you from Joe's photos.

314
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,530
You're Barry, right?

315
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,990
Barr--Barry, yeah.

316
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,610
- Uh, this is Cisco. - Hey, Beth.

317
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,660
Hey, Cisco. I'm Beth.

318
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,760
Come on in.

319
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll be upstairs if you need anything.

320
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,830
And stay as long as you like.

321
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,710
We don't get very many visitors.

322
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,700
Hey, buddy.

323
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,930
I brought a friend.

324
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,590
Wally?

325
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,190
Hey, it's me.

326
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,230
It's Barry.

327
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,760
Can you hear me?

328
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,310
What happened to him?

329
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,420
Iris died, and that...

330
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,660
sent him into this rage.

331
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,170
And, uh, he went after Savitar by himself one night.

332
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,130
Joe found him the next day with a shattered spine.

333
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,360
No one knows what he saw that night,

334
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,690
but whatever it was...

335
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,110
he's been like this ever since.

336
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,350
I'm so sorry.

337
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,160
Listen, Barry, you and Joe--

338
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,110
Where is he?

339
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,450
Well, he's not here,

340
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,680
which means there's only one other place he can be.

341
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,530
Hey, Joe.

342
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,130
Why are you here, Barry?

343
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,890
I just wanted to see you.

344
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,410
Just wanted to see how you were doing.

345
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,040
Now you want to know?

346
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,880
After all this time, now?

347
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
Uh, Joe, um...

348
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm doing my best.

349
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,180
What happened to us?

350
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,740
My daughter's life was taken.

351
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
My son's.

352
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,970
And then you left me, Barry.

353
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,740
The last piece of who I was...

354
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,330
left.

355
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,010
Turned his back and ran away.

356
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,190
I wasn't there for you?

357
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,900
Why start now?

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,530
I'm gonna need you to leave, Barry.

359
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,790
Please.

360
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,030
You promised.

361
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,860
You promised her that you would be there for Joe.

362
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,220
You don't understand.

363
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,810
I don't understand what? That you abandoned him?

364
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,910
That you abandoned him and everybody else?

365
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,330
- You made a promise! - That I couldn't keep!

366
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,270
Not after everything I lost.

367
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,980
I was just as broken as Joe was!

368
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,580
- I don't care. - You will!

369
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,760
You will.

370
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,000
You want answers, Barry?

371
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,070
How's this?

372
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,570
You will go back.

373
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,550
You will do everything that you can think of to save her.

374
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,440
You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself,

375
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,380
but he's gonna kill them all, mostly.

376
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,390
And then on the night of May 23rd,

377
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,990
Iris West will die in your arms.

378
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,560
- No. - And in that moment

379
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,620
that she takes her last breath,

380
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,210
it'll feel like an eternity.

381
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,880
And it will break you.

382
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,500
She's the love of your life, Barry.

383
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,010
She was the love of my life.

384
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,160
There'll be nothing left at all but stopping Savitar.

385
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,130
So no, you won't be there for Joe.

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,210
You won't be there when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost.

387
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,310
When Savitar destroys Wally.

388
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,330
You won't be there for any of them.

389
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,750
But then one day, you'll stop him.

390
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,010
You'll lock him in the Speed Force forever.

391
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,440
But at that point...

392
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,890
he already won.

393
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,010
Because everything that you've ever loved is gone.

394
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,030
Including you.

395
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,700
Go home, Barry.

396
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,430
There's nothing for you here.

397
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,420
Cisco.

398
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,150
Did you figure out what's keeping me here?

399
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,420
I need to go home.

400
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,160
What?

401
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,960
You're leaving? Now?

402
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,200
He's--he's...

403
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,580
he's not gonna help me, man. He's broken.

404
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,890
And if Caitlin's working with Savitar,

405
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,680
I need to get back. I need--

406
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,450
before she's lost to us forever.

407
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,440
What about everyone else?

408
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,530
Don't you want to help them?

409
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,350
I can't help them.

410
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,170
I should've known.

411
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,140
No matter what I do,

412
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,320
you're gonna abandon the ones close to you.

413
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,500
Cisco, it's not like that.

414
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,480
I just--I can't stay here.

415
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,510
But you want me to.

416
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,210
To get the team back together.

417
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,650
It wasn't Mirror Master or Top

418
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,780
that did something to me. It was you.

419
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,420
Wasn't it?

420
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,480
Yeah.

421
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,910
What did you do?

422
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,000
You know the resonance field you create when you run?

423
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,790
This disrupts that.

424
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,250
I might not be able to use my powers,

425
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,270
but I still know something about tech.

426
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,400
Why would you keep me here?

427
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,320
Cause I miss my friend.

428
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,380
Cis...

429
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,730
If you want to go, I'm not gonna stop you.

430
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't know why I expected you

431
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,040
to be the same Barry Allen I remember.

432
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,900
That guy still had some fight left in him.

433
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,130
You were right.

434
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,360
This isn't the future that I wanted.

435
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,580
I can't go back knowing I let it stay like this.

436
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,450
You want to help me try to fix it?

437
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,510
I thought you'd never ask.

438
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,940
Well, let's get the team back together.

439
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,960
Even H.R.

440
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,500
Continuing with the H.R. Romance Series,

442
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,280
"The Streak vs. Mr. Reflecto."

443
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,600
"Just as the villain was about to go in for the fatal blow,

444
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,100
Florence felt strong hands around her waist...

445
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,740
lifting her like she was a feather."

446
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,770
"She was whisked away,

447
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,740
The wind blowing through her hair,

448
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,420
As her mystery hero finally set Florence down

449
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,950
on a mountaintop."

450
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,700
I love that part.

451
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,680
I was in the zone.

454
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,080
"She, uh..."

455
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,780
"Florence was, um..."

456
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,160
And the mountaintop. Back to the mountaintop.

457
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,450
"I have to have you..."

458
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,710
Okay, you know what?

459
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,550
Uh, we should threesome--

460
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,080
do someone--something else.

461
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,180
I think--

462
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,060
Julian, H.R.

463
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,970
What the hell is going on?

464
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,490
I would like to know the very same thing.

465
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,970
I was about to check one of the most important boxes

466
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,440
a man can check in his life.

467
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,960
And who--who brought us here?

468
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,350
I brought you all here.

469
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,180
Oh, it's you again.

470
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,370
Bar?

471
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,980
You--you look--

472
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,040
Young?

473
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,980
He's from the past, Detective.

474
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,970
2017, to be precise.

475
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,180
I knew something felt weird in the cemetery.

476
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,430
You hadn't visited Iris in years.

477
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,780
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

478
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,610
Cisco told me, or showed me,that

479
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,140
you all haven't been a team in a long time.

480
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,350
And I know that I'm the reason for that.

481
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,220
Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.

482
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,300
I mean--I mean, it should've driven me closer.

483
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,490
This isn't what she would want.

484
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,520
But I'm here now to tell you that

485
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,000
no matter what happens in the past,

486
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,190
I will not abandon you.

487
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,870
- What's that? - It's a meta-human app.

488
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,530
Mirror Master and Top are at it again.

489
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,120
Let's get 'em.

490
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,930
Us, as in Team Flash?

491
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,090
Guys, we have a chance to put some hope back into our lives.

492
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,000
And I...

493
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,890
I really need it right now.

494
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,740
I think you do, too.

495
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,150
So what do you say?

496
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,650
You ready for Team Flash to take down the bad guys again?

497
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,700
Team Flash.

498
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,410
Team Flash.

499
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,320
On three.

500
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,090
One, two...

502
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,580
Thank you.

503
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,330
Baby, you're a rock star.

504
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,200
Just like to shine for my man.

505
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,150
Yeah, I don't know.

506
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,060
It looks a little tacky from over here.

507
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,280
But I am old-fashioned.

508
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,730
We told you to stay away, Flash.

509
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,480
Yeah, well, I try not to listen to criminals.

510
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,910
Or stupid people.

511
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,150
You guys hearing me all right?

512
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,980
Yeah, Bar, I can hear you loud and clear.

513
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,500
Man, it's good to be back.

514
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,970
Well, that's--what the...?

515
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,650
Wh--what are you doing?

516
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,140
- Just--I had a-- - What are you looking for?

517
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,010
I just--I found--oh.

518
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,080
Now I'm ready.

519
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,050
Should've done as you were told.

520
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,810
Flash, it's two versus one.

521
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,420
Odds aren't in your favor.

522
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,860
I'll take that bet.

523
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,850
Give him a little ride.

524
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,550
With pleasure.

525
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,460
Okay, that's new.

526
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,720
He can't move.

527
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,280
They're using their powers at the same time.

528
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,150
- What are we gonna do? - Can't he phase or something?

529
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,360
That doesn't work on these guys.

530
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,140
Well, what will?

531
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,620
Give me that thing in your hands.

532
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,420
The other thing.

533
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,710
That makes more sense.

534
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,750
I can rejigger this to mimic the resonance fields

535
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,070
from Scudder's portals, make it so

536
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,400
Barry can manipulate the mirrors.

537
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,090
But what about Top?

538
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,860
This will also restore

539
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,430
whatever rarefaction effect she's causing.

540
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,150
Yes, that's good. That's brilliant.

541
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,510
But without opening another breach,

542
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,970
how can we possibly get it into his hands in time?

543
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,540
I'll take it to him.

544
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,140
I saw what you were doing from the time vault.

545
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,460
You need help.

546
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,570
Give it to me.

547
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,690
Go.

548
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,050
Thought it was about time I did something.

549
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,790
Cisco made it.

550
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,020
Now her powers won't affect us.

551
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,040
We can go anywhere he does.

552
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,710
The odds seem pretty even now, huh?

553
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,650
Go.

554
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,820
Go.

555
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,040
You mind?

556
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,590
Be my guest.

557
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,400
Gotcha.

558
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,940
In a bizarre twist, and the first sighting in years,

560
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,570
eyewitnesses claim not one but two Scarlet Speedsters

561
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,280
were responsible for apprehending Sam Scudder

562
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,120
and Rosalind Dillon,

563
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,420
AKA Mirror Master and Top.

564
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,810
I'm sure I speak for all residents of Central City

565
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,030
when I say this:

566
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,300
Flash, if you're watching,

567
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,300
it's good to see you again.

568
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,870
Ladies and gentlemen,

569
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,520
- Team Flash, back at it again.- Yeah.

570
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah, I think this was a good first step, Cisco,

571
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,640
but yeah, we have a ways to go.

572
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,400
Especially me.

573
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,530
I heard what you said.

574
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,400
And you were right.

575
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,230
Iris wouldn't have wanted this.

576
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,790
She would have wanted us to stay a family.

577
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,490
I broke that promise to her--

578
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,010
to all of you.

579
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,230
You made me realize, even though Savitar's gone,

580
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,920
I've--I've still been letting him win.

581
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,270
I was wrong to do that.

582
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,800
If you're all willing to... try to be a family again...

583
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,750
I think I can, too.

584
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,950
I don't know which--

585
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,110
which one of you to hug first.

586
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,710
Him.

587
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,150
Well, I don't know about you, but...I'm in.

588
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,940
H.R.? What do you say?

589
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,070
Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings

590
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,280
and some book readings--

591
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,470
lot of women left to charm,

592
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,820
but I--I'm in.

593
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,850
You know what?

594
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,450
Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters.

595
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,930
Maybe 10% off. On me, let's go.

596
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,220
Thank you.

597
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,260
- Thank you. - I know how hard this must be.

598
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,270
No, you don't.

599
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,440
Not yet.

600
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,650
That's the problem.

601
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,470
And neither of us can change what's gonna happen.

602
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,590
I wish I could help you, believe me, I do.

603
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,880
But you trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

604
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,530
Just tell me how you did it.

605
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,470
I had help.

606
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,530
- Help from who? - A physicist.

607
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,000
Her name's Tracy Brand.

608
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,500
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

609
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,030
Why wouldn't you tell me this before?

610
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,060
Because she didn't figure out the technology

611
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,730
until four years ago.

612
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,830
Four years after Iris died.

613
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,840
Hang on.

614
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,410
I don't know where she is.

615
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,640
And I don't understand anything that's on here.

616
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,990
But that's got all her information on it.

617
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,820
Maybe when you go back, you can find her and...

618
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,790
I don't know, she can decipher it for you.

619
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,300
I hope so.

620
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,710
But if not...

621
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,010
Just make some good memories with Iris.

622
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,470
Hold onto 'em as tight as you can.

623
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,000
Good luck.

624
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,740
Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."

625
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,730
Which would make me Doc Brown.

626
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,740
You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?

627
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,670
No, I will not.

628
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,050
I'm gonna do something to fix that.

629
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,590
You're too good of a superhero to lose those powers.

630
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,270
You know you're my BFF, right?

631
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,700
You too, man.

632
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,960
Whoa. Wait, did you--

633
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
Did it not work? Do we need to try again?

634
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,890
No, I went. I'm back.

635
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,970
You're back?

636
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,150
I went to the future.

637
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,680
How far?

638
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,030
Eight years from now.

639
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,380
I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was.

640
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,280
Did you?

641
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,770
No.

642
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,610
But I got a lead. Something we can use.

643
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,080
Something that'll help us stop him.

644
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,140
Barry, did you learn anything about Caitlin?

645
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,960
She aligned herself with Savitar.

646
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,000
Why would she do that?

647
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,400
I don't know.

648
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,640
But we need to find her,

649
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,420
before she's lost to us forever.

650
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,360
All right, I'll get to CCPD.

651
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,380
Yeah, and we'll, uh...

652
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,490
we'll dive in here, right?

653
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,540
Right, team? Team Flash.

654
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,270
On three.

655
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,660
Okay. Okay.

656
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,740
Joe.

657
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,540
I love you.

658
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,900
I love you, too.

659
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,270
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

660
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,540
I just want you to know that no matter what happens,

661
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,630
I'm always gonna be there for you.

662
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,110
I know that, Bar.

663
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,900
I know.

664
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,130
Thank you.

665
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,360
What was that about?

666
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,530
I'm just keeping that promise I made to you.

668
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,890
I've been waiting for you.

669
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,540
Fear not, my child.

670
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,140
I have come only to offer you what you desire.

671
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,380
And what's that?

672
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,520
Selvation.

673
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,930
You want to cure me?

674
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,410
Turn me back to Caitlin Snow

675
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,890
No.

676
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm gonna make sure

677
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,730
Caitlin never returns.

678
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,430
Why should I trust you?

679
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,540
What do you need me to do?
