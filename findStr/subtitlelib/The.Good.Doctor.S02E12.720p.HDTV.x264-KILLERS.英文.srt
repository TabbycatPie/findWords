Holy crap, Shaun!

You're a good dancer.

44
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,650
No, I'm not. So don't be a lurker.

45
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,530
You've gotta give a girl a warning

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,690
before she makes a total fool out of herself.

47
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,870
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,970
Why are you even up? You've just gone through hell.

49
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,850
You should be sleeping till noon,

50
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,760
then go out for a Bloody Mary Brunch

51
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,010
and a credit crashing shopping spree.

52
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,770
Those are all unhealthy ways to cope with stress.

53
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,990
Fine.

54
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,530
But whatever you choose to do to decompress on your day off,

55
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,530
it can't start before 9:00.

56
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,770
And it absolutely cannot involve

57
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,550
you sitting around all day reading medical journals.

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,630
You've got to get out and do something.

59
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm so sorry for pushing you.

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
But you know I am right.

62
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,300
How can you investigate a response that's not even over yet?

64
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,990
We just began the Terminal Clean.

65
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,420
The Governor believes an immediate D.I.S. review

66
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,030
is essential to restore public confidence.

67
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,620
The CDC confirmed the virus originated in Malaysia.

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,310
And that there was nothing my staff could've done

69
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,790
to prevent the three deaths or Dr. Lim's infection.

70
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,770
I'm going to need access to every patient record

71
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,940
and all staff communication

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,480
from the moment the first outbreak patient arrived.

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,280
Look at you. Already back at work.

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,480
It's either that or watch the news.

75
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,580
And I'd rather be back on ECMO with a rusty cannula.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,580
- Anything you need? - Thanks, but not necessary.

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,590
You sure?

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,420
Magazines, a book, a Maple Bacon doughnut?

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,800
Yeah, you don't have to play "Supportive friend"

80
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,420
just because we slept together.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,550
I'm not "Playing," I'm being nice.

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,860
Which I've done for people I haven't slept with

83
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,210
many times in my life.

84
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,700
No doubt.

85
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,880
But until we did, you were always more interested

86
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,860
in competing than supporting.

87
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,250
And that's how I prefer it.

88
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,780
Okay.

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm not sure that's true, or fair --

90
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm also exhausted, unshowered, and constipated,

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,970
so if you could shut the door on your way out,

92
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,510
I'd really appreciate it.

93
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,470
Will do.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
I was just about to head out to Hollander's,

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,780
and I thought you might want to join me.

103
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,540
You thought I might want to join you for mimosas?

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Why not?

105
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,540
Because we don't like each other?

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,860
We don't really know each other.

107
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,930
Hollander's has the absolute best brunch in San Jose.

I'll drive. I'll buy.

109
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,280
Morgan, how about you just cut to what it is you really want.

110
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,860
What else are you gonna do?

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,710
Sit around, play guitar, and sing into your phone?

112
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,000
- How did you know what I was doing? - I didn't.

113
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,630
But that's what your profile

114
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,500
on a certain dating app says you like to do on your days off?

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,820
Are you stalking me?

116
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,900
One mimosa

117
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,080
and I'll tell you the fake profile I use for "Oppo Research."

118
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,960
The guy I used for my pic is gorgeous.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,760
You really want to risk swiping right on me?

120
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,030
I'll drive myself.

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,080
It'll be fun. Meet you in an hour.

122
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,810
Call me every night.

123
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,390
I already said I would.

124
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,050
Okay.

125
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,160
Thanks for letting me stop by.

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
No problem.

127
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay, well...

128
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Bye.

129
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,300
Bye.

130
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,960
Bye.

131
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,550
Okay.
Bye.

132
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,980
Mia, wait.

133
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,340
Why don't you stay and fly back with Kellan on Sunday?

134
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,940
I know it's crazy,

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,310
but it's been so long since we've all been together.

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,690
Like old times.

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,070
I think that virus may've affected your memory.

138
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,570
Come on. Hang with us a bit.

139
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,550
Just take a break for a few days.

140
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,980
I'm sure you could use one.

141
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,380
It does sound nice.

142
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,250
But I can't.

143
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,180
Okay.

144
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,160
Have a safe flight.

145
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,820
But I could take - a later flight out tonight.

146
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,820
Perfect.

147
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,710
What are you doing?

148
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,320
I am buttoning my shirt.

149
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
The procedure was a success.

150
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,090
The CSF leak was fixed. What are you doing here?

151
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,600
Thought this was your day off.

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Lea said I'm not allowed to read medical journals,

153
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,070
and Dr. Blaize said you can't be discharged for two days.

154
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,190
Ah, yes, and yet the U.S. Constitution

155
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,380
says I can leave whenever I want.

156
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,520
I am sick and tired of being sick.

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,530
I'm sick and tired of being around sick people.

158
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,980
Surgery and radiation and blood draws,

159
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,120
CT's, MRIs...

160
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,960
I've had it. I need a break.

161
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,710
If you delay the chemotherapy,

162
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,760
you will weaken its effectiveness.

163
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,660
It'll be fine.

164
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,470
Y-you can't quit.

165
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,510
I'm not quitting, Shaun!

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,380
I'm just...

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,430
I appreciate your concern, but you just have no idea.

168
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,560
No, it hasn't had time to heal.

169
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,070
If it leaks, it would be bad.

170
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,440
You could develop a subdural hematoma --

171
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,400
And yet if I stay one more minute in this place,

172
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,280
I will lose my mind.

173
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,570
Where are you going?

174
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,600
Anywhere I don't smell iodoform.

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,240
- I'm coming with you. - You don't have to come with me.

176
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,290
I don't like that smell either.

177
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,350
But where are we going?

178
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,430
Are we friends?

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,780
- Yes. - Why?

180
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,950
'Cause I helped you through school,

181
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,690
because I helped you get a job?

182
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,890
Or is it because neither one of us have any other friends?

183
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,590
- You have lots of friends. - Who?

184
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,270
And if I did, why did I have somebody drive me around

185
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,630
who I barely know and

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,830
who I don't really like very much?

187
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,410
And by the way, why doesn't she have any other friends

188
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,510
besides you?

189
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,970
She does.

190
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,430
She goes out with people all the time.

191
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,120
And yet she slept on your floor for a month.

192
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,380
So unless the people she goes out with are homeless...

193
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,450
Hello, Lea.

194
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,870
You better not be studying.

195
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,410
- I'm not. - Good.

196
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,260
You want to come have lunch with me?

197
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,290
Lea wants us to have lunch with her.

198
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,070
Wait, us? Who are you with?

199
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,360
Dr. Glassman.

200
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,110
Fine. Glassy can come, too.

201
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,420
Glassy never said he wanted to come.

202
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,840
Tell him the food at my office is amazing.

203
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,660
Okay.

204
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,070
- She says that the food at her... - I'm not hungry!

205
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,500
Go. You just go.

206
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,750
I can't come.

207
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,940
Come on, Shaun. Please?

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,830
I'm having a really crappy day,

209
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,350
and you're, like, my only friend.

210
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,520
You know what? I changed my mind.

211
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,940
I would love to come and have lunch with your friend Lea.

212
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,850
Yes!

213
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,850
Okay, I will text you guys the address.

214
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,740
Diego Luis.

215
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,210
My pseudonym.

216
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,410
I think Latin names are sexy.

217
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,920
You might want to pace yourself.

218
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,510
We don't even have the menu yet.

219
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,390
I'll be fine.

220
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,270
I'm really sorry about that EMT.

221
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,690
Tyler, right?

222
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,000
I heard you guys were kinda close.

223
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,130
Well, you heard wrong. I barely even knew him.

224
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,880
Okay.

225
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,180
But as long as I'm here. If you want to talk about...

226
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,760
I don't. I wanted a brunch partner.

227
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,860
Not a shrink.

228
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,850
I'm not trying to be a shrink.

229
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm trying to be a decent human being.

230
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
Of course you are.

231
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,170
St. Claire to the rescue.

232
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,530
What is your problem?

233
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,810
You literally blackmailed me to be here,

234
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,950
and now you have the nerve to act like I am the one...

236
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,330
I'm gonna take this outside.

237
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,560
If you wanna just get the check that's fine with me.

238
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah!

239
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,130
Damn, I'm gonna have to wear a helmet next time I pitch to you.

240
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,640
- Yeah! - There you go.

241
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,880
You seeing anyone?

242
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,320
Sorry, don't mean to interrogate.

243
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,370
It's all right. And no, I'm not.

244
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,490
What about you?

245
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,060
Yeah, but it's nothing serious.

246
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,520
It's okay if it is.

247
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,870
I'd tell you if it was.

248
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,410
You don't have to tell me anything.

249
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,730
It's none of my business.

250
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,630
Could you imagine us ever getting back together?

251
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, sure.

252
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,270
I mean, the same way I can imagine what it's like

253
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,120
to walk across hot coals

254
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,800
or to be waterboarded or attacked by a great white...

255
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,640
All right, I get it. Very funny.

256
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,010
Dr. Andrews, can I help you?

257
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,970
I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.

258
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,800
Yes, we do. Thank you.

259
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,930
Any update? Anything I should know?

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,450
It's best if we wait until the investigation is complete

261
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,360
before discussing any findings.

262
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,890
You already have findings?

263
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,380
- None that I'm prepared to discuss. - Okay.

264
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,070
Although, I was a bit surprised to learn

265
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,460
that you have a part-time Chief of Surgery.

266
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,680
What're you talking about? I was here around the clock.

267
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
In your role as Chief of Surgery

268
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,260
or as the hospital's President?

269
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,620
My dual role was a benefit.

270
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,870
It sped up decision-making

271
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,010
and ensured that there was no miscommunication

272
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,210
between administration and the surgical staff.

273
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,680
Not to mention this is none of your business.

274
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,070
D.P.H. has no oversight of our management structure.

275
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,370
If it adversely affects patient care --

276
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,720
Oh, it didn't. And it never has.

277
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,370
You bureaucrats have no idea

278
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,260
how a hospital runs or what doctors and nurses

279
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,280
have to do on a daily basis

280
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,170
to provide optimum care for patients.

281
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
And you can tell that to the Governor.

282
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,440
I have to go.

283
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,020
Mimosas. Plural. That was the deal.

284
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,390
I've had one. You've had one quarter.

285
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,780
Yeah, well, my mom is getting evicted.

286
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,480
Fine. I'll come along.

287
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,770
I'm not lying. I have to help her move.

288
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,720
- I could use the exercise. - No.

289
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,690
- Two cars are better than one. - Stop.

290
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,540
What is going on?

291
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,710
You were right.

292
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,750
Tyler's death was... upsetting.

293
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,370
I can carry a lot. And I'm great with moms.

294
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,610
Okay.

295
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,310
She doesn't think I can be both President and Chief of Surgery.

296
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,380
Really?

297
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,330
You agree with her?

298
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,330
I never was a fan

299
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,800
of your staying on as Chief after your promotion.

300
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,720
You really think anything would've been different

301
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,850
if someone else was Chief during the outbreak?

302
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,730
You used to have more time to manage scheduling issues.

303
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,540
And staffing shortage did complicate our response.

304
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,100
Every hospital in this country is facing a nursing shortage.

305
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,850
I'm not gonna reverse my decision now.

306
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,530
I'd look like an indecisive fool.

307
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,200
Or like someone who's realized

308
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,100
they've made a mistake and reconsidered.

309
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
Welcome.

310
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,080
How are you not all 300 pounds?

311
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,030
We also have an amazing gym,

312
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,090
a basketball court, and an ice rink.

313
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,870
You have a very generous boss.

314
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,420
And idiot investors.

315
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,620
The founder's from Minnesota.

316
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,610
He's obsessed with hockey, so there's pickup at lunch

317
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,360
and a beer league after work.

318
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,290
- No Flying Glass Elevators? - Get anything you want.

319
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,740
There's also a pasta bar

320
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,020
and a deli and Spanish tapas next door.

321
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,050
And then we'll meet back out in the atrium for our feast.

322
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,530
Any of your co-workers gonna be joining us?

323
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,220
Why?

324
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,770
I don't know. Just trying to be social.

325
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,400
You didn't want to come, then you did.

326
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,600
What changed?

327
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,220
She always this suspicious?

328
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,610
I'm in the mood for Thai.

329
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,020
- Shaun? - No, thank you.

330
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,540
- Sherlock? - No.

331
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,810
Okay, so I'll see you two in a few.

332
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,580
By the way, the lobster rolls are amazing.

333
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,150
Thank you.

334
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,210
Since when do you eat bratwurst?

335
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh, thought I'd try something new.

336
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,410
- You a Bulls fan, Breeze? - Bulls?

337
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,920
Oh, no, that's from when I played South by Southwest

338
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,490
with Danny Attie's band.

339
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,000
That was Austin. The Bulls are from Chicago.

340
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,170
Mom, who else is living here?

341
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,720
It's someone else's mug, but he is not living here.

342
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,660
He just dropped you off after a date

343
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,410
and left his coffee mug and bratwurst behind by mistake?

344
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,830
What do you guys care?

345
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,230
Okay, I am not a child. It's my damn apartment.

346
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,190
Yeah, and it was my money that was supposed to be paying for it.

347
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,660
What was it this time?

348
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,110
You guys were gonna start a new record label?

349
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,600
A restaurant? What?

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,260
I didn't rip you off. And he didn't rip me off.

351
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,740
I was just a little late.

352
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,000
So you're getting evicted

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
because your landlord is a stickler for prompt payments.

354
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,740
It's the truth.

355
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,330
Mom, why the hell do you have to get out of here so fast?

356
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,040
There is no way it's because of a mean landlord.

357
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,400
Because he beat my ass,

358
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,160
and I'm terrified that he's gonna do it again.

359
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,130
And I'm not going to the cops.

360
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,190
I just want to get the hell out of this apartment

361
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,920
and never come back. That's it.

362
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,930
Putting's all about process.

363
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,600
Apparently not.

364
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,300
Front nine's for posers. Back nine's for closers.

365
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,380
You just know I hate that movie,

366
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,540
and you're trying to get me off my game.

367
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,500
But it's not gonna work.

368
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,350
Nice.

369
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,760
So, what's she do?

370
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,690
This woman you're not serious about?

371
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,270
Come on. You started it.

372
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,190
And it was a mistake.

373
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,370
All right, what about work?

374
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,840
Kellan said one of the other residents has autism?

375
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,620
Yeah. Dr. Murphy.

376
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,560
So what's he like?

377
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,950
He's a bit immature. But nice.

378
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,210
Wow, I feel like I totally know him now.

379
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,210
Sorry, I just don't want to talk about work.

380
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,210
Or your personal life.

381
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,790
But I would like to talk about something other than your putting process.

382
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,930
What's going on in your life? How are you doing?

383
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,630
I'm doing great. Everything's fine.

384
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,910
Come on, Mia. I'm just trying to relax.

385
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,010
Have some fun.

386
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,950
This is exactly why we broke up.

387
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,660
That's not how I remember it.

388
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,340
I made a mistake.

389
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
But we were broken long before that.

390
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,740
'Cause I didn't like to talk about work?

391
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,120
You decided to leave the police force and become a doctor,

392
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,350
and the first I heard of it

393
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,480
is when you told me you got into med school.

394
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,340
Most people would think that's a step up.

395
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,400
Be supportive.

396
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,900
How could I support a man I never saw?

397
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,490
And when I did see you, we didn't talk.

398
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,650
It's like everything in your life

399
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,180
can only be divulged on a "Need to know" basis.

400
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,720
And I never needed to know.

401
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,420
Found this in the trash.

402
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,530
An old pay stub for Carnell Hunter.

403
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,930
- I say we pay him a visit. - And do what?

404
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,350
Give him a stern lecture that'll teach him to respect women?

405
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,780
We need to make it clear that abusing, stalking,

406
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,160
or in any way bothering your mom ever again

407
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,770
will be more trouble than it's worth.

408
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,700
You're a bit out of your element here.

409
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,350
We're not dealing with some frat boy or creepy surgeon.

410
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,010
The guys my mom dates are psychos.

411
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,490
So you just want to do nothing? Let him get away with it?

412
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,100
If she doesn't want to involve the police,

413
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,480
there's nothing we can do about it.

414
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,180
Let's just help her get out of this mess and be done with it.

415
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,300
No. I'm not as clueless as you think.

416
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,250
I had a stalker in med school.

417
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,860
The guy was scary.

418
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,110
Which is why now I never go anywhere without this.

419
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,190
What the hell?

420
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,020
Don't worry. It's legal. I have a C.C.W.

421
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,390
So what're you gonna do? Pop a cap in his ass?

422
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,400
No. We just need to send him a message.

423
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,680
And studies have shown that men are more likely to be visual learners.

424
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,820
Give me your key.

425
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,400
- Why? - I want to lock this.

426
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,990
We're leaving the car together.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,900
- How am I gonna get it? - Key.

428
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,580
You're the one who insisted the guy was so dangerous.

429
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,330
I'm sure he is.

430
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,330
But you with a gun - is even more frightening.

431
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,910
Here. Go ahead.

432
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,600
How come you're St. Claire with everyone but your mom?

433
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,850
Stop calling me St. Claire.

434
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,460
And you don't know my mom.

435
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,210
I know it's not her fault she's bipolar.

436
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,070
Feeling any better?

437
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,180
Actually, I am.

438
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,020
Nothing like a good B.M. to turn a frown upside down.

439
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,610
I've been thinking about what you said this morning.

440
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,980
About how competitive I always am.

441
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,450
And the more I think about it, the angrier I get.

442
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,380
All I was trying to say --

443
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,660
I have been nothing but professional with you.

444
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,910
And for the record, you're the one who invited me out for drinks.

445
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,330
You're the one who wanted to go back to my apartment.

446
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,180
And now you're the one who's acting differently

447
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,750
just because we had sex.

448
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,230
You need to project more, use your diaphragm

449
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,260
if you really want - the entire hospital to hear you.

450
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,430
I definitely won't go out of my way to be nice to you again.

451
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,600
He doesn't trust me.

452
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,540
I mean, why?

453
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,230
Is he that way with everybody or just me?

454
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,790
Can you help me convince him

455
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,110
to start his chemotherapy on schedule?

456
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,130
You want me to convince a brain surgeon, who doesn't like me,

457
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,410
that I know the best way to treat his tumor?

458
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,530
Yes.

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,450
Maybe just be supportive, Shaun.

460
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,760
He just wants some time.

461
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,920
No. He doesn't have time. You don't understand.

462
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,350
Actually, I do understand.

463
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,210
And I'm getting really tired of people treating me like I don't.

464
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,220
I know how you feel.

465
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,590
Where's your food?

466
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,180
Too many options. I got confused.

467
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,720
You find out why no one wants to eat with me?

468
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,970
Still snooping.

469
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,150
Okay. We all need to do something fun.

470
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,990
Either of you need a refill?

471
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,160
No, thanks.

472
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,370
I'm good.

473
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,830
Neither do I.

474
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,440
But I'm gonna get one anyways.

475
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,050
I'll be in the arcade when you two are

476
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,590
done with whatever you need to deal with.

477
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,800
Regretting your invite now?

478
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,770
No. It's just, um...

479
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,770
Maybe we should think about trying to get back together.

480
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,230
Are you insane?

481
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,670
We can't even spend half a day together without a fight.

482
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,700
Yeah, I'm sorry. I do respect you.

483
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,410
Which is exactly why I need you back in my life.

484
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,160
To remind me who I can be.

485
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,430
Come on, Alex.

486
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,430
You've just been through a traumatic experience.

487
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,130
You're exhausted... and lonely.

488
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,390
But...

489
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,810
I love you.

490
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,850
Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll do it.

491
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,530
Thank you.

492
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,860
I know how hard it is for you to open up.

493
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,410
I love you, too.

494
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,670
But I think it's best if we just

495
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,330
keep moving forward with our lives.

496
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,160
- Carnell Hunter? -Yeah?

497
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,490
We need to talk.

498
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,450
Yeah, well, I need to do my job. So

499
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,970
unless you got a badge, I ain't interested.

500
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,290
Time for a break.

501
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,940
Because we need to tell you something,

502
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,880
and we want to make sure you're listening.

503
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,150
Well, I'd get out of my face if I were you.

504
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,840
Or what? You gonna beat my ass?

505
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,690
Who the hell are you?

506
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,450
Breeze Browne is my mom.

507
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,200
She's moving out of the apartment today.

508
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,350
And she never wants to see you again.

509
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,310
What are you talking about?

510
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,910
You're a disgusting, pathetically weak coward.

511
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,900
You know it. And every woman you've ever been with knows it, too.

512
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,940
I don't know what you're talking about,

513
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,710
but I would never lay my hands on a woman.

514
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,280
Especially Breeze.

515
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,490
I mean, she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

516
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,080
I love her.

517
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,540
You guys all memorize the same speech, don't you?

518
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,210
Why do you think I asked her to marry me?

519
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,130
Oh, she didn't tell you?

520
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,050
What did she tell you?

521
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,900
You had no right to butt in.

522
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,240
The poor guy was almost in tears.

523
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,990
Which is exactly why I couldn't tell him to his face.

524
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,830
He's just... He's so darn sensitive about everything.

525
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,160
So you thought disappearing into the night

526
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,730
would make it easier for him?

527
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,610
I know, you're right. It's just...

528
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,450
I don't want to marry him.

529
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,550
So tell him you're not ready.

530
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,540
You want to take things slower.

531
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,630
He's one of the sweetest men I've ever met.

532
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,210
So why are you trying to ghost him?

533
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,890
I don't know.

534
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,970
Mom...

535
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Dr. Andrews, we have some findings.

536
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,690
I'm excited to hear them.

537
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,460
And I just wanted to say, with regard to the staffing issu--

538
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,010
I wouldn't worry about that anymore.

539
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,140
Uh, Dr. Audrey Lim non-consensually dosed a man

540
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,760
who was not even a patient with Haldol,

541
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,270
which is not only unethical, it's a crime.

542
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,100
And Dr. Neil Melendez ignored a written DNR,

543
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,670
which is also a crime.

544
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,400
And I've just reviewed a video

545
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,320
showing Dr. Shaun Murphy curled up on the E.R. floor

546
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,890
in the fetal position.

547
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,310
Dr. Murphy has autism,

548
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,000
which on extremely rare occasions impacts his...

549
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,770
Ability to provide the proper standard of care?

550
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,080
I'll be recommending all three

551
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,740
to the State Medical Board for license suspension.

552
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,870
Bumper cars? I'd rather go ice skating.

553
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,470
I don't want to do either.

554
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,560
All right, these aren't bumper cars, smartass.

555
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,030
They're electric sprint-karts.

556
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,640
NASCAR drivers train in them.

557
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,400
We use them to test our device prototypes,

558
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,560
and they haul ass.

559
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,770
This is a very bad idea.

560
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,820
If the skull base repair doesn't hold...

561
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,690
I could get a subdural hematoma.

562
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,220
Yes, we've established that.

563
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,570
I don't know what that means.

564
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,140
But I do know both of you drove on the freeway to get here.

565
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,910
If it's safe, why do we have to wear...

566
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,900
Enough negativity. Both of you.

567
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,120
You didn't blow off Blaize just to go out

568
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,790
for a walk or a nice lunch.

569
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,400
It's time to crank up the volume on this day off.

570
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,340
I don't want to drive a go-kart.

571
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,970
I don't believe you.

572
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,550
I think you do want to drive a go-kart.

573
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,590
You just don't want me to drive a go-kart.

574
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,910
You know what? I'm in.

575
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,120
Okay.

That was awesome.

602
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,770
I still beat your ass, but you improved your time every lap.

603
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,540
Thank you.

604
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,290
You did, too, Shaun.

605
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,180
Are you OK?

606
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,480
- I'm fine.  - You sure?

607
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,950
You look a little glassy-eyed, Glassy.

608
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,100
No, I think I just have something in my eye.

609
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,450
Do you have any dizziness or a metallic taste?

610
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,910
I'm fine, Shaun.

611
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,690
I'm...You know what? I'm better than fine.

612
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,070
I'm good.

613
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,070
He's good.

614
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,950
Yes!

615
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,660
Come on, Shaun.

616
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,670
I was wrong.

617
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,980
From the moment we met,

618
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,390
my defensiveness was unprofessional

619
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,550
and my subsequent behavior even worse.

620
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,190
I was not aware Dr. Lim dosed a hospital visitor.

621
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,890
Or that Dr. Melendez violated a DNR.

622
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
But that's my fault.

623
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,950
Neither of them made any attempt to hide their actions.

624
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,120
Because they both are totally committed to doing

625
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,940
whatever it takes to provide the utmost care for their patients.

626
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,740
Practicing medicine requires doctors to make judgments.

627
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,570
Not just follow rules.

628
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,280
Two human beings

629
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,950
who would otherwise be dead are alive

630
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,870
because of rules broken by Lim and Melendez.

631
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,970
They were doing their jobs.

632
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,180
They shouldn't be punished for that.

633
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,540
They should be applauded.

634
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,850
I'll be notifying the State Board of our findings.

635
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,690
It'll then be up to those doctors to decide.

636
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,020
They'll leave us bureaucrats out of it.

637
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,570
See you at the hearing.

638
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,210
I screwed up.

639
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,630
No, you did the right thing. We both did.

640
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,900
I wasn't talking about this stupid investigation.

641
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,390
I was talking about us.

642
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,980
Ever since my divorce, I can't help but think...

643
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,190
no matter how real this feels, it's not.

644
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,120
I have feelings for you.

645
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,370
I have for a long time.

646
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,290
And it scares me.

647
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,040
But I don't want the night we spent together to be our last.

648
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,880
I feel the same way.

649
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,430
But I'm not sure it's -- it's a good idea.

650
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,020
Especially now since we're both gonna be under a microscope.

651
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
Yeah, that is true.

652
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,990
Of course, if, for the time being,

653
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,280
we just made sure that Andrews and everyone else

654
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,320
doesn't know...

655
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,870
Interesting idea.

656
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,880
Good night, Neil.

657
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,760
Good night, Audrey.

658
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,310
Thank you.

659
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm glad you were here. It helped.

660
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,610
No problem.

661
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,090
And also, um, you're not clueless.

662
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,860
I am.

663
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,580
You carry a gun.

664
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,130
And you practically dared that guy

665
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,660
to take a swing at you.

666
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,100
I volunteered at a battered women's shelter in med school,

667
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,890
and I'm not an expert,

668
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,710
and I'm definitely - not trying to be a shrink,

669
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,510
but if you ever need someone to talk to.

670
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,760
About anything.

671
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,520
Thank you.

672
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,980
It was a good day.

673
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,940
I need to return the favor, have you meet my mom.

674
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,030
That's a date.

675
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,750
I decided not to postpone the chemo.

676
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,460
That's a good idea.

677
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,440
In fact, I'm gonna speed it up.

678
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm gonna go for a-a much more aggressive regimen.

679
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,640
- But Dr. Blaize - Dr. Blaize will have to agree.

680
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,240
Or I'll get another doctor.

681
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,330
I want to get this over with.

682
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,730
I want to have more days like today.

683
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,330
And you should do the same.

684
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,580
- I don't have cancer. - Exactly.

685
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,070
You have no excuse.

686
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,660
Lea's okay, huh?

687
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,450
She gets you.

688
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,140
Yes. I get her, too. She's a good friend.

689
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,960
You think she'll ever be more than that?

690
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,020
She only wants to be my friend.

691
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,630
She made that very clear.

692
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,060
You're a good man, you know.

693
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,640
Deserve to be happy.

694
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,530
Well, thanks again for staying.

695
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,330
It was nice.

696
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,040
It was.

697
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,370
Well, bye.

698
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,420
You forget something?

699
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,110
No.

700
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,990
Maybe you're right.

701
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,740
We could try to slowly and cautiously test the waters.

702
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,200
I would love that.

703
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,000
Maybe in a couple weeks I could come back for a weekend.

704
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,250
On my own.

705
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,550
Definitely.

706
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,640
I'll call you.

707
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:18,910
Shaun?

708
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,200
I thought you were gonna hang with Glassy tonight.

709
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,540
I did. But he got tired.

710
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,770
Is there any more beer? I'd like to try one.

711
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,710
Yeah, there's more in the fridge.

712
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,550
How many beers have you drunk?

713
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,300
Just this one. Why?

714
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,390
Oh, no.

715
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,230
that's Jake's.

716
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,750
Jake, meet my totally cool roomie, Shaun Murphy.

717
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,280
Shaun, meet Jake.

718
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,990
Hello.

719
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,840
It's nice to meet you.

720
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,210
Uh, Lea's told me a lot about you.

721
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,780
He's such a sweetheart.

722
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,220
Well, we gotta run.

723
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,540
Jake's taking me to Death Cab for Cutie.

724
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,890
- Take it easy, Shaun. - And don't wait up.

725
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,250
We're probably gonna be out late.
