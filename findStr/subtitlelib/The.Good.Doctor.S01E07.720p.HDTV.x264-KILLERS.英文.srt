21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,500
Come on. Is the system down?

22
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,950
Worked fine for me.

23
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,150
I don't have time for this.

24
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,630
How you doing?

25
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,240
The computer is not working.

26
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,760
That's not what I'm talking about.

27
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,520
I know. I'm fine.

28
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,850
A patient died because of something you did.

29
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,340
I think it's safe to say the one thing you are not is "Fine."

30
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm dealing.

31
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,790
How exactly are you dealing?

32
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,670
I'm getting back to work,

33
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,630
I have a diabetic toe to debride,

34
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,070
and I'm putting it behind me.

35
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,360
How do you do that -- put it behind you?

36
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,780
By moving forward.

37
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,390
- I appreciate your concern. - You're welcome.

38
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm gonna make an appointment for you for grief counseling.

39
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,580
Dr. Mohan -- She's an expert in dealing with hospital staff

40
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,060
who have experienced stressful events.

41
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,190
That's not necessary.

42
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,500
You agree you had a "Stressful event"?

43
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,690
And while I am comforted

44
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,350
by your commitment to move forward by not looking back,

45
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,460
I still want you to see Dr. Mohan.

46
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,870
If she says that you are fine,

47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,380
then -- and only then -- can you go back to surgery.

48
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,960
It's working now.

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,380
You just have to be patient.

50
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
Heart rate 36.

51
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,260
Push another five milligrams of morphine and prep a nitro drip.

52
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,990
We need atropine on board stat.

53
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,950
What do you got for me?

54
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,660
An MI with severe bradycardia.

55
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,340
He's had aspirin, nitro,

56
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,540
and now we're trying to give him a real rate with atropine.

57
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,470
Cardiology see him?

58
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,640
He's got a broken pacemaker

59
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,030
and probably needs his coronary arteries cleared --

60
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,670
feels like a triple bypass, but you're the expert.

61
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,510
BNP is sky high.

62
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,410
What do you see?

63
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,340
His ventricles are barely pumping.

64
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,570
He's had two massive prior MIs.

65
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,680
End stage heart failure.

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,340
His heart's way beyond repair.

67
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,290
What are our options?

68
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,820
He's 73 years old.

69
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,870
His age is an absolute contraindication for transplant.

70
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,780
- He's dying. - Well, he's not dead yet.

71
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,690
What else?

72
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,140
How about cardiac resynchronization?

73
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,530
That will get what's left of both ventricles working together.

74
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,920
A biventricular pacer?

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,070
It should make him feel a little better in the few months he's got left.

76
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,870
His rate drops any lower, he'll arrest.

77
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,140
Claire, prep his jugular to float in a temporary pacemaker.

78
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,660
Shaun, call up to the cath lab

79
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,240
and have them get an estimate on how long it'll take

80
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
to get the bi-pacer in house.

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,260
Something wrong?

82
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,320
Not at all.

83
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,480
Just a little bit too much coffee this morning.

84
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,900
Let's go. Do it now.

85
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,150
Restraints, please!

86
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,730
I don't want to get stuck with a needle.

87
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,300
You're scaring him.

88
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,290
You're scaring him.

89
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,860
Haldol, five milligrams.

90
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,890
You're scaring him!

91
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,430
- Who are you? - Dr. Shaun Murphy.

92
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
This patient is psychotic, Dr. Murphy.

93
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,530
He's not psychotic.

94
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,690
You don't like people touching you.

95
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,530
He's not psychotic. He's autistic.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,280
You're being an excellent patient.

97
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,410
Okay. We're finished.

98
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,170
You're s-same as...

99
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,510
me.

100
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,650
Can we release his hands?

101
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,920
Dr. Murphy? His hands?

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,090
I'm here, son -- Mom and Dad are here.

103
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,570
You can let go of his hands. He won't hurt you.

104
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,000
Wrong stop. Wrong stop.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Can someone tell me what happened?

106
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,390
Liam has a 5.4 centimeter laceration on his forehead,

107
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,830
probably from a fall.

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,900
The wound was infiltrated with five milliliters of 1% lidocaine...

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,210
7 -- 7 single-interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures.

110
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,350
He will have a small scar,

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,930
but no other long-term effects from this injury.

112
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,350
You're my son's doctor.

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,990
I am. Dr. Shaun Murphy -- "Shaun" with a U.

114
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,930
Got lost -- got lost, got lost, got lost, got lost!

115
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,410
- Yes, yes. Yes. But you're okay. - Got lost. Got lost, got lost.

116
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,030
You won't be taking that bus again.

117
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,660
This light is too bright.

118
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,960
These rooms make him anxious. Can we take him home?

119
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,660
No.

120
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,180
Your son is jaundiced,

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,890
clenching his right abdominal muscles when touched and febrile.

122
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,110
He should not go home.

123
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,390
Why am I here?

124
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,870
Your pacemaker malfunctioned.

125
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,420
You had a heart attack.

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,250
I...I think I get that part.

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320
Your neighbor's gardener saw you on the ground inside your house --

128
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,130
called 911, saved your life.

129
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,520
Well, I must remember to thank him.

130
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,500
How old are you?

131
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,320
Me?

132
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,550
I know how old I am.

133
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm 28.

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,320
We have, uh, a biventricular pacer on its way,

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,870
and it's gonna make you feel a lot better.

136
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,760
Is it?

137
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,700
I will be back to prep you for surgery.

138
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,790
Liam has elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes,

139
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,880
a white cell count of 23.

140
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,340
Abdominal ultrasound shows dilatation of the bile ducts.

141
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,410
Sounds like ascending cholangitis --

142
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,650
can lead to sepsis if the bacteria gain access to his blood.

143
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,750
Is he stable now?

144
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,270
Yes, his vital signs are stable.

145
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,100
Cause could be anything from cancer to diet, so --

148
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,630
High-fat diets can cause obstructive gallstones,

149
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,330
which could have set the whole thing off.

150
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,890
Do an ERCP to clear him.

151
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,230
After that, a few weeks of broad spectrum antibiotics

152
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,610
should take care of things.

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,500
I want you help.

159
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,310
With what?

160
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,480
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography.

161
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,440
ERCP? Why?

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,050
You've done those before, Shaun.

163
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,560
You're good with people who have autism.

164
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,770
Okay, Glen, let's get this, star...ted

165
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
Glen, you almost finished?

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
It's Dr. Kalu.

167
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,510
Glen?

168
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah, we have a code green.

169
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,280
Patient is Caucasian, male, 185 pounds.

170
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,260
Shaun, can you talk to him or something?

171
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,760
I can't push the Midazolam.

172
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,520
Four lights...four doors.

173
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,220
Yes. Lots of things.

174
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,220
32, 8. 32, 8.

175
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,910
32 is the number of cabinet windows,

176
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,510
and 8 is the number of handles.

177
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,980
the end title's CO2 is rising.

178
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,520
He needs oxygen. He has respiratory depression.

179
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,310
It's a common reaction to Midazolam.

180
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,190
CO2 is coming down.

181
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,820
-You can proceed, Claire. -Thank you.

182
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,930
Have you been around a lot of other autistic people?

183
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,160
I've never met someone with autism.

184
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,960
So, it must be nice to spend some time around Liam, then.

185
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,130
Why?

186
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
Why would that be nice?

187
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,080
Okay.

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,280
There are no stones.

189
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,640
Where are the stones?

190
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,260
And there is scarring.

191
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,160
This has nothing to do with gallstones.

192
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
The entire biliary tree is so thick with scarring

193
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,180
we can't even get the camera through.

194
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,600
The differential diagnosis for biliary tree scarring includes

195
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,470
primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver failure,

196
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,510
secondary to primary biliary cirrhosis --

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,370
Yeah, Shaun, we can add a few cancers to that list as well --

198
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,760
It's a long and ugly one.

199
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,510
Find another way to figure out what it is.

200
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,670
We could do an MRI.

201
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,710
No, we couldn't.

202
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,220
It's not possible.

203
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,570
That's the first time I've ever heard you say that.

204
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,300
-Liam is stimming. -Stimming?

205
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,640
The tics and spasms are a neurological response to stress.

206
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,630
If he's doing an MRI, there is stress --

207
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,980
if there is stress, he won't keep still,

208
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
if he wont' keep still, we can't do an MRI.

209
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,210
Therefore, it is impossible.

210
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,830
Maybe if you just keep talking to him like that,

211
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,870
he'll doze off and it'll all be simple.

212
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,310
Give him a mild sedative.

213
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,020
He didn't respond well to Midazolam during ERCP --

214
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,290
depresses his breathing.

215
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,970
His respiratory saturation can't be properly monitored inside --

216
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,780
I get it.

217
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,700
He could die in the MRI and we wouldn't know.

218
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,010
You're just gonna have to find a different way to calm him.

219
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,120
Okay. We'll do it.

220
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,130
Guess he has an idea.

221
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,070
We have a code green.

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,460
Patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age.

223
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,250
Shaun, what are you doing?

224
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,130
Counting.

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,850
- Counting what? - Distance.

226
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,060
Why?

227
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,080
I want $1,643.

228
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,980
You can get that by counting?

229
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,150
That's why you're alone and pacing in this room?

230
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,510
What do you want the money for?

231
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,060
I want to buy a television.

232
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,000
$1,600 for a television?

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,530
And 43. I am a surgeon. I get paychecks.

234
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,070
You're not a surgeon yet. You're a surgical resident.

235
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,770
Ah, there's a big difference in the paycheck there, pal.

236
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,880
I'm not a child, pal.

237
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,740
How 'bout $1,000 for a television?

238
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,640
No. The one I want is $1,643, okay?

239
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,560
I know, but you have a budget.

240
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,590
- A budget. You -- - Uh, rent, food, bills to pay.

241
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,850
I should do my own budget. I have an MRI to do.

242
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,920
These are live feeds -- entrances, E.R., receiving dock.

243
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
If your patient had left, we would've seen it.

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Then where'd he go?

245
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,150
A freight elevator, but we don't have cams in the freights,

246
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,480
and he doesn't pop back up.

247
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,880
So, we're dealing with an alien abduction here?

248
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,300
Sorry.

249
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,530
We don't have cams on the freight elevators

250
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,840
on levels one, four and five, and the basement.

251
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,470
And you got people looking on those floors?

252
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,820
We've covered four and five, and we're moving on to one.

255
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,850
What's in the basement?

256
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,590
Pediatric patient lost a blanket --

257
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm just gonna check lost and found.

258
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,920
That's nice of you.

259
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,520
While you're there,

260
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,440
you might want to check if they found your code green.

261
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,890
This is Doctor...

262
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,450
This is Shaun.

263
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,490
I can hear you when you speak.

264
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,720
I was thinking about something.

265
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,900
There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

266
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,930
Please turn down the lights. That helps calm him.

267
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,600
There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

268
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,510
There are 22 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

269
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,070
He has very long strides.

270
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,760
Yes.

271
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,900
There are 22 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

272
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,670
There are 37 steps from the elevator to room 405.

273
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,650
There are 37 steps

274
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,030
from the elevator to room 405.

275
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,950
In room 405, there are 6 steps to the sink...

276
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,800
6 steps to the sink.

277
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,030
We're getting good images.

278
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,870
It's amazing how accomplished you are for someone with ASD.

279
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,940
Three steps to the window.

280
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,260
Three steps to --

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,250
Three...

282
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,920
It's seven steps -- It's seven steps to the door.

283
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,900
Liam, there are seven steps to the door.

284
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,650
You need to get him out.

285
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,700
Just a little more time.

286
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,690
He's scared.

287
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,420
It's okay to be scared. We need to finish this.

288
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,760
- Seven - You're doing wonderfully, honey.

289
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,590
Just breathe. Just breathe.

290
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,760
No, it's seven steps to the door.

291
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,030
Glen?

292
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,730
Glen?

293
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,960
Glen?

294
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,110
Glen?

295
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,390
It's Dr. Kalu.

296
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's get you upstairs.

297
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,340
Go away.

298
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,300
We're gonna get your new pacer in.

299
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,340
Don't you get it?

300
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,940
I broke my pacer on purpose.

301
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,290
I want to die.

302
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,060
With a new pacemaker, maybe you'll feel better.

303
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,860
So, I'll be cured?

304
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Good as new?

305
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,340
Well, it'll reduce your pain, and then hopefully --

306
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,370
You think this is the first time I've heard that?

307
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,950
It's always the "Next best thing."

308
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,480
The truth is I'll just keep getting worse.

309
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,590
I know it, you know it.

310
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,270
Do you have any family you can talk to?

311
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,700
Brother's dead. I don't have a wife.

312
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,950
So, no, there's no one around to nag me

313
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,780
into doing what you want.

314
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,660
We have great counseling services here.

315
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,350
I'm in pain, 28 --

316
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,040
all the time.

317
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,430
Talk therapy gonna talk that away?

318
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,820
Let's get you upstairs.

319
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,500
You color's not good, and your lungs are crackling,

320
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,920
which means there's fluid building in --

321
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,160
I know my...

322
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,020
I know my rights.

323
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,370
I don't have to get treatment if I don't want it.

324
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,930
The minute I catch my breath, I'm gonna walk out of here,

325
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,350
so you can just leave.

326
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm not leaving.

327
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,320
We can't treat it until we find the underlying cause.

328
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,220
How do you do that?

329
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,260
Surgically -- It's called "Exploratory laparoscopy."

330
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,570
We use a camera to navigate Liam's midsection.

331
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,050
There are significant risks --

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,210
perforation of an organ,

333
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,910
accidental spread seeding malignancy.

334
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,880
And you have to do this

335
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,510
because he can't stay still during an MRI?

336
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,820
You obviously know your son better than I do.

337
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,420
Do you think we should try again?

338
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,290
So, Shaun told me he's getting a TV --

339
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,100
70 inches, all the works.

340
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,140
Is he now?

341
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,890
It's just a TV.

342
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,440
It's not about a TV.

343
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,060
Why are you so worried about him?

344
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,710
He showed up late for work half a dozen times,

345
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,090
he calls me 2:00 in the morning

346
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,600
'cause he can't find a screwdriver,

347
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,420
and his superintendent wants to kick him out of his building.

348
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,340
- Did you show up? - What?

349
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,520
At 2:00 in the morning when he called you

350
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,410
about a lost screwdriver,

351
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,260
did you show up?

352
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,470
He was frantic. I didn't know what he was gonna do.

353
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,330
There are 47 residents here,

354
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,340
and all of them show up late sometimes,

355
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,450
all of them make mistakes,

356
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,300
and hopefully, all of them learn.

357
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,160
If you want to worry about Shaun, fine.

358
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,620
But you fought to hire him

359
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,820
because you know he can learn.

360
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,480
The question is, are you willing to let him?

361
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,600
Shaun?

362
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,850
I can see the pixelation.

363
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,710
- That's great. Listen. - It's not great.

364
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,230
It's not good.

365
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,650
On a high-quality display,

366
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,500
the human eye at 20/20 cannot detect the pixels.

367
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,460
You disappeared after the failed MRI.

368
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,150
I failed.

369
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,870
Yeah, see, I don't think it's about that.

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,420
You were hesitant with this kid even before that.

371
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,240
You asked me to the ERCP.

372
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,120
Doctors don't have to like their patients, Claire.

373
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,830
- You don't like him? - I don't know him.

374
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,550
Shaun, there's something else going on here.

375
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,450
- I know you know that. - No. Nu-- Nu-huh.

376
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,920
He has the same condition you have.

377
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,570
You have never met anyone with --

378
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,900
Do you like all people with psoriasis?

379
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,050
I don't have --

380
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,050
Yes, you do.

381
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,480
And you can never get rid of it.

382
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,910
Okay.

383
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,390
It's too bad you don't like him,

384
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,340
because I think he likes you.

385
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,780
Not only that, I think he looks up to you.

386
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,240
So you know how he thinks?

387
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,350
Well, not as much as you probably do.

388
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,770
What are you waiting for?

389
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,770
For you to pass out.

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,290
Judging by the size your ankles...

391
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,570
that shouldn't be too long from now.

392
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,990
Then hopefully I can get you upstairs before you die.

393
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,380
Why do you give such a damn about what I do with my life?

394
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,780
I don't know, Glen.

395
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,720
Why'd you want to die so bad?

396
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,660
I've lived.

397
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,460
I've had decent jobs,

398
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,740
and I've had jobs that went nowhere.

399
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,450
Had a good roof over my head,

400
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,580
and I've had that good roof taken away from me.

401
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,230
I loved a girl, and I got married.

402
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,470
The 20 happiest years of my life...

403
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,120
then she died.

404
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,380
And now I'm alone

405
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,190
and in pain.

406
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,580
Feels like the end of the story.

407
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,170
I understand.

408
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,300
Yeah?

409
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,460
You've had some tough times, too, 28?

410
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,140
Nobody understands what it's like to be so good-looking and successful?

411
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,520
I was raised by nannies and housekeepers.

412
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,030
Oh, my God.

413
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,400
You're an ass.

414
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,010
Your point is you didn't suffer

415
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,420
because you were good-looking and smart --

416
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,040
you suffered because you were rich?

417
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,950
The only time I ever saw my parents was Christmas.

418
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,020
Seriously, the story continues?

419
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,240
They had this big party every year,

420
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,890
and wherever they were traveling they'd always fly home for it.

421
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,900
And I'd have to come home, too,

422
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,950
from whatever school they sent me off to.

423
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,490
When I was 18, I decided that I was fed up.

424
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,070
I was a man, done being their son.

425
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,500
And I was gonna tell them publicly,

426
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,240
tell all their friends what horrible people they were.

427
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,450
So I came home from school, and I knocked on the door,

428
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,890
and someone answered.

429
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,940
But it wasn't my parents. It was a stranger.

430
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,770
Turns out they'd sold the house months ago.

431
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,730
They were gone.

432
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,690
I guess they were done with me, too.

433
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,960
To prep Liam for the laparoscopy,

434
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,740
we need to make four small incisions in his stomach.

435
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,030
I don't need to do it.

436
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,520
I-I don't need to do it.

437
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,490
- Liam, you do need to. - I don't need to!

438
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,940
If you could just hold still for a second, Liam.

439
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,080
The -- the bus driver lets me off.

440
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,400
I-I get lost --

441
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,280
You're safe now.

442
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,840
I get lost. I'm hungry.

443
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,110
I can't make food.

444
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,630
C-C-Can't do bath -- Don't need to do it!

445
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,060
C-C-Can't do food -- C-Can't put on clothes.

446
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,030
Can't do bus.

447
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,560
I took the bus.

448
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,390
I got off at the wrong stop,

449
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,200
and I got scared, but then I found my way.

450
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,340
I did an MRI, and a man got hurt.

451
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,570
I made a mistake. I make a lot of mistakes.

452
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,120
You tried to walk.

453
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,140
You made a mistake.

454
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,970
But mistakes are good. You should make more.

455
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,870
You're like me.

456
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,480
You have red eyes -- uveitis.

457
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
Liam takes vitamins --

458
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,280
Does Liam also take herbal supplements?

459
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,660
Kava root. Why?

460
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,570
He doesn't need the laparoscopic surgery.

461
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,080
I know what's wrong with him.

462
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,960
The red eyes -- they're caused by an immune flare-up,

463
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,730
which can create the scarring that we're seeing in his digestive system.

464
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,520
The solution requires us to go in

465
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,950
and remove damaged segments of the bowel piece by piece.

466
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,900
Us?

467
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,970
Yes, myself and my team.

468
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,970
Is Dr. Murphy on your team?

469
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,960
Of course.

470
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,380
Thank you for diagnosing our son.

471
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,310
Dr. Melendez, you have our permission to do the surgery,

472
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,590
but in no way will Dr. Murphy be in it.

473
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,030
Well, the parents -- they won't budge.

474
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,640
They don't believe that anyone who has autism

475
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,010
is capable do doing surgery.

476
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,940
Well, clearly they're irrational --

477
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,270
I don't know -- shallow-minded people.

478
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,960
Who cares? What's the difference?

479
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,870
You agree with them, right?

480
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,220
Do you agree with them?

481
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,900
It's my team -- I don't want anybody telling me

482
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,330
who's supposed to be on my team,

483
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:20,900
including the Board.

484
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,530
You're not answering my question.

485
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,350
The question's moot.

486
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,300
Moot? No, it's not.

487
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,640
If you agree with them,

488
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,710
then the only issue is somebody stepping on your poor, little toes.

489
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,700
Get over it and go save the kid.

490
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,870
If you don't agree,

491
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,640
if you think Shaun can handle surgery,

492
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,420
then tell them that.

493
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,910
Tell them to go screw themselves.

494
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,950
Either they agree that Dr. Murphy belongs in that room with you,

495
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,700
or you can go find them someplace else to do the surgery.

496
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,190
I was an 18-year-old with no one and no money.

497
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,590
So I worked three jobs and took out loans.

498
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,780
Still alive.

499
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,190
That's not a bad story, 28.

500
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,760
What happened with the parents?

501
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,060
I talk to them now, but...

502
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,070
they're not the people who got me here.

503
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,410
It was the people I didn't expect --

504
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,220
the ex-Marine at the shelter who got me my first job,

505
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,950
and this crazy artist girl

506
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,330
who convinced me to go after what I really wanted.

507
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,450
When you think you're alone, Glen,

508
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,550
you're not.

509
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,060
All right.

510
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,720
All right?

511
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,920
Ready?

512
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,230
Two, three!

513
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,570
No disturbing dreams?

514
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,100
After a 36-hour shift?

515
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,890
From the moment my head hits the pillow

516
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,390
to the moment wake up,

517
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,150
all I see is black.

518
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,950
How's your level of concentration?

519
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,060
Have you had any difficulty focusing?

520
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,910
I mean, I can do the New York Times crossword puzzle in one sitting.

521
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,190
Sure, sometimes I wish I was more focused.

522
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,150
It's pretty normal, right?

523
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,960
Shaun's different.

524
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,110
He also has savant syndrome.

525
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,770
He has a remarkable memory.

526
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,160
He has autism, same as our son --

527
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,530
same limitations.

528
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,650
You saw what happened to our son in the MRI --

529
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,220
he knew he needed to lie still, but he couldn't.

530
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,510
Now, what happens if Dr. Murphy breaks down like that

531
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,870
while he's standing over my son at an operating table?

532
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,370
You know your son.

533
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,880
I know surgeons.

534
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,120
And after working with Dr. Murphy,

535
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,640
after challenging him in surgery and everywhere else --

536
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,290
probably more than he deserved --

537
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,270
I can tell you he has my compete confidence.

538
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm sorry.

539
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,710
He doesn't have ours.

540
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,800
So, what do we do now?

541
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,850
I've contacted my colleague at St. Joseph's,

542
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,270
updated her on Liam's condition.

543
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,870
They have good people.

544
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,620
We can arrange for transportation as soon as possible.

545
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,020
Where's my phone? Have you seen my phone?

546
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,200
Where's his second bag, the one with his medications?

547
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,460
I want...

548
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,240
I want...

549
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,210
What, honey?

550
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,680
He said I could do it.

551
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,330
I want Dr. Shaun.

552
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,620
Your pacemaker's here.

553
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,660
The techs are programming it as we speak.

554
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,530
The moment they're ready, we're gonna put it in.

555
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,430
I told you my wife died.

556
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,290
The truth is s-she left me.

557
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,910
But I gave her good reason for that,

558
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,150
so I got what I deserved.

559
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,790
- We all make -- But you didn't get what you deserved --

560
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,270
good parents who loved you.

561
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,840
They were lucky to have you, Jared.

562
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,520
You appear remarkably well-adjusted.

563
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,310
Thank you.

564
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,710
That's not a compliment.

565
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,180
That's my concern.

566
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,450
Well, I assume everyone responds differently.

567
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,610
The thing is everyone responds.

568
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,100
Strictly speaking,

569
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,970
you don't meet the criteria to be required to go into treatment

570
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,400
or take a leave of absence,

571
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,940
so I'm not gonna ground you.

572
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,390
You're a strong woman, Claire,

573
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,300
and that strength has undoubtedly played a major role

574
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,890
in getting you where you are.

575
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,610
But if you have suppressed feelings about this incident,

576
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,590
you need to find someone to share them with.

577
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,620
Because if not, they will eat you up

578
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,480
no matter how strong you are.

579
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,760
All right, Glen. Second ti--

580
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,920
Come on.

581
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,070
Thank you.

582
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,220
It should be a very interesting surgery.

583
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm glad I'm participating.

584
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,720
His pressure is bottoming out.

585
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,360
What's happening?

586
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,980
His bowel must have perforated.

587
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,990
He's going into septic shock.

588
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,880
This perforation could be anywhere.

589
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,290
What's the best way to access the entire bowel as quickly as possible?

590
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,780
Full-length midline incision.

591
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,960
Good. Mark it.

592
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,510
And what do we do once we get in there?

593
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,000
Eviscerate the entire bowel

594
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,700
so we can check every inch for necrotic segments.

595
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,510
Okay, let's make the cut.

596
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,530
You gonna take it or not?

597
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
This is the Number 3 L.

598
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,910
It's made of high carbon steel. It doesn't break.

599
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,600
That's correct, Dr. Murphy.

600
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,380
Time of incision -- 2:05 p.m.

601
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,930
We have a code green --

602
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,320
patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age.

603
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,300
Where'd he go?

604
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,150
Yeah, on my way.

605
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,090
I have a five-centimeter segment of proximal jejunum.

606
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,780
It's...sclerotic, but not perforated.

607
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,280
All right, mark it and move on.

608
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,910
Shaun, why are you just standing there?

609
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,990
We have 25 feet of bowel to run.

610
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,070
Shaun, you need to get moving -- unless you've found something.

611
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,170
- I have the perforation. - Clamp it off --

612
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,210
I'll get in there with the enterotomy scissors and remove the damaged segment.

613
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,150
I can't.

614
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,180
You can't? Why not?

615
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,650
It's a phlegmon.

616
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,900
You found a walled-off abscess?

617
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,010
It's large.

618
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,700
- Don't touch it. - I already am.

619
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,380
If you move and that thing ruptures,

620
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,430
the pus will spread to his entire abdominal cavity --

621
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,280
this boy dies.

622
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,100
I know, that's why I'm not moving.

623
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,870
Claire, I need you to open it up gently.

624
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,650
I'm gonna evacuate the septic contents,

625
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,310
flush the cavity with antibiotics,

626
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,040
and then I'm gonna have you remove the capsule.

627
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,160
I didn't do anything.

628
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,240
That's the pressure tanking.

629
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,980
You need to finish what you're doing right now.

630
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,440
Let's go, Claire. Come on.

631
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,770
Clamp.

632
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,910
You guys check left.

633
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,080
Come on.

634
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,050
Stop.

635
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,640
Come on, Glen.

636
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,200
We can do this.

637
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,430
I don't want to --

638
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,160
I just don't want to.

639
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,220
Please leave me alone.

640
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,340
Once I get my strength back, I'll climb up and jump.

641
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,230
I can't let you do that.

642
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,580
When this temporary pacer fails,

643
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,780
which it will,

644
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,850
your heart may stop and you die suddenly.

645
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,830
But more likely, Glen,

646
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,830
you slip back into that slow rhythm,

647
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,180
your chest is racked with excruciating pain

648
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,600
and your lungs start to fill with fluid,

649
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,390
and slowly you suffocate.

650
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,580
Give it a rest, 28.

651
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,660
Just get me a DNR and a cab.

652
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,510
You can't help me.

653
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,150
Yes, I can.

654
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,550
It was a difficult procedure.

655
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,670
We removed a total of two feet of --

656
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,800
Is he okay?

657
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,390
He will be okay.

658
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,980
Thank you.

659
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,690
Thank you, thank you.

660
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,100
I-I'm sorry. We're -- We just...

661
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,780
He's our son.

662
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,950
You shouldn't feel bad.

663
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,430
You did what you thought was best for Liam.

664
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,920
You love Liam.

665
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,180
I didn't have that from my parents.

666
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,550
It also means I didn't have to take kava root,

667
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,820
so I didn't get hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis.

668
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,150
Are you gonna get in trouble for this?

669
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,690
You're worried about me now?

670
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,960
You signed the DNR.

671
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,460
All I'm doing is sitting with you.

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,090
He was the first quarterback picked in 2013,

732

but his stats outside the pocket are only 27% competed passes.

733

Their backup QB is at 65% under pressure.

734
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,020
Absolutely.

735
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,900
- He's wasted potential on the bench. - Yes.
