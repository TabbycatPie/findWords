1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,900
Oh, God!

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,490
It's a little early, isn't it?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,140
Go back to sleep. I don't need you awake for this.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,730
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,250
Are you gonna spend all day on that thing?

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,630
I made a promise.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,300
Yes!

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,300
Last Christmas, Phil got an elliptical machine

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,680
and vowed to walk the equivalent

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,240
of our house to Canada in one year.

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,550
This body doesn't just happen, ladies.

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,810
If he didn't make it,

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,500
no machine in the bedroom.

14
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,380
Except for this machine in the bedroom, ladies.

15
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,230
Who are these ladies?

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,870
Oh, Phil, give it up.

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,350
Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,510
Just when I'm so close to the Canadian border,

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
I can smell the bacon

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,070
and the reasonably priced medications.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,860
Mom, this came for you from nana.

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,550
I don't know why she bothers to wrap it every year.

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,670
It's always the same thing -- slippers.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,590
You never know. She might surprise you this year.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,010
Would you care to take a visit

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,560
to the museum of maternal indifference?

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Watch it!

28
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,650
Oh, careful!

29
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,840
You guys are really moving her downstairs right now?

30
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,800
Aren't you gonna be late for work?

31
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,940
They're not gonna fire an elf on Christmas Eve.

32
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,600
Ugh, I thought this would be lighter without my shoes on it.

33
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,700
You know, once you set up your room,

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,960
you could put books on this.

35
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,110
Books...on a shoe shelf.

36
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,300
Right.

37
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,040
- You're not gonna jump on that? - I'm just too happy!

38
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,930
After today,

39
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,130
there'll be no more clothes thrown everywhere,

40
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,500
no more hour-long phone calls

41
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,140
where all she says is "No way."

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,530
I think it's a little sad

43
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,660
that you guys are doing this today.

44
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,630
I remember when you used to get

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,530
into the same bed on Christmas Eve

46
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,080
and talk about all the presents you were gonna get.

47
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,510
It's a perfect day for it!

48
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,220
When I wake up in my own room tomorrow,

49
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm going to be giving thanks for my independence.

50
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,690
And isn't that what Christmas is all about?

51
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,760

This is your great-grandmother's recipe.

57
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,200
If she could see you now...

58
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,050
...she would die again, because you're doing it wrong!

59
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,000
My mother has been here all week.

60
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,690
I love her very much, but you know what they say --

61
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,940
house guests start to stink after three days,

62
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,420
like dead bodies.

63
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,030
What the hell is that?

64
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,700
A fiber-optic tree.

65
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,610
It's way better for the environment than a real one.

66
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,520
Not if the environment is my living room.

67
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,740
Look, I admit, it takes some getting used to,

68
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,970
but so did greek yogurt.

69
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,080
Now I can't even remember how the old stuff tastes.

70
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,130
Why do we keep changing things that don't need changing?

71
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Christmas is real trees and eggnog,

72
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,010
Perry Como and bing on the hi-fi.

73
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,060
Now you're just making up words.

74
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,330
I'm drawing a line in the sand.

75
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,120
We're gonna get a real tree,

76
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
and we're gonna cut it down like I did when I was a kid.

77
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,820
Follow me.

78
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,440
Hi, dad.

79
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,540
Can't talk. Saving Christmas.

80
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,590
Hi. Thank you again for coming.

81
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,750
No problem. I love babysitting!

82
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Good! We're going to run some quick errands.

83
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,250
Wait, if you're taking Joe --

84
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,660
Hola, Claire!

85
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,670
Around 4:00, she gets fussy for her bottle.

86
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,010
Lily, do you know why I'm able to relax

87
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,340
and read this paper today?

88
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,610
Because you don't have a job?

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,580
FYI, I am starting a new job in exactly t--

90
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,680
No. We're not doing this again.

91
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,510
It's because I planned ahead.

92
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,370
I finished my Christmas shopping weeks ago.

93
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,310
It's important to keep busy.

94
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,840
I-it is perfectly normal to take some downti--

95
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,280
No. No!

96
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,790
Okay.

97
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,370
I printed out the directions to Pepper's party.

98
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,170
We're calling it "The 12 Gays of Christmas" now.

99
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,190
Oh, just be thankful

100
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,850
we talked him out of "Feliz Navidude."

101
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,300
Okay, honey, finish your breakfast

102
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,560
so we can go help our fellow man!

103
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,750
One hour at this charity event, max.

104
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,320
I can't eat.

105
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,630
I'm too excited to get my Puppy Pound.

106
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,130
I'm -- I'm sorry. Your what?

107
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,550
Puppy pounds have six puppies

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,780
with online profiles.

109
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,660
Ask your parents before using the Internet.

110
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,640
Honey, you never mentioned a-a-a puppy pound.

111
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,290
- What is she talking about? - I-it's not on your list.

112
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,060
Yes, it is. "Puppy Pound."

113
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,910
Oh, no! She put a "P" backwards.

114
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
And, honey, there's a "u" in "Pound."

115
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,650
- This says "Guppy Pond"! - Guppy Pond!

116
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,270
What is a Guppy Pond?

117
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,090
It's only the -- the coolest gift ever!

118
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,480
I want a Puppy Pound.

119
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,210
Um, honey, it's C--

120
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,810
Okay.

121
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,060
I am not pointing fingers,

122
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,840
but our daughter had

123
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,770
exactly one thing on her list,

124
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,030
and someone didn't get it,

125
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,260
so someone needs to go to the mall.

126
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,150
You're pointing fingers.

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
No. It's still a "1."

128
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,480
It just fell asleep on the job.

129
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,970
Ellipticaler's log, 12/24.

130
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,110
10 miles from Canadian border.

131
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,980
Spirits -- high. Stamina -- strong.

132
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,530
Must get another application of thigh lube.

133
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh, good. Luke.

134
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,880
Dad, I was with you on the tightrope.

135
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,340
I was your wing man in the wing-eating competition.

136
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,990
But I'm not feeling this one.

137
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,090
You're missing Christmas Eve.

138
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,730
There's something more important than Christmas, son

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,560
-- pride.

140
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,460
If I don't make it to Canada,

141
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,520
your mom wins, and this baby

142
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,410
ends up in the garage first thing in the morning.

143
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,940
Our garage?

144
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm in charge of the recycling.

145
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm supposed to bring it from the garage to the curb

146
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,950
by 6:00 A.M. Thursday morning.

147
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,890
I may have missed a few weeks.

148
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,390
Shoot!

149
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,090
Maybe more than a few weeks.

150
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,600
After a while, the pile just got so big,

151
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,020
I couldn't bring it out the night before

152
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,580
or people would ask questions.

153
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,130
I don't need people asking questions.

154
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,130
Then you're right! You've got to finish!

155
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,350
You'll never use this thing in the garage! It's too drafty!

156
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,150
That's why I'm going to Canada, buddy --

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,630
to avoid the draft!

158
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,950
No.

159
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
Bang.

160
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,950
I know we've been hiking for an hour, but...

161
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,290
worth it when you look at this beauty, huh?

162
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,430
That's why you don't cut down the first tree you see.

163
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,630
This is literally the first tree we saw.

164
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,820
There's our car.

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,550
No, we started that way.

166
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,330
So, you're arguing

167
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,220
that we walked entirely around the earth?

168
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,560
Give me the ax.

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,230
Don't give me that look.

170
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,220
Trees are like women.

171
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,660
The best ones make you work a little bit harder.

172
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,600
She's just not that into you.

173
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,220
- I know! - Sorry it too long!

174
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,600
Oh, it's fine.

175
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,000
Claire and I were having a nice time catching up.

176
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,640
I am really sorry that I am late.

177
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,770
No, you're not.

178
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,320
No, I'm not.

179
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,740
Mm-hmm. It's fine.

180
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,440
Just hope I didn't talk Pilar's ear off!

181
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,590
No!

182
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,920
I love hearing about your family

183
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,400
and your big, new job!

184
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,920
Oh, well, it's -- it's not such a big job.

185
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,600
I mean, I'm really just working for my dad.

186
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,840
But you're working hard.

187
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm proud of you.

188
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,680
- How do they look? - Ooh! Perfect!

189
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,270
- Yes. - You are a wonderful student.

190
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,740
-Thank you.  -My grandmother taught my mother.

191
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,290
My mother taught me.

192
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,870
And now, I teach Claire.

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,140
And don't be so modest.

194
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,370
I respect a woman who can raise a family

195
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,580
and have a full-time job.

196
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,120
Can you believe that on Fridays,

197
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,070
they don't even have to dress up?

198
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,570
Taste. Taste. Taste.

199
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,420
Sometimes, they even wear sweatpants.

200
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,720
Would you like to lick the batter?

201
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,750
Yes! Oh, yes!

202
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,910
- Me, too! - No, no, no!

203
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,740
Helpers only.

204
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't make the rules.

205
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,800
Oh, Lily, what a beautiful ornament!

206
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,220
That's gonna make a little kid very happy.

207
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,910
Wait. I don't get to keep this?

208
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,660
Why am I killing myself?

209
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay, kids!

210
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,030
We've got a visitor from the North Pole,

211
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,650
and he brought presents!

212
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,370
Hey! Hey. How's it going?

213
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,010
There are no Puppy Pounds anywhere.

214
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,600
It's like trying to find a Cabbage Patch Kid

215
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,510
on Christmas Eve 1983.

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,740
Still hurts, huh?

217
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,190
I had her bed all made.

218
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay. Well, Lily is gonna be devastated.

219
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,830
Call around. Get us on some lists.

220
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
You have to do something!

221
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,450
I'll figure it out.

222
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,740
How's the fundraiser?

223
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,290
Oh, well, I'm managing, you know.

224
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,560
Oh, bring the checkbook.

225
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,990
You can always tell when they're gearing up for the big ask --

226
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,430
Fill you full of freebies.

227
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,650
Oh, hey, I gotta go. Got to help somebody.

228
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,550
Hi! Classic.

229
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
Flawlessly executed.

230
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,480
If I had one...

231
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,160
Just trying to bring a smile to you folks.

232
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,510
- You're gonna get through this. - Get through what?

233
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,470
Don't be embarrassed.

234
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
Everyone here is in the same boat.

235
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,510
We are?

236
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,260
Best thing about the hot chocolate --

237
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,880
they let us keep the mug.

238
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,020
I thought it was a charity event for the needy.

239
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,960
Turns out, it was a charity event for the needy!

240
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,780
Look! Santa gave me a puppy pound!

241
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,850
What? No.

242
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,420
I'm finally happy!

243
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,640
I'd like a picture for the newsletter.

244
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,770
Oh. You can show your mommy.

245
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't have a mommy.

246
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,170
This is why I do this.

247
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,930
That cramp could be a heart attack.

248
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,970
Here's some advice I've been holding back on.

249
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,750
Always shave with the grain.

250
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,220
No reputable talent agent

251
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,650
will ever ask for money up-front.

252
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,120
Dad, you're fine.

253
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,270
I really want to quit, Luke!

254
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,160
No, you're gonna make it!

255
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,670
He was never gonna make it.

256
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
I just needed to buy some time.

257
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,490
That's a lot of product you're moving.

258
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,280
Just bring it to a recycling place.

259
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,010
Not until I get paid.

260
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,860
Just so you know, this is six weeks' allowance.

261
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,950
Oh, you have the coolest parents ever.

262
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,980
I want to know when you're about to leave,

263
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,500
so give me a honk.

264
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,280
- Honk! -  From your car.

265
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,990
The best business card is a firm handshake.

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,310
The best pick-up line is a tight pair of dockers.

267
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,320
The best dockers are --

268
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,500
Dad, save your breath! You're in the last five miles.

269
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,860
- I'm never gonna make it! - Of course you are!

270
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,360
Then again, do what you want. I got stuff to do.

271
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,660
- I'm gonna quit. - Cool.

272
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,160
What's one more failure?

273
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,680
You ever wonder why we take such a crazy route to school?

274
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,880
So I don't have to drive by certain places --

275
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,550
The flute teacher's house I went to once...

276
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,780
The French cooking academy I quit after learning

277
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,020
only two of the five mother sauces...

278
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,620
The hot yoga studio I left after "Happy baby."

279
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,580
I guess there's no avoiding

280
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,380
this big failure sitting in my garage.

281
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,250
Get up.

282
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,880
I appreciate it, buddy, but --

283
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,410
Get up.

284
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,820
I don't know anything about flutes

285
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,160
or cooking or happy babies...

286
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,600
But I'm damn sure getting my dad to Canada.

287
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Now, mount that beast.

288
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,350
Thank you, son.

289
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,260
You can thank me after you cross the finish line

290
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,000
and the celebration begins.

291
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,560
Just picture that.

292
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,550
I'm picturing it!

293
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,510
I'm picturing it!

294
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm really picturing it!

295
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,530
Thanks, Santa.

296
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,660
Yeah. You got it.

297
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't forget a candy cane from Mrs. Claus!

298
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,680
Oh! I got to take a break.

299
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,690
- What? - What? What?

300
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,910
Um...it's okay!

301
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,910
Does anybody want to take a picture with me?

302
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,460
- I'll do it. - Oh, maybe just the kids.

303
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,690
- What was that? - What was what?

304
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,310
Santa doesn't take breaks.

305
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,190
He visits the North Pole!

306
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,320
And why do you leave your things all over?

307
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,910
Who do you think cleans this place up?

308
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,770
Oh, you are such a nag!

309
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,070
Can't we at least

310
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,290
act like a happy couple during the holidays?

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,700
For the children!

312
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,430
Another hot chocolate?

313
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,070
How many more of those are you going to drink?

314
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,210
At least it's warm, unlike you!

315
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,040
He travels a lot.

316
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,640
She's put on cookie weight.

317
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,010
It's hard.

318
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,030
Yes, you can put me on

319
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,650
the "Last-minute shoppers" waiting list.

320
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,920
- Unbelievable. - Oh! Well, there he is!

321
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,020
H-hey, Jotham!

322
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,220
Oh, looks like someone did

323
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,990
a little last-minute Christmas shopping.

324
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,530
That Zaniel's a lucky guy.

325
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,030
Yes, he is.

326
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,250
But these are for Pepper's party.

327
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,170
His invitation said, "No gifts, please."

328
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,310
Mm, say that again...

329
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,740
as Pepper.

330
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,020
No gifts?

331
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,210
Please.

332
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,690
5 o'clock, Christmas Eve,

333
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,210
and I have to find a dozen perfect presents

334
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,850
for the world's snarkiest, cattiest men...

335
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,950
My dear, dear friends.

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,100
Pull! Pull! Pull!

337
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,320
Yeah. Hey, take a break.

338
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,550
- This is taking forever. - It's supposed to.

339
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,140
Took my dad and I all day to get a tree.

340
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,170
And when he finally brought her down,

341
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,530
he used to celebrate with a cigar.

342
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,300
I was just a kid, so I'd have a cigarette.

343
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
All right. Grab the other end.

344
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,010
There we go.

345
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,870
Now we got a groove.

346
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,410
Yeah. There we --

347
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,740
It won't budge!

348
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,820
The hell is this wood made of?

349
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,210
They ought to make saws out of it!

350
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,940
Let's face it. The tree's beaten us.

351
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,280
Hey, we're Pritchetts. We don't quit.

352
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,610
Besides, all my tools are stuck in it.

353
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,080
I got it.

354
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
It's simple physics.

355
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,640
A little pressure,

356
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,100
the thing will snap where we put the blade in.

357
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,120
- Done. - Just hit the gas.

358
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,780
It's working.

359
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,130
That's why they call it yankee engine--

360
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,450
Get down!

361
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,160
It's bald on one side now!

362
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,360
It'll be fine!

363
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,030
We'll just comb over some branches!

364
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,300
Oh, Claire, I thought that you had left.

365
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,220
She was going to,

366
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,270
But I wanted to show her how much better she looks

367
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,600
without this hair blocking her pretty face.

368
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,590
She does have beautiful hair, though.

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,740
I see.

370
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,260
What did she say?

371
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,880
That you picked a good color...

372
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,160
At least, I think that's what she said

373
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,890
with that American accent.

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
You don't have to entertain her.

375
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,370
After all, she's my mother.

376
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,480
Ah, these used to be Glorita's favorite!

377
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,050
She used to do headstands to get extra cookies.

378
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,120
At least, she'd try.

379
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,070
Yeah, but it's not easy!

380
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,360
I mean, it's hard enough to keep all this right-side up!

381
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,790
Imagine when I had to put it all right-side down!

382
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,720
- It was... - Oh, my gosh.

383
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,100
I can't believe I can still do it!

384
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,830
Look at that.

385
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Oh, wow. Look at Claire, Gloria!

386
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,800
Very good! Two cookies for you!

387
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,130
Thank you!

388
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,210
Uh, yeah, but she needs a pedicure.

389
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,350
Look at that.

390
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,150
You knocked me down!

391
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,060
- I did not. - Yes, you did, too!

392
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,260
Girls! Girls! Girls! No need to fight.

393
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,930
I don't have a favorite.

394
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,600
Why the hell not?!

395
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,470
I am very disappointed in both of you.

396
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,750
Family members should treat each other

397
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,200
with love and respect.

398
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,700
Except that Claire is not part of our family.

399
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,880
- Cierra la boca! - No. No, no.

400
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,580
She's right-- unless that's what you just said.

401
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,800
I can't tell, 'cause I-I only took French,

402
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,900
And je parle un peu.

403
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,570
Oh, you have a beautiful accent.

404
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,840
Really? Do you think so?

405
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,400
- Ay-ya! Por favor? - I'm sorry. I...

406
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,640
I-I'm jealous.

407
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,550
Ay, Claire.

408
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,850
But you're beautiful, too, in your own way.

409
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,470
No. I'm not jealous of you.

410
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,840
I am jealous of how your mother

411
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,930
comes all the way to see you from Colombia,

412
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,230
When my own mother won't even get on a bus

413
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,730
from the Almond co-op she lives on three hours away.

414
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,320
She sends presents, no?

415
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,100
Yeah. It's the same thing every year.

416
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,630
It's always slippers.

417
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,870
I am sorry.

418
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,680
Thank you.

419
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,910
But I shouldn't take it out on you

420
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,410
just 'cause I have a lousy mom.

421
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,220
Don't disrespect your mother!

422
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,410
- Is she always like this? - Yes.

423
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,870
Did you-- did you ever think maybe there's a reason

424
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,900
she sends you that gift?

425
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, 'cause she found something

426
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,910
when I was 8 years old that I actually liked,

427
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,420
and she hasn't thought about it since.

428
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,480
Well, maybe she thinks about it a lot.

429
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,220
Maybe she remembers a time when she made you happy,

430
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,060
and she wants to go back there.

431
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,870
Well, now I feel terrible.

432
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,510
The only thing I sent her was an e-card.

433
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,630
We don't like to admit it...

434
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,820
But mothers never get over

435
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,180
the day their daughters leave them.

436
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,090
We never stop needing our little girls.

437
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,810
I will never stop needing you, mama.

438
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,070
Excuse me.

439
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,130
Excuse me.

440
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,830
Excuse me, elf,

441
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,930
it's been 45 minutes.

442
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,980
Where's Santa?

443
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,040
I don't know!

444
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,730
Maybe he's a little busy making presents

445
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,930
for every child in the world.

446
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,260
One second!

447
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,540
Where is he?

448
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,980
He said he was going out for a pack of candy canes.

449
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,370
You mean like those?

450
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,510
Okay. Wake up! He is not coming back!

451
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,800
We need to change into our regular clothes

452
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,990
and sneak out.

453
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,990
Who am I kidding?

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,170
My eyes are unforgettable.

455
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,490
I couldn't even hold on to a fake husband.

456
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,000
I always thought you were the tough one to live with,

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,780
but maybe I am.

458
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,580
Okay, they've breached the jelly bean moat. This is a problem.

459
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,760
It's a big problem. All this time, I've been waiting

460
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,820
for a guy to see the true me,

461
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,300
and now I'm scared he will.

462
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,020
Oh, my god! They've got Blitzen!

463
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,160
What's going to happen to me?

464
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,360
Am I just going to nitpick everyone until they leave me?

465
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,930
- Hey, mom found somebody! - That's true.

466
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,150
Okay, listen.

467
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,950
We really need to get out of here.

468
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,210
But I just want to let you know

469
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,280
that you weren't all bad to live with. I thought--

470
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,920
Oh, my god!

471
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,600
Oh, my god!

472
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,800
Where's santa?!

473
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,880
Only 100 more yards.

474
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,610
You're just about there!

475
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,430
Can you see it?

476
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,740
It's so beautiful. It's so green.

477
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,070
And, wow, those are high up there.

478
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,720
The mountains?

479
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,160
No, my shorts again.

480
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,700
Would you mind giving them one last tug?

481
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,950
You're crossing the border.

482
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,510
Yeah, I know, and I feel bad asking,

483
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,170
But I'm tasting cotton.

484
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,110
No! You did it! You're in Canada!

485
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,990
Wait. What?

486
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,840
I did it? I did it!

487
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,480
I did it! I did it!

488
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
Let's go tell mom!

489
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,200
Wait.

490
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,890
How did I used to walk?

491
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,430
All right. Come on, sweetie.

492
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,730
Let's go.

493
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,820
Uh, we're serving Christmas dinner.

494
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,640
Uh, no. That's fine.

495
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,270
We have to actually get going, so...

496
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,790
But I haven't eaten today.

497
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,640
Oh, you poor thing!

498
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,370
No, she's fine. She's fine.

499
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh, there he is.

500
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,400
Honey, where did you get this coat?

501
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,330
Sorry, kids.

502
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,210
It looks like we've run out of coats and toys.

503
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,970
That's okay, mom. At least I got to see presents.

504
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,230
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

505
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,420
Hey! How are my do-gooders?

506
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,100
Did you have fun?

507
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,450
Yep. Talk about it in the car. Oh, my gosh.

508
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,210
What are these?

509
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,350
Yeah, I went a little crazy, huh?

510
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
No! No, no! It's a Christmas miracle!

511
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,300
Kids! Kids! Who wants presents?

512
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,230
Cam, what are you doing?

513
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,990
No, trust me. Lily has enough.

514
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,780
- Cam, Cam. - Everybody, Merry Christmas!

515
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,830
Oh! Not that one.

516
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,320
Feliz navidad!

517
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,700
Okay, but those aren't for Lily.

518
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,930
"His-and-his shower clogs?"

519
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,360
They're for Pepper's party.

520
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,370
He said, "No gifts, please."

521
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,760
Imagine how Pepper would say that.

522
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
What's a Himalayan salt plate?

523
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,730
You can season your food while you serve it. Yeah.

524
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,450
Body-fat scale?

525
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,140
I wish I would've had one of those when I was your age.

526
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,240
- You're welcome. - Who's Robert Mapplethorp?

527
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,480
Actually, I'm gonna need that one back. Sorry.

528
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,770
That's okay.

529
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,590
All I really wanted this year was a Puppy Pound.

530
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,270
Here. You can have mine.

531
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,450
It's really fun.

532
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,980
Oh, my gosh.

533
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,000
That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen!

534
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,640
Lily, honey, that was so nice!

535
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,760
It's okay. I'll get one tomorrow.

536
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,870
Um, well, you know what? About that --

537
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,050
Cam? Cam?

538
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,260
Uh, that was a t-o-y s-t-o-r-e.

539
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,710
- What? - Someone returned their Puppy Pound.

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,850
W-we can't get over there in time before the store closes!

541
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,370
Wait, you know who lives right over there?

542
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,800
Oh, no. No!

543
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,880
Almost there.

544
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,380
No.

545
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,920
No! Why?!

546
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,860
Why-y-y-y-y?!

547
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,490
In hindsight, the cigar was a mistake.

548
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,570
So, what do we do now?

549
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,980
We go home.

550
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,210
I thought Pritchetts never give up.

551
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,640
They know when to give up,

552
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,740
which is its own kind of victory.

553
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
- Unless... - what?

554
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,720
No it's crazy.

555
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,880
Unless...

556
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,610
Are you really gonna make me ask you again?

557
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,070
...we somehow apply pressure to the axhead already in the tree.

558
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,300
I bet we can use the jack from the car.

559
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,980
Of course. The upward motion will split the trunk. Yeah.

560
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,030
We can always tell people that's how we did it.

561
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,550
That is how we did it.

562
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,110
People love getting new things...

563
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,640
But the best stuff has a story behind it.

564
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,100
Damn fine tree.

565
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,520
Except the saw's still stuck in the truck.

566
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,100
Yeah, you're gonna want to keep your brother away from that, huh?

567
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,050
A lot of times, it's only after we get rid of something...

568
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,260
Room for me?

569
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,620
...that we realize how much we miss it.

570
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,140
Oh! Nice!

571
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,590
Good job, Luke!

572
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,840
Yay! A Puppy Pound!

573
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,700
And things that seem worthless

574
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,100
suddenly turn out to be super valuable...

575
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay, everybody, picture in front of the tree.

576
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,820
Timer's set. Ready?

577
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,220
What? No!

578
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,330
...maybe even precious...

579
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,500
Which is why I thought getting rid of this stuff

580
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,070
would be a huge mistake.

581
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,620
Nice try.

582
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,190
You still owe us six weeks' allowance,

583
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,510
and the fireworks.

584
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,420
How could you screw this up?

585
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,570
What?

586
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,430
I'll see you in Vancouver, eh?

587
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,770
No. Luke, do the accent again?

588
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,100
Oh, are you on that machine?

589
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,750
Yes, Juliana, but unlike your husband,

590
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
I'll be finished before you know it.

591
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,970
You know what? It's actually easier this way!

592
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,720
Wonder if you could patent a movement?

593
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,740
Call it "Fliptical" --

594
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,920
Dad, trick or treaters!

595
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,260
We're out of candy!

596
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,040
Who is this dad?

597
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,570
I'm Gandalf.

598
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,420
Who's on?
