1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,724
[steady buzzing]

2
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,608
[clattering]

3
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,236
[indistinct announcement on PA]

4
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,670
Did you experience any pain or cramping
before the bleeding began?

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,255
[Eva] Uh, yes.

6
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,341
A little.

7
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,635
- [doctor] Do you have an OB?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,053
Did you call them?

9
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,305
Uh, no, I've been traveling.

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,973
I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,560
You know, first trimester miscarriages
are not uncommon.

12
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,396
- Many women experience them.
- [sighs] I know that.

13
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,941
It's not your first?

14
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,487
How many miscarriages have you had?

15
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,698
Mrs. Geller.

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,159
It is Mrs., right?

17
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,412
I need to know your medical history

18
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,748
- in order to process...
- This is my fourth.

19
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,207
Okay.

20
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,168
What medications are you on?

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,463
Mrs. Geller.

22
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
Endometrin.

23
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,843
- Injections or pills?
- Injections.

24
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,887
Okay. So you're on a fertility program?

25
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,433
Is your husband outside?
Do you want him to come in?

26
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,059
No.

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,687
Do you need to call him?

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,941
He's dead.

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,197
He banked his sperm
before his chemo treatments.

30
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,117
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,453
Do I need a D and C?

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,164
It's not likely.

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,875
- At this early stage of...
- Can I go, then?

34
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,212
We need you to stick around
for a few hours for observation.

35
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,296
[Eva sighs]

36
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,674
- Do you have a friend you can call?
- No, I'm...

37
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,342
I'm fine, thank you.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Okay.

39
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,602
[man on PA]
<i>Dr Montel to the chem lab, please.</i>

40
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,884
[woman] <i>This is an important case
for the ACLU.</i>

41
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,304
<i>We're gonna make sure that it gets
the right amount of attention.</i>

42
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,516
The judge will likely uphold the charge
of illegal entry,

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,352
recommend that you be removed.

44
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,021
We'll apply for relief
so that you're not deported.

45
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,398
You'll probably be denied bail
and detained

46
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,400
while we await your proper hearing.

47
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,612
Do you understand everything I'm saying?

48
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,154
Yes.

49
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,116
I'm the best at what I do,
and I'm gonna win this for you.

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,327
God willing.

51
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,747
God willing or not.

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,794
- [buzz of conversation]
- [Anna] Listen to me...

53
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,503
[man 1] OK. Should be out of here
in three to five.

54
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,066
- [Anna] Go on, take a sip.
- [man 2] I shouldn't have left her.

55
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,301
I shouldn't have left her alone.

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,388
- [man 1] Take that...
- [man 3] Right there...

57
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,473
[radio chatter]

58
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,769
[man 1] Right now, ma'am!
Out of there!

59
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,813
There you go!

60
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,319
- We're clearin' out...
- I'll grab it now, put it on through.

61
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,115
- [woman] Thank you, Reverend.
- You're welcome. God bless.

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,367
[man 1] Turn it on on three. That's right.

63
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,620
[man 2] Give me some motion,
you know what I'm sayin'?

64
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,421
[woman] Excuse me.

65
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
Hey.

66
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,758
Do you know where we can set up camp?

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,803
[Felix] You're not local.
Where are you from?

68
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,886
Austin.

69
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,930
Is this it?

70
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,018
- Is this where it happened?
- Where what happened?

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,979
Where the Miracle Man appeared.

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,606
- Yes.
- Ah!

73
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,032
- What are you doin'?
- I'm posting it.

74
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,742
People want to know.

75
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,951
People are coming.

76
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,827
Thank you.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
[helicopter flying overhead]

78
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,297
[coughs]

79
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,474
[man on radio] <i>Yeah, I'm over here, uh...</i>

80
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,685
<i>going to wait a couple more minutes, so...</i>

81
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,773
[coughing]

82
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,736
<i>Uh, level B, Charlie, going down now...</i>

83
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,326
[phone notifications]

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,752
- [sighs]
- [phone chiming]

85
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,422
Geller.

86
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,009
<i>It's, uh... Will... Mathers.</i>

87
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,636
Yes.

88
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,097
<i>- I think we got off on the wrong foot.</i>
- Uh-huh.

89
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>- Is that all you wanted to say?</i>
- Well, pretty much.

90
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,063
<i>That, and...</i>

91
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,651
his lawyer just left for the day,
so if you were thinkin' about comin' in...

92
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,153
I'll be there in 45.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,591
[thunder rumbling]

94
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,853
[Eva] Where is he?

95
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,190
I've put him in a holding cell.

96
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,609
He was most obliging
without his lawyer present.

97
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,821
Thought you were by the book?

98
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,657
No rules being broken here.

99
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,868
Just a little bent.

100
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,454
You good?

101
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,832
Yeah.

102
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,481
[door creaks and closes]

103
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,027
Hello.

104
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,572
Hello.

105
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,199
Are they treating you okay?

106
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,244
Yes, thank you.

107
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,257
You have questions for me?

108
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,842
No, I just want to talk.

109
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,639
I'm what you might call a follower...

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,351
of yours, as in,
I have been following you.

111
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,230
Syria, Israel, Jordan, Mexico.

112
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,857
- You're CIA.
- You get around.

113
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,526
It's the nature of my work.

114
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,362
And what is that work?

115
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280
God's work.

116
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,658
And God wants you here?

117
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,911
- In a Texas detention center?
- [thunder rumbling]

118
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,162
For now.

119
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,246
Hm.

120
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,249
Planning on another breakout?

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,960
It's not up to me.

122
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,382
Must be a comfort to know
that whatever it is you do...

123
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,510
- it's God's will.
- To the contrary.

124
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,389
It's a great responsibility.
He doesn't ask easy things.

125
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,599
Responsibility?

126
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,521
You feel responsibility
for the hundreds of women and children

127
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,149
that you led to a border of a country
that is never going to let them in?

128
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,194
No one can question God's will.

129
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,154
Oh, I'm not questioning God's.

130
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,490
I'm questioning yours.

131
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,160
You're the one who led them there.

132
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,413
Before too long,
people are gonna start dying.

133
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,124
And that will be on your head.

134
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,879
You've made yourself a lot of enemies.

135
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,465
Speaking the truth often has that effect.

136
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,549
Truth?

137
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,385
We'll get to the truth.

138
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes.

139
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,514
Good.

140
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,144
The more you cooperate,
the more I can help you.

141
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,605
I don't need your help. God provides.

142
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,649
You know, maybe...

143
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,444
I'm a part of God's plan.

144
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,863
- You are.
- Huh.

145
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,157
So...

146
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,910
tell me what that plan <i>is.</i>

147
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,871
Enlighten me.

148
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,667
I wish it were that simple.

149
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,835
[Eva chuckles]

150
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,295
But it never is.

151
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,422
Is it?

152
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,301
It's always an idea
that's just out of reach.

153
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,181
And people just need to trust in you
and follow you.

154
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,476
You know, my job, I...

155
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:49,690
I meet people like you all the time,
people who think they have the answer,

156
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,403
if only the world would listen to them
and do as they say.

157
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,616
They become so committed to an idea,
they distort themselves.

158
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,036
They become the embodiment
of that ideal and...

159
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
it makes them feel special.

160
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,376
For a while.

161
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,215
But sooner or later, all of these people,
deep down, they...

162
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,717
all want it to stop.

163
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,012
They miss being human.

164
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,851
But they feel they have no choice
but to continue what they started,

165
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,478
isolating themselves...

166
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,897
cutting off from friends and family,

167
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,609
and getting further and further away
from what they know...

168
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,698
till there's no choice
but to go over the cliff.

169
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,909
And that's what makes people like you...

170
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,077
dangerous.

171
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,249
To everyone, including yourself.

172
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,961
My job...

173
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,507
My job is to catch you...

174
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,759
before that cliff.

175
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,223
Catchers in the rye.

176
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,018
What was that?

177
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,772
We're both catchers in the rye...

178
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,649
you and me.

179
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,571
Trying to stop the children from falling.

180
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,541
You are very devoted to your job.

181
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,793
Why do you say that?

182
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,878
It's Sunday.

183
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,633
You are a woman who has fought hard
for everything she has.

184
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,138
Fought hard to be recognized,
to be the best...

185
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,015
to stand out...

186
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,268
to be better than the men around her.

187
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:53,147
- That's every working woman.
- But you're prepared to go the extra mile.

188
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,733
Ignore your personal problems...

189
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,779
and drag yourself here on a Sunday...

190
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,240
It's what you worship.

191
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,577
- Worship?
- Mm.

192
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,330
Everybody worships.

193
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,374
The only choice is what we worship.

194
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,962
Some people kneel to money.

195
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,050
Some to power, to intellect.

196
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,092
And you?

197
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,807
You are an acolyte of the CIA.

198
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,351
And you have sacrificed everything
for an idea.

199
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:35,189
And the more you've pursued that idea,
the more isolated <i>you've</i> become.

200
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,360
But at night, you lay in bed...

201
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,114
and wonder if it was worth
everything you gave up.

202
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,413
God hears the tears that you won't cry.

203
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,166
You don't know anything about me.

204
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,751
I know you're in pain.

205
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,295
It will not last.

206
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,633
I'm just fine, thank you.

207
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,677
You will be, after it passes.

208
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,561
I can make it pass.

209
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,651
Your accent...

210
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,486
you're from Iran.

211
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,906
Do you have family there, friends?

212
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,369
And you're right.

213
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,667
I am good at my job.
And I'm going to find out everything...

214
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,337
- about you.
- You're looking for the wrong things.

215
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,800
[in Hebrew] "They that seek the Lord
shall not want for good."

216
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,302
Who taught you Hebrew?

217
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,471
- My father.
- You're trying to tell me you're Jewish?

218
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,016
It follows the mother's line.

219
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,475
As you would know.

220
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,397
Just as your mother had you.

221
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,866
She wants you to know
you were her gift from God.

222
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,954
You know nothing about my mother.

223
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,832
She's always watching.

224
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,044
Her...

225
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,340
and your husband.

226
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,553
Eva...

227
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,724
it's okay.

228
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,893
It's okay to cry.

229
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,942
[buzzer sounds]

230
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,276
[gasping]

231
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,536
[buzzer sounds]

232
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,163
Everythin' okay?

233
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,705
[Eva] Yeah.

234
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,248
I'm good.

235
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,835
Did you tell him my name?

236
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,922
- No. Fuck.
- Here.

237
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,092
- I'm gonna have to take him back now.
- Fuck.

238
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,427
I'll be damned. [sighs]

239
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,539
[Eva] <i>And I've been following you.</i>

240
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,334
<i>Syria, Israel, Jordan, Mexico.</i>

241
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,712
- [al-Masih] <i>You're CIA.
- You get around.</i>

242
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,547
<i>It's the nature of my work.</i>

243
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,675
[Eva] <i>And what is that work?</i>

244
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,876
[in Hebrew] I need to close up.

245
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,726
[man] Do you answer your fucking phone?

246
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,769
[groans]

247
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,064
- I was beginning to think you were dead.
- [bartender] I'm closed.

248
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,441
Get him out of here.

249
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,524
Give us a minute.

250
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,946
The boss is pissed...
he's been trying to reach you.

251
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,077
You've been investigated
before... we all have.

252
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,248
He's doing what he has to.

253
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,008
Avi.

254
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,594
What's the matter? Talk to me.

255
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,682
I think I fucked up.

256
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,768
[cicadas chirping]

257
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,562
[car door slams]

258
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,696
What were you thinking?

259
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,870
[Aviram sighs]

260
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,872
[man sighs]

261
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,835
[boy groaning]

262
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,738
[Eva] <i>We need to properly detain him, in
order to get better access, more answers.</i>

263
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,366
He's not under CIA jurisdiction
on US soil.

264
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,449
<i>You know that.</i>

265
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,495
<i>- Israel wants him extradited.</i>
- He's being handled. I'm sure of it.

266
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,163
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

267
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,125
He can read people.
He's smart, ma'am. He's been trained.

268
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,920
- He... he knew things about me.
- <i>What things?</i>

269
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,839
Personal stuff.

270
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,756
<i>Like what?</i>

271
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,717
About my family,
stuff that you'd find in a dossier on me,

272
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,137
say, from a counterintelligence agency
like the GID.

273
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,389
Coupled with the fact
that he escaped Shin Bet,

274
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,684
boarded a private plane in Jordan,
and it starts to paint a picture.

275
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,562
It's a nice theory, but what's his plan?

276
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,647
<i>Well, if he gets extradited,
nobody will know.</i>

277
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,649
<i>If we're gonna detain him,
it has to be now.</i>

278
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>- When's the trial?</i>
- Bail hearing's tomorrow.

279
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,530
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

280
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,615
[sighs]

281
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
[notification pings]

282
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,365
[phone rings]

283
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,246
- Hello?
- [Eva] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

284
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,664
Ruth?

285
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,584
Eva, Dad.

286
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,127
Oh, Eva, that's what I meant.

287
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,503
Uh, what's wrong?

288
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,839
- [sighs] Nothing.
- <i>You sure?</i>

289
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,718
Yes. Why does there always
have to be something wrong?

290
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,930
Because you never call, that's all.

291
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,308
- We speak almost every day.
- Yeah, but you're never the one who calls.

292
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,353
I'm calling you now.

293
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>So what's up?</i>

294
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,443
Uh, nothing. I'm just...

295
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,486
checking in.

296
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,781
<i>Dad?</i>

297
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,659
Yeah. Uh...

298
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,036
It's nice that you did.

299
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,745
<i>How are you?</i>

300
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,834
Oh, well, I... I'm good.

301
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,794
<i>I'm gonna try and come see you soon.</i>

302
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,339
<i>So what... what is it?</i>

303
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,593
Nothing.

304
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,929
<i>I miss you.</i>

305
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,141
Work getting you down?

306
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,352
<i>It's okay, Dad.</i>

307
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,272
Hey, you don't...
you don't have to be tough around me.

308
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,316
I know, Dad.

309
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,360
<i>I remember what it was like.</i>

310
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,071
It's a lonely job.

311
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,615
I'm just tired.

312
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,492
Okay.

313
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,247
I love you.

314
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>Me too.</i>

315
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,886
[sighs]

316
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,805
[woman] <i>A spotlight has been shone today</i>

317
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,266
<i>on the president's
federal immigration policies,</i>

318
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,062
<i>as political folk hero
and Syrian refugee al-Masih...</i>

319
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,185
[man] <i>The hearing caught
the attention of lawmakers,</i>

320
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,649
<i>as the ACLU has stepped up
to defend Mr. Masih.</i>

321
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,028
Whether he entered the country illegally
or not is beside the point.

322
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,781
He has rights, and the ACLU is here
to protect those rights.

323
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,990
What about Judge Pleva?

324
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,077
He's a conservative,
known for coming down hard on illegals.

325
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,954
Whatever political or social leanings
Judge Pleva has,

326
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,290
he's obliged to weigh the case
on its own merit.

327
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,920
The federal government
has found the respondent

328
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,590
to be present in the United States
without proper admission,

329
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,135
lacking a visa
or other forms of documentation.

330
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,636
Miss Garcia?

331
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,267
Does the respondent understand
the charges being brought against him?

332
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,560
He does, Your Honor.

333
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,479
And does he admit or deny?

334
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,023
My client admits to the charge
of illegal entry.

335
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,526
However, the defense wishes
to file for protection

336
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,569
under the convention against torture.

337
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,239
Based on what information?

338
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,909
My client fears persecution
for his religious and political beliefs

339
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,661
if he were to be sent back to Israel.

340
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,744
Your Honor?

341
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,579
Ms. Lang?

342
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,125
The United States would like to point out

343
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,045
that the respondent is seen as a person
of interest, having incited rioting

344
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,090
and violence in Israel,
which you've surely seen in the news.

345
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,677
Therefore, the prosecution kindly asks
Your Honor to consider

346
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,054
an expedited removal of Mr. Masih,

347
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,348
which I would like to note
is not his real name...

348
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,892
Your Honor, my client is reluctant
to give his real name

349
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,228
for fear of retaliation
against family members

350
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,689
- he may have back home.
- Seeing as the respondent has fled

351
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,192
a foreign country already,
the court is going to deny bail.

352
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,444
Flight risk.

353
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,656
Having heard Ms. Lang's argument,
and due to the stature of the case,

354
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,533
I'm going to expedite the hearing.

355
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,453
- We're gonna lose him.
- We'll see you all here Wednesday.

356
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,736
- [ACLU lawyer] That gives us no time...
- [gavel bangs]

357
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,377
Shit.

358
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,690
[Bailey] <i>Best you put this to bed now.</i>

359
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,091
What if we offer his lawyer a deal?

360
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,302
<i>The situation's the situation, Eva.</i>

361
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,805
You need to concentrate on the West Bank.

362
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,518
[sighs]

363
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,983
[thunder crashing]

364
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,244
I should report you.

365
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,915
You interrogated my client behind my back.

366
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,602
- He agreed to talk to me.
- You violated his right to due process.

367
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
Do you even care about your client?

368
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,671
Because right now, he's screwed.

369
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,341
The judge expedited the hearing
to disadvantage you.

370
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,759
You don't think I know that?

371
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,220
The only way you can protect him is
if he gets detained.

372
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:17,224
- In this country? That's no protection.
- He goes back to Syria, he gets shot.

373
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,352
He goes back to Israel, he gets locked up
for the rest of his life.

374
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,979
Now, your client was happy
to cooperate with me.

375
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,023
- You're the one who's being stubborn.
- Hm.

376
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,317
We're prepared to make a deal.

377
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,277
By offering me a chance
to throw the case.

378
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,363
I'm trying to help you.

379
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,448
Yeah. Thanks,
I'll take my chances in court.

380
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,575
Maybe you want to lose the case?

381
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,370
That way you still get your point
across to the media.

382
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,748
What is he, your sacrificial lamb?

383
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,210
Good night, Detective.

384
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:46,836
It's Officer.

385
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,922
<i>His actions weren't overtly aggressive.</i>

386
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,551
<i>You could argue he's an activist.
Some people are calling him a prophet.</i>

387
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,428
[man] <i>Or maybe he's a terrorist,
or a religious fanatic.</i>

388
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,390
<i>Why are there only two options?
Because he's Muslim?</i>

389
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,185
<i>A Muslim can only be a terrorist
or a religious extremist?</i>

390
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,731
<i>Why can't he just be an ideologue
or a good old-fashioned charlatan?</i>

391
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,359
<i>I just think we're missing
an important part of the debate here</i>

392
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,444
<i>by focusing solely on provenance.</i>

393
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,782
[man] <i>Whatever he is, and however
he got here, he's our problem now.</i>

394
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,578
[in Hebrew] This is bullshit.

395
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
This is serious.

396
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,831
I'm trying to help you.

397
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,584
By forcing me to make a statement?

398
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,129
Without the American here,
just tell me what was on that tape.

399
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,964
[distant siren wailing]

400
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,758
Just give me a goddamn statement.

401
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,094
If you don't, you'll be suspended

402
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,263
and go before the Security Council,
do you want that?

403
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,057
You're threatening my job now?

404
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,268
Take it however you like.

405
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,895
I haven't done anything wrong.

406
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,439
You erased an interrogation tape.

407
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,442
[yells] I've erased a thousand tapes.
You know what goes on in there.

408
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,820
- This is different!
- Because he escaped custody?

409
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,573
Because it's on CNN.
The whole world is watching.

410
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,336
It's not just your job. The Prime
Minister is on my back about this.

411
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,493
Do you understand?

412
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,537
Fuck this.

413
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,459
Whatever you're hiding...

414
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,544
I hope it's worth your career.

415
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,591
Keys and ID.

416
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Avi.

417
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,522
If I were you, I'd get an attorney.

418
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,070
[door slams]

419
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,006
[coughs]

420
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,467
[groaning]

421
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,139
[gasps]

422
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,393
[coughs]

423
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,106
[wheezes]

424
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,868
[wind howls]

425
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,770
[gasps]

426
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,147
[baby crying]

427
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,913
[footsteps]

428
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,499
[baby crying]

429
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,377
[keys jangling]

430
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,048
[Anna] What are you doing?

431
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,943
I have to go, Anna.
I have to be with him.

432
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,238
Why?

433
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,615
I can't explain it.

434
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,326
I think he needs me.

435
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,746
You've already retained this man a lawyer.

436
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,499
Don't you think you've done enough?

437
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,585
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

438
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,462
Explain.

439
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,466
Explain to me what's been goin' on.

440
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,179
Explain to me what you were gonna do
the morning of the tornado.

441
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,308
What were you gonna do, Felix?

442
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,437
Somethin' stupid.

443
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,483
Say it.

444
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,988
I was tryin' to help us.

445
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,197
No.

446
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,535
You weren't even thinking about us.

447
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,290
I can't keep doing this.

448
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,419
I can't keep silent,
wondering what you're gonna do next.

449
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,337
I know things have been hard

450
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,382
- and we haven't been happy, but...
- But what?

451
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,344
- Now things are gonna change?
- Yes.

452
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,345
Why?

453
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,807
Because of this man?

454
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,020
You don't even know who he is.

455
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,730
I can't explain it, Anna.

456
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,026
But right now, I think... I feel...

457
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,611
that this is important.

458
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,446
He is important.

459
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,407
- Are we not important?
- Yes.

460
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,991
Of course.

461
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,170
I was gonna burn this place down, Anna.

462
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,966
I just...

463
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,261
didn't see the point
of what I was doin' here.

464
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,765
I thought I lost everything.
I thought I lost my faith.

465
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,893
And... right at that moment...

466
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,438
a tornado hits and he shows up.

467
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,609
I know God put this man here at this time
in front of me for a reason.

468
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,362
I don't know what that reason was.

469
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,613
That's up to God.

470
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,742
But I do know that if we have faith...

471
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,744
God will guide us.

472
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,912
I know that.

473
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,790
Your duty is here right now.

474
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,876
This town needs you.

475
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,257
I have to do this.

476
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
- [sniffling]
- [car door closes]

477
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,732
[engine starts]

478
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,370
[man on radio] <i>Need an escort
for a male lockdown,</i>

479
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,622
<i>65723, red building...</i>

480
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,957
Brought you a coffee.

481
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,791
Thanks.

482
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,628
So, what's he doin'?

483
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,549
Nothin'. Hasn't moved once all day.

484
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,159
- [crowd chanting] al-Masih! al-Masih!
- [man]...versus the state of Texas...

485
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,464
Court proceedings are about to commence
on what has become

486
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,689
a highly anticipated trial overseen
by Judge Pleva.

487
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,942
[man] The trial that has caught
the nation's attention is in session...

488
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,320
[woman]...today in a trial
that is heating up the immigration debate,

489
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,906
not just here in Texas,
but across the country.

490
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,872
[distant siren wailing]

491
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,751
[woman] All rise for the honorable
Judge Harold Pleva.

492
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,923
[helicopter flying overhead]

493
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,890
[Pleva] Please be seated.

494
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,729
Miss Garcia, I received your necessary
applications last night.

495
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,357
What evidence does the respondent
wish to present?

496
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,447
Your Honor, due to the promptness
of this trial, it was difficult

497
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,867
for the defense to bring forth evidence
or produce witnesses.

498
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,953
However, I would like to make a statement.

499
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,997
- Please proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

500
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,834
My client fled
the war-torn country of Syria

501
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,213
with thousands of refugees
hoping to seek shelter in Israel.

502
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,675
But they were met with hostility
and aggression by the Israeli government,

503
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,678
who arrested my client without cause.

504
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,765
My client is here as a refugee.

505
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,851
If the Court decides
to send him back to Israel,

506
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,605
he fears he would be persecuted
for his religious beliefs in Islam.

507
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,359
Is that your whole statement, Miss Garcia?

508
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,485
Yes, Your Honor.

509
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,821
Does the respondent wish
to make a statement?

510
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,115
- No, Your Honor.
- I'd like to say something.

511
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,708
No one decides where they were born.

512
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,754
Our birthplace was decided by fate.

513
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,798
You were born here...

514
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,217
I was born there.

515
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,553
What divides us?

516
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,931
A border...

517
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,144
is an idea decided by the lucky.

518
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,024
Today you sit
in the seat of the fortunate.

519
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,070
Just remember what put you there.

520
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,782
Fate.

521
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,784
What is fate...

522
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,203
but the hand of God?

523
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,269
Ms. Lang, respondent is all yours.

524
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,067
Mr. Masih, if I may?

525
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:41,115
Can you tell the court
what you're doing in this video?

526
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,374
It's hard to tell, but what I can tell you
is that you're not praying...

527
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
at least, not like a Muslim.

528
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,255
As I'm sure the court is aware,
Muslims observe five formal prayers a day.

529
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,009
You didn't stand up
and face Mecca even once.

530
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:06,557
So how can the respondent's council argue
that Mr. Masih can't be removed to Israel

531
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,517
for fears of persecution for his religion

532
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,479
- if he doesn't practice that religion?
- Objection, Your Honor.

533
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,231
The prosecution is testifying,

534
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,792
- not questioning my witness.
- Mr. Masih, what religion are you?

535
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,860
You are not to question my client.

536
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,403
I walk with all men.

537
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,696

540
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,913
No further questions, Your Honor.

[woman] <i>The case

00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,506
[both] "I walk with all men."

545
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,092
They were the words
of the man they're calling al-Masih.

546
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,427
His statements in the hearing today
likely to jeopardize

547
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,447
- his chances for asylum...
- Are you the reverend?

548
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,808
From Dilley, whose church was saved?
Why are you following this man?

549
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:56,232
I'm following this man because I believe
he was sent here, to us, for a reason.

550
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,818
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Jack.

551
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,405
You're taking his words
completely out of context.

552
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,823
Uh, yes, you are.

553
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,994
The president is a man of faith.
He has a strong opinion about this.

554
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,040
From now on, if you want a direct answer,
come to me first.

555

- [man] <i>Director Bailey</i>

558

Send them in.

560
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,180
Have you seen this?

561
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,224
This is blowing up.

562
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,060
I want him out of the country now.

563
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,270
We're working on it, sir.

564
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,397
- It's complicated.
- Complicated.

565
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,280
The president didn't fight for two years
to have his immigration policy

566
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,153
called back into question
because of some fucking Arab.

567
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,238
Respectfully, sir...

568
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
the best way to make him disappear
is to detain him.

569
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,286
That way <i>we</i> own him.
We control the situation.

570
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,263
Israel is demanding he be extradited.
There's no way around that.

571
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,771
You want to send him back to Israel,

572
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,144
- let him create his Holy War?
- If we risk upsetting Israel,

573
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,521
- who knows where this ends?
- How do we protect the country?

574
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,589
- We need Israel's cooperation...
- Okay.

575
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,175
Fuck.

576
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,677
I'll solve it myself.

00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,024
Why did you answer her question?

580
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,277
Because it's the truth.

581
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:28,324
You didn't just screw this up for you.
You screwed it up for these people, too.

582
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,952
