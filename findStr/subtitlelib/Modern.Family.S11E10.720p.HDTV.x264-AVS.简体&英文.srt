Adolfo of Venice.

31
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,830
他不是给那些明星染发的吗

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,130
谢谢询问  尽管我知道你知道这个事实
Thank you for asking even though I know you know.

37
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,930
但他窃取了我的染发剂配方

38
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,830
对于一个满是可爱成员的家庭来说

你还没拆开我和小卡送给你的蜡烛呢
You haven't even opened the candle that Cam and I got you.

42
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,220

48
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,010
实际上  你们不行
Actually, you can't.

49
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,240
公司有严格规定  客人都要在员工陪伴下才行
There's a strict "No unaccompanied guests" policy.

50
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,290
一旦我违反了  他们就会把我赶走

我会让泊车员把你们的车开出来的

-再见  克莱尔  -我需要去一趟商场

你能从农贸市场买些牛排晚上吃吗

60
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,530
所以你还记得今晚是约会之夜
Oh, so you did remember it's date night.

61

你没回我的无纸化邀请函  让我还有点担心呢
I was a little worried after your response to my Paperless Post.

62
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,920

64
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,590
好的

你和我上一次
When was the last time that you and I

66
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,600
一起准备浪漫晚餐是什么时候了
cooked a romantic dinner together?

67
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,790
我们上周才弄过啊
We did it last week.

68
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,300
我说的可不是简单地把热狗片撒在披萨上
I'm not talking about sprinkling hot dog slices on a DiGiorno's.

69
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,700
你就不能在我挨说之前把车开来吗
You couldn't bring my car before I got in trouble?

谢谢

我一直悄悄在网上当美食博主

账号叫"帽衫美食家"

73
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,930
是一个押韵的名字
it rhymes on the page.

74

76
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,490
叫"什么餐厅"

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,340

我还在努力认识这里所有的住户

我是这里的管理员希金斯

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,580
我长着一张大众脸  大众身材
I have an everyman face and body.

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,060
机器人崛起了
They're rising.

87

没错  芬利
Ah, yes, Finley.

88
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,390
它负责巡查大楼  搜出非住户
Patrols the building for non-residents

89
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
全靠运动感应器和面部扫描仪
using a motion sensor and face scanner.

90
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,870
确实非常有用  但它拥有独特的人类本事
Useful, yes, but does he have that uniquely human ability

91
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,170
能提前预料到人的每一项需求吗
to anticipate a person's every need?

92
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,280
喝椰子水吗
Coconut water?

93
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,270
我都没意识到我想喝水呢
I didn't even know I wanted this!

94
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,660
芬利  走开
Finley, away!

95
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
还有什么能帮到您的吗  先生
Anything else I can help you with, sir?

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,260
没了  我直接去餐厅

97
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,180

98
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,250
你们的  内部食堂
Your...in-house eatery.

99
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,270
什么
Pardon?

100
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,720
就是  服务生  餐具  每日特色菜
You know -- uh, waiters, cutlery, daily specials.

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
好像是叫"什么餐厅"

102

-当然了  我的错  -没事
- Of course. My mistake. - It's all right.

要躲避安保机器人会很棘手
Avoiding the security robot would be tricky,

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
但芬利有个弱点
but Finley had a weakness --

106
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,860
它只能侦测到在移动的人
he can only detect people if they're moving.

107
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,970
那值得冒险啊
And it was worth the risk --

108
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,110
"什么餐厅"的小汉堡号称是全世界最美味的
Pardon claimed to have the world's best beef slider,

109
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,370
我的粉丝全都超想看到我的点评

110
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,660
除了一个人
Well, all but one.

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,770
我有个黑子

112
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,620
网名叫"厨巨王走"  鬼知道那是什么
Screen name "Close to Utlaw," Wherever that is.

113
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,120
我们最近在评论里发生了撕逼大战
We recently got into a -- a heated comment war.

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
脏话乱飚  操爹骂娘
Insults were hurled, mothers disparaged.

115
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,030
谁能想到网络这么负能量呢
Who knew the Internet could be so negative?

116
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,290

你能领我去放映室吗
Could you lead me to the screening room?

121
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,850
我觉得可以吧
I should think so.

122
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,710
在管家学院  我在领路方面可是全班第一名
At the butler academy, I led my class in leading.

123
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,880
这边请
This way.

124
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,980
最近  我搞到了有史以来

130
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,990
拜托  我觉得这里用推拉镜头才更合适吧

希望他在沙漠里能找到精彩情节
I sure hope he finds a plot out there in that desert.

132

-你不介意吗  -介意什么  拜托
- You wouldn't mind? - Mind? Please.

139
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,490
我最大的乐趣
There is no greater joy

140
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,500
就是去搞到一些我从未听过的东西
than fetching something I've never heard of

141
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,410
给一个我刚认识的人

请问有什么需要帮忙的吗
May I help you with something?

米奇很讨厌我做这种事
Okay, Mitchell hates it when I do this,

147
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,450
但我每次遇见名人
but every time I meet a celebrity,

148
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,740
我都拜托他们帮我录来电语音应答
I ask them to record my outgoing message.

149
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,360
我现在用的是我在银行遇到史诺普・道格时录的
My current one is from when I saw Snoop Dogg at a bank.

150
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,360

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,280
宝贝  什么事  我这会儿有点忙
Hey, sweetie, what's up? I'm -- I'm kind of busy.

158
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,990
小卡  我受伤了  是我的腿
Cam, I'm hurt. It's my leg.

159
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,660
什么
What?

160
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,120
我在美食街滑倒了
I slipped in the food court,

161
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,820
现在全身都粘粘的  而且还被十岁小屁孩嘲笑
and I'm all sticky and tweens are laughing at me.

162
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,000
你一定要来接我
You have to come pick me up.

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
听起来好惨  但是
Well, that sounds awful, but --

164
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,960
克莱尔不是离你更近吗
Isn't -- Isn't Claire closer?

165
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,950
可你就在街尾的农贸市场啊
Well, you're at the farmers market right down the street.

166
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,320
行吧  我这就来
Okay, fine. I'm on my way.

167
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,400
老公你最好啦
Aww, you're the best.

168
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,540
我绝不能让小卡毁了我当面感谢
I was not gonna let Cam ruin my chance

169
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,950
我的壁纸  维多利亚・贝克汉姆的机会
to thank my wallpaper, Victoria Beckham, one-on-one.

170
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,600
当时是1997年
Okay, so, it was 1997.

171
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,710
我和女朋友在底特律看辣妹合唱团演唱会
I was in Detroit for a Spice Girls concert with my girlfriend.

172
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,640
我本来打算向她求婚的
I was going to propose to her,

173
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,770
戒指什么的都准备好了
had the ring in my pocket and everything,

174
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,380
结果时髦辣妹从台上径直看向我  并说道
when from the stage, Posh looked right at me and said,

175
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,380
{\an8}维多利亚・贝克汉姆曾是辣妹合唱团的成员
当时的别名是时髦辣妹

176
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,300
"要直面真正的你  米奇尔"
"Be true to yourself, Mitchell!"

177
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,620
好吧  她说的可能是"密歇根"
Okay, you know, she might've said "Michigan,"

178
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,530
但她当时目光正对着我
but she was looking right at me!

179
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,750
那一晚我受到她的鼓舞而出柜
She inspired me to come out that night.

180
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,930
我把那颗钻石挂到脚链上当幸运符
I had that diamond reset as an anklet charm,

181
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,170
接下来我就夜夜笙歌了
and I was off to the races.

182
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,930
那到底是哪门子的奇葩健身袋啊
What kind of gym bag is that, anyway?

183
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,330
这是挎包  你个无知白痴
It's a satchel, you ignorant sneeze.

184
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,150
你最近好暴躁好讨厌
You have been so unpleasant lately.

185
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,990
与他这态度绝对有关的就是
On a definitely related note,

186
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,070
曼尼有好几个月没做过床上"运动"了
Manny hasn't gotten any action in months.

187
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,010
好吧  除了害他得腕管综合征的运动外
Well, other than whatever gave him carpal tunnel.

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,530
幸好普雷斯科综合生活馆有80年代有氧健身操课程
Luckily, The Prescott has an '80s aerobi-cise class,

189
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,930
现场会有很多单身熟女
which will be full of single older ladies.

190
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,450
女人一过40岁就到达一个黄金交叉点
Women hit a sweet spot right after 40

191
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,720
那时她们外表仍然美丽
where they still look great

192
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,700
但对男人的要求大大降低
but their standards have lowered.

193
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,910
你身材保持得不错啊  毕竟你已经...
You're in pretty good shape for someone who's...

194
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,560
42岁  43岁了
42? 43?

195
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,780
我才38
I'm 38.

196
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,190
再见
Bye.

197
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,580
希金斯
Higgins.

198
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,750
贝克汉姆先生  抱歉
Oh, Mr. Beckham. Apologies.

199
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,750
{\an8}退役足球明星  与维多利亚・贝克汉姆是夫妇

200
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
我没戴眼镜时就跟蝙蝠一样眼瞎
Blind as a bat without these bad boys.

201
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,900
我和柯特妮跟保龄球教练约好了
So, myself and Courteney are expecting a bowling instructor.

202
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,900
{\an8}《老友记》主演之一

203
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,510
麻烦你叫他
Would you have him meet us

204
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,470
到楼下的保龄球馆找我们  好吗
downstairs at the bowling alley, please?

205
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,500
你和考克斯女士要为
You and Ms. Cox getting an edge

206
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,090
周末的名人马拉松保龄球赛大练身手吗
for this weekend's celebrity bowl-a-thon?

207
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,140
我们绝对需要练习
Oh, we'll need it.

208
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,150
你没看到去年比赛他打得有多烂
You should've seen the way he bowled last year.

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,360
可那比赛只是要为慈善筹款啊
I mean, it is to raise money for charity.

210
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,770
没错  你总共击倒的18个瓶募到18块钱呢
Yeah, a dollar for each of the 18 pins that you knocked down.

211
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,500
多亏了你  无国界医生们
Thanks to you, Doctors Without Borders

212
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,700
现在成了无痢疾药医生

213
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,130
有点毒
A bit harsh.

214
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,820
你看到后面那两位女士了吗
Did you see the two friends in the back?

215
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,010
金发那个喜欢我  褐发那个一直盯着你看
The blond one liked me, and the brunette kept staring at you.

216
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,890
你能怪她吗
Can you blame her?

217
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,020
我跳《加勒比海女王》的舞步  无人能及
No one moves to "Caribbean Queen" Like me.

218
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,950
我正要找你们
Ah, just who I was told to be on the lookout for.

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,140
有两个人叫你们
A certain couple have asked

220
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,650
去保龄球馆找他们
that you meet them in the bowling alley.

221
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,000
是不是一位金发  一位棕发的
Was it a blonde and a brunette?

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,350
没错  而且他们等不及要"开滚"了
Indeed, and they seemed eager to get rolling.

223
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
保龄球馆
Bowling alley?

224
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,380
这些妹子口味真重
These girls are freaky.

225
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,940
美发沙龙在哪

226
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,880
-穿过院子  在您右手边  -谢谢

我一直想把头发染成深色
I've always wanted to dye my hair dark.

228
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,050
但我放心委以重任的染发师只有一位
But there's only one colorist I would trust to do it --

229
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,260
威尼斯的阿道夫
Adolfo of Venice.

230
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,540
歌洛莉亚的死对头
Gloria's sworn enemy.

231
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
我得偷偷绕回来染发  不让她知道
I just have to sneak back in and do it without her knowing.

232
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,990
妈妈好啊

So, how's the project going?

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,700
我肯定赶不上最后期限了
I'm never gonna make this deadline.

236
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,430
不会吧  好惨哦
Oh, yeah, no, that -- that -- that's tough...

237
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,170
听到你这么说我很难过
I'm sorry -- sorry to hear that.

238
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,660
工作真是让我压力山大
Work is so stressful.

239
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,410
我得挂了  爱你哦  再见
Yeah, got to go, love you! Bye!

240
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,830
泳池在哪

您进电梯
Just hop on the elevator

242
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,310
按下写着"泳池"的大按键就能到达

243
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,530
众人皆知我是这个家里最大胆无畏的
I am known as the fearless one of the family.

244
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,520
所以克莱尔给我们下周
So, when Claire gave us all free passes

245
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,060
快乐镇水上乐园的免费票后
for the Fun Town Water Park next week,

246
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,190
我不敢承认我怕滑滑梯
I couldn't admit that I am afraid of slides.

247
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,950
水上滑梯速度好快  我觉得自己都要飞出去了
They go so fast, I feel like I'm going to fly off.

248
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,320
我需要先滑一次  到时我就不怕了
I just need to try it once and I am going to be fine.

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,250
我做不到
I cannot do it!

250

吊吊我粉丝们的胃口
an Instagram tease.

263

您的甜心宝宝  先生
Your Sugar Babies, sir.

264
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,350
希望没让你太费心
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

265
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,540
恰恰相反
On the contrary.

266
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,400
街对面的公园里正在举办
There was a Mexican birthday celebration

267
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,550
墨西哥生日庆祝会
taking place in the park across the street.

268
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,500
我等他们敲破塞满糖果的皮纳塔后
I waited for the crack of the pinata,

269
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,250
就无耻地混进小孩子中间
mixed in seamlessly with the children,

270
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,480
伺机猛抢糖果
and pounced.

271
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,040
他也在这吗
He's here?!

272
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,250
一个白痴美食博主攻击
Some moron food blogger took a shot

273
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,590
我最喜欢的其中一家餐厅
at one of my favorite spots.

274
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,580
于是我用艺名"橱柜狂徒"去网上骂他
So I go after him using my screen name, "Closet Outlaw."

275
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,360
骂战升级  他唆使他一大票粉丝来围攻我
It escalates, and he turns his army of followers against me.

276
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,010
我就在最后一条评论里写道
As I wrote in my last comment --

277
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,330
"看看是我的拳头硬  还是你的脸硬"
"Let's see how well my fist pairs with your face."

278
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,770
保龄球馆
The bowling alley?!

279
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,070
艾丽克斯在这
Alex is here?!

280
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,780
假如她看到我们  会赶我们出去的
If she sees us, she'll throw us out.

281
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,060
不好意思
Excuse me.

282
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,590
要是金发和棕发那两位来了
If that blonde and brunette come by,

283
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,330
你能不能告诉他们碰面地点换了
could you tell them there's a new meet-up spot?

284
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
换成顶楼的按摩浴缸
The hot tubs on the rooftop.

285
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,350
当然  锻炼前先热身
Of course, warm things up a bit before your workout.

286
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,660
假如您没有其他需求  我得继续检查
If there's nothing else, I need to make sure

287
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,610
确保保龄球的重量没有标错
these balls are marked with their correct weights.

288
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,260
给他10号的鞋
Size 10 for him

289
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,480
给我一双有钢头的
and anything with a steel toe for me.

290
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,260
某人总是出纰漏[掉球]
Someone drops his ball a lot.

291
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,390
计划有变
There has been a change of plan.

292
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
你们的保龄球教练说在顶楼碰面
Your bowling instructor would now like you to meet him

293
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,060
要在按摩浴缸里热身
in the hot tubs for a warmup first.

294
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,550
-楼上见吧  -好
- Meet you up there? - ?Yep.

295
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,960
假如你想打给慈善机构换搭档
If you're calling the charity for a new partner,

296
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,060
那是行不通的
it's not gonna work.

297
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,590
他们已经做好海报了
They already made the posters.

298
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,670
-可以点餐了吗  -迫不及待
- Ready to order? - ?Very.

299
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,860
我来这间餐厅只想点一样菜品
I came to this restaurant for one thing and one thing only.

300
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,530
是什么菜
And that thing is...?

301
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,530
抱歉  来一份你们世上最肥...
Sorry. Uh, one of your world fa--

302
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,670
世上最肥的热狗  这就来
One of our world's fattest hot dogs coming up.

303
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,040
不  是肥美小汉堡
No! The-the slider.

304
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,780
肉饼要几分熟
And how would you like it?

305
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,540
我
Me...

306
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,580
-是的  您  先生  -要三分熟
- Yes, you, sir. ?- ...dium rare.

307
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,470
能请你送到泳池来吗
And can you have it delivered to the pool, please?

308
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,460
当然
Of course.

309
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,280
那份小汉堡送到泳池
Okay, that slider goes to the pool,

310
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
还有一份贝克汉姆先生的送到顶楼
and it looks like we need one for Mr. Beckham to the roof.

311
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,420
你见到过穿黑帽衫的家伙吗
You seen a guy in a black hoodie?

312
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,590
-他刚走  -谢了
- Just left. - ?Thanks.

313
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,600
我去去就回
Oh, I'll be back.

314
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,910
我迫不及待想尝尝你们世上最肥的热狗
I'm dying to try one of your world's fattest hot dogs.

315
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,940
你到商场了吗
Hey, you here at the mall?

316
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,080
还没  你怎么喘得这么厉害
No, not yet. Why are you breathing so hard?

317
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
一群孩子在我旁边抽电子烟
Oh, um, a bunch of kids were vaping next to me,

318
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,800
我不得不伏地爬到香薰店里
and I had to army-crawl into a-a candle store.

319
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,800
我来都来了  你想买什么吗
Yeah. Is there anything you want while I'm here?

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
我能告诉你我"真正真正想要的"吗
Can I tell you what I want, what I really, really want?

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
{\an8}辣妹合唱团歌词

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
你正在看着我对吗
You're watching me right now, aren't you?

323
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,400
小卡  好吧
Cam, okay, look.

324
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,240
我只是希望能在健身房
I was hoping I'd run into Posh

325
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,580
遇到时髦辣妹聊上两句  好吗
here at the gym for a private moment, okay?

326
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,420
我们都希望遇到贝克汉姆夫妇
Look, we're both after the Beckhams.

327
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,100
我们一起制定一个计划
Let's come up with a plan together --

328
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,380
在泳池酒吧等我
meet me at the swim-up bar.

329
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,690
他们还有泳池酒吧
There's a swim-up bar?!

330
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,470
就是说  我们才该住在这里
I know, we should be living here

331
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,590
艾丽克斯该住在我们的破房子里
and Alex should be living in our stupid house.

332
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,420
希金斯  我需要你
Higgins, I need you!

333
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,850
你在哪
Where are you?!

334
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,130
您似乎遇到小麻烦了
A spot of bother, I see?

335
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,560
我做不到
I can't do it!

336
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,400
您当然可以
Oh, of course you can.

337
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
我爬到您身前
I'll just crawl in front of you

338
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,420
您就可以抓住我的腰
so you can grab me around the waist.

339
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,550
要是我笑出声了提前向您道歉
I apologize in advance for any giggling.

340
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,480
我这人天生很怕痒
I'm cursed with the tickle gene.

341
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,810
出什么事了
What's going on?

342
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,870
有人卡在滑梯上了
Someone's stuck on the slide.

343
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,570
她想爬回去  但是
She tried to climb back down, but --

344
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,100
-滑梯不许反悔[倒退]  我懂  -是啊
- No backsies, I get it. - Yeah.

345
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,640
那是我的
Oh, oh, oh! That's for me.

346
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,470
谢谢
Thank you.

347
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,600
-可是速度太快了  -不  别担心
- But it goes too fast! - Oh, no, don't worry.

348
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
我将不断收缩臀部来控制我们的速度
I shall vary the flex of my buttocks to control our speed.

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,660
我们会
We should be --

350
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,790
不
No!

351
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,580
请接受我最诚挚的歉意
My deepest apologies!

352
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,030
不
Oh, no!

353
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,580
好吧
Okay.

354
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,680
不
Noooo!!

355
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,690
麻烦解决
That one's sorted.

356
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,230
送一些气泡水到按摩浴缸帐篷
I need some sparkling water sent up to the hot tub cabanas.

357
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,100
不能说是给谁的
Can't say for whom,

358
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,840
但附带一杯香槟
but let's include a glass of champagne

359
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,480
以防他的"时髦"妻子一会儿也来
in case his posh wife joins him.

360
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,960
小心
Easy.

361
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,080
小心
Easy.

362
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,100
有没有搞错
Come on!

363
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,120
希金斯
Higgins!

364
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,290
听我说
Um, listen...

365
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,510
我需要你帮我弄来那个小汉堡[滑水者]
I need your help getting my hands on the slider.

366
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,400
滑水者吗
The slider?

367
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,910
当然
Oh, of course.

368
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,390
看着就诱人
Quite a looker, that one.

369
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,560
问题就在这  目前为止
Well, that's the problem -- so far,

370
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,340
我只能看  还没尝到
I've only been able to look and not taste.

371
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,150
无需多言  我会想办法将滑水者送来
Say no more. I shall find a way to deliver the slider to you.

372
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,000
太好了  有没有什么隐蔽些的地方
Great! Um, is there somewhere private

373
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,580
能让我单独享用它
where I could enjoy the slider alone?

374
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,140
我建议您去我们顶楼的按摩浴缸
Might I suggest one of our rooftop hot tubs

375
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,000
能眺望都市
overlooking the city?

376
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,270
完美  我在那等着
Perfect, I'll wait there.

377
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,440
我还需要一个围嘴  我总搞得满身污渍
And I'll-I'll need a bib -- I can make a mess.

378
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,580
还很脆
Still crisp.

379
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,720
他没走远
He's close.

380
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,480
我怎么又到这来了
How'd I get back here?

381
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,190
时髦辣妹
Ah, Posh.

382
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,610
多谢
Thank you.

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,540
您丈夫叫您去露台碰面
Your husband has asked that you meet him

384
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,950
一起在按摩浴缸里喝香槟
up in one of the rooftop hot tubs for some champagne.

385
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,250
菲尔
Phil.

386
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,230
希金斯  真正的敌人不是滑梯
Higgins! The slides aren't the enemy.

387
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,390
而是恐惧
Fear is.

388
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,820
见到我们的住客成长总是如此激动人心
It's always a thrill to see one of my residents grow.

389
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,890
顺带一提  某位神秘的先生
By the way, a certain mystery man

390
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,160
在楼内注意到了您的存在
has spotted you around the building

391
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,180
他希望您能去顶楼一聚
and has requested your presence on the roof.

392
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,860
杰总算知道搞浪漫了
Jay's finally doing something romantic!

393
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,810
我还以为他只是个不解风情的糟老头
Just when I thought he was a clueless grouch.

394
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,520
这地方有几个大堂啊
How many lobbies does this place have?!

395
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,890
打扰一下  哪里能买到泳衣
Excuse me. Where can I find a bathing suit?

396
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,880
所有帐篷里都有附赠的泳衣
Oh, there are complimentary suits in all of the cabanas.

397
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,080
别担心  我每晚亲自高温消毒
?Worry not, I boil them myself nightly.

398
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,220
机器人有这本事吗
Let's see a robot do that.

399
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,640
希金斯  我们有个不寻常的小请求
Hi, Higgins. We have a bit of an unusual request.

400
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,310
我们知道你必须谨言慎行  不过
Now, we know you need to be discreet, but...

401
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,540
我们希望能和某位杰出的英国人
we are hoping to have a rendezvous

402
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,420
来一场"不期而遇"
with a certain distinguished Brit.

403
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,130
我会为二位安排
Consider it arranged.

404
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,170
-好的  -好的
- Okay. - ?Okay.

405
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,980
还是没看到女士们的踪迹
Still no sign of the ladies.

406
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,510
或许她们是在另一个帐篷里
Maybe they're in a different cabana.

407
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,350
我的到了
Mine's here.

408
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,540
陪我等金发妹吧
Let's wait for the blonde.

409
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,430
我只有在成双成对的时候才玩得开
I only know how to do this with even numbers.

410
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,470
机器人先生
Hello, Mr. Robot!

411
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,620
能告诉我我的浪漫惊喜在哪里吗
Can you tell me where to go for my romantic surprise?

412
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,920
歌洛莉亚
Gloria?!

413
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,840
现在我的到了  但你的走了
Now mine's here, but yours is gone.

414
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,540
现在两个都跑了
Now they're both gone!

415
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,470
她们会回来的
They'll be back.

416
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,320
或许其中一个保姆出了问题
Maybe one of them had a nanny emergency.

417
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,540
去里面等她们吧
Let's wait for them in there.

418
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,600
小汉堡[滑水者]
Slider?

419
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,910
很快就到  请进3号帐篷等
Arriving shortly. Cabana 3.

420
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,780
谢谢
Thank you.

421
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,420
那事不宜迟  我们开始吧
Here we are, then.

422
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,510
希金斯  你在干什么
Higgins, what are you doing?!

423
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,000
要玩角色扮演啊
Oh, role play.

424
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,190
我知道我只是个低贱的马夫
I know I am but a lowly stable boy,

425
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,280
不允许进入主人们的住宿区域
unwanted in the master's quarters, but --

426
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,010
但或许你们会想要好好"教训"我呢
Perhaps you'd like to teach me a lesson?

427
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,660
别伤到脸就行
Just stay away from the face.

428
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,930
我们之间很明显有一些误会
Uh, obviously there's been some sort of misunderstanding.

429
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,660
我们看起来像是那种
Yeah, do we look like the kind of people

430
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,860
会喜欢跟别人玩奇怪角色扮演
that would be into some sort of weird role play

431
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,520
而且是带马夫情节的人吗
involving a stable boy?

432
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,160
我想他非常不乖
I'm assuming he's been naughty

433
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,550
会愿意做任何事来保住自己的工作吧
and would do anything to keep his job.

434
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,650
小卡  小卡
Cam -- Cam?

435
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,240
为自己辩护一下  我其实很常接到这种要求
In my defense, I do get this request quite often.

436
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,570
尤其是在圣诞节前后
Particularly around the holidays.

437
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,730
{\an8}耶稣在马厩中出生

438
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,730
其实呢...
Actually, um...

439
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,790
我们很希望能跟某一对明星夫妇见面
we were hoping to meet a certain celebrity couple.

440
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,830
无需多言
Yeah. ?Say no more.

441
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,250
我不能做任何保证  但请两位稍等
I make no promises, but let me just

442
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,920
等我穿好裤子  出浴缸尽力安排一下
wriggle back into my shorts and make some inquiries.

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,370
来得真巧
Ah, wonderful timing!

444
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,550
请移驾3号帐篷  您的神秘男士正在等候
Please step into Cabana 3 -- your mystery man awaits.

445
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,350
你好啊
Hi.

446
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,390
我知道我们不应该偷偷在这里见面
I know that you and I aren't supposed to be here,

447
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,780
但经过我今天的经历
but after today,

448
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,450
我不想再被恐惧控制生活
I am tired of living a life of fear.

449
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,700
歌洛莉亚是克莱尔为我准备的棕发惊喜吗
Was Gloria Claire's brunette surprise?

450
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,480
起因是克莱尔送了我"乐园"的入场券
It all started when Claire gave me a free pass to Fun Town.

451
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,160
我就想  那今天来试试看

放胆去"玩"  看看感觉如何
Take a ride, see how it feels.

453

454

她绑头带时跟现在看起来不太一样啊
She looked different with a headband on.

457
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,490
先在按摩浴缸里暖身
Warming up in a hot tub first --

458
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,010
不是寻常套路  但只要能让小贝放松就行
unconventional, but, hey, anything to loosen up Becks.

459
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,210
我们有认识叫贝姬的吗
Did we meet a Becky?

460
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,050
或许吧  当时那么多女人
Maybe. There were so many of them.

461
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,960
所以小贝是几岁了来着
So, how old is this Becks?

44.

好戏上场啦
It's on.

464

是啊  我也十分有心想学
Yep, and I'm eager to learn.

467

警告一下  我身材比较走形了  但我的腿功还是一流
A warning -- my form is clumsy, but I'm great on my feet.

好吧  男的谁来
Okay, who gets the dude?

469
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,830
这件事从未发生过
This never happened.

470
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,340
行吧  我来处理他
Fine, I'll take him.

471
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,750
但我跟他就只是先熟悉一下再看情况啊
But we're just gonna hang out and see where it goes.

472
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,140
抱歉打扰了
Pardon the interruption.

473
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,880
看来您已享用完滑水者[小汉堡]啦
It looks like you're finished with the slider?

474
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,280
是啊  我能说句实话吗  我喜欢面包[屁股]大点
I am, and can I be honest? I prefer bigger buns.

475
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,950
偶尔能这样男人与男人间聊天  感觉很不错吧
It's wonderful to just talk like men sometimes, isn't it?

476
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,830
是啊
It is.

477
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,290
杰  你怎么来了
Jay, what are you doing here?

478
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,570
我花了一天的时间在找一个王八...
I've spent the whole day looking for that miserable --

479
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,710
你就是那个毛衫美食家吗
You're the Foodie in a Who-dy?!

480
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,020
你为何会这么认为呢
W-Why would you say that?

481
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,200
番茄酱
Ketchup!

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,910
我很努力了  但真的没听懂你的话
I'm trying, but I'm lost!

483
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,460
你侮辱了我妈
You insulted my mother!

484
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,010
天啊  你是厨巨王走吗
Oh, my God. You're Close to Utlaw?!

485
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,630
是橱柜狂徒
It's Closet Outlaw!

486
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,850
杰  你生气我不怪你
Jay, I don't blame you for being mad.

487
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,260
我让我的粉丝大军去喷了你  还有...
I-I turned my legions of fans against you, and, uh...

但我刚听说你家有个比这个严重多了的问题啊
But you got a bigger problem at home that I just heard about,

490
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,240

-克莱尔  -歌洛莉亚
- Claire? - ?Oh! Gloria.

492
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,710
真不敢相信你能认出我
I can't believe you recognized me.

493
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,660
我的头发真是很对不起了

我很高兴我们终于可以聊这件事了
I'm so glad that we can finally talk about it.

你就放心让它长吧  让你自己当个女孩
