1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,180
- All right, so that's
two bedrooms upstairs--

2
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,398
both the guest and the master.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:08,878
- That master bedroom
is incredible.

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,620
- Right? It's like a--
a king lives in there.

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,840
- Guest bathroom
for all the guests

6
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,146
that one would have

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,672
over for dinner in
your sweet, sweet kitchen.

8
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,326
- It's nice.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,806
- This is, like, bigger than any
house I've ever lived in before.

10
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,851
- It's really nice.
- This is what they call

11
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,636
a "waterfall" countertop.

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,767
Look at it, it's glorious.

13
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,421
- You should get it.
It's really nice.

14
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,162
- It better be nice for
the price that they're asking,

15
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,469
which I'm hoping maybe
someday you'll split with me.

16
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,862
- What?
- I'm playing with you.

17
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,690
I'm playing with you.
- That's not funny.

18
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,344
- I'm playing, I'm playing,
I'm playing, I'm playing.

19
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,172
But seriously, you like it?
- I like it.

20
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,957
- Okay, 'cause I would hope
that you'd spend

21
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,524
a little bit of time
with me over here.

22
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,483
- We'll see.
- We'll see?

23
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,702
All right.

24
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:53,357
- Mm, I'm pretty sure
that this is illegal.

25
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,880
- I'm pretty sure I know
a few cops

26
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,839
that can help us out
just in case we get in trouble.

27
00:00:56,882 --> 00:01:00,060
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's good.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,898
- No.

29
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,466
- Hold on.

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,034
- We gotta go.
- Unfortunately, yes.

31
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,123
Okay.

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,606
You got that?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,087
- All right.

34
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:48,934
- Well?

35
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,371
- Everything looks good,
Antonio.

36
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:53,025
There's no tears,
no fractures, no arthritis.

37
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,724
- All right, then, why does
my shoulder still hurt so much?

38
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:56,768
- I'm not sure.

39
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,248
So when you say "pain,"

40
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,294
what type of discomfort
are you experiencing?

41
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,773
Is it stiffness, soreness?

42
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,906
- I don't know.
Uh, pain.

43
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:07,170
- You probably just need
to give it some more rest.

44
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:09,694
- Yeah.

45
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:13,176
Hey, uh, I'm gonna need
a refill on that prescription.

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,525
- Another one?

47
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,788
- I need something
to help with the pain, so.

48
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,095
- It's been three months
since the injury.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,444
There's no structural damage.

50
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,316
- It's the only thing
that helps with the pain.

51
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,145
- I get it, but this would be
your fourth refill.

52
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,624
I mean, that's a lot
of Oxycodone,

53
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,583
especially for
an injury like this.

54
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,716
- Like I said, it still hurts.
- I understand, but--

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,283
- You know what, look,
I'm not some junkie

56
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,981
looking to hustle my doc
for some pills.

57
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,292
I'm a cop.

58
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:46,340
I just need help with the pain
so I can do my job.

59
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:49,560
- Look, I'm sorry.
I could lose my license.

60
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,345
If you need any help,
anything at all--

61
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,085
- I don't need any help, Doc.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,178
- What happened?

63
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,138
Nothing, I--
- Your hand is bleeding.

64
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,705
- I'm okay, sweetie.

65
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,925
I was just--
I was fooling around.

66
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,145
I was shadow-boxing and I--
I hit the stupid mirror.

67
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,538
- You sure you're okay?

68
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:57,672
- Yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing home, anyway?

69
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:01,284
I thought you had mid-terms?
- I forgot my notebook.

70
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,546
- Well, I suggest
you find your notebook

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,983
and get back to the library.

72
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,855
Go.

73
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,997
Not right now.

74
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,306
- Where's Antonio?
He's not picking up his phone.

75
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,700
- Huh.
- So what's going on?

76
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,528
- Jay busts some punk
this morning with

77
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,443
an ounce of heroin in his car,
gave up the drug house.

78
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,922
Supposed to be moving
a lot of Fentanyl.

79
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,489
We're gonna hit it,
and see what we can find.

80
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,404
- Yeah, and who we can flip.

81
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,058
- Yeah, so I want you
to bust them all, too.

82
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:39,279
Junkies, dealers,
girlfriends, everyone.

83
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,106
Hey, you know
where Antonio is?

84
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,673
- No, I've been
calling him but...

85
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,980
- Huh.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,765
- Right, so Hailey, Burgess,
and I will take the front.

87
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,245
Ruzek, Atwater,
you guys take the back.

88
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,507
- All right, hit it.

89
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,422
I'll see you all
back at the district.

90
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,163
- Do we have any
names or pictures?

91
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,512
- No, we're flying blind.

92
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,471
But that makes it fun, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,822
- Chicago PD, nobody move!

94
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,302
- Cops! Cops!

95
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,651
Go, go-go-go-go!
- Damn it.

96
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,348
Nobody move!
Hands in the air, now!

97
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,437
- Runners to the right!
- I said hands in the air, now!

98
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,786
- Get up against the wall.
- Get your hands up!

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,440
- This has gotta be
some kind of mistake, man.

100
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,312
- Hands where I can see them!
- Turn around!

101
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,965
- This must be
some kind of mistake.

102
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,794
- This is a mistake?
What is this, aspirin?

103
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,843
What's all this, man?

104
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,455
Look at the wall.
- Hey! Chicago PD!

105
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,152
- Face the wall,
put your hands behind your back.

106
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,290
Adam, I got four
coming out the back!

107
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,726
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put your hands up!

108
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,206
Put your hands up!
- Come here!

109
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,642
I want to see hands!
- It's cool. It's cool.

110
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:39,991
- Hands up!
- Get on the ground!

111
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,384
Come here.
- It's cool. I'm cool.

112
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,472
- Oh, my hand, man!
- Hey--

113
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,821
- You, look--look at the wall.

114
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,475
Don't look at me,
just get on the wall, okay?

115
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,781
- Put your hands behind
your back right now.

116
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,391
Hands behind your back...
- Damn!

117
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,479
- Damn it.
- Burgess, you got her?

118
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,002
- Go, go, go!
I got her.

119
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,830
Hey, you got anything
that could hurt me in there?

120
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,136
- No, I don't know those guys.
- Hey! Do not--

121
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,355
You do not turn around.

122
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,834
- I didn't do anything.
- Hey.

123
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,054
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
- I got him, I got him!

124
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,360
Chicago PD!

125
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,105
Police!
Freeze!

126
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,349
Chicago PD!
Get down!

127
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,177
Get down right now
or I will shoot you!

128
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,439
Put your hands up.

129
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,136
Hands in the air!

130
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,051
Now turn around real slow.

131
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,792
Real slow.

132
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,407
What the hell?

133
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,235
- Don't shoot.
It's me.

134
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,674
- Antonio?

135
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,897
- Antonio,
what the hell happened?

136
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,551
You were--you were
doing a buy in the house?

137
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,074
- It's not that hard
to understand, Adam.

138
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:04,424
I got a tip from a CI.

139
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,903
Came to check it out
so I did a buy.

140
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,122
- You didn't want
to tell anybody you were here?

141
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,471
We could have covered you.

142
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,125
- Oh, I got the tip
20 minutes ago.

143
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,822
I was in the area,
figured I'd come check it out.

144
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,608
It's no big deal.
- Yeah, it is a big deal, man.

145
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,524
I almost shot you.

146
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,873
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,137
I should have
identified myself earlier.

148
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,096
- Antonio, look.

149
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,924
I don't mean to pry but, uh--
- Then don't.

150
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,013
- But we all called you
like a bunch of times.

151
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,841
- I came here to do
some undercover work.

152
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,496
Things got screwed up.
End of story.

153
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,150
- You break protocol,
it's end of story.

154
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,282
One of us does it,
bro, you would want our badge.

155
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,719
- I swear to God, Adam--

156
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,155
- Antonio, it's a little
out of character, man.

157
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,070
She almost shot you.
- Hey, listen, listen.

158
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,637
Nobody got hurt.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,465
There's a lot of eyes around

160
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:50,948
so let's just leave it
alone for now.

161
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,689
- Okay.

162
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:59,522
- You okay?

163
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,568
- No.

164
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,420
- Hey.
Can I get a ride?

165
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,900
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

166
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,989
I, uh, drove here with Jay
but he's stuck doing

167
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:35,906
the paper work so he's gonna be
like another hour or so.

168
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,170
Are these yours, or...

169
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:42,043
- No, I did a buy, remember?

170
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,046
- Right.
Okay.

171
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,569
So I'll just take them
and lock them with the other--

172
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,571
- No, no, no, that's okay.
I can do it.

173
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,878
- Uh, no.
I almost killed you.

174
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,662
I mean, it's the last I can do.

175
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,317
- I'm good.

176
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,669
- Look--hey--uh,

177
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,716
I mean, I'm your partner...
and your friend.

178
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,980
If something's going on...

179
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,982
- I'm fine.

180
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,860
- All right, Patrick Carter.

181
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:19,602
He's a mid-level player
according to Narcotics.

182
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,386
All his priors
are cocaine-related,

183
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,867
so he must have just started
pushing synthetic opioids.

184
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,608
- Controls on legit oxy
are getting tight,

185
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,218
so this fake stuff,
it's everywhere.

186
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,916
- Yeah, killing a lot
of people, too.

187
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,962
- 11 overdoses last month
in that neighborhood.

188
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,877
- Hey, why don't I
take a run at this guy,

189
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,705
see if I can get him
to flip up to his supplier?

190
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,185
- Uh, too late.
He lawyered up

191
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,101
the second they brought him
into interrogation.

192
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,755
All right, let's dig
into Carter's phone,

193
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,713
digital footprint,
known associates.

194
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:46,673
See if we can ID
who's supplying the pills.

195
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,631
Hey, give me a sec,
will you, Antonio?

196
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,286
- Yeah.
- Help me out.

197
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,811
Why you flying solo
at that drug house?

198
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,117
- Well, it's like
I told the other guys.

199
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,119
I got a tip from a CI.
I was in the area.

200
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,774
I figured I'd act on it.
- Huh.

201
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,645
Why'd you run?

202
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,474
- Man.
I thought it was a rip.

203
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:09,391
Guns were coming out,
heard yelling, so I took off.

204
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,436
- Hurt your hand?

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,090
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

206
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,962
Cut it moving some bricks
in the backyard.

207
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,528
It's no big deal.
Didn't even need stitches.

208
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,661
- Huh.

209
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,055
- That it?

210
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,406
- Thanks.
- You got it.

211
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,805
- Come on.

212
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,156
- Hey, hey.
- Shh.

213
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,940
- You'd better have a damn good
explanation for this, Antonio.

214
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,115
- I don't, and keep it down.
- Hey, we had a deal.

215
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,943
You keep me safe
and I get you pills.

216
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,206
Instead, you set me up.
- I didn't. It was a mistake.

217
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,512
I didn't know
they were gonna be there.

218
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,992
- You work with these people.

219
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,080
How did you not know that
they were looking at me?

220
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,777
Man, you must think I'm a idiot.

221
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,779
- I'm doing everything I can
but it's not gonna be easy.

222
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,041
- I don't care if it's easy.

223
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,782
Okay, just get it done,

224
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,479
'cause I ain't going down
for this alone, Antonio.

225
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,525
I can promise you that.
- Look, look, look.

226
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:57,700
The only way I can make a deal

227
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,441
is if you offer up
your supplier.

228
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,138
- You want me to flip?

229
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,140
Get my family killed?
What the hell are you thinking?

230
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,447
- You gonna cooperate?
Yes or no.

231
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,710
Yes or no?

232
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,060
- Fine.
But no jail time.

233
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,410
I'm 47 years old.
I can't go back to prison.

234
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,674
I won't go back.

235
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:15,762
I'm gonna walk.

236
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,894
I want full immunity.

237
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,635
- All right,
I'll see what I can do.

238
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,160
You just keep your mouth shut
or I'll bury you behind this.

239
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,871
Good news, Sarge.
I just talked to Carter.

240
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:40,003
- I told you he lawyered up.
- I know.

241
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,526
I had an angle,
so I took a run at him.

242
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,832
- What are you talking about?

243
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,921
- Listen, he said he'll flip

244
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,663
if we can work out a good deal.

245
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,925
- How good?

246
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,536
- He wants full immunity.
- That's it?

247
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,322
What about a beach house
in Malibu? A new Tesla?

248
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,758
- Look, I'm just
telling you what he said.

249
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,325
- He's got two felony priors.

250
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,762
Unless his supplier
is Pablo Escobar,

251
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,068
he can forget about it.

252
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,417
- There's gotta be
something we can work out.

253
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,550
- Antonio,
it's an election year.

254
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,769
No one is gonna kick

255
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,466
a known pill dealer
with two priors.

256
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,729
The optics are terrible.

257
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:13,602
- Since when do you care
about optics?

258
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,691
- What the hell is going on?

259
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,606
- What do you mean?

260
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,000
- You don't look so good, bro.

261
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,436
Something you want to tell me?

262
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,568
- I'm fine.

263
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:34,144
- Yeah, listen--
I want you to move Carter.

264
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,885
I don't want Antonio
anywhere near him.

265
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,235
You understand?

266
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,716
Thanks, Trudy.

267
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,772
- Yo.

268
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,425
Looking for some Oxy.

269
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,253
- Don't carry that.

270
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,821
- How about Vicodin?
- I got rocks and blow.

271
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,041
That's it, jefe.

272
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,740
Give me a dime of H.

273
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,091
- My man over there
will hook you up.

274
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,113
- Give it to me.

275
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,419
- Hank, what the hell
are you doing?

276
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,899
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

277
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,117
- Come on,
don't make a jerk out of me.

278
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:35,292
- What are you doing?

279
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,555
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

280
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,652
- Uh, hey, you should know--

281
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:48,828
- It's all right,
it's all right.

282
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,003
- No, wait, look--
- Hey.

283
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,178
- I was meeting up with a CI
and he--

284
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,657
- Don't do that.
- No, I was--

285
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,572
I was meeting with a CI.
- Hey, don't do that.

286
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,966
Listen to me.

287
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,794
I'm gonna help
get you through this.

288
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,318
I don't need help.

289
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,016
I don't need any help.
- Come on, hey.

290
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,669
- It's all right.

291
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,890
Hey.

292
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,500
- Come on.

293
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,156
Come on.

294
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,376
It's gonna be fine.

295
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,030
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,988
I don't know
what the hell happened.

297
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:22,818
- It's gonna be all right.

298
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,689
No, it--it's not.

299
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,825
That dealer, Carter...
- Yeah.

300
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,393
- I know him.
- Okay.

301
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,616
He was giving me pills.

302
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,922
I

303
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,534
- You promised
you'd look out, right?

304
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,709
It's okay.

305
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,668
Listen--hey.

306
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,061
We're gonna deal
with that, too.

307
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,367
We're gonna deal with that.

308
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,891
- Listen to me.

309
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,196
Listen.

310
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,895
- Right now we gotta
get you clean, okay?

311
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,159
- I...

312
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,944
- I'm gonna take you home.

313
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,904
- I'm gonna take care of you.
okay?

314
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,297
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

315
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,692
It's okay.

316
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,826
- It's okay.

317
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,241
- There's nothing there.

318
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,375
- Come on, pack your bag.

319
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,246
You're going into
rapid detox today.

320
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,944
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

321
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,947
- Yeah, well, I'm not asking.

322
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,210
Look, I'll cover for you
while you're gone.

323
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,429
Won't go any further
than this room.

324
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,789
- It's Eva.
She's cooking dinner tonight.

325
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,401
- Hm.
- Hey, sweetie.

326
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,360
Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

327
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,450
Who is this?

328
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,582
What?

329
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,323
What are you--
what are you talk--

330
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,977
Put Eva on the phone!

331
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,980
Hey, put her on the phone!

332
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,372
- What's going on?

333
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,943
- I think someone
just kidnapped my daughter.

334
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,394
- Antonio.

335
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,788
All right, the team's here.

336
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,659
Come on.

337
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:52,533
Just get your head on straight.
Eva needs you.

338
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,405
- Yeah.

339
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,016
- Yeah.

340
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,498
- So Antonio
got a call from Eva at 1:24.

341
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,717
Then the last call
from Eva's phone

342
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,675
was from the kidnapper
at 2:21.

343
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,981
- I called OCD Tech Lab

344
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,983
and put an emergency ping
on Eva's phone.

345
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,985
- Already checked all
the outside doors and windows.

346
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,204
There's no sign
of forced entry.

347
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,422
- There's no sign of struggle

348
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,771
outside the house either.
- No.

349
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,425
- That's because
she never made it home.

350
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,644
She always puts her backpack

351
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,689
right here on
the kitchen counter.

352
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,865
It's not here, so...

353
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,303
- I mean, you sure it's not
something to do with school?

354
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,479
Maybe a boy from school?

355
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,658
- The guy on the phone
said I made a mistake.

356
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,486
That dealer, Paddy Carter?

357
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,270
He wasn't supposed
to get arrested.

358
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,620
That's because
I wasn't at that drug house

359
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:39,797
to do a buy-bust.

360
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:43,279
I was there
to score Oxy for me.

361
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,846
- Hm.

362
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,506
- I'm sorry, guys.

363
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,168
- I assume I'm free to go.

364
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,129
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

365
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,262
- Antonio Dawson's daughter.
- "Daughter"?

366
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:10,524
What the hell
are you talking about?

367
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,178
- You had a deal with Antonio.

368
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:15,485
You think he screwed you so you
had someone grab his daughter.

369
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,531
You think I'm stupid?

370
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,880
I'm trying to get out of jail.

371
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,664
Why would I kidnap
a cop's daughter?

372
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,711
- You better be telling
the truth, Paddy.

373
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,713
Or you and me?

374
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,064
We're gonna have a problem.

375
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,898
- No, no.
Antonio, wait.

376
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,682
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

377
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,206
I told you, stay upstairs.

378
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,685
- What'd he say, Hank?

379
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,296
- Nothing.

380
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,385
He said he had no idea
what we were talking about.

381
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,169
- He's lying.
- Maybe not.

382
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,171
I checked the logs.
He hasn't had any visitors

383
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,086
or phone calls
since he's been in lockup.

384
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,435
- You check
the security cameras?

385
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,089
- I did.
Until now, the only person

386
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,004
he talked to was you,
and we should probably

387
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,920
make sure that conversation
is accidentally erased.

388
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,096
- Okay, we'll take care
of that later.

389
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,794
Come on, let's go.

390
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:07,842
Okay, so the question is...

391
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,757
do we want to do this
off the books,

392
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,802
or do we want to
involve CPD and FBI?

393
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,195
But if we go big,

394
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,762
you're gonna have to
come clean about everything.

395
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:15,937
- I don't care
about any of that.

396
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,417
I just want to find Eva.

397
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,766
I'll do whatever you want,

398
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,246
whatever gives us
the best chances.

399
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,382
- Jay, what do you got?

400
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,168
Good.
Chase it down.

401
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,866
Jay and Hailey
just found a witness.

402
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,132
- I heard somebody screaming.

403
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,482
I looked out my window,
I saw a man and a woman

404
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,657
up near the alley.

405
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,963
- Why didn't you call it in?

406
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,617
- It looked like
they were in an argument.

407
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,792
You don't call the cops
every time

408
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,750
somebody gets into a beef.

409
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,883
It was right here.

410
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,232
They went up the alley.

411
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,625
I didn't see what happened
after that.

412
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,409
- Can you describe the man?

413
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,238
- White guy, blue jacket.

414
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,805
I've seen her
around the neighborhood

415
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,285
but I've never seen him before.

416
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,374
- Jay?

417
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,820
- What do we got?
- We pinged Eva's phone.

418
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,430
It was recovered on
the median of I-94

419
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,649
near the Damen underpass.

420
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,042
I guess he tossed it
out the window.

421
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,305
Fortunately
the nearest camera is

422
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,176
two mile markers up the highway.
- Prints?

423
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,352
- Not yet, but we did
hand-deliver it to the lab, so--

424
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,919
- We pulled surveillance
from an apartment

425
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,877
two blocks
from Antonio's house.

426
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,837
It matches the timeline
of the kidnapping.

427
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,320
Are you sure you want
to see this?

428
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:37,018
- Play it.

429
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,864
- Okay, right there.

430
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,866
Should be able
to pull the plate.

431
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,565
- Run that plate.

432
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:07,875
- All right, vehicle's
registered to a Jason Rizzo.

433
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,485
- Antonio,
you recognize this guy?

434
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:10,921
- He looks familiar.

435
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,183
I think he might have
worked with Carter.

436
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,533
- He's got two priors
for possession,

437
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,535
one for aggravated battery,
and--

438
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:19,060
he did two years in Stateville
for statutory rape.

439
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,327
- Address is in Uptown.
804 Christopher.

440
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:27,721
- All right, listen up,
before we make our first move

441
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,245
I'm gonna make something
crystal clear.

442
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,160
From this moment on,
we are off the books.

443
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,641
You want to walk, walk now.

444
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,904
No one's gonna judge you.

445
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,998
- Let's go get Eva.

446
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,561
- Clear.

447
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,612
Show me your hands!
- Okay, okay, okay!

448
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,830
Who are you?
What do you want?

449
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,223
- Get up!
- Okay!

450
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,877
- Come here. Come here.
Where's Rizzo?

451
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,182
- Uh, he's not here.

452
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,184
- Where is he?
- I don't know, I swear!

453
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,361
- Why were you hiding?
- Because I'm scared of Rizzo!

454
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,579
He's an addict.

455
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,711
I've been trying to kick him out

456
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:45,929
for a month but he won't leave!

457
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,148
- When's the last time
you seen him?

458
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,584
- About an hour ago.

459
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,890
I told him that I was
gonna change the locks

460
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,282
and he said that he'd kill me.

461
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,241
- Was he with anybody?
- I don't know.

462
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,809
Whenever he's around, I stay
in here with the door locked.

463
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,855
- Sit down, shut up.
Don't move.

464
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,250
- Antonio?

465
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:48,949
There's something in the garage

466
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,343
we need you to take a look at.

467
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,928
- It's Eva's.

468
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,158
- So along with the backpack
we found, uh,

469
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,856
zip ties, duct tape.

470
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,989
Standard kidnap kit.

471
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:31,687
- The blood on the rag
is fresh.

472
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:35,038
- Okay, so that means
that Eva was just here.

473
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:38,520
So let's hit the streets,
find some witnesses.

474
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:39,869
Come on, pull it together.

475
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,219
Let's go.

476
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,918
- Dawson.

477
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,397
- Hey.

478
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,356
Put it on speaker.

479
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,879
- Who am I talking to?

480
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,490
- You're talking to the guy
who's gonna

481
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,492
put a bullet
in your daughter's head

482
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,276
if Paddy Carter don't walk.

483
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,538
- I'm working on it.

484
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,974
It's--it's gonna take
a little longer.

485
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,542
- You got four hours,
Detective.

486
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,762
- Don't--don't hang up.

487
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,720
I need proof of life.

488
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,505
- What's that mean?

489
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,420
- I need to know
my daughter's alive.

490
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,118
- No, you need

491
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,076
to release Paddy Carter.

492
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,904
- No, I need to know
my daughter's alive.

493
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,081
If I don't hear her voice,
then you got no deal!

494
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,301
- Daddy, please help me!
Help me!

495
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,694
[hard slap]
- Shut up!

496
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,347
- Let me go!
- Sweetie, don't worry.

497
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:24,740
- Dad!
- I'm coming for you.

498
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,655
- Help! Help me!
- You just be strong.

499
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,527
- Shut up!
You got four hours,

500
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,572
Detective, or I kill her.

501
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:31,921
- Hang on, hang on, hey-hey-hey.

502
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,575
Let's--let's figure this out.

503
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,272
You and me,
let's--come on, man.

504
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:37,318
Hey, you there?

505
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,449
Rizzo?

506
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,581
Hey, you there?

507
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,888
- Hey, hey.
He hung up.

508
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,759
All right, we're already
up on Antonio's phone.

509
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,456
I want you to trace that call.

510
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,806
Let's hit the streets.

511
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,416
We're gonna find
some witnesses.

512
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,766
Let's go.

513
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,949
- Keep Antonio away.
- Copy that.

514
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,777
- I want my lawyer.
- Step back.

515
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,519
- Hey, where's my lawyer?
- Jason Rizzo is your cousin!

516
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,870
- So?
- So he kidnapped Eva Dawson.

517
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,176
- Wait, what the hell
are you talking--

518
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,961
- You told him to kidnap
Dawson's daughter!

519
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,659
- No, I didn't, I swear--
ow!

520
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,009
- His only ask
was that you walk.

521
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,793
Why would he do that
on his own?

522
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,752
- Because he's an idiot
and an addict,

523
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:20,883
and every time I try
to help him out,

524
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:21,928
it bites me in the ass.

525
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,843
- How does Rizzo know Antonio?

526
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,714
- Because he's been
helping me out lately.

527
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,411
Okay, he knows the deal
that I have with Antonio.

528
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,500
He delivered a package
to his house last week.

529
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:32,155
Look, he probably only
wants me out to get more drugs.

530
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,594
He doesn't think
right in the head, this kid.

531
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,639
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

532
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:38,988
All I can tell you is

533
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,164
if you don't
do what this monster says,

534
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,644
he'll kill her.

535
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:57,224
- Where you going, boss?

536
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:05,493
- Hey, Sam.

537
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,321
Thank you for meeting me.

538
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,670
Listen, I heard you caught

539
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,063
that pill case
we just brought in.

540
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,978
- Yeah, it's a good one.
I'm looking forward to it.

541
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:15,198
- Yeah, well, I need a favor.
- Name it.

542
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:18,549
- I want you to
let Carter walk on this.

543
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,031
- Look, there were some
unintended consequences

544
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,817
to that bust, and I can't
get into the details right now.

545
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,472
But the only way
to fix it is to kick Carter.

546
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,692
- Look, maybe I can hold off
the probable cause hearing,

547
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,041
buy you guys some time.

548
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,218
- It's gotta be within
the next three hours.

549
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,959
- It's election season.

550
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,918
Every candidate in Chicago's
stomping on each other

551
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,789
trying to prove
they're tougher on crime.

552
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,225
I'm not sure
I can make that happen.

553
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,012
- Look, one of my guys
is jammed up bad.

554
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,492
- I need this.

555
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:51,147
- It's a tough ask.
- I know.

556
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:55,325
But you know I'll make it up
to you down the road.

557
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,893
- Okay.

558
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:00,809
Uh, I'll recommend
expedited release

559
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:04,334
based off of
insufficient evidence, huh?

560
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:08,817
- Thank you.

561
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,693
- Parked in the same place.
- Uh-huh.

562
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,739
- Any word yet?
- Nothing yet.

563
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:18,740
- Voight said
it was a done deal.

564
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,089
What's taking so long?

565
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,308
- I'll make some calls,
see what I can do.

566
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,483
Antonio, Antonio.

567
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,050
Antonio.
- Antonio?

568
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,095
Hey.
Where the hell's Eva?

569
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,575
I've been calling her
all afternoon

570
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:28,576
and she doesn't pick up.

571
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,144
She's not at the house.

572
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:36,671
What is that?

573
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:38,934
"Taken."

574
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,241
You--you mean kidnapped?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,286
It happened right after school,
so--but don't worry.

576
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,114
We're, you know--
- No, no, no-no-no.

577
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:46,768
You're--you're wrong.
She's just with a friend.

578
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,901
She's--did you try
calling Grace or Noa?

579
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,424
- She's not--
she's not at a friend's.

580
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,773
- Well maybe she's with a boy.

581
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,122
She was always afraid
to tell you about boys

582
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,515
because you get
so freaked out all the time--

583
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,516
- No!
She's not with a boy.

584
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,647
Listen--listen to me.

585
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,301
She was kidnapped.

586
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,348
This can't be happening again.

587
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,785
- Look--
- No, no, no, Tony, it can't.

588
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,308
- Listen--
- This can't be happening again.

589
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,267
- Listen, I promise
I'm gonna find her.

590
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,400
- I told you to quit this job
when they took Diego.

591
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,489
There were a million
other things you could have--

592
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:16,798
- We got Diego back
and we're gonna get Eva--

593
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,806
- You chose this job
over your family.

594
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,330
I hope it was worth it.

595
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,605
- That's actually the special
mayor's division...

596
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:46,306
- Come in, Hank.

597
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,612
What the hell are you thinking?
- Kate--

598
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:51,224
- The ASA wants to kick the guy
we just busted

599
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,052
for selling opioids
on your recommendation?

600
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,270
- I know what it looks like.

601
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:55,794
- One of the ODs
in the neighborhood

602
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,492
is a kid that goes to school
with Brian Kelton's kids.

603
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,233
- Listen, I can't
get into the details--

604
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,365
- His entire campaign is run

605
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,106
on tough on crime,
tough on drugs.

606
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,239
- I get it.

607
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:08,284
Look, one of my guys
has a problem.

608
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,417
I mean, a real problem.

609
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,159
The only way to fix it
is to kick Carter, Kate.

610
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm asking you a favor.

611
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,514
- I'm sorry, truly.

612
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:21,950
My hands are tied.

613
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,996
Kelton just did a press
conference on the Carter bust

614
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,998
an hour ago.
He already rang the bell.

615
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,652
There's nothing I can do, Hank.

616
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,934
- You got 30 seconds
to give me something good,

617
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:52,154
something that helps me
find Rizzo,

618
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:53,590
or today's gonna be the day

619
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,767
you end up hanging yourself
with your own shirt.

620
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,334
- I don't know anything.

621
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,032
I'm the one getting
screwed here, not--not Dawson.

622
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,566
- Tell me where Rizzo is,

623
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,307
who he runs with,

624
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,225
who might help him,
give him money, a car.

625
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,270
Give me something, Paddy,

626
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,751
or I'll choke you out
right here and now.

627
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:27,407
- Okay, okay, just let me go.

628
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,415
Ah--ah--
- Start talking, Paddy.

629
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,286
- Okay, okay,
let me just catch my breath.

630
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,549
- Start talking!
- There's a--there's a guy.

631
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,594
His name is Gary.

632
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,683
He's got a scrap yard
out in Cicero.

633
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,685
They like to go out there
to get drunk and get high.

634
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,165
- That's all you got?
Nothing else?

635
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,602
- No, nothing.

636
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,952
They find Dawson's daughter,
that mean I get released?

637
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,565
- That means
you might get to live.

638
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,887
- You Gary McCoy?

639
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,454
- Yeah?

640
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,803
- When was the last time
you talked to

641
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:18,545
your friend, Jason Rizzo?

642
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,590
- None of your business.
- That's the wrong answer.

643
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,201
- I'm gonna look around
over here.

644
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:23,593
- You talk to him today?

645
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,247
- You got a warrant
or something?

646
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,988
- I don't need a warrant
to ask you questions.

647
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,207
- Questions about a kidnapping.

648
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,425
What do you know about that?

649
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,732
- I fix cars and I drink beer.

650
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,255
- Right.

651
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,431
- Yo, check this out.

652
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,259
Rizzo's car back there.

653
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,392
- Oh, you'd better
start talking fast,

654
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,828
'cause things are gonna go bad.

655
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,221
- "Go bad"?

656
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,136
The hell are you
gonna do about it?

657
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,964
- Rizzo switched out
his car here.

658
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,009
- What'd you give him, Gary?
- Make and model.

659
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,445
We need it now.

660
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,490
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

661
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,708
- You're not going anywhere.

662
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:52,709
- Do not grab me, lady.

663
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,668
- Hey!
Come here. Come here.

664
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,930
- The hell is wrong
with you, huh?

665
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,105
- Say you're sorry.

666
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,628
Say you're sorry!
- It's fine!

667
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,413
We're talking about
a kidnapping, here, Gary.

668
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,284
That's life in prison
for Rizzo and for you

669
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,416
if you don't cooperate.

670
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,027
What car did you give Rizzo?

671
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,552
- Car's out front.

672
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:12,903
Rizzo's in Room 201.
- Okay, listen up.

673
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,818
We're moving in fast and dark.

674
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,907
This offender
is armed and dangerous,

675
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,953
so you all have a green light.

676
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,303
Let's hit it.
Antonio.

677
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,697
I need you to hang back, bro.

678
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,394
- Hank, there's nothing
you can do or say right now

679
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,395
that's gonna
keep me from going in there.

680
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,267
I'm going in first.

681
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:45,197
- Go.

682
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,686
- Watch out, watch out.

683
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,820
Eva!

684
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:01,343
Eva!

685
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:03,911
- All right, come on.
Get up!

686
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,217
Get up and put
your head on the wall.

687
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,393
Hands up.
- Okay, all right.

688
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,359
- Sweetie?

689
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:21,189
It's Daddy.
It's Daddy.

690
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,148
I'm here, I'm here.
Can you hear me?

691
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,239
Can you hear me?

692
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,240
- 50-21, roll an ambulance

693
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,764
to 1900 Fisher now.

694
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,288
- Copy that.

695
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,599
- You're gonna be okay.
You're safe now.

696
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,906
Just stay strong, sweetie.
I'm gonna take care of you.

697
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,607
Hey.

698
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,956
How's she doing?

699
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,566
Any serious injuries?
- Not sure.

700
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,915
We need to do more tests,

701
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,482
but she appears to be
in stable condition.

702
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,093
- I saw scratches on her face,
and I saw

703
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,877
some down below
by her waist and legs.

704
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,619
Do you know if--
did she say if the offender--

705
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,142
- No, she didn't say anything.

706
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,449
But when we get to Med,
we'll do a rape kit.

707
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,018
- Rizzo is still in the wind.

708
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,498
- Yeah, but his truck's
still here.

709
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,891
- You know, maybe
he got spooked when we rolled in

710
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:11,935
and took off on foot.

711
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,154
- All right, so let's fan out.

712
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,982
Talk to witnesses,
look for cameras,

713
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,592
do whatever we gotta do.

714
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:19,117
Just find this prick.

715
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,301
- We're gonna get you
all the help you need.

716
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,304
Nothing to worry about.
- I'm sorry, Dad, I--

717
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,480
I shouldn't have let him
push me in that car.

718
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:35,959
- No, no, no.

719
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,613
Don't blame yourself.

720
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:40,747
It's not your fault.
It's his.

721
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,183
And we're gonna find him.

722
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,838
He's gonna pay for what he did.

723
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,189
Do you know, did--
did he say anything?

724
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,931
Was he gonna meet someone or--
- No.

725
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,455
No, he just wanted drugs.

726
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,022
He's a loser.

727
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,416
He's an addict.

728
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,550
He took my ATM card,

729
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,683
made me tell him the PIN.

730
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,424
He was gonna buy drugs.

731
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,339
Meth, I think.

732
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,949
- Okay.

733
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:12,126
That's good.
That's good.

734
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,261
- ATM.

735
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,483
- Hey, what's up?
- Not here.

736
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,181
- CPD, bro.
Did this man come in here

737
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,573
and get some cash out the ATM?

738
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,793
- Yeah, he was here
like ten minutes ago.

739
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,187
- Okay, did he pull up
in a car or was he on foot?

740
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,536
- Uh, he was walking,

741
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,102
and he looked like
he was in bad shape, too.

742
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,582
- If anybody wanted
to score around here,

743
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,975
where would they go?

744
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,324
- Uh, the old factory.

745
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,283
Lots of drugs, lots of junkies.

746
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,198
Looks like one of those
zombie movies.

747
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,809
- Me and Burgess
found the store

748
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,245
where Rizzo got his cash.

749
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,769
We're going to a drug spot
near the old factory.

750
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,206
Ten minutes away.

751
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,089
- There he is.

752
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,106
- Chicago PD!

753
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:21,543
Stop running!

754
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,956
- Put 'em down!
- Get off me!

755
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,524
Get off me!
- Hey!

756
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,177
Come on now!

757
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:49,136
- Make a move.
Please.

758
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,616
- [laughs]
Come on, you won't do it.

759
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,965
- Then move.
- Come on, I want you to do it!

760
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,619
- Reach for something.
Hey!

761
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:54,707
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

762
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,969
Whoa, hey, hey.

763
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,362
What are you doing?
We got this.

764
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,885
- Just give me five minutes
with him.

765
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,844
- No, Antonio.
- Five minutes.

766
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,152
- Give me your gun.

767
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:07,981
- Quit struggling.

768
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:10,462
- Adam.

769
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,464
- What's up?
You want to talk?

770
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,174
- Hey, hey, hey!

771
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,741
Hey!
Whoa, whoa.

772
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,177
Whoa, whoa, easy.

773
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,483
Come on.
That's enough.

774
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,399
That's enough.
That's enough, it's over!

775
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:37,227
Hey, whoa.
- Get up.

776
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:40,448
- How old is Eva anyway?

777
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:43,190
She 18 yet?

778
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:46,411
She was good.

779
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,548
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

780
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:59,598
Whoa, what the hell
just happened?

781
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,514
- Antonio.

782
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,124
- He got what he deserved.
- Hey, hey--

783
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,952
- He took my daughter.
- Hey, Antonio.

784
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,214
You gotta shut up
and listen to me.

785
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,433
Are you clean right now?

786
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,435
- What?
- Hey, look at me.

787
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:11,392
Be honest.

788
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,046
I don't have time
to play games.

789
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,962
- Antonio!
- Today.

790
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,180
It was a few hours ago.

791
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,661
I needed a little energy
so I...

792
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,228
- Whoa, stop talking.

793
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,583
What the hell are we gonna do?
