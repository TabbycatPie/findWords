1
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,355
Hey.

2
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,365
Hey.

3
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,567
Uh, I got to go. I got to meet Jay.

4
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,004
All right.

5
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,765
How did I not know you went
to the University of Chicago?

6
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,434
My dad wanted me to be a lawyer.

7
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,636
Adam, I got to go.

8
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:50,307
I-I don't have pants.

9
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,912
- Pants.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:08,558
- So...
- Mm-hmm?

11
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,363
How do you want to play this?

12
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,632
Uh, low-key.

13
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,100
Like, um...

14
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,668
Like really low-key,

15
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,470
don't say anything to anyone,

16
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:22,606
this didn't happen low-key.

17
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,009
Okay. Copy that.

18
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,912
I will grab my stuff and leave.

19
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,682
Look, I, uh...

20
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,520
You know, just for the record,
that thing that didn't happen,

21
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,988
that was pretty fun.

22
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,126
Yeah, it was.

23
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:44,974
Yeah, it was.

24
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,432
What's up, Sarge?

25
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,809
What are you guys doing?

26
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,312
That's Al's desk. What are you doing...

27
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,680
what are you doing with Al's desk?

28
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,482
The district is doing a yearly audit.

29
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,351
They're going to reallocate it.

30
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,987
- Here we go.
- Sarge...

31
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:12,823
I...

32
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,036
They left us his hat.

33
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:37,581
Has there been any progress

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,015
on Olinsky's letter of exoneration?

35
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,383
I'm working on it.

36
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,751
If there's no letter,
there is no pension.

37
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,919
They're cut and dried about that...

38
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,187
Trudy, I said I'm working on it.

39
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:45,622
Okay.

40
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:47,190
- Hank.
- Yeah?

41
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:49,526
My CI's story checks out.
There's been incident reports

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,361
at six different restaurants
in Little Village.

43
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,729
They have to be robbers.

44
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,297
Then why aren't the Robbery Dicks on it?

45
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,466
Well, if it's Little Village
that means it's immigrants.

46
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,868
Probably too scared to file a report.

47
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,402
Don't want to get deported.

48
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,737
That's right. No complaint, no crime.

49
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,240
So I say we put boots on ground,
monitor calls over the zone.

50
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:04,541
Maybe we catch 'em in the act.

51
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,043
Maybe we find a needle in a haystack.

52
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,589
We're dealing with
a crew that's preying on

53
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,984
the most vulnerable people in the city.

54
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,816
I know and I feel bad for
'em, but we got a lot going on.

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,117
If they're not gonna work with us...

56
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,349
It's our job to find a way.

57
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,287
Wait... wait, there's a call
going over City-Wide right now.

58
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,822
Possible armed robbery in progress

59
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:20,323
saying shots fired in the Little Village.

60
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,492
Okay, so let's roll on this.

61
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:23,927
As a team.

62
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,779
- What happened?
- Mom and pop joint.

63
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,247
Pop caught a bullet to the throat.

64
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,949
Carlos Coto. He's the owner.

65
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,909
Waitress said two guys showed up,

66
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:50,304
told everybody to hit the floor,
and then they started shooting.

67
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,088
- She make an ID?
- They were wearing masks.

68
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,157
Hey, this witness said
the robbers grabbed a hostage

69
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,292
on the way out... a woman.

70
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,526
He give a description?

71
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,094
Yes, young Caucasian, denim jacket,

72
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,462
definitely not from the neighborhood.

73
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:00,893
Pulled into a blue Honda.

74
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,132
All right, let's hit the streets

75
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,167
look for witnesses.
See if any blue Hondas

76
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,635
show up on surveillance cams.

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,270
Crime techs found a key fob by the door.

78
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:08,772
Hm.

79
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:11,508
Let's go.

80
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,047
People in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

81
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,983
This is the same guy who sued
the Chicago Police Department.

82
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,485
- Evan Gilchrist?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,354
Sergeant Hank Voight, Chicago PD.

84
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:25,789
You mind if we come in?

85
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,476
W-what is this all about?

86
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,793
Well, we found a BMW registered to you

87
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:31,795
in a parking lot in Little Village.

88
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,463
It's at the scene of a crime.

89
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,198
Yeah, that's my daughter's car.

90
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:36,566
Is she here?

91
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,668
Look, what the hell is going on?

92
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,971
We think she may have been abducted.

93
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:43,840
What?

94
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,721
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

95
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,047
So they dragged Valerie into a car

96
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,025
and drove away, and that's all you know?

97
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,311
Well, at the moment, yes,

98
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,986
but we're still gathering information.

99
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,521
Let me ask you, this taco joint
in Little Village, that's in

100
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,589
a pretty rough neighborhood. Any idea why

101
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:00,824
she might be there?

102
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,359
Yeah, she's a foodie. So she travels

103
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,827
all over the city looking for dives

104
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:06,997
with exotic cuisines
and she blogs about it.

105
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,833
I warned her about
some of these neighborhoods.

106
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,334
All right, we're gonna need consent

107
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:13,770
to search all of Valerie's
electronic devices.

108
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:15,005
Yeah, I'll give you her passwords.

109
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,674
I keep tabs on her social media.

110
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,510
Is there any reason that you're
monitoring her so closely?

111
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,412
Yeah, she's my only child,
so I tend to err

112
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,680
on the side of over-protection.

113
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:24,948
Look, I know when someone goes missing

114
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:26,616
there's only a short window now.

115
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:28,311
I have 400 employees. I have access

116
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,067
to all kinds of data. I can help here...

117
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,188
I understand the impulse,
but the best thing you can do

118
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:34,691
right now is just sit back,
let us do our jobs.

119
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,427
Anyone contacts you,
you call us right away.

120
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,529
Sergeant, can I just talk
to you for a second?

121
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,931
Yeah. What's up?

122
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,266
You know I'm the one who financed

123
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,201
the Police Transparency Initiative.

124
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:46,603
What's your point?

125
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,038
Well, I just want
to make sure my politics

126
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,539
don't get in the way
of you doing your job.

127
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,375
Doing everything you can to,
please, find my daughter.

128
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,044
Sarge.

129
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,407
Just leave your phone on, please.

130
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,051
We just got a ping
on Valerie's cell phone.

131
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,395
We found Valerie's phone
in the car, Sarge.

132
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,065
This car was stolen from
Little Village this morning.

133
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,568
Same make and model as the one
seen fleeing the taqueria.

134
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,489
Give me a minute, will you?

135
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,774
First Deputy.

136
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,843
Any update on the Gilchrist girl?

137
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:30,146
Well, we just found her phone,
but she's still in the wind.

138
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,614
Kidnapping?

139
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,816
No demands have been made,

140
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,684
but we do know she witnessed a murder

141
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,086
and the robbery crew grabbed her.

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,546
All this crime, this situation,

143
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,256
is gonna attract a lot of attention.

144
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,791
I know.

145
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,993
Evan Gilchrist has been
a royal pain in our ass.

146
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,595
I wanna get this buttoned up quickly.

147
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,932
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten
your boss is running for mayor.

148
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:51,668
There's a girl missing. Let's find her.

149
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,673
This mean I get more boots on the ground?

150
00:06:58,342 --> 00:06:59,442
Whatever you need.

151
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:05,115
Hey, what happened this morning?

152
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,616
- What do you mean?
- You're, like, never late.

153
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,277
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

154
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,619
- It won't happen again.
- What do we got?

155
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,188
Valerie Gilchrist, 19 years old.

156
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,491
Just graduated from
the Culinary Institute.

157
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,125
No priors, no red flags.

158
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,660
Her sister died when they were kids,

159
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,496
but other than that,
she's led a privileged life.

160
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,830
Do we buy her dad's story

161
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:23,199
that she was there in Little
Village to blog about tacos?

162
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,368
Her social media's mostly about food.

163
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,303
Best salsas, hole in the wall.

164
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:28,872
According to "The Reader,"

165
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,241
Coto's has the number three
ranked taco in Chicago, so...

166
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,565
Wrong place, wrong time.

167
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,344
Check this out. We looked at the pattern

168
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,812
of the previous robberies.

169
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,779
The crew knew when these places
would be fat

170
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:39,349
and how to slip away
without being detected.

171
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:41,772
They case these joints,
probably ate there.

172
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,019
Makes sense they're
from the neighborhood.

173
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,187
If they're worried about
her being a witness

174
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,698
why not just silence her there?

175
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,091
She's a white girl. Maybe they
thought she was worth something.

176
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,592
Or they grabbed her for other reasons.

177
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,094
When we find this crew, we find her,

178
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,229
so search databases for anyone convicted

179
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,898
of robberies living around
Little Village.

180
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,900
Now let's get some extra
patrol units in here,

181
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,335
and pull in every banger
with an open warrant.

182
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,206
Hank, these are going up
all over Little Village.

183
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,411
Hey.

184
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,316
Sergeant, any news?

185
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,656
I asked you to sit back,
let us do our job.

186
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,716
I'm not gonna sit on my hands
while my daughter's missing.

187
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,753
You put 500 grand on the street.

188
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,755
Now everyone's gonna try and grab it.

189
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,754
Unless that reward is coordinated with us

190
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,426
it's gonna pull this investigation
two separate directions.

191
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,795
I don't want the reward tied
to Chicago Police Department.

192
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,463
Okay, there are a lot of
undocumented immigrants

193
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,365
in Little Village and they're
scared of being deported.

194
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,568
Look, sir, I understand
you want to find your daughter,

195
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,775
so do I. But it's my job

196
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,038
and you're getting in the way
of me doing it.

197
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,107
Look... Hello?

198
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,411
Yeah. Right, give it to me.

199
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,713
I'm sorry, but that's
probably a different woman.

200
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:44,881
Thanks for your help.

201
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,115
No, I don't think you need to be

202
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,884
a legal resident to collect the reward.

203
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,319
Do you remember seeing her,
or are you chasing the money?

204
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:51,788
But do you have any more information?

205
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,156
What, are we a bunch of telemarketers?

206
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,490
Hank, the phones just started blowing up.

207
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,845
People are calling us directly. - 500
grand's got a way of making people

208
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,145
remember things they've never seen.

209
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,596
Hang up the phones.

210
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,897
How 'bout we focus on police work?

211
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,766
I got something. I checked the
traffic cams by Coto's Taco

212
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,134
and I got a hit on that blue Honda.

213
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,063
Nice work. Hayley, you and Jay

214
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,772
head over to Streets and San.
Get this guy's name

215
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,774
and go talk to him.

216
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,813
This girl was in the blue Honda
parked next to your truck,

217
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,014
and you're sure you didn't see her?

218
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:21,017
Like I told you, I can't help you.

219
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,952
That's the girl on the posters.

220
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,288
- Did you see her?
- Mama, leave us alone.

221
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:29,759
Hugo, there's a $500,000 reward.

222
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,361
Did you see her?

223
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,129
Answer your mama, Hugo.

224
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,142
Okay.

225
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:39,836
Yeah, I saw her. Earlier today.

226
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,605
She was out on the street, running.
Some guy was chasing her.

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,274
Can you describe the man?

228
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:47,477
Latino, 30, little chubby.

229
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,322
Never seen him before.

230
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:52,158
And which direction were they going?

231
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,384
That way, toward a warehouse.

232
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:55,818
You saw a man chasing a woman

233
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:57,353
and you didn't call the police?

234
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,222
I get paid to pick up garbage.

235
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:02,458
I don't get nothing extra
for solving crimes.

236
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,173
Over here.

237
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,645
There's blood. Looks recent.

238
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,887
Body.

239
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,863
Victim, gunshot wound.

240
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,432
Roll an ambo.

241
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,734
50, 21, George, emergency.
Roll an ambo to our location.

242
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,170
We got a female victim, gunshot wound.

243
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,638
<i>Copy that.</i>

244
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,312
Okay, just... you know, take your time,

245
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:56,347
and then tell us what happened
<i>Shaw Direc</i> at the restaurant.

246
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,451
Um...

247
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,330
went there to, uh, get a taco.

248
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,198
I was...

249
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,967
walking in.

250
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:10,304
I didn't... realize what was happening.

251
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,172
Um...

252
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,805
I saw two men.

253
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,474
- They had masks.
- Okay.

254
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:18,510
One of them had a gun and, um...

255
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,979
the other guy came out from the back

256
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,210
and he started screaming
in Spanish and, uh...

257
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,753
Uh, the larger one shot him.

258
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,920
You didn't run?

259
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,302
I was... I was freaking out.

260
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,928
The one with the gun

261
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,563
grabbed me.

262
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,700
Shoved me in the back seat of his car.

263
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,136
Forced me to keep my face down.

264
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,938
One man said that they had to...

265
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,691
kill me.

266
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,977
Um...

267
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,045
He pulled over. He had to pee, and...

268
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,617
I just... I took off running and I...

269
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,162
remember going into this building and...

270
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,556
Um...

271
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,412
Do you remember anything else about them?

272
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,161
Any tattoos, any scars?

273
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,996
No, I'm sorry.

274
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,898
Don't be sorry.

275
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,800
Okay, thank you.

276
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,404
I'm gonna grab Halstead and dig
back to the other robberies,

277
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,872
the ones that didn't get reported.

278
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,376
Makes sense. Someone somewhere
had to have seen something.

279
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,312
Two weeks ago someone
from this restaurant called 911

280
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,314
and said that was a robbery in progress.

281
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,484
I already told the police when
they came, there wasn't a robbery.

282
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,486
Why would someone make that up?

283
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,754
Don't know.

284
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,389
I... was arguing with a customer.

285
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,091
Maybe the person who called got confused.

286
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,260
Thought I was being robbed.

287
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,307
Look, Miguel we know
that there's a stickup crew

288
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:45,628
going around targeting

289
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:47,199
Hispanic restaurants in the neighborhood.

290
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,500
You have nothing to be scared of.

291
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,168
This has nothing to do with ICE.

292
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,471
I'm not scared of you.
I've got my green card.

293
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,358
Why don't you, uh...
why don't you tell me more

294
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:56,675
about this misunderstanding.

295
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,814
You were here
for the robbery, weren't you?

296
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,018
Miguel's a victim.

297
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,553
We want to help.

298
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,122
You're his wife?

299
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,891
Engaged.

300
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,093
Okay.

301
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,528
Can you tell me what happened?

302
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,396
They're taking everything away from him.

303
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,199
Who? The people that did the robbery?

304
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,301
No, the guys who came after.

305
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,604
They asked for protection money.

306
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,205
I told Miguel to go to the police,

307
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,207
but he didn't listen.

308
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,978
Because you don't have papers.

309
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,924
If keeps paying those <i>ladrones</i>

310
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,615
he's gonna lose his business, his dreams.

311
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,383
That's not right.

312
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,052
Can you help us?

313
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,221
Yes, I can.

314
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,991
Okay.

315
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,599
Shh. Get up.

316
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,967
Yeah, straight up.

317
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,403
Johnny Marquez.

318
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,339
What is this?

319
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,842
I'll you what this is.

320
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,974
This is you on surveillance cam.

321
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,613
Looks like you're running
a protection racket, Johnny.

322
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,683
It's a rough neighborhood, Voight.
We provide a service.

323
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,085
Oh yeah? Well, it proves
you're the shot caller.

324
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,588
And that means you ordered
those robberies.

325
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,524
I need the names of that crew, bro.

326
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,847
Ain't got nothing to do with robberies.

327
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:24,321
Yeah? Well, we just locked up 32 bangers

328
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,264
from this neighborhood
and let me tell you something,

329
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,987
they're singing.

330
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:31,074
They're lying to save their
own asses and you know it.

331
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,338
Well...

332
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,307
I'm about to tell you what I know.

333
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,567
You're Aunt Gloria Valdez, she's keeping

334
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,378
15 guns over at her place
on Maple Street,

335
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,161
and you're ex-baby mama,

336
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,849
she's got a few kilos over at her house.

337
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,618
But me...

338
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,120
I got a team of guys and they're waiting

339
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,122
to take 'em down right now.

340
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,158
So give me the names of that crew.

341
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,659
Okay.

342
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,362
I know something about the stickup
guys, but I ain't part of it.

343
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,798
I just get a little taste. That's it.

344
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,302
I need names, Johnny.

345
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,641
Pablo Sosa. According to Marquez
he's the leader of the stickup crew.

346
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,142
He's got a rap sheet to the floor.

347
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,577
He just did four years of Stateville

348
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,811
for accessory to murder.
No current address.

349
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,072
Yeah, and Marquez says
that he thinks Sosa's

350
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:19,316
working with a young banger
named Jorge Luna.

351
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,052
Pablo's the fat guy,
so that's our shooter.

352
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,587
All right, we got any leads?

353
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,489
Yeah, Jorge Luna
has one prior for possession,

354
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,986
sentenced last month;
200 days of community service.

355
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,307
Right, and didn't his parole officer say

356
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,495
that's he's working off that
case at Clean Up Chicago?

357
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,763
Well, find out where they're cleaning

358
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,765
and pick him up now.

359
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,204
Strike two!

360
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,936
- Hey, Coach.
- Yeah?

361
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:42,494
You need you to move the kids
out of the way.

362
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,729
Get 'em off the field. Do it now.

363
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,331
- Stay calm.
- Time!

364
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,901
All right, everybody,
bring it in. Come on.

365
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,602
There's lots of families
and children out here,

366
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,671
so we do not engage
under any circumstances.

367
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,939
No weapons.

368
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:55,507
We box this guy in on my orders.

369
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,608
Are we clear?

370
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,082
We got eyes on the target.

371
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:11,457
Guys, he made us.

372
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,929
- Don't engage.
- He's gonna jack that van.

373
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:19,198
Stand down! <i>Stand down!</i>

374
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,140
Stay down.

375
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,940
Hey, Adam.

376
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,754
- What was that?
- We caught the guy.

377
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,722
I told you to stand down.

378
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,391
There were civilians.
He could have had a gun.

379
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,459
Yeah, I thought he was gonna
jack that van, so...

380
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:50,295
- I mean, we caught the guy...
- That's not the point.

381
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,997
Are we seriously...
we're gonna do this again?

382
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,400
And again and again...
I gave you an order.

383
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,816
Thank you.

384
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,106
Detective, you're working on
Youthe Gilchrist case, yes?

385
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,832
Yes, Officer Kim Burgess.

386
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,233
Um, we have a person of interest.

387
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:19,835
I showed Valerie some photos.

388
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,775
Unfortunately, she wasn't able
to make a positive ID, so...

389
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,407
Mr. Gilchrist.

390
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,910
Kate Brennan, Deputy Superintendent.

391
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,211
I hear your daughter's going home today.

392
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,046
- That's great news.
- Thank you.

393
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,182
I just got off the phone
with Superintendant Kelton.

394
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,516
He wants you to know
that he's doing everything

395
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,051
he can to make sure that the men

396
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:37,920
that hurt your daughter are apprehended.

397
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:39,254
Well, I-I appreciate that.

398
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,690
Well, we may not be perfect,

399
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,585
but we deliver.

400
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:45,561
If you need something, give me a call.

401
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,262
If you're looking
for an attagirl, Ms. Brennan,

402
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:48,897
you're gonna be disappointed.
My daughter's safe

403
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,232
because I put out a reward.

404
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,600
That's why the witness came forward.

405
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,348
- That's why you found her.
- That's not true.

406
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,372
We found your daughter bleeding to death

407
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,140
in a warehouse through our police work.

408
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,242
Garbage man talked because of the money.

409
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:01,939
I mean... if you think I'm gonna
shill for your boss

410
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:05,047
or for Chicago PD,
it's never gonna happen.

411
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:12,087
I told you already.
I was at Pablo's yesterday.

412
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,655
We didn't have nothing
to do with those stickups.

413
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,924
Then why'd Johnny Marquez hang it on you?

414
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,427
'Cause Marquez, he's an old head,

415
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,095
he thinks he owns the neighborhood,

416
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,630
but he don't own me.

417
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:24,299
I don't follow his orders
and he don't like that.

418
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,001
Why'd you run at the park?

419
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,603
Simple.

420
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:28,771
You were chasing me, right?

421
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,840
Jorge, stop.

422
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,143
We know Pablo organized the stickups,

423
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:35,677
and a witness said Pablo's the one

424
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,446
who shot the manager,
so if you confirm that,

425
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,015
you give us Pablo, we'll help you out.

426
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,317
I mean, you'll do some time,
but you're young.

427
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,952
I mean, you still have a good life.

428
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,788
Nah.

429
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,623
I'm not talking. Hm.

430
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,696
Well, you may want
to reconsider 'cause...

431
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,823
the girl...

432
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,265
the one you thought you killed

433
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,954
can put you at the crime scene.

434
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,336
So even if you didn't pull the trigger,

435
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,305
we can still hang the murder on you.

436
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,586
- You screwed up, bro.
- No.

437
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,977
I had nothing to do with that.

438
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,508
Nothing.

439
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,386
I would never hurt a woman.

440
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:16,852
I'm not saying another word
till I get a lawyer.

441
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,331
Okay, so Jorge said
he was chilling with Pablo

442
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:30,732
at the time of the murder, but that can't

443
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,410
be confirmed 'cause Pablo's in the wind.

444
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,502
Phone records?

445
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,070
Neither one has a registered phone.

446
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,371
I'm assuming they have burner phones.

447
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,006
Jorge had one when we busted him.

448
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,241
This kid's lying.

449
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,843
We just gotta push a little harder.

450
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:42,511
Yeah, but we have no prints,
no surveillance,

451
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,146
nothing to put Jorge at the scene.

452
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,848
All we got is the word of Johnny Marquez,

453
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:48,350
which, at this point,
ain't worth too much.

454
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,685
Jay,

455
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:52,054
you find that sanitation worker, Sanchez?

456
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:54,022
Yeah, I did, but he won't be much help.

457
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,524
Patrol found his body.

458
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,160
<i>- Any witnesses?
- No, but we'll keep looking.</i>

459
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:02,364
Well...

460
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,633
Hugo Sanchez just got popped.

461
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,402
Looks like Pablo's silencing
all witnesses.

462
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:09,438
Tough way to earn 500k.

463
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,106
All right, let's get Valerie in here.

464
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,408
- What for?
- Make an ID.

465
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:15,344
I already showed her a photo
right at the hospital.

466
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:16,912
Well, this time we'll show her a line-up.

467
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,848
Maybe if she's Jorge in person,
something'll click.

468
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,884
Got it.

469
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:28,123
I already told you, they had masks on.

470
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:34,263
No, we know, but maybe there's
some other physical characteristic

471
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:37,232
like... like their arms or their
neck... maybe their hands.

472
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,972
I already said I-I don't remember.

473
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:43,405
Valerie, they can't see you,
so don't worry.

474
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,307
Okay, you're protected.

475
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:46,708
I don't know. Sorry.

476
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,710
Look, why do you keep hammering her?

477
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,280
We're trying to ID a killer.
Get him off the street.

478
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,048
Yeah, I understand,
but she didn't see the guy.

479
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,716
Can I go, please?

480
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:59,721
Come on, hon. You're okay.

481
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,924
I mean, there's no good
reason to drag her down here.

482
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,091
She already looked at the photos.

483
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,459
Look, man, we are just trying

484
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,461
to nail the guy who hurt your daughter.

485
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,834
Yeah, well,
it sure doesn't feel that way.

486
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,266
Explain to me what that means.

487
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,068
- Reporters out there.
- Oh.

488
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:14,236
Your boss is trying to use my daughter

489
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,404
for political profit.

490
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:17,092
You know what? That might be.

491
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,341
Then again...

492
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,742
those reporters might be there

493
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:24,279
to talk to you about
that $500,000 reward.

494
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,115
The one that got
the sanitation worker killed.

495
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,274
What? Hugo... Sanchez?

496
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:34,256
No.

497
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:36,992
You posted that picture on Twitter.

498
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:41,697
Come on, there's a back exit.

499
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,332
There's no press.

500
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,168
Kim, take 'em out the back, will you?

501
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,441
Hey, Sarge, we pulled footage
from the Sanchez homicide.

502
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,169
We got a positive ID from facial rec.

503
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:55,656
Pablo Sosa is definitely our shooter.

504
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,944
- Okay.
- Problem is,

505
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,280
we still don't have an address
on this guy.

506
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:00,315
He's a ghost.
We have Tact and Gang officers

507
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,618
hunting him down and so far nothing.

508
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,187
Then we try a different angle.

509
00:22:13,196 --> 00:22:15,197
It's your lucky day, Jorge.

510
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,333
You're good to go.

511
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,868
You mean I don't need no bail?

512
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,503
Nope.

513
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,200
Here's the thing, though,

514
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,575
as soon as you leave,
you're a marked man.

515
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:29,344
- Pablo's gonna think you're a snitch.
- I ain't no snitch.

516
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,812
Well...

517
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,714
that's not what Pablo's gonna think

518
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,921
'cause we're putting word out
on the street that we own you.

519
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:37,753
You're a cooperating witness.

520
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,126
Nah, Pablo knows I ain't no snitch.

521
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,924
Yeah, well, then you got
nothing to worry about.

522
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,726
Get out of here.

523
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,702
I bet the first person
he talks to is Pablo.

524
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:57,005
- Well, that's the plan.
- I got you.

525
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,543
All right, Jorge just turned
on Race Street.

526
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:17,292
We relocated. We got him.

527
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,396
All right, he just went into an apartment

528
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,573
at 1200 Race Street.

529
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:33,241
<i>We're running everyone in the building,</i>

530
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,976
<i>So far, no nexus for either target.</i>

531
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,411
Copy that.

532
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:42,236
Yo, bro, I been wanting to rap with you

533
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,618
about this Antonio thing, though.

534
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,784
It's time to move on.

535
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,558
I know. I get it. I'm trying,

536
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:51,326
but... I don't know, man.
It's pretty tough.

537
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,061
He's always judging and critiquing.

538
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,963
He plays by the book.

539
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:58,545
True, but that doesn't make him
a bad person or a bad cop.

540
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:00,769
In my humble opinion,

541
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:02,137
he's a baller.

542
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:03,972
He's always the first one
through that door.

543
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:13,915
50, 21, Henry, shots fired,
emergency 1200 Race Street.

544
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,627
It's Pablo.

545
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,165
- Out the back.
- We can't leave him.

546
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,797
You go. Go!

547
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,334
Police! Freeze!

548
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:39,875
Offender out the back!

549
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:44,216
Jorge, stop! I will shoot!

550
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,481
Westbound in the alley.

551
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,188
Hey!

552
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:57,159
50, 21, Idaho, carjacking,
on-site, gray pickup truck.

553
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,226
Stop the truck!

554
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:03,999
Plates are 8, 4, 9... that's all I got.

555
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,168
Plate's 8-4-9, gray pickup truck.

556
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,303
Be advised, offender is armed.

557
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:15,043
We lost Jorge.

558
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:17,813
He jacked a gray pickup truck,
so I put out a flash message.

559
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:19,815
Pablo didn't make it.
I found this next to the body.

560
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,917
It's a .380, same caliber
as the other murder.

561
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:23,518
Yo, I just got a hit on that gray pickup.

562
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,020
It's in a restaurant in the West Loop.

563
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:26,354
- Let's go!
- We'll meet you there.

564
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:30,659
Went to the restaurant. Jorge's gone.

565
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,594
- He's in the wind.
- Check this out.

566
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:34,529
Valerie works at the restaurant
part-time.

567
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:36,064
The manager said
that he was looking for her.

568
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:37,365
He's looking for Valerie?

569
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,967
Yeah, we got a beat car sitting on it

570
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,001
just in case she comes back.

571
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:41,536
How does he even know where she works?

572
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,438
Hey, guys, they're dating.

573
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,006
What?

574
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,208
They're dating?

575
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:48,443
Yeah, they're dating.

576
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:50,688
I found a private DM app

577
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:53,114
that she downloaded
so messages stay off the radar.

578
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,884
According to this, they've been
hooking up for about a month.

579
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:00,589
Find Valerie now.

580
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,241
Maybe we should wait till my...

581
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,509
my dad's lawyers get here.

582
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:13,544
Maybe you should tell us
what the hell's going on

583
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:15,579
since you've been screwing us
around this whole time.

584
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:16,864
I'm sorry, but my father told me

585
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,891
to always ask for a lawyer.

586
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:20,726
All right, look, Valerie,
the choice is yours.

587
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,628
We can do that,
but then the gloves come off.

588
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:24,129
We put you in handcuffs, charge you

589
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:25,831
with felony obstruction
and take you to jail.

590
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,167
And there's nothing that
your father can do about it.

591
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:29,501
But...

592
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,971
we'd rather not do that.

593
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:36,575
We know things aren't always
what they seem, so...

594
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,811
just help us out.

595
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:41,379
We had this...

596
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:43,806
really amazing connection.

597
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:46,518
It was, like, intense,
like there was no way

598
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:48,387
to stop us from happening even though

599
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,255
I knew he was a little crazy.

600
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,124
Do you know what I mean?

601
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:54,639
Yeah.

602
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:56,632
You fell for the bad boy.

603
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,851
<i>Felt good. Felt right.</i>

604
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,167
<i>And you said to hell
with the consequences.</i>

605
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,759
<i>Did you know he was a criminal?</i>

606
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:04,870
<i>No.</i>

607
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:08,540
I knew he lived in a tough part of town,

608
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:10,643
that he'd been in trouble.

609
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:13,115
Why don't you tell us about the robbery.

610
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:17,349
I was...

611
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,718
out with Jorge.

612
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,755
He got a-a phone call.

613
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:25,124
<i>He said he had to go back
to Little Village</i>

614
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,759
<i>so...</i>

615
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:29,028
<i>I drove him to the restaurant and...</i>

616
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:31,864
<i>and he met up with this... this guy.</i>

617
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:33,632
Uh...

618
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,901
Yeah, that's him. I, um...

619
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:37,570
I think his name is Pablo.

620
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,266
So I...

621
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:42,269
I dropped off Jorge...

622
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:45,897
You know, he told me to go back home,

623
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:48,650
but I stuck around 'cause

624
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,695
I wanted to spend the night with him.

625
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,352
And then I heard

626
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,321
all of this yelling and I went

627
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:57,589
to see what was happening

628
00:27:57,624 --> 00:28:00,525
and that's when, uh, Pablo shot...

629
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,161
the guy.

630
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,059
Yeah, that's him.

631
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,381
Everyone was...

632
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,538
was freaking out.

633
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:16,470
Pablo was yelling and screaming, and...

634
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:18,917
he pulled me into the car.

635
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,432
He...

636
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,810
He dropped Jorge off. He said he would...

637
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,855
He would take me back
to the house, but...

638
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:29,797
uh, but he was lying. He tried to kill me

639
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,257
and that is why I ran.

640
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,026
Where's Jorge now?

641
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,794
I don't...

642
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,194
I don't know,
but he is not what you think.

643
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:41,200
He's always been very respectful,

644
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:43,535
and Pablo, that is the killer.

645
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,374
Valerie, you need to tell us where he is.

646
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:54,813
This thing with you and Jorge,

647
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:56,468
it's not gonna last.

648
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,717
It never does with the bad boys.

649
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,987
<i>The sooner you realize that, the better.</i>

650
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,969
What's your take?

651
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:15,968
She's a stupid kid who fell in love

652
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:18,156
with a handsome punk
and stumbled onto a robbery.

653
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,658
I think she's hiding something.

654
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:22,753
All right, so dig back into
her phone records,

655
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:25,980
social media accounts,
anonymous and otherwise.

656
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,833
See if she tried to make contact.

657
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,544
- Hank, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

658
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,450
I had one of the FOP lawyers

659
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:34,943
draw up a full letter of
exoneration for Olinsky.

660
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:37,703
All it needs is one signature.
It's on your desk.

661
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,470
Trudy, I said I'm working on it.

662
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,496
I know that, but the signature it needs

663
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,588
is sitting in your office.

664
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:50,511
First Deputy.

665
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,739
I just want to make sure
that my intel is correct.

666
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:56,041
Gilchrist's daughter
is dating one of the offenders.

667
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:59,011
Well, dating might not
be the word for it, but...

668
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,952
Yeah, they had a relationship.

669
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:03,978
She lied to us.
It's called felony obstruction.

670
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,071
- What are you waiting for?
- We need her.

671
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,287
She's our best shot at
catching the offender, Jorge.

672
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,621
He's still out there.

673
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:10,923
We have two dead innocents.

674
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:12,210
She's in the middle of it.

675
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,760
- Get her booked.
- Huh.

676
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:15,839
I get it.

677
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:19,298
If we put Gilchrist's daughter in jail,

678
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:22,601
his criticism of CPD becomes meaningless.

679
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:25,763
He's just another bitter father
with an axe to grind, right?

680
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:26,964
I don't like coddling the rich.

681
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:28,465
- Huh.
- Makes us look bad.

682
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,800
You know what else makes you look bad?

683
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,703
- Hm?
- If Jorge kills more people

684
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:34,738
and the press founds out

685
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,207
that you had a chance to use Valerie

686
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:39,276
to get him off the streets,

687
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,221
but you decided to play politics instead.

688
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:45,076
What are you saying, Sergeant?

689
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:47,484
You know what I'm saying.

690
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,167
I got something, Sarge.

691
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,932
That was four hours ago.

692
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:09,506
Get Evan Gilchrist down here.

693
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:14,778
You grab my daughter? You drag her
down here and you don't even call.

694
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:16,513
- Hey.
- No heads up

695
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:18,348
I'm trying to help you, okay?

696
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,903
Listen to me.

697
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:23,520
Your daughter is shacking up
with the killer.

698
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:25,155
- Killer?
- Yeah.

699
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,958
And it looks like she's trying
to help him get away.

700
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:29,426
What are you talking about?

701
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:32,262
I'm telling you this wasn't a kidnapping.

702
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:34,182
It was a date gone bad.

703
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:35,928
Look, I don't know what kind of game

704
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,668
- you guys aren...
- I am not playing a game.

705
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,603
I'm telling you she is head-over-heels

706
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,383
in love with this guy.

707
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:45,595
Look, she withdrew five grand
in cash this morning.

708
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:48,614
Wha... so? It's not a crime
to withdraw money.

709
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:51,115
Yeah, well, it is
if you give it to a fugitive.

710
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:52,394
A killer.

711
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:57,221
If it turns that she's helping
this guy Jorge,

712
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:58,856
I am telling you...

713
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,224
there is no way to walk that back.

714
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:02,126
She'll do time. You understand?

715
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,894
I mean...

716
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,229
real time.

717
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:06,730
Me?

718
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:08,465
All I care about is catching the killer.

719
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,786
That's it.

720
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:12,747
If your daughter can help us,

721
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,540
I'll make sure she doesn't get jammed up.

722
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,841
You have my word.

723
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,820
Jorge, where are you?

724
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:31,955
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

725
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,558
I'm at the place we were at last week.

726
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,229
I have the money.

727
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:39,232
<i>Look, there's something
I need to tell you.</i>

728
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:42,166
Just keep her talking till we locate him.

729
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,948
What is it?

730
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,577
<i>I had no idea Pablo was gonna do that.</i>

731
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,997
<i>He told me he was gonna take you home.</i>

732
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:59,002
<i>But then the police...
they showed me that picture.</i>

733
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,172
<i>I saw what he did to you.</i>

734
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,883
<i>That's why I killed him...</i>

735
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,025
<i>Because I love you.</i>

736
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,693
Bingo.

737
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:14,097
<i>I would never let anybody hurt you.</i>

738
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:15,766
<i>Ever.</i>

739
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,979
<i>I love you so much.</i>

740
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:20,604
Jorge, I'm so sorry.

741
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:23,026
<i>No, no, I'm the one who's sorry.</i>

742
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:25,843
It's a trap! You have to drive!

743
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,344
Right now! You have to go!
You have to go!

744
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:29,346
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

745
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,368
Go. Go. Okay... go...

746
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,660
Go! Come on. Come on.
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go!

747
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:45,028
Run, kids! Run!

748
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:46,563
Come on. Move. Move. Move!

749
00:33:46,598 --> 00:33:48,298
Move. Move. Move. Move. Come to me!

750
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,500
Faster, kids. Come on!
Come on. Come on. Come on!

751
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,139
There's kids inside.

752
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:03,556
<i>Kids.</i>

753
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,458
He went that way. He went in there.

754
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:07,063
- You get the ones in front.
- Okay.

755
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:08,461
I'll go in front. Go in there.

756
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:09,796
Go. Go outside!

757
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,131
Kids, I want you to get behind me now!

758
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,465
Get behind me now!

759
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,034
Get behind me, kid! Get behind me!

760
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:15,568
Now hold hands, hold my hand.

761
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:16,970
I want you to walk quickly
and walk me to that door.

762
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:18,471
- Y'all got it?
- Walk me to that door.

763
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:20,106
Yeah. Get him out.

764
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,946
No. No. I'll go.
Stand down, that's an order.

765
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:39,125
- Go, you go.
- Come on.

766
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,608
Shh.

767
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,951
Come on. Come to me.

768
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:07,020
Shh. Come to me.

769
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:09,155
Stay down.

770
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,758
Come on. Come on.

771
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:13,993
Come on.

772
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:16,463
Come on.

773
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:19,532
Hey. Hey.

774
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,372
Go. Go.

775
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:41,488
Let's see. You're gonna have to hold.

776
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:44,064
How's your shoulder?

777
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:46,620
Ah, it's okay. I just hit it wrong.

778
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,395
Shouldn't have hit it in the first place.

779
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:49,796
That's what the young guys are for.

780
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,964
Yeah.

781
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:52,465
All right, I called ahead to Med.

782
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,670
They're expecting you.

783
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,363
Appreciate it.

784
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:02,810
Hi.

785
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,011
- Val.
- Hey.

786
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:06,913
- Dad. You have to help me.
- Wait...

787
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,748
What the hell's going on?
Why is she in handcuffs?

788
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,250
You can't talk to her right now.

789
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,152
- Please, I'm sorry.
- She's under arrest.

790
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:14,487
- Are you kidding me?
- Felony obstruction.

791
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,156
We had a signed cooperation agreement!

792
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,648
Well, she didn't cooperate.

793
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:19,035
Deal's off.

794
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:22,495
- I'm very sorry.
- You're sorry?

795
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:37,410
Thank you.

796
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,578
- Hey, Hank.
- Hi.

797
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:40,447
I'll meet you inside.

798
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:43,059
- Ma'am.
- Thank you for coming.

799
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:45,518
I hear you arrested the Gilchrist girl.

800
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,086
Felony obstruction.

801
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,621
Talked to the ASA, she's gonna write

802
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,790
the full ticket. She'll do time.

803
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,126
All right, do you really
think that's necessary?

804
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,864
I thought you'd be happy.

805
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:58,798
At the end of the day,
she doesn't really pose

806
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,535
a threat to the city, does she?

807
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,269
Huh.

808
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,475
So she walks?

809
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,841
She walks 'cause her daddy's rich,

810
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,114
and he's gonna play ball.

811
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,085
Because she's a kid.
She deserves a second chance.

812
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,724
I need something too.

813
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,721
It's good to hear.

814
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:32,232
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

815
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,503
Antonio got released from the hospital.

816
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,238
Oh, that's good.

817
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,200
Hey, I want to revisit that
thing you said about bad boys.

818
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,370
Mm-mm.

819
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,129
Something about they're, uh, fun,

820
00:37:48,154 --> 00:37:49,653
but they never last. Something like that.

821
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,518
First of all, you're not a bad boy.

822
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:54,120
- Well...
- Second of all, I was questioning a suspect.

823
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:57,090
All right, I was just asking.

824
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,197
Damn it.

825
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:04,889
You're up.

826
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:09,228
But since we're talking about
the thing that never happened...

827
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:13,066
- Yeah?
- Um...

828
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:15,902
What's the deal with you and Burgess?

829
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,145
Well...

830
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,147
I don't know. Kim's an amazing woman.

831
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,241
I love her.

832
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:24,984
We had a lot of bumps in the road,
and, at the end of the day,

833
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,371
she didn't want to be with me,
so we're friends.

834
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,968
Simple as that.

835
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,158
Yo, you know,
if you want to tie this off,

836
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,604
I get it. I'll respect that.

837
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,763
But I personally think
we should keep it going.

838
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,132
Have some fun. See what happens.

839
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,533
No pressure.

840
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,803
You know?

841
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:44,971
But I will do whatever you want to do.

842
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:47,298
Okay? It's up to you.

843
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,272
<i>We expect our police
officers to be perfect,</i>

844
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,541
but they're just human.

845
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,379
They deserve our respect and support
and, in my case, gratitude.

846
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,948
<i>Thanks to the CPD,
I got my daughter back.</i>

847
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:30,617
<i>Does this mean that you're
gonna bury the hatchet</i>

848
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,218
<i>with Brian Kelton?</i>

849
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:34,087
<i>Well, I'm gonna do a lot more than that.</i>

850
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,689
<i>I've actually decided
to support him for mayor.</i>

851
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,637
Hey.

852
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,405
You wanted to see me?

853
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,873
Yeah.

854
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,152
"The Internal Affairs investigation

855
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,488
"into criminal allegations against

856
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,558
"Detective Alvin Olinsky...

857
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,726

862
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:28,169
I'm impressed.

863
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:32,278
Don't be.

864
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:36,683
Does this have anything to do

865
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,336
with the Gilchrist kid walking?

866
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,416
Sometimes things just work out.

867
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,413
Uh-huh.

868
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,225
To Al.

869
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,057
To Al.
