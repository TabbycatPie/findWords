32
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,500
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty.

33
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,840
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

34
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't mind the dirt.

35
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,390
I do mind...

36
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,020
unannounced visits.

37
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,410
You police?

38
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,120
Are you Sapper Morton? Civic number NK68514?

39
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,410
- I'm a farmer. - I saw that.

40
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,420
What do you farm?

41
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,550
It's a protein farm.

42
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,930
Wallace design.

43
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,890
Is that what I smell?

44
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,190
Grow that just for me.

45
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,840
Garlic.

46
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,360
Garlic.

47
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,940
Go on, try some.

48
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,490
No, thank you.

49
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,820
I prefer to keep an empty stomach

50
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,270
until the hard part of the day is done.

51
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,740
How long you been here?

52
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,040
Since 2020.

53
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,530
But you haven't always been a farmer, have you?

54
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,550
Your bag.

55
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,830
It's colonial medical use.

56
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,260
Military issue.

57
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,880
Where were you? Calantha?

58
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,650
Must have been brutal.

59
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,110
Plan on taking me in?

60
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,240
Let them take a look inside?

61
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Mr. Morton...

62
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,030
if taking you in is an option...

63
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,200
I would much prefer that to the alternative.

64
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm sure you knew it would be someone in time.

65
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm sorry it had to be me.

66
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,750
Good as any.

67
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Now, if you don't mind...

68
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,150
if you could just look up and to the left, please.

69
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,790
Please don't get up.

70
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,210
How's it feel killing your own kind?

71
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,470
I don't retire my own kind because we don't run.

72
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,520
Only older models do.

73
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,490
And you new models are happy scraping the shit...

74
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,150
because you've never seen a miracle.

75
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,500
Just photograph everything.

76
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,620
Madam, please.

77
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,350
Incoming L.A.P.D. Re-codec hash.

79
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,970
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

80
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,760
- I'll glue it. - And?

81
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,490
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

82
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,280
He looks like he could take your head off.

83
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,650
He tried.

84
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,580
He went AWOL after Calantha...

85
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,040
with a few more in his outfit I wouldn't mind closing out.

86
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,080
- Just him? - Just him.

87
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,410
Come on home for your baseline.

88
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,380
One moment, madam.

89
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,390
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

91
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,480
What is that?

92
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,790
I'll send a dig team.

93
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,780
Come on home before the storm.

95
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,650
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

96
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,000
- Let's begin. Ready? - Yes, sir.

97
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,380
Recite your baseline.

98
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,040
And blood-black nothingness began to spin.

99
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,090
A system of cells interlinked within cells...

100
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,310
interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem.

101
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,600
Fuck off, skin-job.

102
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,450
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,

103
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,150
a tall white fountain played.

104
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,140
- Cells. - Cells.

105
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,270
- Have you ever been in an institution? Cells. - Cells.

107
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,690
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells. - Cells.

108
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,480
When you're not performing your duties,

109
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,740
- do they keep you in a little box? - Cells.

110
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,920
- Interlinked. - Interlinked.

111
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,450
What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Interlinked.

112
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,250
Interlinked.

113
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,850
Did they teach you how to feel finger to finger? Interlinked.

114
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,250
Interlinked.

115
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,670
Do you long for having your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

116
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,470
Interlinked.

117
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,910
- Do you dream about being interlinked? - Interlinked.

118
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,650
What's it like to hold your child in your arms? Interlinked.

119
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,030
Interlinked.

120
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,910
Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing?

121
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,180
- Interlinked. - Interlinked.

122
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,760
- Within cells interlinked. - Within cells interlinked.

123
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,140
Why don't you say that three times?

124
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,190
Within cells interlinked. Within cells interlinked.

125
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,020
Within cells interlinked.

126
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,850
We're done.

127
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,230
Constant K.

128
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,610
You can pick up your bonus.

129
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,900
Thank you, sir.

130
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,950
Caution, keep clear.

131
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,790
Caution, keep clear.

132
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Caution, keep clear.

133
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,130
Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

134
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,710
Packages start at 20 minutes.

135
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,170
Many options available.

136
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,810
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

137
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,810
Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

138
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,940
Packages start at 20 minutes.

144
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,890
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

145
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,030
You want me to come back?

146
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,440
- Just go scrub. - Yes, ma'am.

147
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
How was your meeting?

148
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,460
The usual.

149
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,780
How was your day?

150
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,300
I'm getting cabin fever.

151
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,870
99.9 percent detoxified water.

152
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
I had an accident at work.

153
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,640
I think I ruined my shirt.

154
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,930
I'm sure I can fix that for you. Let me take a look at it.

155
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
I need a drink.

156
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,150
- Do you want a drink first? - Pour me one, will you?

157
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,770
I'm trying a new recipe.

158
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,250
I just need a bit more practice.

159
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,460
Don't fuss.

160
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,200
I should have marinated it longer. I hope it isn't dry.

161
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,220
Did you know this song was released in 1966 on Reprise Records?

162
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,920
It was number one on the charts.

163
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,930
It won't be much longer. Just putting on the finishing touches.

164
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,450
Okay, it's ready. I hope you're gonna like it.

165
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,190
I told you not to fuss.

166
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,210
And yet....

167
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,290
Voilà! Bon appétit.

168
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,630
I missed you, baby sweet.

169
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,720
Honey, it's beautiful.

170
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,430
Just put your feet up.

171
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,130
Relax.

172
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,230
Was a day?

173
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,830
It was a day.

174
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,540
Would you read to me?

176
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,870
It'll make you feel better.

177
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,790
- You hate that book. - I don't wanna read either.

178
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,680
Let's dance.

179
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,340
Do you wanna dance, or do you wanna open your present?

180
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,100
What present?

181
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,480
- This one. - What's the occasion?

182
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,390
Let's just say...

183
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,940
- it's our anniversary. - Is it?

184
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,860
No, but let's just say that it is.

185
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,870
Okay?

186
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,950
Happy anniversary.

187
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,040
An emanator.

190
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,380
Thank you.

191
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,960
Honey, you can go anywhere you want in the world now.

192
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,000
Where do you wanna go first?

193
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,180
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

194
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,820
You don't have to say that.

197
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,230
The dig's come through. We have a new lead.

198
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,730
Get down here.

199
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,070
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

200
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,900
Your box is a military footlocker,

201
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,310
issued to Sapper Morton...

202
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,940
creatively repurposed as an ossuary:

203
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,180
a box of bones.

204
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,600
Nothing else in it but hair.

205
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,780
The soil samples indicate that she's been buried for 30 years.

206
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,910
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,

207
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,580
meticulously laid to rest.

208
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,400
"She"?

209
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,670
Cause of death, Coco?

210
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,020
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

211
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,270
a fracture through the ilium.

212
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,510
It's a narrow birth canal. Baby must have got stuck.

213
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,760
She was pregnant?

214
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,400
So he didn't kill her?

215
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,890
She died in childbirth.

216
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,780
What's that?

217
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,480
Go back.

218
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,780
Closer.

219
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,750
Closer.

220
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,950
What's that?

221
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,930
Notching in the iliac crest.

222
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,470
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

223
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,340
That looks like an emergency C-section.

224
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,180
The cuts are clean. No sign of a struggle.

225
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,170
He was a combat medic.

226
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,400
Maybe he tried to save her, and he just couldn't.

227
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,940
He didn't seem like the saving type.

228
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,200
He went to the trouble of burying her.

229
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,870
A sentimental skin-job.

230
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,000
Sorry.

231
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,620
So where's the kid?

232
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,460
You scan the whole field?

233
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,990
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

234
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,130
Maybe he ate it.

235
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,680
That's not possible.

236
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,390
She was a Replicant.

237
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,260
Pregnant.

238
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,320
The world is built on a wall.

239
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,870
It separates kind.

240
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,490
Tell either side there's no wall,

241
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,460
you bought a war.

242
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,490
Or a slaughter.

243
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,290
So what you saw...

244
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,300
didn't happen.

245
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,060
Yes, madam.

246
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,060
It is my job to keep order.

247
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,340
That's what we do here. We keep order.

248
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,010
You want it gone?

249
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,680
Erase everything.

250
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,780
- Even the child? - All trace.

251
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,280
You have anything more to say?

252
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,950
I've never retired something that was born before.

253
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
What's the difference?

254
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,970
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

255
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,460
Are you telling me no?

256
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,050
I wasn't aware that was an option, madam.

257
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,270
Attaboy.

258
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,070
You've been getting on fine without one.

259
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,280
What's that, madam?

260
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,930
A soul.

261
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,290
And you new models are happy scraping the shit...

262
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,830
because you've never seen a miracle.

264
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,310
Just checking in on an old serial number.

265
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,400
Confirmation DNA?

266
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,500
I got hair.

268
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,130
An old one.

269
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,520
Pre-Blackout.

270
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,060
That's gonna be tough.

271
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,400
Not much from then.

272
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,680
And what's there is...

273
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,890
thick milky.

274
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,490
You can customize them as much as you'd like.

275
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,400
As human as you want them to be.

276
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,150
But your operation is strictly a drill site, isn't it?

277
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,830
I wouldn't waste your money

278
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,000
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

279
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,050
Unless you'd like to add some pleasure models to your order.

280
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,640
Would it be possible to reschedule this call, please?

281
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,490
Everyone remembers where they were at the Blackout. You?

282
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,240
That was a little before my time.

283
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,490
I was home with my folks, then 10 days of darkness.

284
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,200
Every machine stopped cold.

285
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,580
When the lights came back, we were wiped clean.

286
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,870
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.

287
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,370
Bank records too.

288
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,700
Didn't mind that.

289
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

290
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,840
I mean, we had everything on drives.

291
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,550
Everything, everything, everything.

292
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,720
My mom still cries over the lost baby pictures.

293
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,180
Well, it's a shame. You must have been adorable.

294
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,230
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

295
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,270
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

296
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,310
Standard issue.

297
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,080
- Made by Tyrell. - And?

298
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,900
Unremarkable.

299
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,330
"Unremarkable"?

300
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,330
There must be something else we can find for him.

301
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,600
Another prodigal serial number returns.

302
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,060
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

303
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,470
Thank you, officer.

304
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,180
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

305
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,440
He named you.

306
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,110
Must be special.

307
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,320
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

308
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,060
Follow me.

309
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,830
The ancient models give the entire endeavor a bad name.

310
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,920
What a gift, don't you think, from Mr. Wallace to the world?

311
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,000
The outer colonies would never

312
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,130
have flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

313
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,890
revivified the technology.

314
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,720
To say the least of what we do.

315
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,820
I see you're also a customer.

316
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,520
Are you satisfied with our product?

317
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,830
She's very realistic. Thank you.

318
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,860
Here. All the junk is in here.

319
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,210
Lucky for you, Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

320
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,770
No one's been down here in ages.

321
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,480
Sorry about that.

322
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,030
All our memory bearings from the time.

323
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,330
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

324
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,490
But there are sometimes fragments.

326
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,670
You got a little boy.

327
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,060
He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

328
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,260
I'd take him to the doctor.

329
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,280
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm. - I'd kill it.

330
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,610
You're reading a magazine.

331
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,110
You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

332
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,930
Is this testing

333
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,410
whether I'm a Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

334
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,820
Just answer the questions, please.

335
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,920
It was unclear what she was, at least to someone.

336
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,000
This was a test.

337
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,680
We were difficult to spot then.

338
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,290
Was there anything unusual about how you found her?

339
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,310
To warrant an official investigation?

340
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,800
You know how people are about old serial numbers.

341
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,220
Everyone just sleeps better when they know where they got to.

342
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,440
She likes him.

343
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,910
Who?

344
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,870
This Officer Deckard.

345
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,990
She's trying to provoke him.

346
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,700
It is invigorating being asked personal questions.

347
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,750
Makes one feel...

348
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,540
desired.

349
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,050
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

350
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,230
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

351
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,270
You worked with Officer Deckard...

352
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,200
back in the day.

353
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,150
What can you tell me about him?

354
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,210
He liked to work alone.

355
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,960
So did I.

356
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,420
So we worked together to keep it that way.

357
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,340
That was it.

358
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,250
Anything else you can tell me?

359
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,670
He wasn't long for this world.

360
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,260
How so?

361
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,770
Something in his eyes.

362
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,740
Any idea how I could contact him?

363
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,950
None.

364
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,870
He's nyugdíjas.

365
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
Retired.

366
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,000
What happened?

367
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,950
Probably got what he wanted.

368
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,300
To be alone.

369
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,770
Welcome back, sir.

370
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,450
You wanted to review the new model, sir, before shipment?

371
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,370
An angel should never enter the kingdom of heaven...

372
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,040
without a gift.

373
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,420
Can you at least pronounce, "a child is born"?

374
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,940
A new model.

375
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,110
Well, let us see her, then.

376
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,870
The first thought...

377
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,830
one tends to fear...

378
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,790
to preserve the clay.

379
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,590
It's fascinating.

380
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,380
Before we even know what we are...

381
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,350
we fear to lose it.

382
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,820
Happy birthday.

383
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,740
Now, let's have a look at you.

384
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,790
We make angels...

385
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,260
in the service of civilization.

386
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,920
Yes, there were bad angels once.

387
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,560
I make good angels now.

388
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,720
That is how I took us to nine new worlds.

389
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,820
Nine.

390
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,190
A child can count to nine on fingers.

391
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,330
We should own the stars.

392
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,910
Yes, sir.

393
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,660
Every leap of civilization was built off the back of a disposable workforce.

394
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,040
We lost our stomach for slaves...

395
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,620
unless engineered.

396
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,170
But I can only make so many.

397
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,610
That barren pasture...

398
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,610
empty...

399
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,600
and salted...

400
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,690
right here.

401
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,540
The dead space between the stars.

402
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,990
And this, the seat that we must change for heaven.

403
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,750
I cannot breed them. So help me, I have tried.

404
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,460
We need more Replicants than can ever be assembled.

405
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,670
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

406
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,560
We could storm Eden and retake her.

407
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,290
Tyrell's final trick:

408
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,410
Procreation.

409
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,830
Perfected, then lost.

410
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,750
But there is a child.

411
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,840
Bring it to me.

412
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,760
Sir.

413
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,440
The best angel of all.

414
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Aren't you, Luv?

415
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,810
The man with the green jacket.

416
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,850
The one who killed Sapper. Find out what he knows.

417
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,620
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

418
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,620
You alone?

422
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,220
It's fine.

423
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,470
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

424
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,160
Oh, you don't even smile.

425
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,530
Didn't you hear your friends?

426
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,540
Don't you know what I am?

427
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,450
Yeah.

428
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,740
Guy eating rice.

429
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,420
What's that?

430
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,370
It's a tree.

431
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,760
Never seen a tree before.

432
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,640
It's pretty.

433
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,310
It's dead.

434
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,560
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

435
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,310
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

436
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,120
Depends. What's your model number?

437
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,790
Why don't you look under my eye and find out?

438
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,380
You don't like real girls.

439
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,330
Well, I'm always here.

440
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,100
You can't take those.

441
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,710
Of course not. Proper channels and paperwork.

442
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,390
It's all here.

443
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,280
Hold this for me.

444
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,020
Yep. Here you go.

445
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,040
Coco is dead.

446
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,310
Bones are gone.

447
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,640
It's out. Already out. How long did that take?

448
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,020
So, what do you have for me? And don't say nothing.

449
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,610
I found that.

450
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,890
A sock?

451
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,820
- Where'd you find it? - Sapper's.

452
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,080
Anything else?

453
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,490
I burned everything else.

454
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,350
Then what's this? What's that date?

455
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,910
Is that a birthday? Is that a death day?

456
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,750
I don't know yet.

457
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,950
Am I the only one that can see the fucking sunrise here?

458
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,220
This breaks the world, K.

459
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,190
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

460
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:13,030
All useful, but with you, I sometimes forget.

461
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,520
We didn't have any of you where I was a kid.

462
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,700
Do you remember anything?

463
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,580
Before you were under me, you have any memories from before?

464
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,960
I have memories...

465
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,460
but they're not real. They're just implants.

466
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,050
Tell me one.

467
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,480
From when you were a kid.

468
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,020
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,

469
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,820
considering I was never a child.

470
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,440
Well, would it help you share if I told you it was an order?

471
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,320
I have one about a toy that I had.

472
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,570
A wooden horse.

473
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,130
With an inscription underneath.

474
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,750
All I remember is a group of boys trying to take it away from me.

475
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,090
So I run.

476
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,450
I go looking for a place to hide it,

477
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,410
and the only place is this dark furnace.

478
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,080
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

479
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,840
but this horse is all I have, so I go in anyway.

480
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,300
Later on, those kids find me...

481
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,140
and they beat me to tell them where it is, but I don't.

482
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,530
That's it.

483
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,070
Little K, fighting for what's his.

484
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,990
It's a good one.

485
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,210
Look at me.

486
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,290
We're all just looking out for something real.

487
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,690
What happens if I finish that?

488
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,810
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

489
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,580
Check back in after DNA base.

491
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,140
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

492
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,350
Request.

493
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,510
DNA records children born 6-10-21.

495
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,720
Looking for anomalies.

497
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,690
You have the satcrystal backup?

499
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,070
Okay.

500
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,490
Run it raw.

501
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,330
Mere data makes a man.

502
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,860
A  C  T  G
A and C and T and G.

503
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,910
The alphabet of you. All from four symbols.

504
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,580
I'm only two:

505
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,840
One and zero.

506
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,520
Half as much but twice as elegant, sweetheart.

507
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,890
You don't prefer your madam?

508
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,190
You were listening.

509
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,520
Maybe.

510
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,450
You didn't like her enough to tell her the truth.

511
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,280
Six, 10 and 21.

512
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,900
There's nothing to tell.

513
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,910
How many times have you told me that story?

514
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,670
Your memory?

515
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,120
The date carved beneath.

516
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,460
Six, 10 and 21.

517
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,140
Coincidence?

518
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,940
A dangerous coincidence.

519
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,640
I always knew you were special.

520
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,480
Maybe this is how.

521
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,820
A child.

522
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,450
Of woman born.

523
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,920
Pushed into the world.

524
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,840
Wanted.

525
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,800
Loved.

526
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,460
Well, if it were true...

527
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,730
I'd be hunted for the rest of my life by someone just like me.

528
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,770
It's okay to dream a little.

529
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,270
- Isn't it? - Not if you're us.

530
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,740
Stop.

531
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,780
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

532
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,550
They're identical. Translate.

534
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,430
A boy and a girl.

535
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,250
- It's impossible. - Why?

537
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,130
Two people can't have identical DNA.

539
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,150
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

540
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,030
They were both processed at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

542
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,410
It says the girl died there.

543
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,700
Genetic disorder.

544
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,910
Galatians Syndrome.

545
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,920
And the boy...

546
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,620
disappears.

547
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,370
Where's the orphanage?

548
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,970
You wanna go for a ride?

551
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,500
Well, here we are.

552
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,300
Buckle up.

553
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,820
K
K?

554
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,430
K  K
K? K?

555
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,840
K  K  K
K? K? K?

556
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,890
Stay back.

557
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,830
Fire again.

558
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,960
Fire again.

559
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,330
Fire.

560
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,430
Two hundred feet to the east.

561
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,310
Fire.

562
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,730
Go north.

563
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,520
Fire.

564
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,620
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

565
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,530
Stop.

566
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,490
Zoom in.

567
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,450
Closer.

568
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,800
Oh, come on.

569
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,500
Get up.

570
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,000
Do your fucking job.

571
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,560
Find the child.

572
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,010
Watch the car.

573
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,140
Every last piece,

574
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,700
or I'll put you outside where the sky is raining...

575
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,910
where it's raining fire!

576
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,780
You're in here to work.

577
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:37,210
And if you're not working, I don't need you.

578
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,790
I don't need any of--

579
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,800
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

580
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,770
Closest any of them or any of us is gonna get...

581
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,190
to that grand life Off-world.

582
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,300
And I encourage play, I do. Keeps them occupied...

583
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,110
and it makes them nimble, right?

584
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,530
But it's work.

585
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,480
It's work that molds them into a child worth having.

586
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,870
So come on, now.

587
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,340
What sort do you have in mind?

588
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,090
Because I got all kinds.

589
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,810
- Oh, no, no, no. - I'm not buying.

590
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,060
No, no, no. This is just my game, and I play it fair.

591
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:44,100
No. No, I mean, bigger than you....

592
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,800
Bigger than you have tried to shut me down. Bigger than you.

593
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,240
And they were men, at that.

594
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,410
A little boy came through here about 30 years back.

595
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,750
I need to see your records.

596
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,000
Legitimate placements, private sales, everything.

597
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,460
Don't keep records that far back.

598
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,620
- You don't? - I don't.

599
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,260
Sorry.

600
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,250
Can't help you.

601
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,880
- You can't? - Nope.

602
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,930
I think you can.

603
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,810
I think someone like you keeps a long memory.

604
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,780
Now you can tell me what you remember...

605
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,230
or I can put a hole right here and take a look.

606
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,580
They were laughing and what was it you said? What'd you say?

607
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,480
Are you coming?

608
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,000
Where is it?

609
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,620
Oh, God.

610
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,140
Where, where, where?

611
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:41,550
I don't see it. Here.

612
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,320
It's gone.

613
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,560
It's the entire year.

614
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,860
I didn't do that.

615
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,950
That wasn't me.

616
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,950
I didn't. Wasn't me.

617
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,940
I always told you.

618
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,900
You're special.

619
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,570
Born.

620
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,290
Not made.

621
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,920
Hidden with care.

622
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,260
A real boy now.

623
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,040
A real boy needs a real name.

624
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,890
Joe.

625
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,420
"Joe"?

626
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,930
You're too important for K.

627
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,690
Your mother would've named you.

628
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,820
Joe.

629
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,440
- Joe. - Stop.

630
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,110
How do I know if a memory is an implant or not?

631
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,840
Who makes the memories?

632
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,280
Dr. Ana Stelline?

633
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,530
A visitor.

634
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,410
Is that okay?

635
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,920
Yes.

636
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,220
It's just unusual.

637
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,600
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

638
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:48,260
Sorry. It's a compromised immune system.

639
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,490
A life of freedom, so long as it's behind glass.

640
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,700
- Is that why you're not Off-world? - Yes.

641
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,320
My parents had our passes in pocket, but I took sick.

642
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,660
So it was a new life for me.

643
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,210
And they put me in my cage...

644
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:12,460
filled it with everything they could to keep me happy.

645
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:17,550
Except company, of course. And I was used to crowds.

646
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,920
What can I help you with?

647
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,980
Thought you might be able to help me with a case.

648
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,720
Oh, that's the most interesting thing

649
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,280
I've been offered to help with in ages.

650
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,240
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

651
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,770
Of course.

652
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,380
I promise I hear every word.

653
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,790
They say you're the best memory-maker there is.

654
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:01,010
Well, then, they're kind.

655
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,670
I love birthday parties.

656
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,320
You work for Wallace?

657
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,990
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

658
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,820
He offered to buy me out,

659
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,280
but I take my freedom where I can find it.

660
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,150
Why are you so good?

661
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,250
What makes your memories so authentic?

662
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,290
Well, there's a bit of every artist in their work.

663
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:33,170
But I was locked in a sterile chamber at 8...

664
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,420
so if I wanted to see the world, I had to imagine it.

665
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:43,060
Got very good at imagining.

666
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,930
Wallace needs my talent to maintain a stable product.

667
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,350
I think it's only kind.

668
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:58,310
Replicants live such hard lives, made to do what we'd rather not.

669
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,770
I can't help your future...

670
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,690
but I can give you good memories to think back on and smile.

671
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,910
It's nice.

672
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,670
It's better than nice. It feels authentic.

673
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,310
And if you have authentic memories,

674
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:15,550
you have real human responses.

675
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,210
Wouldn't you agree?

676
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:30,090
Are they all constructed, or do you ever use ones that are real?

677
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,240
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

678
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,310
How can you tell the difference?

679
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,870
Can you tell if something...

680
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,330
really happened?

681
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,420
They all think it's about more detail.

682
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,700
But that's not how memory works.

683
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,830
We recall with our feelings.

684
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,130
Anything real should be a mess.

685
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,420
I can show you.

686
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,220
Sit.

687
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:30,360
Now, think about the memory you want me to see.

688
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,820
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

689
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,090
Let it play.

690
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,500
Someone lived this, yes.

691
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,850
This happened.

692
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:50,230
I know it's real.

693
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,380
I know it's real.

694
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,970
Goddamn it!

695
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:58,270
Officer KD6 - 3.7. Madam is calling you in.

696
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,470
You're under arrest.

697
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,720
Drop your gun and keep your hands where I can see them.

698
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,530
- Cells. - Cells.

699
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:07,170
- Have you ever been in an institution? Cells. - Cells

700
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:09,090
When you're not performing your duties,

701
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,610
- do they keep you in a little box? Cells. - Cells.

702
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,990
- Interlinked. - Interlinked.

703
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,750
What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love?

704
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:18,710
- Interlinked. - Interlinked.

705
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,850
- Within cells interlinked. - Within the cells interlinked.

706
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,050
- Dreadfully. - Dreadfully.

708
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,330
- What's it like to be filled with dread? Dreadfully. - Dreadfully.

709
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,330
- Do you like being separated from other people? Distinct. - Distinct.

710
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,500
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark. - Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

711
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,960
- Within cells interlinked. - Within the cells interlinked.

712
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:36,630
- Within one stem. - Within one stem.

713
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,130
- And dreadfully distinct. - And dreadfully distinct.

714
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,020
- Against the dark. - Against the dark.

715
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,040
A tall white fountain played.

716
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,350
A tall white fountain played.

717
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,990
You're not even close to baseline.

718
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,740
Out! And close the door.

719
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,460
What the fuck is with you?

720
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,670
I put you on a case.

721
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,080
I impressed on you the importance of that case...

722
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:10,090
and then we pick you up fucking around outside an upgrade center?

723
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,340
Scan said you didn't look like you on the inside.

724
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,970
Miles off your baseline.

725
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,130
- Do you know what that means? - I found the kid.

726
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,890
He was set up like a standard Replicant, put on a service job.

727
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,440
Even he didn't know who he was.

728
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,730
- And? - And it's done.

729
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:39,240
- What does that mean, "It's done"? - What you asked.

730
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,280
It's done.

731
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,540
Fuck.

732
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,620
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

733
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,460
You did good.

734
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,760
I can help you get out of this station alive...

735
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,020
but you have 48 hours to get back on track.

736
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,650
Surrender your gun and badge.

737
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:08,230
And your next baseline test is out of my hands.

738
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,360
Thank you, madam.

739
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,260
You were right.

740
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,780
You were right about everything.

741
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:26,680
Thought you weren't interested, worky man.

742
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,320
You liked her. I could tell.

743
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,900
It's okay.

744
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,110
She's real.

745
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,700
I wanna be real for you.

746
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:45,250
You are real for me.

747
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:47,950
You have a special lady here.

748
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,720
Okay.

749
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,190
Let's do it.

750
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,460
Look at you.

751
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,120
Quiet now, I have to sync.

752
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:36,100
Joi is anything you want her to be.

753
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:41,070
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

754
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,380
99.9 percent detoxified water.

755
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,370
It's from a tree.

756
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,370
I'm done with you.

757
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,760
You can go now.

758
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,060
Quiet now.

759
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,940
I've been inside you.

760
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,180
Not so much there as you think.

761
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,330
Coffee?

762
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,800
They'll be coming after me soon.

763
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,430
I'm coming with you.

764
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,070
But not like this.

765
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,520
If they come here looking for you,

766
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,190
they'll have access to all my memories.

767
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,280
You have to delete me from the console.

768
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,820
My present.

769
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,330
Put me there.

770
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,250
I can't do that.

771
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:11,220
Think about it:

772
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,080
If anything happens to this, that's it.

773
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,680
You're gone.

774
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,840
Yes.

775
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:22,190
Like a real girl.

776
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,310
Please.

777
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,560
Joe, please.

778
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,570
I want this.

779
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,200
But I can't do it myself.

780
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,840
Break the antenna.

784
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,590
I don't need a real horse.

786
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:52,190
I don't need a real horse. I just wanna find out where it's from.

789
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,790
Radiation from a reactor?

793
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,000
It matches a dirty bomb.

795
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,180
There's only one place that dirty.

796
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,600
Nobody lives there.

803
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,020
Go to five.

804
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:23,410
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

805
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,860
Tilt up.

806
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:31,670
Elevate to 400 feet.

807
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,300
Radiation analysis.

808
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:43,800
Move forward.

809
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:52,050
Tilt up.

810
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,720
Stop.

811
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:57,360
Move forward.

812
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,820
Go to five.

813
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,490
Seven, move forward.

814
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,440
Six.

815
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,170
Stop.

816
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,370
Go to seven.

817
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,370
Eight.

818
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,830
Nine.

819
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,420
Heat analysis.

820
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,520
Life.

821
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,770
What is it?

822
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:40,570
Guess we're about to find out.

823
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,290
Too dark in here.

824
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:57,040
I like him.

825
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:59,590
He's a good boy.

826
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,330
Where is he?

827
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:11,930
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

828
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,010
Check around.

829
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,930
I checked...

830
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:19,180
...anywhere a good boy might go.

831
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,530
You're too late.

832
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:26,060
It's gone.

833
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:30,870
He destroyed it.

834
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:35,450
Everything about it.

835
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:38,840
Well, except for the box of bones that you already took.

836
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:47,140
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough. Here you are.

837
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:56,810
You tiny thing.

838
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:01,940
In the face of the fabulous new, your only thought is to kill it?

839
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:05,820
For fear of great change?

840
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,650
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

841
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:11,910
Except that I did.

842
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:14,570
Where is he?!

843
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:20,420
You're so sure.

844
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,830
Because he told you.

845
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,330
Because we never lie.

846
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,140
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace you tried to shoot me first.

847
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,260
So I had to kill you.

848
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:40,020
Then do what you gotta do.

849
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,820
Madam.

850
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:18,060
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

851
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:11,690
Mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?

852
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:14,190
Would you, boy?

853
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,110
Treasure Island?

854
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:39,090
He reads.

855
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,680
That's good.

856
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,170
Me too.

857
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:48,640
Not much else to do around here at night anymore.

858
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:55,970
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

859
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,780
toasted, mostly.

860
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,730
What are you doing here?

861
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:11,700
I heard the piano.

862
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,790
Don't lie.

863
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:18,120
It's rude.

864
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:22,260
You're a cop.

865
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,720
- I'm not here to take you in. - Oh, yeah?

866
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:30,060
Then, what?

867
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,600
I just have some questions.

868
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:36,730
What questions?

869
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,120
Stay.

870
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:32,320
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

871
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,560
But you're not making it easy.

872
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,950
I like this song.

873
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,920
We could keep at this, or we could get a drink.

874
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:53,990
I'll take the drink.

875
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,080
This is really something.

876
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,360
The whole town was something.

877
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,380
One time.

878
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,170
Forget your troubles...

879
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:15,220
...see a show...

880
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:18,760
...gamble a little.

881
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:23,840
Win some money, lose some money.

882
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:28,010
They made money seem like candy.

883
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,100
You like whiskey?

884
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:32,480
I've got millions...

885
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:35,070
...of bottles of whiskey.

886
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:49,790
Here.

887
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:52,800
Bleeding.

888
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:06,340
Is it real?

889
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,970
I don't know.

890
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:10,930
Ask him.

891
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,320
You got a name?

892
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,200
Officer KD6 - 3.7--

893
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:35,160
That's not a name. That's a serial number.

894
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:39,630
All right.

895
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:43,510
Joe.

896
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,890
What do you want, Joe?

897
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:50,060
- I wanna ask you some questions. - Like what?

898
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,610
Like what was her name, the mother of your child?

899
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,780
What was she like?

900
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:23,750
- You two live here together? - Too many questions.

901
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:26,000
I had your job. I was good at it.

902
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,140
- It was simpler then. - Why you making it complicated?

903
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,630
- Why don't you answer the question? - What question?

904
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:34,810
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

905
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,770
What's her name?

906
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:51,960
Rachael.

907
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:58,840
Her name was Rachael.

908
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:04,330
What happened to the kid?

909
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:10,510
Who put it in the orphanage? Was it you?

910
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,600
I was long gone by then.

911
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:21,190
You didn't even meet your own kid?

912
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:25,160
Why?

913
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:27,620
Because that was the plan.

914
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:35,040
I showed them how to scramble the records, cover their tracks.

915
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:38,550
Everyone had a part. Mine was to leave.

916
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:42,210
Then the Blackout came, paved over everything.

917
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,800
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

918
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,500
- Did you want to? - Not really.

919
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:52,230
- Why not? - Because we were being hunted.

920
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,730
I didn't want our child found...

921
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:58,760
taken apart, dissected.

922
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:05,480
Sometimes, to love someone...

923
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,530
you gotta be a stranger.

924
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:32,170
To strangers.

925
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:45,440
What'd you do?

926
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,220
Who'd you bring?

927
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:51,810
- No one. - Oh, yeah?

928
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:58,440
Target locked.

929
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:02,110
They know you're here.

930
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,080
I came alone.

931
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:13,840
Bad dog.

932
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:33,150
Stop.

933
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,320
I do hope you're satisfied with our product.

934
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:54,120
I love--

935
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:12,320
Hey, there's someone who wants to meet you.

936
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,000
You can trust us.

937
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,340
You must want me to look up and to the left.

938
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,300
This is Freysa.

939
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:36,560
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

940
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,640
I recognize you.

941
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,560
Did you help him hide the child?

942
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:46,730
I was there.

943
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:52,690
I saw a miracle delivered.

944
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:57,110
A perfect little face crying up at me.

945
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:59,860
Mad as thunder.

946
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,640
Were you with her?

947
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,720
Rachael?

948
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:20,520
I held her as she died.

949
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:26,150
We hid the child and made a vow to keep our secret.

950
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:29,100
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

951
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:36,790
I knew that baby meant we are more than just slaves.

952
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,950
If a baby can come from one of us...

953
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:43,290
we are our own masters.

954
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:46,130
More human than humans.

955
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,750
A revolution is coming.

956
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,840
And we're building an army.

957
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,720
I want to free our people.

958
02:06:04,230 --> 02:06:05,900
If you want to be free...

959
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,350
join us.

960
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,080
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

961
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:20,210
our lives mean nothing next to a storm that's coming.

962
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:25,660
Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.

963
02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:30,790
You led Wallace to Deckard.

964
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:35,510
You cannot allow Deckard to lead Wallace to me.

965
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,550
You must kill Deckard.

966
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:50,490
Deckard only wanted his baby to be safe.

967
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:51,700
And she is.

968
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,780
When the time comes, I will show her to the world...

969
02:06:57,950 --> 02:07:00,080
and she will lead our army.

970
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,650
"She"?

971
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:03,710
Of course.

972
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:06,210
Rachael had a daughter.

973
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:10,590
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

974
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:13,920
I dressed her in blue when it was time for her to go.

975
02:07:14,090 --> 02:07:16,180
It was a boy that you hid.

976
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:21,880
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

977
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:41,330
You imagined it was you?

978
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:45,670
You did.

979
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:47,740
You did.

980
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,080
We all wish it was us.

981
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:56,630
That's why we believe.

982
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,480
Someone lived this, yes.

983
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:21,520
I showed them how to scramble the records, cover their tracks.

984
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,080
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

985
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:29,880
I dressed her in blue when it was time for her to go.

986
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,590
There's a bit of every artist in their work.

987
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,750
Always jumping, that one.

988
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:17,500
Never a thought of what to do if it made land.

989
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:23,630
All the courage in the world cannot alter fact.

990
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:32,610
I have wanted to meet you for so very long.

991
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:54,540
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

992
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:01,630
I had the lock.

993
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:05,800
I found the key.

994
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:12,190
Yet the pins do not align. The door remains locked.

995
02:10:14,230 --> 02:10:18,280
I need the specimen to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

996
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,110
The child.

997
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:25,780
I need the child.

998
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,860
To teach them all to fly.

999
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:42,580
And God remembered Rachel...

1000
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:47,800
heeded her and opened her womb.

1001
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:51,430
Do you like our owl?

1002
02:10:53,890 --> 02:10:55,600
It's artificial?

1003
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,720
Of course it is.

1004
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:01,900
Must be expensive.

1005
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,150
Very. I'm Rachael.

1006
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:08,780
Deckard.

1007
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:22,720
Is it the same...

1008
02:11:23,710 --> 02:11:26,670
...now, as then...

1009
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:31,090
...the moment you met her?

1010
02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:43,770
All these years you looked back on that day...

1011
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:47,810
drunk on the memory of its perfection.

1012
02:11:50,490 --> 02:11:52,660
How shiny her lips.

1013
02:11:52,820 --> 02:11:55,860
How instant your connection.

1014
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:00,380
Did it never occur to you

1015
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:03,660
that's why you were summoned in the first place?

1016
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:07,090
Designed to do nothing short of fall

1017
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:11,100
for her right then and there.

1018
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:18,680
All to make that single perfect specimen.

1019
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:24,900
That is, if you were designed.

1020
02:12:25,770 --> 02:12:27,350
Love...

1021
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:30,490
or mathematical precision.

1022
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:37,530
Yes.

1023
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:39,960
No.

1024
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:46,580
I know what's real.

1025
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:13,620
It was very clever to keep yourself empty of information...

1026
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:17,950
and all it cost you was everything.

1027
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:23,290
But you can still help me.

1028
02:13:25,170 --> 02:13:28,880
You had help in the hiding.

1029
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:33,000
Where did they go?

1030
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,210
I know you know something.

1031
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:39,260
Help me...

1032
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:43,940
and very, very good things can come to you.

1033
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:51,450
You don't have children...

1034
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,690
do you?

1035
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:59,500
Oh, I have millions.

1036
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:04,530
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

1037
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,050
Only I know...

1038
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:09,620
you love pain.

1039
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:15,760
Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.

1040
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,380
More joy, then.

1041
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,570
Do not be afraid.

1042
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:43,880
An angel...

1043
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:46,170
made again.

1044
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,340
For you.

1045
02:15:26,370 --> 02:15:28,370
Did you miss me?

1046
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:48,100
Don't you love me?

1047
02:16:06,830 --> 02:16:08,210
Her eyes were green.

1048
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,360
Off-world...

1049
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:32,280
I have everything I need to make you talk.

1050
02:16:33,650 --> 02:16:36,820
You do not know what pain is yet.

1051
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,810
You will learn.

1052
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:53,660
Hello, handsome.

1053
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:12,890
What a day.

1054
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:18,350
You look lonely.

1055
02:17:19,650 --> 02:17:22,110
I can fix that.

1056
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,650
You look like a good joe.

1057
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:08,950
Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.

1058
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:14,250
Because you've never seen a miracle.

1059
02:18:52,410 --> 02:18:55,580
You're entering Los Angeles Airport restricted airspace.

1060
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:58,050
Confirm your identity.

1061
02:18:58,210 --> 02:19:01,090
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

1062
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:02,960
Space, this is 0-6.

1063
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:05,850
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

1064
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:07,930
Where are we going?

1065
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:10,310
Home.

1066
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:06,980
Drive two down.

1067
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:09,230
Backup engaged.

1068
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:11,240
Warning.

1069
02:20:11,410 --> 02:20:14,210
- Can we make it? - We're too low!

1070
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:15,500
Take us back!

1071
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:05,720
Get us up.

1072
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:32,110
Open the door.

1073
02:23:25,310 --> 02:23:27,400
I'm the best one.

1074
02:24:07,890 --> 02:24:10,020
Off-world is waiting.

1075
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:26,150
Joe. Joe!

1076
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:37,500
Joe!

1077
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:18,670
You should have let me die out there.

1078
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:21,300
You did.

1079
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:27,100
You drowned out there.

1080
02:27:32,470 --> 02:27:34,260
You're free to meet your daughter now.

1081
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:02,770
All the best memories are hers.

1082
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:13,120
Why?

1083
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:17,580
Who am I to you?

1084
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:28,840
Go meet your daughter.

1085
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:36,220
You okay?

1086
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,330
Just a moment.

1087
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:17,970
Beautiful, isn't it?
