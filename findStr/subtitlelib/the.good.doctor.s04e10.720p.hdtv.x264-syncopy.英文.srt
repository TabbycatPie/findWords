18
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,670
Perfect.

19
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,050
What are you doing to me?

20
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,430
Not the results we'd hoped for.

21
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,340
Your labs confirm what we saw on the ultrasound.

22
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,430
You're in end-stage liver disease.

23
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,770
But I always took my medicine.

24
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,520
I know.

25
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,100
You're the most compliant patient I have.

26
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,480
But autoimmune hepatitis can progress

27
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,770
even with treatment.

28
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,320
You need a liver transplant.

29
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,530
We talked about that before, remember?

30
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,570
But you're gonna have a fantastic team of surgeons

31
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,870
working their tails off to get you fixed up.

32
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,540
We're gonna get you admitted.

33
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,580
Do you have any questions?

34
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,830
Someone has to die

35
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,750
so I can live?

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,970
I want to pray,

37
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,440
but I can't pray for someone else to die.

38
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,860
Ooh, hold the door!

39
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,870
Thank you! I'm late enough already.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,040
What happened to you?

41
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,370
Oh, not much.

42
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,290
Just slept through my alarm, stubbed my toe,

43
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,380
then got a parking ticket and a flat tire.

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,340
You have a 50-year-old relic, and you don't use Triple A?

45
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,960
I drive a 44-year-old car,

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,460
and it takes longer to wait for help

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,220
than it is to put the spare on myself.

48
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,590
I'm surprised you know how to use it.

49
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,680
Because I'm a woman?

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,890
Because you're a millennial.

51
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,140
I'm also an engineer who used to work for a car company.

52
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,970
A computer company. You built software.

53
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,230
For self-driving cars.

54
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,480
So Sony is a car company

55
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,560
because they built stereos for cars...

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,480
My point is I obviously know how to change a tire

57
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,940
faster than any tow truck driver or you.

58
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,150
Okay. No need to be hostile.

59
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,900
I'm just trying to make conversation.

60
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,950
Have a nice day.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,830
What do you got?

62
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,200
He almost drowned in the triathlon.

63
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,040
We restarted his heart, but he's obtunded,

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,290
and breathing's labored.

65
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,040
He was in the triathlon?

66
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,840
Agonal respiration with accessory muscle use.

67
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,090
His sats are dropping.

68
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,720
- It's Cort Graham. - Eight liters oxygen.

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,090
Are we supposed to know who that is?

70
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,100
Cancer survivor and endurance athlete.

71
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,140
Also heads a big cancer charity.

72
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,100
Left lung has focal consolidation

73
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
and fluid collection.

74
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,520
- I need a chest tube. - On it.

75
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,770
If he's an experienced swimmer,

76
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,310
something must've made him pass out.

77
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Could be a heart attack. Stroke.

78
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,440
- Head trauma? - From swimming?

79
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,780
I did a sprint tri once.

80
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,900
The swim was like a roller derby in water.

81
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,700
Damn it. Pyxis won't open.

82
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,530
I tried to put in my code, but nothing happens.

83
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,580
Well, figure it out. We need the chest tube.

84
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,830
I'm going to go in with a 10 blade.

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,750
That won't release enough fluid.

86
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,710
I know.

87
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,500
Come on!

88
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,630
He's cyanotic.

89
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,430
Ugh! Come on, open!

90
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
Get out of the way.

91
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,110
Don't just stand there. Get the tube.

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,650
Sorry. Sorry.

93
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,280
What's going on? Why didn't it open?

94
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't know.

95
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,830
The power's on, but our computers are down.

96
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,330
All of them? The whole hospital?

97
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,330
Looks that way.

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,850
We'll need to temporarily close the clinic, ER,

101
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,100
and divert new patients.

102
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,890
Good news is,

103
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,890
the ORs are isolated from the network,

104
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,480
so we won't be able to share imaging

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
on external monitors,

106
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,270
but the MRI and radiology machines are still functional.

107
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,020
Well, great.

108
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,190
Let's postpone all elective procedures,

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
keep the most urgent cases on the board.

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,240
Got it.

111
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,910
You call the cops?

112
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,530
San Jose Police and the FBI

113
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,620
and the Cyber Attack insurance carrier.

114
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,910
What's the ransom?

115
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,250
Two million.

116
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,040
Well, we have the data backed up.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
Got it covered.

118
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,470
We got a problem.

119
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,220
If it's only one problem,

120
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,140
it'll make me extraordinarily happy.

121
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
No, it won't.

122
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,640
They actually hacked into the network

123
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,850
over three months ago.

124
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,060
Took their time to not only

125
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,310
encrypt our servers

126
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,520
but our on-site and cloud-based backups.

127
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,480
Don't we have backups, data?

128
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,440
Actually, we have three,

129
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
which get rotated out every 30 days,

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,230
which means the oldest backup we have

131
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,110
was synched four days after the bastards broke in.

132
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,610
We have no data?

133
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,950
Technically, we still have data.

134
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,150
We just can't access it

135
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,490
without their encryption key.

136
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,500
Okay.

137
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,290
You can't pay the ransom.

138
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,750
You don't negotiate with terrorists.

139
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,060
What I can't do is

140
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,750
pay an exorbitant amount of money to an insurance company

141
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,920
and then not use them.

142
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,630
They gave us 24 hours to get the Bitcoin.

143
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,840
If I can find a mistake in their encryption software,

144
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,930
I might be able to get our data back.

145
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,350
Of course, I'll also have to retrace the attack chain

146
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,850
to find the exact door they came in.

147
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,060
Otherwise, we might as well toss

148
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,640
every computer we have in the recycle...bin.

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
If you're trying to convince me to not pay the ransom,

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,190
you maybe shouldn't have said that last part.

151
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,940
I realized that as I was saying it.

152
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,490
You've got 24 hours.

153
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,540
The surgery shouldn't be a problem,

154
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,960
but finding a liver will be.

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,330
Her MELD score puts her first up

156
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,000
on our list, which still leaves her competing

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,630
against every patient in the region.

158
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,090
No procurement coordinator is gonna discriminate

159
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,710
against a patient with Down Syndrome,

160
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,880
but they are gonna give a patient

161
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,430
with shorter life expectancy a low priority.

162
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,390
She also lives alone

163
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,260
and doesn't have any family to help with recovery.

164
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,760
She's worked so hard to be independent,

165
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,470
and now it's gonna be held against her?

166
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,350
It sucks, but it's not unfair.

167
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,060
I'm not giving up.

168
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,360
You don't have to worry about the list

169
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,980
if you can find a living donor.

170
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,280
Look for one who's already volunteered to give a kidney.

171
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,400
Get help. With the network down,

172
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,650
everything's gonna take longer,

173
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,950
and she doesn't have much time.

174
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,700
I couldn't have gotten kicked.

175
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,830
Wasn't even close to the pack.

176
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,330
I thought swim was your strongest section.

177
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,210
Usually, but I let my ego get the best of me.

178
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,710
I went out way too fast

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
and got dropped at the first turn.

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Well, I'm impressed you're even out there.

181
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,340
I can barely finish a 5K.

182
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,890
I used to be the same way, too.

183
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,140
Cancer actually made me a better runner.

184
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,680
That can't be true.

185
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,940
The chemo you had reduces lung capacity,

186
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,770
and how could losing a leg make you a faster runner?

187
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,480
Well, once you get past a mile, it's not about speed.

188
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,290
It's about pain

189
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,860
and how much you're willing to push through.

190
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,650
And my threshold definitely increased

191
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,820
after chemo and rehab.

192
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,080
And seeing the hope I give survivors

193
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,870
every single time that I cross the finish line,

194
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,580
that doesn't hurt either.

195
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,750
His cancer could be back.

196
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,340
The odds of sarcoma reoccurrence are very high.

197
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,960
It could be lots of things.

198
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,880
It could be a virus or bacteria.

199
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,130
More likely cancer.

200
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,050
Overtraining can weaken the immune system.

201
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,180
I'm a motivational speaker,

202
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,680
so literally a professional optimist.

203
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,350
I can handle the truth.

204
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,770
Dr. Murphy is probably right,

205
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,810
but we'll do a full blood panel and chest CT to be sure.

206
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,110
The good news is, it's clearly an underfunded startup.

207
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,280
Their website's garbage,

208
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,490
and the ransom's only half your cyber policy limit.

209
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,550
Underfunded? Startup? Website?

210
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,830
Where do I start?

211
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,450
Despite what you see on TV,

212
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,250
these attacks don't come from lone wolves.

213
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,620
It's a global business.

214
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,920
With websites and customer service call centers.

215
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,170
Our IT Director thinks

216
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,960
that we might be able to decrypt the data.

217
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,380
Even if he could do that, which is impossible,

218
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,110
it wouldn't do any good

219
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,590
unless he can also retrace the entire attack chain.

220
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,840
She explained that.

221
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,810
She also said that she might be able to do both.

222
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm sure your IT Director's excellent.

223
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm also sure

224
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,560
that this is outside her area of expertise.

225
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,400
The only way to retrieve your data is to pay the fee.

226
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,820
Now, I'm sure I can negotiate it down

227
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,070
to a few hundred grand.

228
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,240
From two million?

229
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,900
Well, they're amateurs.

230
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,110
I'm not.

231
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,320
Thought I had a perfect match,

232
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,660
but she's in Shanghai on business.

233
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,450
How long's a flight from...

234
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,950
11 hours, but I couldn't talk her into it.

235
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,210
She's about to close the most important deal of her life.

236
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,620
Who talked to John Raponi?

237
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,210
Retired firefighter, peak physical condition.

238
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,090
I did.

239
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,920
He was at a bar at 3:00 p.m.

240
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,090
Doesn't give me high hopes

241
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,840
that his liver will be in perfect condition.

242
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,800
Mmm, not ideal, but not disqualifying.

243
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,010
Rachel Trainor is a better option.

244
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,180
She's local, preschool teacher,

245
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
and an extremely devout Christian.

246
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,980
What makes you think her faith helps us?

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,810
I'm a devout Christian, and I'm not sure

248
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
I'd be a live liver donor for a family member,

249
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,070
much less a stranger.

250
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,070
Well, you may be devout, but you're also selfish.

251
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,620
Um, we all are,

252
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,040
relatively speaking.

253
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,410
So what makes you think Rachel isn't?

254
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,710
Her Instagram.

255
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,080
I mean, you'd be surprised by how much you can learn

256
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,210
from what people "like,"

257
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,630
and Rachel likes everything she sees.

258
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,840
Like, literally everything.

259
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,010
We rescheduled the chemo appointments we could,

260
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,220
but there's still three that need their infusions today.

261
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,890
We're doing our best to modify the regimens.

262
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,060
Okay. Check and see if they got second opinions

263
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,520
from other oncologists.

264
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,230
- And if so, then maybe we can use those records. - Okay.

265
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,230
And keep me posted.

266
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,150
Yes.

267
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,070
What the hell?

268
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,660
You said I had 24 hours.

269
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,410
God, you're gonna give me a heart attack.

270
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,410
I authorized a negotiation. I didn't authorize a payment.

271
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
You don't trust me?

272
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,750
It's not about trust. It's about

273
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,420
weighing the costs of a delay.

274
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,710
Well, then you should know your costs just went up.

275
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,050
They sent us a Signal text.

276
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,930
What's a bot worm?

277
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,350
It's what happens when you listen to an insurance rep

278
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,220
instead of your own Head of IT.

279
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,680
They were insulted by the offer,

280
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,400
so they doubled the ransom and activated malware.

281
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,940
If we don't pay, they're gonna delete our data

282
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,360
and destroy all of our MRI, CT, and X-ray machines.

283
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,450
They obviously just figured out what the policy limit is,

284
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,790
which means they didn't do their research

285
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,080
and are now improvising.

286
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
They're playing catch-up.

287
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,290
Can we still get them down to a few hundred K?

288
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,130
No. That was before they had the policy information.

289
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,710
Now we'll end up somewhere between

290
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,220
their initial and current demands.

291
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,800
This is just a piece of paper

292
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,090
and a check to you, isn't it?

293
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,050
I'm sorry, you're upset because your insurance rep

294
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,970
wants to promptly pay a claim?

295
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,350
The frequency of these attacks is skyrocketing

296
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,350
because insurance companies make it so easy to collect.

297
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,440
I'd quibble with the analysis but accept the compliment.

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,560
It's just a matter of time before these bastards kill someone.

299
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,690
I agree, but do you have a solution or just a lecture?

300
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,190
Give me the time I asked for

301
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,280
to decrypt the data and restore the network.

302
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,950
- Not gonna be able to restore... - How do you even know that?

303
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,030
Because I've never seen it done.

304
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,780
- It would take a thousand years - I'm not running

305
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,080
- a brute force with some... - to run all the possible sequences.

306
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,910
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

307
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,790
Enough.

308
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,250
Your solutions aren't mutually exclusive.

309
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,540
You keep negotiating,

310
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,670
and you do whatever you do to get the network back online.

311
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,930
We have some good news.

312
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,930
Your cancer hasn't returned.

313
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,970
You have a fungal infection

314
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,930
that is causing a bleed in your left lung.

315
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,690
- That's great. - No, it's not.

316
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,350
The best treatment is surgical excision

317
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,270
of the infected lobe,

318
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,110
but we can't do that because of scarring

319
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,730
from the Bleomycin you were treated with

320
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,070
during chemotherapy.

321
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,200
They always do this good cop, bad cop thing?

322
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm sorry.

323
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,700
Dr. Murphy just has a more direct bedside manner.

324
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,490
That's good. I like direct.

325
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,250
You can't climb an obstacle until you're facing it head-on.

326
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,830
We're gonna start you on an anti-fungal drug.

327
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,290
If surgery's the best,

328
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,670
that's what I want.

329
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
The chemo was over 10 years ago.

330
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,260
Bleomycin weakens the lungs permanently.

331
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,470
For most people.

332
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,800
I climbed five of the Seven Summits

333
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,970
with these lungs.

334
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,270
It's my decision.

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,730
I want the surgery.

336
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,730
I'm sorry, but sometimes

337
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,860
a positive attitude just isn't enough.

338
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,030
We may have to try you on several different drugs

339
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,490
before we see some improvement,

340
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,610
so you're gonna have to be patient.

341
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,070
It's not one of my strengths.

342
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,990
Me neither.

343
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,830
But we're gonna get through this together.

344
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,550
Turkey, avocado, and Swiss on wheat bread with mayonnaise.

345
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,760
It's your favorite.

346
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I don't have time.

347
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,380
Low blood sugar can decrease

348
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,970
your ability to concentrate.

349
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,390
I've had five energy drinks and three granola bars.

350
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,260
Okay.

351
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,400
I have an interesting patient.

352
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,440
He said he thought cancer made him stronger,

353
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,940
- but that is obviously not true...  - Shaun!

354
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,700
Would you walk in on Glassman while he's doing brain surgery,

355
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,070
offer him a sandwich,

356
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
and start telling him about your day?

357
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,870
That's different.

358
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,410
Of course.

359
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,830
Because his job's important and mine's not.

360
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,460
Do you have any idea

361
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,010
how insulting it is to hear you demean what I do,

362
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,890
just like every man I've worked under and over my whole career?

363
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,260
You...

364
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,810
You don't respect me.

365
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,230
You can't bring sandwiches into an OR.

366
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,280
I have to go.

367
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,670
King me.

368
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,300
We have a problem.

369
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,510
Am I too sick for the transplant?

370
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,390
No.

371
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,060
But you are.

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,970
Your bloodwork indicates

373
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,230
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

374
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,850
It's a minor case which should be manageable with diet,

375
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,530
but it means you can't be a liver donor.

376
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,950
Wouldn't a fatty liver be better than nothing?

377
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,030
It wouldn't be safe for either of you.

378
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,120
There has to be another way.

379
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,660
We can't give up.

380
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,580
We're not giving up, but...

381
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,710
Thank you for trying to help me.

382
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,090
I'm sorry you are sick, too.

383
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,940
Your kidney is fine.

384
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,110
Would you be willing to donate it?

385
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,990
Uh, of course.

386
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,400
But how does that help Jamie?

387
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,570
You might be able to save two lives with one kidney.

388
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,540
What's going on?

389
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,750
Blood oxygen level dropping. He's hypoxic.

390
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,380
The anti-fungal regiment isn't working, but don't worry.

391
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,750
There are other drugs we can try.

392
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,550
I want the surgery. Please.

393
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,510
I'll take the risk, whatever it is.

394
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,550
Not a risk. It's a guarantee.

395
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,680
Increase voriconazole by 320 milligrams

396
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,640
and add Amphotericin at 24 milligrams.

397
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,810
We may need to intubate you.

398
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,310
Stop! Stop.

399
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,730
I would survive the surgery.

400
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,060
- No, you...  - Yes.

401
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,480
I would.

402
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,400
Because I never had the drug.

403
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,860
Because I never had cancer.

404
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,620
So, how'd he lose his leg?

405
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,460
Drunken motorcycle accident when he was 22.

406
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,590
It's good news.

407
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,510
Now we can give him the surgery he needs.

408
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,840
No way. He needs to find new doctors,

409
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,180
and we need to figure out a way to alert the charity.

410
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,780
He faked cancer so he could steal money,

411
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,690
date models, and get his face on a Wheaties box.

412
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,060
He didn't steal the money.

413
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,270
He gave it all to charity.

414
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,360
I don't care what he did with it after he lied

415
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,280
and cheated thousands of people to get it.

416
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,150
He should be in prison, not our OR.

417
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,610
Can we even do that? Refuse to treat him?

418
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,240
We refuse to treat noncompliant patients all the time.

419
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,620
What's going on?

420
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,120
I mean, he's obviously not the first patient

421
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
who's lied to you.

422
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,960
He didn't just hide how much he smokes or drinks.

423
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,830
He weaponized people's empathy,

424
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,340
and he kept pushing his lie

425
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,300
until he was some sort of national hero.

426
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,590
How does that not piss you off?

427
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,470
It does.

428
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,590
But I can be pissed off and professional.

429
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,640
Get him prepped for surgery.

430
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,190
A multi-organ chain.

431
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,190
We need to find someone

432
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,440
who wants to give a kidney to their loved one

433
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,480
but isn't a match, but is a match to Jamie.

434
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,690
And the loved one has to be a match to Rachel.

435
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,990
We have to match blood and tissue types,

436
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,160
as well as organ size,

437
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
and kidneys and livers have different test requirements.

438
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,410
And we need another donor willing to do a surgery

439
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,870
that's more painful and dangerous

440
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,410
than the one they already signed up for.

441
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,580
Twice the challenge.

442
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,330
To save twice as many lives.

443
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,250
Park and I will start calling hospitals.

444
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,300
Asher, back to social-media stalking.

445
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,880
Jordan, check local news reports

446
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,300
and any other corner of the Internet you can scour.

447
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,480
Stay back

448
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
or you're gonna contaminate my clean room.

449
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,610
I found an error.

450
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,150
Not theirs. Ours.

451
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,990
The serial numbers on the server didn't match up.

452
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,110
Turns out one of my techs spilled coffee on a server,

453
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
didn't want to tell me,

454
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,080
so he switched it out three days before the hack.

455
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,540
His screw-up might just save our ass.

456
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,920
So it's not encrypted?

457
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,840
No, but it is corrupted from the coffee and dust and dirt.

458
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,340
I found it under a pile of junk in the recycling bin.

459
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,680
But if my patient pulls through,

460
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,430
I'll be able to restore the network

461
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,930
without having to pay the hackers a dime.

462
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,560
That's great.

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,070
The insurance guy came to an agreement

464
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,440
with the hackers, didn't he?

465
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,570
Actually, he negotiated them down

466
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,950
below the original ransom amount.

467
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,870
I didn't authorize it yet.

468
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,880
You have till 9:00 a.m. to get us back online.

469
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,170
Okay.

470
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,220
We will get one more chest CT,

471
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,430
and then we will insert

472
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,430
the central venous line and the arterial line

473
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,270
to finalize your surgical prep.

474
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,310
You must think I'm a sociopath, but...

475
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,310
Don't even bother.

476
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,190
It's not like I planned this all out.

477
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,440
It just happened.

478
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,240
You just forgot

479
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,910
the drunk driving on a motorcycle detail

480
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,580
while you raked in cash and collected famous friends?

481
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,870
I went back to school

482
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,330
and got my MBA in nonprofit finance.

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,260
My first interview after graduation

484
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,220
was with this small cancer charity.

485
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,050
And for some reason,

486
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,680
the woman assumed I lost my leg to cancer.

487
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,440
And I didn't correct her.

488
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
It was a weak

489
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,610
stupid moment.

490
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,190
It wasn't just a moment.

491
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,070
It was years.

492
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,530
Where I was raising money,

493
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,830
helping thousands of cancer survivors.

494
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,580
And I knew if the truth came out,

495
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,830
that would all end.

496
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,500
I have helped

497
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,670
far more people over the last 10 years

498
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,800
than I have hurt.

499
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,810
You're scheduled for surgery first thing in the morning.

500
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,950
Hey, what's going on?

501
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
Don't you have a thoracotomy to prep for?

502
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,020
Yeah, I just needed a break.

503
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
I'm fine.

504
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,450
"I'm fine" is a pretty reliable indicator

505
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,360
that someone is not fine.

506
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,760
I suck at this.

507
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,440
I completely froze, could've killed the patient.

508
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,950
I always freeze. Lim knows it.

509
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,060
I feel like an impostor because...

510
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,620
I am.

511
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,200
It's a stressful job.

512
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,350
Patient's being a jerk?

513
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,060
Get used to it.

514
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,990
Chief of Surgery doesn't appreciate you?

515
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,470
Earn her respect.

516
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,320
If you want to be a successful surgeon,

517
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,950
you got to develop thicker skin.

518
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,750
My skin's not...

519
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,700
Suck it up and get back to work.

520
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,500
I did it!

521
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,050
If I had a mic, I'd drop it!

522
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,730
I fixed the server.

523
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,400
It's still missing the last 96 days of records,

524
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,010
but it's totally malware free,

525
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,130
which means we can restore the network with...

526
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,690
with three hours to spare.

527
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,850
And the, uh, the bot worm, the thing on the imaging?

528
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,840
How did you get rid of that?

529
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,800
I didn't, but I don't have to

530
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,490
because I went through every line of code,

531
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,760
and there's no sign of a worm.

532
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,680
They were obviously bluffing.

533
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,490
Obviously? It's not obvious to me.

534
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,550
No, the cyber insurance rep was right.

535
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,720
These guys are amateurs,

536
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,500
and the level of skill it would take

537
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,150
to cause an offline machine to self-destruct,

538
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,110
they would have to be like the Sidney Crosby of hackers,

539
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,070
and they're beer league at best.

540
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,330
Are you sure?

541
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,970
Totally.

542
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,070
95%.

543
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,330
Okay, well...

544
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,340
You have three hours to get to 100.

545
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,650
It's not going to work.

546
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,940
I already tried.

547
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,660
Why would the hack affect the microwave?

548
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,210
It's a smart microwave.

549
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,290
Apparently not.

550
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,020
Why are you so angry about Cort's lies?

551
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,440
You told me before, when the truth can't help someone,

552
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,520
you should lie.

553
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,800
I was talking about small white lies.

554
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,090
Cort's lies are huge.

555
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,270
When does a lie stop being white and start being huge?

556
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,710
The amount of good Cort did was proportional to the size of his lies.

557
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,410
Looks like you got what you wanted.

558
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,720
I just got off the phone with a reporter.

559
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,640
She wanted a comment on her soon-to-be

560
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,090
front page expose on Cort Graham.

561
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,030
Because her source is an employee in my department.

562
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,190
- I mean, I didn't... - You're off the case.

563
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,740
And you're lucky I can't prove it was you,

564
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,120
or you'd be out of a job.

565
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,170
What?

566
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,220
- Crap. - It's okay.

567
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,330
I got someone.

568
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,640
I called an old buddy who runs the infirmary

569
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,130
at the state pen in Arizona.

570
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,950
He put me in touch with an ex-inmate,

571
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,300
just paroled on compassionate release for kidney failure.

572
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,920
He's a match for Rachel.

573
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,800
His daughter's a match for Jamie.

574
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,510
They're on their way here with a police escort.

575
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
ETA 20 minutes.

576
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,590
The chain is closed. We did it!

577
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,200
Not to be a buzzkill, but...

578
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,130
An ex-inmate?

579
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,720
What'd he do?

580
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,250
He killed someone?

581
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,650
It was a complicated case over 20 years ago.

582
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,420
- He's paid his... - I can't do this.

583
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,030
You're not doing it for him. You're doing it for Jamie,

584
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,320
who's an innocent and deserving woman the system failed.

585
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,000
I understand.

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,500
But you want to put my kidney in a murderer's body.

587
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,720
He's a person who did something wrong a long time ago.

588
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,830
It's more than just wrong.

589
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,960
I'm not going to risk my life

590
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,890
to help someone who took another's.

591
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,870
Please take this IV out of my arm.

592
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,550
Now!

593
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,370
I get it.

594
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,060
I wouldn't want to save a murderer's life either.

595
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,360
But you should understand what Dr. Park means by "complicated."

596
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,650
Chris was abused as a child sexually, physically.

597
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,180
You don't want to know the horrors.

598
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,900
Once he got strong enough, he put a stop to it.

599
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,020
With a bullet.

600
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,350
But the prosecutor and the jury didn't see a brutalized kid.

601
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,640
They just saw a thug.

602
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,010
So they put him away for life for fighting back.

603
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,780
All finished. You're free to go.

604
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,360
That man shot someone in a robbery.

605
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,330
If the lie saves a life, it's fine by me.

606
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,370
And it saves two lives,

607
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,260
so I definitely think we can let it slide.

608
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,500
I think I've actually solved a huge problem,

609
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,810
but Glassman wants me to be 100% sure,

610
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,110
and I can't be.

611
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,270
I need your advice.

612
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,600
If I'm wrong,

613
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
all the imaging machines in the entire hospital will self-destruct.

614
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,320
Tens of millions of dollars' worth of damage.

615
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
But if I'm right, I'd save the whole hospital

616
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,560
and prevent some really bad people

617
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,720
from getting almost $2 million.

618
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,550
And I'm almost sure I'm right.

619
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm never 100% sure

620
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,980
a surgery is going to cure the patient.

621
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,510
There's always a chance something could go wrong,

622
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,180
but I still do the surgery.

623
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,300
But you get the patient's permission first.

624
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,270
And in my case, Glassman is kind of the patient,

625
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,610
and he hasn't given me permission.

626
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,040
In fact, he told me not to.

627
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,780
Oh, then I wouldn't do the surgery.

628
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,980
But this isn't actually surgery.

629
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,180
I don't know what you want me to say.

630
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,830
It's all right, sorry.

631
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,530
I'll just figure it out on my own.

632
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,590
Lea...

633
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,940
I wouldn't bring Dr. Glassman a sandwich in the OR

634
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,160
because you can't eat in the OR.

635
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,460
I knew that because I know about surgery.

636
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,020
I don't know about computers.

637
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,990
Neither does Dr. Glassman.

638
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,790
But you do.

639
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,960
You always know how to fix things.

640
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,680
I respect you.

641
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,060
I would've thought you would respect me enough

642
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,240
to at least ask me the question to hear me out

643
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,460
before kicking me off the case and threatening to fire me.

644
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,700
I did hear you out, when you sat right there

645
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,340
and said you wanted to blow the whistle on a patient,

646
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,380
and then that's exactly what happened.

647
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,570
- What am I supposed to think? - You're supposed to trust me.

648
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,490
I thought we were friends.

649
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,640
Is that why you went over my head

650
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,200
to tell my boss about my diagnosis?

651
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,880
- Is that what this is about? - No.

652
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm capable of separating my personal feelings

653
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,880
from my professional decisions.

654
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,080
Excuse me.

655
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,750
Yeah, what is it?

656
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,270
Sorry. Cort just coded.

657
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,000
We had to do CPR. and manual cardiac massage.

658
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,770
Dr. Murphy didn't want to start the lobectomy with...

659
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,350
I'll assist Dr. Murphy.

660
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
You coming or not?

Spread the ribs more with Finochietto Retractor.

678
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,650
Would you really fire Dr. Browne?

679
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,830
If I find evidence she did it, I will.

680
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,720
Shingle the ribs.

681
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,680
But you and Claire are friends.

682
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,760
Professional responsibilities come before friendships.

683
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
It wasn't Dr. Browne.

684
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,790
It was me.

685
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,920
I called the reporter.

686
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,650
Why?

687
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,060
People suffered real tragedies,

688
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,470
and he used their pain to enrich himself.

689
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,620
But

690
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,120
why confess?

691
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,980
You're the kind of person I aspire to be.

692
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,310
So is Dr. Browne.

693
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,490
If you two lost trust in each other,

694
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,180
it would do a lot of damage to this department,

695
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,400
to what makes it so special.

696
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,050
I didn't want to be responsible for that.

697
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,120
Scrub out.

698
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,510
Stapler.

699
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,460
Transecting the bronchial branches.

703
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,770
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

704
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,680
Please tell me

705
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,200
you haven't made the transfer yet.

706
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,090
No. But I'm authorizing it.

707
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,490
Turn your computer on.

708
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,910
Your employee ID is your temp password.

709
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,210
Who knows their employee ID number?

710
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,780
I remotely rebooted every authorized user.

711
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,750
Totally.

712
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,940
100%.

713
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,560
Successfully.

714
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,540
Imaging's unscathed.

715
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,830
No malware. No worm. No nothing.

716
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,480
Bastards were obviously bluffing,

717
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,850
just like I told you.

718
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,060
You gambled your entire imaging department on a hunch?

719
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,530
Do you have any idea how reckless that was?

720
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,400
Thank you.

721
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,950
Appreciate all you've done.

722
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,910
That decision was not yours to make.

723
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,140
If you ever usurp my authority again,

724
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,190
I'm going to fire you right on the spot.

725
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,420
- I'm sorry, but... I - Will you just...

726
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,290
- just saved the whole hospital... - Will you shush for a second?

727
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,100
Wait for the compliment.

728
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,120
Thank you.

729
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,860
Well done.

730
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,680
You're welcome.

731
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,410
If I ever have another poker night, you're invited.

732
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,740
You'll need to take all three of these

733
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,580
every morning and before bedtime.

734
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,810
Call me if you need anything.

735
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,080
Thank you for not giving up on me.

736
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,100
You can't just leave.

737
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,740
I've never been fired before,

738
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,980
but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

739
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,130
I'll talk to Lim.

740
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,480
Convince her to give you a second chance.

741
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,270
I do not think she'll do that.

742
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,540
She was willing to fire you,

743
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,100
- and she likes you a lot more than her. - Shaun...

744
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,430
It's okay.

745
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,690
I've enjoyed working with you both.

746
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,870
Thank you.

747
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,490
if there is anything I can do, don't hesitate to call.

748
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,150
I'll miss you.

749
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,570
But I don't want to hug you.

750
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,930
Surgery went well.

751
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,130
You'll be back to competition in a couple months.

752
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,210
Was it you?

753
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,170
I can't claim credit for that good deed.

754
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,760
Not a terribly convincing denial.

755
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,130
If I cared about convincing you, I'd try harder.

756
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,680
I knew this day would eventually come.

757
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,080
And I expected I'd feel vulnerable,

758
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,680
exposed.

759
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,860
And I do.

760
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,770
But I also didn't expect that, you know, I'd feel

761
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,960
relieved.

762
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,140
It's a little like getting back in the water the first time

763
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,710
without my prosthetic.

764
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,070
I had to awkwardly hop to the water,

765
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,170
people staring at me.

766
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,630
But once I got in, I...

767
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,800
I felt a little bit lighter.

Uncle Marcus, I can't.

00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,980
Not now.

779
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,410
I'm sorry I let you down.

780
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,460
You didn't let me down.

781
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,700
You confused me.

782
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,780
I know you're not the whistleblower.

783
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,800
- It wasn't Dr. Browne. - I know.

784
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,300
It was me.

785
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,550
You?

786
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,030
Why?

787
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,370
Exposing that guy was the right thing to do.

788
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,390
Patient privacy is an important obligation,

789
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,200
but it's not our only one.

790
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,150
I knew there'd be no proof, so no one was gonna get fired.

791
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,930
Never expected Lim to blame Browne.

792
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,610
But I know that's not why you destroyed your whole career here.

793
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,950
How can I help you if you don't...

794
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,800
- I don't want your help. - Livy.

795
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,780
I never wanted to be a doctor.

796
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,500
But every time I tried to tell my parents,

797
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,140
my professors, you,

798
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,290
you'd just push me and encourage me until I backed down.

799
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,160
I knew if I got myself fired,

800
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,340
there was no way that you could pep-talk me back

801
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,300
into a career that I don't want.

I just want to be myself.

But I don't even know who that is.

I know I'm the last person you want to see right now,

824
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,870
so I brought a bribe.

825
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,830
I was wrong to accuse you,

826
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,970
not only because you didn't do it

827
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,180
but because I was holding against you

828
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,570
the very thing that makes you such an awesome doctor.

829
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,370
You care.

830
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,120
When you meet a patient,

831
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,320
you don't just see muscles, bones, and organs.

832
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,810
You see a human being

833
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,890
with all of their strengths and flaws.

834
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,380
And you should never lose that,

835
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,280
even if it does make the job harder.

836
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,460
And most importantly,

837
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,170
you're a good friend.

838
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,000
You got salted caramel in that bag?

839
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,800
