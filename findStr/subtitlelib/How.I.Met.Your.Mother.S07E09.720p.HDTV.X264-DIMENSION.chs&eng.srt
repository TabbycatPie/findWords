00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,460
可你不该把领带摘下来
But you're not supposed to take the tie off.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,000
你跟你的朋友莉莉和马修打赌输了
You lost a bet with your friends Lily and Marshall

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,570
所以你必须一整年都戴着这条领带
which requires you to wear the tie for a full year.

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,070
如果事关救人性命  我想他们会理解的

<i>如果没被人当过反面教材  明令禁止</i>

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,990

"绝对严禁在此趴板"

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,430
那是怎么一回事
What's that all about?

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,030
那是个精彩的故事  你有时间听吗
Oh, that's a great story. You got time for it?

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,870
我该出发去我妈的生日派对了  所以...
Well, I'm supposed to go to my mom's birthday party, so...

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,500

万幸的是  你们有朋友是童子军出身
Luckily, you are friends with a former Boy Scout.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,250
童子军总是什么呢

56
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,550

当艾琳还只是个热带低气压...

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
你就是个头脑发热的抑郁狂

童子军就是牛  不必客气

泰德说得对  我们该去

等你长到我的岁数  我的高度

坐在巴尼家的超屏电视前  喝着小酒
Drinking beer in front of Barney's giant TV

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,320
比坐在车里

93
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,220
听着《艺妓回忆录》好多了
listening to Memoires of a Geisha.

拜托  我们都听到最精彩的部分了

100
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,770
马修  你同意我的观点  对吗
Marshall, you're with me, right?

101
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,440
抱歉  老朋友
Sorry, old friend.

102
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,670
可我冒不起这个险
But I can't afford to tempt fate.

103
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,980
对哦  当时的我有被害妄想症
Oh right, I was being really weird.

104
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,180
我要解释一下
I should explain.

105
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,850
去年夏天我辞去了工作

106
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,580
就在飓风来临的一周前
And then, a week before the hurricane...

107

我的医疗保险过期了
Huh, my medical insurance just expired.

108
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,920
所以在加入你的医保计划前
That gives me two uninsured weeks

109
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,420
我有两周时间是无医保的
before I'm added to your plan.

110
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,490
没什么大不了的
It's no biggie.

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
被纸划了
Ow! Paper cut.

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,530
死亡无处不在
Death is all around us.

113
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,270
所以在接下来的两周

他变成了个粘人的爱伦坡[惊悚推理小说家]

116
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,750
我可以感觉到他用冰冷的手掐住我的喉咙
I feel his icy grip around my throat,

117
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,850
他的猎犬匍匐在我脚下喘着粗气
the breath of his hounds at my heels,

118
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:50,220
他的镰刀无休无止地敲打着我的房门
the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of his scythe on my chamber door.

119
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,190
而你  你随口提出的请求
And you, with your blithe request,

120
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,360
把我狠狠地推向了他的怀抱
you only hasten his inevitable triumph.

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,300
这就是你想要的吗
Is that what you desire?

122
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,670
这就是你想要的吗  莉莉
Is that what you desire, Lily?

123
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,400
我只是想要你去买点百吉饼
I just wanted you to get us some bagels.

124
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,270
百吉饼
Bagels?!

125
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,670
你有没有想过
Do you have any idea

126
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,080
我可能会在买百吉饼时遭遇不测
what could happen to me whilst getting bagels?!

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,650
怎么  不  我不要这样死
What the...?! No, not like this!

128
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,790
好吧  那我去买

记住  别加太多奶油干酪
And remember, not too much cream cheese.

132
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,400
最多加满半张饼
Half a shmear, max.

133
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,500
多谢  宝贝
Thanks, baby.

134
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,840
不不  我不要这样死
No! No! Not like this!

135
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,170
够了  你现在的想法也太扯了
Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,070
人生本来就很扯  莉莉
Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!

137
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,680
人们会被公车碾
People get run over by buses

138
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,710
被滑板击中蛋蛋  被婴儿咬
and hit in the nuts by skateboards, bitten by babies.

139
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,380
没人一醒来就有预感
Nobody wakes up and says,

140
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,350
"今天我要在视频网站上出名"
"Today I'm gonna star in a YouTube video."

141
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,450
你已经说了不下十几遍了
You've said that at least a dozen times.

142
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,120
莉莉  接下来的两周
Lily, for the next two weeks

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,620
你必须寸步不离地保护我
you must be by my side protecting me.

144
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,730
至于吗  能出什么事
Why, what's gonna happen?

145
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,960
答案就是  飓风
Answer: a hurricane.

146
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,000
就让我把领带摘了吧  求你们了

你们能想象那有多糟糕吗

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,340
如果证监会上诉  我们就全完蛋了
If the SEC pursues charges, it's going to be all our asses.

150
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,540
我比任何人还认真地对待这件事
Nobody takes this more seriously than I do.

151
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,410
求你了  我能摘了吗
Please, can I take it off?

152
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,390

163
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,980
喂  阿呆
Hey, Nerdlinger,

164
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,050
瞧你那万事俱备的傻样
what's with the safety boner?

165
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,980
拜托

灾害应急包  汽车  女士雨靴

粉色是为了更容易被救援直升机发现

听着  原谅我为你们瞎操心了
Look, forgive me for caring about you guys,

170
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,760
可你们是我在这世上最好的朋友

171
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,590
我只想确保你们都平安无事

泰德  你真是个大哭丧鬼

这场暴风雨没什么大不了的
this storm is not a big deal.

176

这场暴风雨很严重
This storm is a big deal.

177
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,210
让我们重播艾琳抵达北卡罗来纳州时
Let's replay that harrowing footage

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,140
那段令人痛心的画面吧

我们得马上离开纽约
We gotta get out of here!

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,120
走  快点  快点
Go, go! Come on, come on!

-拜托就让我摘了吧  -不行

-五千  -不行

183
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,100

一万
$10,000?

185

-下手多重都行  -这主意不错
- as hard as you can. - You have my attention.

189
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,810
孩子们  还记得马修和巴尼的耳光赌约吗
Kids, you remember Marshall and Barney's slap bet.

190
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,440
几年前  因为巴尼和马修打赌输了
A few years earlier, Barney lost a bet to Marshall.

191
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,150
他的惩罚是  随时随地可能会被扇耳光
His penalty was five slaps delivered anyplace, anytime.

192
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,250
迄今为止  马修扇了巴尼四个耳光
So far, Marshall had slapped Barney four times.

193
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,290
也就是说还剩最后一个
Which meant he only had one slap left.

194
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,420
你意下如何呀  马修
What do you say, Marshall?

195
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,190
你是要把握住这次"赏光机"
Are you going to seize this slap-ortunity

196
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,430
还是让这次机会从你指缝中流失
or let it slap through your fingers?

197
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,160
别让他得逞  马修
Don't let him tempt you, Marshall.

198
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,900
我不知道  莉莉  我们的宝宝快出生了
I don't know, Lily. I mean we have a baby on the way.

199
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,470
那个多余的耳光迟早能派上用场
An extra slap could really come in handy.

200
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,770
不  不行
No! No!

201
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,970
我怎么能动摇
This is crazy.

202
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,210
这条领带你必须再戴十个月
You having to wear that tie for another ten months

203
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,640
只有这样才能令我满意
is all the satisfaction I need.

204
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,180
再说了  我还有一个耳光没扇呢
Plus, I still have one slap left,

205
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,810
-感觉真好  -可如果你那个耳光也不剩了
- and that feels good. - But if you didn't have that slap left--

206
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,220
假设我今晚怂恿你扇了我
if say, I were to get you to slap me tonight--

207
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,850
我想到时可就大不相同了
I suppose that would change everything.

208
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,520
是的
I suppose it would.

209
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,830
游戏开始
Le jeu commence.

210
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:52,600
嘲笑马修不会说法语

211
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,600
我叫马修
Je m'appelle Marshall.

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
-刚才说到趴板滑行...  -趴板滑行
- So boogie-boarding... - Boogie-boarding.

213
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,470
我想说服他们跟我走
So I was trying to get these guys to leave,

214
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,810
不过有个小问题
but there was one little problem.

215
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go.

216
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,180
我不走
I'm staying.

217
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,510
怎么了  巴尼
What?! Barney?!

218
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,610
到时外面肯定会狂风乱作
Hey, hey, it's going to get pretty crazy out there.

219
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,680
如果哪个辣妹被吹得花枝乱颤衣服全没
And if some hot woman gets all her clothes blown off,

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,950
而我却没有录下来
and I'm not up here to videotape it

221
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,250
传到网上  那谁会代劳  联邦应急管理局吗
and put it up on the Internet, who will, FEMA?

222
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,590
拜托  睁大眼看重点
Come on, open your eyes.

223
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,320
不  不  你跟我们一起走
No, no, you are coming with us.

224
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,260
一个都不能少
We leave no man behind.

225
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,260
妈
Hey, Mom.

226
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,860
对  这双雨靴卖得可火啦
Uh, yeah, the boots were a big hit.

227
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,900
我得先去尿个尿
You know, I better pee.

228
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,100
可等我和莉莉回来的时候  我们都得走
But when Lily and I get back, we're all leaving.

229
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,770
等等  你尿尿我也要陪着吗
Wait, I have to go pee with you?

230
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,240
你想让我一个人去厕所吗
You want me to go to the "bathroom,"

231
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,740
那可是这房子里最危险的房间呀
the most dangerous room in the house by myself?

232
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,010
你有没有想过  我可能会遭遇不测
Do you have any idea what could happen?

233
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,610
我的眼睛
Ow! My eye!

234
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,620
我看不见了
I'm blind!

235
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,520
不  不  我可不想这么死
No, no! Not like this!

236
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,460
我觉得对于这件事发生的可能性
I don't think we're seeing eye to eye

237
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,990
我们的看法不太相同
about the likelihood of that happening.

238
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,330
是我爸
Hey, it's my dad.

239
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,900
我爸打电话给我
My dad's calling me.

240

244
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,610
现在换我做主  我们要立刻撤退
I'm taking charge. We are getting out of here.

245

够了  每个人的父母都打电话来嘱咐
Okay, what is with everybody's parents calling

246
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,880

247
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,020
不过是下了场小雨
It's just a little rain.

248
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,520

251
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,830
什么
What?!

252
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,630
我爸有什么好担心的
Eh... What would my dad be worried about?

253
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,630
担心我没涂够防晒霜吗
That I'm not wearing enough sunblock?

254
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,700
粉刷的好天气
House-painting weather.

255
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,340

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,070
我改变主意了  算我一个  快走吧
I've changed my mind. I'm in. Let's go.

257
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,770
是吗  我也改变主意了  不带你走
Yeah, I changed my mind, too. You can't come.

258
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,370
其他所有人  我们撤
Everybody else, we're moving out.

259
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,510
真够狠的
That's harsh.

260
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,150
知道还有什么够狠的吗  紫外线
You know what else is harsh? Ultraviolet light.

261
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,980
这周我在日光浴床上睡着了
I fell asleep in the tanning bed this week

262
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,250
我觉得我的脸颊都被晒伤了
and I think I got a sunburn on my cheek.

263
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,320
我的肤质太敏感了
It's so sensitive.

264
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,150
这半边脸就像一个红色的大靶心
It's like a big, red bull's-eye.

265
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,860
哎哟喂
Ouchie.

266
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,890
你是不是拿了我包里的腮红
Did you take my blush out of my purse?

267
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,830
话题回到趴板
So, boogie-boarding.

拜托  泰德
Oh, come on, Ted,

270
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,660
你不能就这样把他扔下
you can't just leave him here.

271
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,000
为什么不能
Uh, yeah, I can.

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,270
他说我是个大哭丧鬼
You called me a giant whining bummer.

273
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,740
你不准上我的车
You're not allowed in my car.

274
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,210
你也没法知道艺妓最后有没有找到真爱
You don't get to find out if the geisha finds love.

275
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,940
这是原则问题
This is about principle.

276
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,310
泰德  我准备好了
Hey, Ted. I'm ready to go.

277
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,450
肯定是你唤醒了他的"原则"吧
And you must be "Principle."

278
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,180
另外说一下  各位  这是玛雅
Ah, on a separate note, guys, this is Maya.

279
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,620
我刚在大厅遇到的
I just met her out in the hall.

280
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,420
我们有很多共同点
We have a lot in common,

281
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,390
比如我们都热爱乡村音乐
such as our mutual love of country music,

282
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,420
纳斯卡赛车  杰夫・兹沃西  不许插嘴
NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy. Just go with it.

283
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,420
纳斯卡是美国国家赛车联合会的简称
杰夫・兹沃西是美国喜剧演员

284
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,190
她想搭个便车出城
She needed a ride out of the city,

285
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,230
我们又正好多个座位  所以
and we have an extra seat in the car, so...

286
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,660
好  我们出发吧
Okay, let's hit it!

287
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,560
事情居然演变成这样
Wow, it's come to this.

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,130
你本来可以帮助一个朋友
You could help a friend,

289
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,270
但你却选择了穿紧身吊带的辣妹
but instead, you're choosing the hot girl in the tight tank top.

290
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,210
你出师了
Your training is complete!

291
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,610
我真为你感到骄傲
I'm so proud of this kid!

292
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,940
但话说回来  暴风就要来了
But seriously, the storm's coming in,

293
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,610
甩了这个小妞  咱们快撤吧
so dump the hoochie and wheels up.

294
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,150
但你说好捎上我的
You promised me a seat.

295
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,180
我的上帝啊
Oh, for God's sake.

296
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,750
你俩都去  我留下
You two both go. I'll stay here.

297
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,450
-什么  莉莉  别啊  -副驾归我
- What? Lily, no! - Shotgun!

298
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,620
-不带你  -那莉莉能去了
- You're staying. - Then Lily can come!

299
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,520
-什么  不不不  我就呆这儿  -为什么
- Wha...? No, no, no, I'll stay here. - Why?

300
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,790
因为我想一个人待会儿
I just want some time away from you!

301
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,390
什么
What?

302
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,030
马修  对不起  我爱你
Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you,

303
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,300
但我这个星期一点私人时间都没有
but I haven't had a second alone in weeks!

304
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,070
现在可是暑假呀
It's summer vacation!

305
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,000
我只想坐在浴缸里
All I want to do is sit in the bathtub

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,570
静静地看书  但现在
and read a book, but now...

307
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,780
宝贝  我忘了拿书进来
Baby, I forgot to bring a book.

308
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,650
你不介意大声念给我听吧
Do you mind reading yours out loud?

309
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,380
我也没觉得有多好啊
Hey, it's been no picnic for me either.

310
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,080
你的声音都没有分角色
You don't even do the voices.

311
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,090
匿名电话
Blocked number.

312
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,920
你好
Hello?

313
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,260
RJ吗  我是爸爸
RJ? It's your father.

314
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,090
爸爸
Daddy?

315
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,260
我爱你
I love you.

316
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,400
你的电话对我来说意义重大
It means so much that you called.

317
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,630
我就知道你在等你爸电话
Ha! I knew that you wanted him to call.

318
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,930
被我猜对了吧
Busted!

319
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,300
刚才是你
That was you?

320
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,810
我真觉得你该扇他
I really think you should slap him.

321
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,910
绝对该扇
You should slap him!

322
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,640
-使劲扇  -使劲扇
- Slap him. - Slap him.

323
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,710
两边脸  出手吧
Two cheeks, no waiting.

324
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,480
很好  因为我真的忍不住了
Good, 'cause I really think I'm gonna slap him!

325
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,010
-话说趴板  -继续趴板
- So, boogie-boarding? - Boogie-boarding.

326
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,380
拜托  泰德
Come on, Ted.

327
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,450
你宁可载不认识的妓女
You're gonna give some random floozy a ride,

328
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,590
也不愿意载巴尼
but not take Barney?

329
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,390
妓女
Floozy?!

330
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,560
如果有她  我就不去了
If she's going, I'm not going!

331
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,960
莉莉  你留这儿  我们走
Lily, you're staying. Let's go.

332
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,390
如果莉莉不去  我也不去
If Lily's staying, then I'm staying!

333
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,960
-那我走  -那我也走
- Then I'm going. - Then I'm going.

334
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
你留下  马修  因为我要去
You can't go, Marshall, 'cause I'm going.

335
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,400
-如果巴尼去  我就不去  -那我就能去了
- If Barney's going, I'm not going! - Then I can go.

336
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,930
-那我不去了  -我也不去了
- Then I'm staying. - Then I'm staying.

337
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,900
-那我去  -那我就不去了
- Then I'm going. - Then I'm not going.

338
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,100
你们爱去不去  反正我是要走
Okay, you know what? I'm going.

339
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,540
多普勒雷达连续一周都在报这场暴风雨
This storm's been on Doppler radar for a week.

340
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,640
我是唯一一个为之做准备的人
I'm the only one who prepared for it.

341
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,340
你们还都嘲笑我  所以我决定
And you all made fun of me. So guess what?

342
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,580
童子军要孤身上路了  再见
This Boy Scout is taking a hike. Good-bye!

343
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,880
玛雅  问一句
Maya, real quick,

344
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,380
你觉得咱俩有戏吗
did you think there was anything here, or...

345
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,420
我有男朋友
Oh, I have a boyfriend.

346
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,350
再见
Good-bye!

347
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,560
泰德
Um, Ted...?

348
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,690
疏散时间已经结束
The time for evacuation is over.

349
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,990
在天气情况好转前
Everyone should now go inside and be prepared

350
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,160
大家请留在室内
to stay inside until weather conditions improve,

351
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,830
在周日下午前  请勿外出
which won't likely be until Sunday afternoon.

352
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,270
我们被困住了吗
We're stuck here?

353
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,440
大伙儿别慌
Okay, let's not panic.

354
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,040
你们可以慌了
You know what? Let's panic.

355
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,670
如果我们熬不过今晚
Hey, if we don't make it through the night,

356
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,470
我希望你们知道  我是发自肺腑地后悔
I want you guys to know, and I really mean this...

357
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,040
20多岁时没拓展交际圈  多交几个朋友
I wish I had branched out and made more friends in my 20s.

358
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,310
好了  我要去厕所了
Well, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

359
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,450
只身前往
By myself, I guess.

360
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,720
小心有熊出没哦
Watch out for bears.

361
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,260
既然我们都快完蛋了
Since this might be the end,

362
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
那我就坦白一件事吧
I gotta confess something.

363
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
可以吗
Can I?

364
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,000
如你所愿
Might as well.

365
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,470
其实  我跟巴尼有一腿
Barney and I have been doing the wild thing...

366
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,670
一直在暗中偷情
this whole time.

367
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,070
去年短暂地停过一阵
Except a brief period last year

368
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,970
因为当时他忙着搞马修的妈妈
when he was shacking up with Marshall's mom.

369
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,010
但幸运的是  当时我们有一起玩3P  所以
but luckily, three-ways were on the menu, so...

370
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,750
马修  你知道她根本没说这些  对吧
Marshall, you know she didn't say any of that, right?

371
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,420
我知道  可我就是想狠狠地扇他
I know, but I just want to slap him so bad!

372
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,020
但那条领带看着又那么弱智
But that tie is so stupid!

373
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,720
但那巴掌扇起来又那么爽
But the slap would feel so good!

374
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,590
但他又那么讨厌那条领带
But he hates that tie so much!

375
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,130
也许我能帮你
Perhaps I can help.

376
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,590
马修  你好好想一想
Marshall, ask yourself this question:

377
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,990
为什么是今天
why today?

378
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,470
他在过去的几个星期  都毫无怨言
He hasn't said anything about that tie for weeks,

379
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,870
可突然就在今天
and yet, suddenly today,

380
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,040
他怎么连一秒都忍不住了
he can't wear it another second?

381
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,470
凡事皆有因
No, there's a reason.

382
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,110
你接下来一定有什么重要的事
You've got something coming up.

383
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,840
因为它  你就象待宰的羔羊
Something where you're on display,

384
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,680
无力反抗
vulnerable...

385
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,810
被迫示众
exposed.

386
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,920
这和工作无关
It's not work-related.

387
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,450
对  应该是和感情有关
No, this is relationship stuff.

388
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,160
你想给某人留下好印象
You're trying to impress someone.

389
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,020
在你一开始编的故事里
In the lie you told,

390
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,980
你说有两个暴徒在追杀你
you said you were being chased by two goons.

391
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,890
所以你要见的是两个人
So it's two people.

392
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,730
或许是一对夫妇
A couple, perhaps.

393
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,630
你明天要去见诺拉的父母
You're meeting Nora's parents tomorrow!

394
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,300
猜错了
Wrong!

395
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,500
错上加错  大错特错
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

396
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,710
其实是后天  人家真的很想讨得他们的欢心
It's in two days, and I really want them to like me!

397
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,980
专家就是牛
Oh-ho! Therapisted!

398
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,610
你是心理医生  还是精神病医生
Shrinked? Shrunk?

399
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,810
我们回头再研究吧
We'll figure it out.

400
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,450
那么  说回滑板的事
So, boogie-boarding.

401
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,880
继续趴板的故事
Boogie-boarding.

402
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,420
莉莉  能和你单独说点事吗
Hey, Lily, can I talk to you for just a second?

403
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,590
马修  如果你叫我进来是帮你刷牙的话
Marshall, if I'm in here to brush your teeth,

404
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,190
老娘誓将
I swear to...

405
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,360
抱歉  我这段时间这么黏人
I'm sorry that I've been so needy lately.

406
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,600
我明白你需要时间独处
I know that you need some time alone.

407
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,200
我去其他房间呆着
So... I'll be in the other room.

408
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,300
你哪儿也别想去
You're not going anywhere.

409
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,050
妙就妙在  那晚过后
And the funny thing is, after that night,

410
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,250
我们从此不再孤单
we'll never be alone again.

411
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,680
你们居然在我的浴室播种
You made that in my bathroom?

412
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,150
无心插柳柳成荫
Whoops.

413
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,060
哇  飓风送子
Wow, a hurricane baby.

414
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,260
天啊  小旋风・埃里克森是个好名字
Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would be a sweet name.

415
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,160
是个相当好的名字
It would be a crazy sweet name!

416
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
我谢谢你全家  泰德
Thanks, Ted.

417
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,270
不管怎样  第二天  警报解除后
Anyway, the next day, after the danger had passed...

418
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,670
酒吧不开门
It's closed.

419
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,670
现在我们干嘛
Now what?

420
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,810
童子军总是做足准备
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

421
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,580
真棒
Nice!

422
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,580
为平安度过飓风而干杯
To surviving the hurricane.

423
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,250
-我爱你们大家  -我们也爱你
- I love you guys. - Love you.

424
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,750
我终于在几天后  如愿去一趟韦斯切斯特的家
I did finally make it up here to the house later that week

425
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,750
却发现客厅里躺着
only to find that a falling oak tree had

426
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,590
一棵连根拔起的橡树
landed in the living room.

427
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,290
如果当时我们在那里
If we'd been here,

428
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,960
一定会被大树砸得稀巴烂
it would have crushed us like bugs.

429
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,350
所以孩子们  你永远没法确定
You see, kids, there's no way of knowing for sure

430
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,900
什么地方最安全
where the safest place is...

431
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,970
所以你只能期望  能有三两好友陪在身旁
so the best you can hope for is to have some good company.

432
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,170
各位  你们说我用这个趴板能滑出多远
Guys, how far do you think I can boogie-board on this thing?

433
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,670
心有多远  就滑多远
So far!

434
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,010
马修  新的医疗保险明天才开始啊
Marshall, your insurance doesn't kick in till tomorrow.

435
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,170
你们知道吗
Yeah, well, you know what?

436
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,740
人要活在当下
Life kicks in right now.

437
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,790
别担心  他第一次
Don't worry, he wasn't hurt...

438
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,660
伤得不重  我有急救夹板
the first time. I have splints!

439
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,990
不过第二次  他直接穿破了麦凯伦的前窗
The second time he went through the front window of Maclaren's.

440
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,360
这就是"不准在此趴板"标牌的由来
Hence the "No Boogie-boarding" sign.

441
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,400
好了  各位  我得走了
All right, guys, I gotta go.

442
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,900
巴尼  祝你拜见岳父母顺利
Barney, good luck with Nora's parents.

443
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,200
-拜拜  -拜拜
- Bye. - Bye.

444
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,370
回见
See you later.

445
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,040
回见
See you.

446
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
巴尼
Hey, Barney?

447
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,740
我们在你家浴室
Listen, um, we made a baby

448
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,340
造人成功
in your bathroom.

449
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,910
所以我们欠你一份情
So we owe you one.

450
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,150
我们决定
So we say...

451
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,980
你可以取下你的小鸭领带了
you can take off the ducky tie.

452
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,620
代价是  三个耳光
For three slaps.

453
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,520
三个耳光吗
Three slaps?

454
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,990
先说好  是在马修还剩一耳光的基础上
And to be clear, this would add three slaps

455
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,930
再加三耳光
to Marshall's existing one,

456
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,930
所以总计是  四个耳光
giving him four slaps in total.

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,600
成交
Deal.

458
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,230
我解放了
I'm free!

459
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,940
天啊  感觉如此美好
God, this feels so good!

460
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,040
我觉得我错了
This was a mistake!

461
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,010
我还是乖乖戴着领带吧
I wanna put the tie back on!

462
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,080
快把领带还给我
I wanna put the tie back on!

463
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,010
我干嘛选在这时候恢复本色呢
Why do I have to be Barney right now?

464
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,250
还有三个耳光
Three slaps remaining!

465
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,680
还有三个  我真喜欢那清脆的声音
Three slaps. Wow, I like the sound of that.

466
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,620
我要把剩下这三个耳光攒着
I think I'll save those bad boys,

467
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,150
以备不爽之需
you know, for a rainy day.

468
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,860
很好  苦难已经结束了
Okay. The worst is over.

469
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,290
还剩两个耳光
Two slaps remaining!

470
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,160
没事了
It's all right.

471
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,130
都结束了
Hey, it's all done...

472
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
下次接着扇
for now.

473
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
我觉得我要回家
I think I need to go home

474
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,540
重新审视我的决策能力
and reevaluate how I make life decisions.

475
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,440
来吧  我也要回去工作了
Come on. I have to go back to work.

476
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,580
-我们一起搭计程车吧  -好的
- Let's split a cab. - Okay.

477
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,780
你和他们说过
Did you ever tell those guys

478
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,090
另外那件差点发生的事吗
about that other thing that almost happened?

479
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,530
另外的那件事
That other thing?

480
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,490
你说那件事啊  我没说  你呢
Oh, that. No. Did you?

481
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,590
我也没说
No.

482
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,860
我很抱歉打了那个电话
Hey, I'm really sorry about that phone call.

483
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,970
没关系
Oh, it's fine.

484
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,270
不  怎么会没关系呢  我真是混蛋
No, it is so not fine. I was a jerk.

485
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,000
如果你不介意的话  我想说
And if you don't mind my saying,

486
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,940
你爸居然不打给你  他就是个彻头彻尾的蠢蛋
your dad is a complete idiot for not calling.

487
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,180
他应该每天都打电话给你
He should never let a day go by without calling you

488
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,380
因为我要是一整天没和你说上话
because when I let a day go by without talking to you...

489
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,020
那一天  都黯淡无光
Um, that day's just no good.

490
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,860
抱歉
Um, sorry.

491
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,130
是我爸
It's my dad.

492
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,830
等一下  把手拿出来
Wait, show me your hands.

493
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,170
绝对不是我
My hands.

494
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,970
你好啊老爸
Hey, Dad!

495
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,100
我就说嘛
That's what I've been saying!

496
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,110
高尔夫球天
Golf weather!

497
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,270
你能相信我们差点就
Can you believe we almost...?

498
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,810
我知道
I know.

499
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,010
幸好我们没做下去
Good thing we didn't.

500
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,150
在那不久以后
Yeah. I mean, not long after that

501
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,350
你就和诺拉在一起了
you got together with Nora.

502
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,680
你也遇到了凯文
And you met Kevin.

503
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,780
我们也算"死里逃生"
Yeah. Disaster averted.

504
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,050
没错
Exactly.

505
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,020
要是我们真的做了  一切就毁
It would've ruined everything if we'd been all...

506
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,790
喇  喇  喇  喇  喇
ah-la-la-la...

507
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,260
对啊  太傻了
I know, right? So dumb...

508
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,120
喇  喇  喇  喇  喇
ah-la-la-la...

509
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,970
喇舌[终于>_<]
La-la-la-la...
