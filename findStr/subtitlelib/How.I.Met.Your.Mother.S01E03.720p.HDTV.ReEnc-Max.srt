12
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:15,335
OLDER TED: So there was this one night,
before I met your mother,

13
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,292
when I really wanted to go to the bar.

14
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:19,726
The bar. Big surprise.

15
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,876
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.

16
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,864
Well, that's just what we did back then.

17
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,830
<i>Me, Marshall and Lily, Barney, Robin.</i>

18
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:31,687
<i>We all used to hang out
at this one bar called MacLaren's.</i>

19
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,034
<i>But then one night...</i>

20
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,471
- Why don't we go to MacLaren's?
- Let's go to MacLaren's.

21
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,099
You guys taIking to each other?

22
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,696
- Nobody's listening?
- What's wrong with MacLaren's?

23
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,448
MacLaren's is bore snore.
Ted, tonight we're gonna go out.

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,514
We're gonna meet some ladies,
it's gonna be legendary. Phone-five!

25
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,618
<i>OLDER TED: I had no idea
why I hung out with Barney.</i>

26
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:57,978
You didn't phone-five, did you?
I know when you don't phone-five, Ted.

27
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,799
Come on. We always go to MacLaren's.

28
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,787
Yeah, 'cause MacLaren's is fun.

29
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,032
MacLaren's is this much fun.

30
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:09,072
What I'm offering
is the chance to have this much fun.

31
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,733
See, you say that.
You say it's gonna be this much fun,

32
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,651
but most of the time,
it ends up being this much fun.

33
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:17,440
This much fun is good. It's safe.
It's guaranteed.

34
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,941
This hand-gesture thing
doesn't really work on the phone, does it?

35
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,958
No, it doesn't.

36
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,173
Get in the cab. Marshall, you, too.

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,258
I wish I could.
I think Lily and I are just gonna...

38
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,983
- I understand. Get in the cab.
- Why can Marshall say no?

39
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,202
Because he's getting laid.

40
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,501
Consistently.

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,620
Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here.

42
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,408
You keep going to the same bar.
You're in a rut.

43
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:41,903
And I am a rut-buster.
I'm going to bust your rut.

44
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:45,527
It's not a rut, okay?
It's a routine and I like it.

45
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:49,298
Ted, what's the first syllable in 'rut-tine'?

46
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:58,446
Peace out, suckers!

47
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,231
All right, so what's this legendary plan?

48
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,059
First, we gotta pick someone up
at the airport.

49
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:07,503
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Estaban, doors!

50
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,709
Okay, we just do this one little thing
and the rest of the night is ours.

51
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:16,274
Why do you have those suitcases
and who are we picking up?

52
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:19,191
I don't know. Maybe her. Or her.

53
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:23,520
Wait. So, when you said you were
going to pick someone up at the airport,

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,784
you meant you were going to
pick someone up at the airport?

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,971
Scenario.

56
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,273
Couple of girls fly into town
looking for a fun weekend in NYC...

57
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,126
when they meet two handsome
international businessmen...

58
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:38,429
just back from a lucrative trip to Japan.

59
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,737
Sample dialog. You have a wheelie bag?

60
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,757
Why, I have a wheelie bag.

61
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,841
- You've got to be kidding me.
- False.

62
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:47,470
Sidebar. Tuck in your shirt.
You look sketchy.

63
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,061
- I'm sketchy?
- Trust me, it's gonna be legendary.

64
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,472
Don't say legendary, okay?

65
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:55,102
You're too liberal with the word legendary.

66
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:58,403
We're building an igloo in Central Park.
It's gonna be legendary.

67
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,421
Snowsuit up!

68
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,592
Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here!

69
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:05,040
This is happening.

70
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:06,804
Now, you can either put the bags
on the carousel now...

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,727
or you can listen to me
give you a really long speech...

72
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:13,479
convincing you to put the bags
on the carousel. Your move.

73
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,137
Ted, since the dawn of time,
mankind has struggled...

74
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:21,264
<i>That night,
Marshall had a ton of studying to do.</i>

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,610
<i>So, Lily went out with Robin...</i>

76
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:25,175
<i>who was new to New York
and looking for a friend.</i>

77
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,124
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out,

78
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,598
- just the two of us.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:30,778
And you sure you're okay
giving up your Friday night...

80
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:32,959
to hang with an old, almost-married lady?

81
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,299
Oh, please.
I'm so sick of the meat-market scene.

82
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,774
Guys are like the subway.

83
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,088
You miss one,
another one comes along in five minutes.

84
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:44,248
Unless it's the end of the night,
and then you get on anything.

85
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,594
Compliments of that guy.

86
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,469
Really? Sweet.

87
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,488
Oh. For you it's $6.

88
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:56,049
I guess that's one drawback
to being engaged.

89
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,709
- I'm sure that's why he did it.
- Hey.

90
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,727
Oh, hello.

91
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:08,158
So, did you just get in from Detroit?

92
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,964
Japan.

93
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,475
Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready?

94
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:23,476
'Cause I'm about to drop some knowledge.
Cute girls are not from Buffalo.

95
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,494
Time out. Ten o'clock.

96
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,228
You ready to rock this, Tedder?

97
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,408
All right, I think we need to refine
our back-story first.

98
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:33,424
- How did we...
- Ted! You klutzy, great guy you!

99
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,301
Hey. Barney.

100
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,033
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

101
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,213
- I am so sorry.
- It's fine, no.

102
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:43,579
You were a little shaky on your landing.
I'd give you a 9.2.

103
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:44,829
Hi, I'm Ted.

104
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,362
Laura. Look, I'm really sorry
that we have to hit and run,

105
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,613
but we've got a plane to catch.

106
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,473
- Oh, where are you headed?
- Philadelphia.

107
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,326
- Philly? That's where we're headed.
- You are?

108
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:59,072
- Well, then, we'll see you on the plane.
- Yes, you will.

109
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,015
- Follow them. Tickets on me.
- No. Barney!

110
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,725
Don't you get on that escalator!

111
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:09,002
And don't you dare
get on that subsequent escalator!

112
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:32,504
(CELL PHONE RINGING)...

113
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,823
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,862
Hey, guess where I am? I'm on a... Ready?
Plane to... Ready? Philadelphia.

115
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,427
- That is awesome.
- Hey, is that Marshall?

116
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,774
Marshall, stop whatever you're doing,

117
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,243
get in that hoopty-ass Fiero of yours
and come meet us in Philly.

118
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,589
It's gonna be legendary!

119
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,481
Man, I wish I could, guys...

120
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:57,804
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sent you
some pictures on my phone. Check it.

121
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,707
Philly!

122
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,953
Admit it, you're having fun.

123
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:08,351
This much... 35,000 feet of fun.

124
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,083
Well, I didn't think
I'd be flying to Philadelphia...

125
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,846
when I woke up this morning,
I'll give you that.

126
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,059
Attaboy. Now let's go taIk to those girls.

127
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:15,854
Wait, wait. The seat-belt sign's on.

128
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,862
Ted, you've been living your whole life
in a seat belt.

129
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,880
It's time to unclick.

130
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:28,636
- Sir, seat-belt light's on.
- Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

131
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,276
Well, I grew up in Park Slope.

132
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:34,002
Oh, I love Park Slope.
When did you move to Manhattan?

133
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,201
- You're from Park Slope?
- No, she is.

134
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,677
So, where are you from? Heaven?

135
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,375
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

136
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:45,065
I died 15 years ago, like that pick-up line.

137
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,782
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, believe me, I've been there.

138
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:52,790
I have this line that I use
when guys come up... Check it out.

139
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,808
Hey.

140
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,050
You take this one,
I'll save it for the next one.

141
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:03,402
- So, what brings you guys to Philly?
- We're visiting our boyfriends.

142
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:06,513
I think Chris is gonna propose
this weekend.

143
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,531
Isn't that great?

144
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,967
So great.

145
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,612
<i>So, there we were,</i>

146
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,235
<i>stuck on an airplane to Philadelphia
with two very un-single girls.</i>

147
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,126
<i>All thanks to your Uncle Barney.</i>

148
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,601
Aren't they cute?

149
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:27,224
- They're both linebackers for the Eagles.
- Both!

150
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,669
Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.

151
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,058
You're going to Philly? Why?

152
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,643
I didn't ask.

153
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,851
Well, it sounds like
you're having a lot more fun than I am.

154
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,961
I'm just taIking to guys' backs
while they hit on Robin.

155
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,558
Well, yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.

156
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,514
Don't you bet I get that a lot?

157
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,797
Not with a ring on your finger.

158
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:53,932
I mean, you know, guys see the ring,
it's, like, Marshall parking only.

159
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,497
Oh, of course. That's it. The ring.

160
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,068
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

161
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,826
Oh, it's totally the ring.
If you took that ring off your finger...

162
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,294
you'd have a ton of guys
crowding your junk.

163
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,250
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

164
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:09,162
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys
swarming all over my beeswax?

165
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:12,272
Oh, yeah. You know me,
I'm the jealous type.

166
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,317
Any goon so much as looks at you,
I'll sock him in the kisser!

167
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,658
No, seriously,
you girls have a good time tonight.

168
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:18,876
Bye.

169
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:21,014
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)</i>

170
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,692
Robin! Robin!

171
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,353
Hey, I'm over here.

172
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,815
Going to Philly!

173
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,837
Marshall, don't come to Philly.

174
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,569
But we're on an adventure.

175
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,397
We're on a tarmac in Philadelphia.

176
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:41,414
Crazy adventure.

177
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:44,140
Fine.

178
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:47,697
No. No. The night has just started.

179
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:50,490
Look, airport bar. Flight attendants.

180
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,023
They'll get your tray table
in its full, upright position.

181
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,229
- Say what?
- Passengers Mosby and Stinson?

182
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,800
Please come with us, gentlemen.

183
00:08:57,896 --> 00:09:01,551
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Barney, I am going to kill you.

184
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:04,597
Don't say you're gonna kill someone
in front of airport security.

185
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,615
Not cool. Not cool.

186
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,299
This is an outrage.

187
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,292
We are international businessmen...

188
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,825
on a very important
international business trip.

189
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,198
I demand you release us immediately.

190
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,923
You demand?
No, no, no, no, he does not demand.

191
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,430
We have no demands.

192
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,707
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to remain calm.

193
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,854
Okay, I'm calm. I'm totally calm.

194
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,831
We've got footage of you placing two bags
on JFK carousel three,

195
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:34,158
and abandoning them
to purchase a last-minute flight with cash.

196
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,660
- Those bags were your responsibility.
- They were your bags.

197
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,231
Sir, please.

198
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,104
We're assessing the bag situation.

199
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,647
(BEEPING)

200
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:46,855
Look. This is all just...
It's a misunderstanding.

201
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,873
Please.

202
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:51,633
We are international businessmen.

203
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:54,293
My colleague
accidentally left the bags there.

204
00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,188
Now, please let us go before we miss
our international business meeting.

205
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:02,854
Can't remember the last time
I saw an international businessman...

206
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,872
with an untucked shirt.

207
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:10,958
In addition, we received this footage,
taken over the last few months.

208
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:38,691
Believe it or not,
that duffle bag thing worked.

209
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,618
The truth is, my friend, he does this thing...

210
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:44,022
where he goes to airports
with fake luggage to pick up girls.

211
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,946
And we followed some here to Philadelphia.

212
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,492
That's it. That's all this is.

213
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,755
Nobody's that lame.

214
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,608
Yes, he's that lame.
Tell him you're that lame.

215
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:59,347
- We are international businessmen...
- Oh, come on!

216
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,522
Sir! Lower your voice or I will restrain you.

217
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,597
Dude, seriously, relax.

218
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:08,838
- We at least get to call our lawyer.
- Exactly.

219
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,856
We have a lawyer?

220
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,327
Listen to me.
You're both American citizens.

221
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,501
Don't let them pull any Patriot-Act voodoo.
You both retain the right...

222
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,874
to refuse to answer any questions
without an attorney present.

223
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,957
So don't say anything
until I get there, all right?

224
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:22,975
Okay, goodbye.

225
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,702
Oh, it's ridiculous in here.
Why don't we go somewhere else?

226
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,505
No. This place is great.

227
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,687
- What are you doing?
- What?

228
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,233
With your lips and everything?

229
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:47,845
My lips are always like this.

230
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,507
You had to play the race card.

231
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:02,277
Relax, Ted, we didn't do anything wrong.

232
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:06,861
And, BTW, we'd be out of here by now
if you'd have tucked in your shirt.

233
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:09,523
Go ahead, JFK.
What is the baggage status?

234
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,921
They're clean.
It's just a whole bunch of condoms.

235
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,938
And a PowerBar.

236
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,049
You're free to go.

00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,392
<i>TED: Don't come to Philly.</i>

238
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,764
- Man, I'm almost halfway there.
- Yeah, we just got released...

239
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,175
and we're heading back on the next flight.

240
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,355
Meet us at MacLaren's.
Maybe we can still make last call.

241
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:30,747
- Can't we just...
- No, we can't 'just,' we're going home.

242
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:33,313
- We're going to Sascha's.
- Who the hell is Sascha?

243
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,788
Sascha.

244
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,673
She's having friends over for drinks
at her house.

245
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,366
It's gonna be legend... Wait for it,

246
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:41,874

247

is 'dairy.'

248
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,105
- No!
- Legendary!

249
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,471
- Legendary? That sounds awesome!
- No, Marshall, we're going back.

250
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,723
Fine.

251
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,903
Hold on, I have another call.

252
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,307
- Hello?
- Marshall, we're going to Sascha's.

253
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,942
No, we're not.

254
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,224
Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here. Yes, we are.

255
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:02,727
Sorry, buddy. Two against one.

256
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,785
- Look, a booth opened up.
- Really?

257
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,639
Yeah, I thought we could finally go taIk
and you're not listening to me,

258
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:13,410
- so I'm gonna waIk away.
- Yeah, yeah, booth.

259
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,031
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:23,137
I'm engaged. You know, I'm sorry.
I took my ring off.

261
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,247
It's very, very sweet of you
to come over and taIk to me, but I just...

Yeah, I'm gay.

263

that you sat on a grape.

- Is she taIking to some hot guy?

You can tell me. It's totally cool.
It was my idea.

280

Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.

kind of weird, but if you're cool with it...

- No! Don't interrupt. It's awesome.

Wow, it must be
really well cordoned-off over there.

and touch it?

00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:03,733
with my regular friends in my regular city.

344
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,750
Ted, Ted, Ted.

345
00:18:06,138 --> 00:18:09,055
- You're not even looking.
- No, I'm not.

346
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:13,351
Look, our forefathers died
for the pursuit of happiness. Okay?

347
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:16,366
Not for
the sit-around-and-wait of happiness.

348
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,860
Now, if you want, you can go to
the same bar, drink the same beer,

349
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:24,509
taIk to the same people every day.
Or you can lick the Liberty Bell.

350
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:29,343
You can grab life by the crack
and lick the crap out of it.

351
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,010
That was beautiful, man.

352
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,474
Thanks, Leonard.

353
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,040
Ted, you're missing out
on a valuable life lesson here.

354
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:41,631
Look, I don't need you to teach me
how to live, okay? I know how to live.

355
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,580
If you wanna go lick the Liberty Bell,
just go lick it yourself.

356
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,882
- No. It has to be the two of us.
- Why? Why do you need me?

357
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:50,832
Because you're my best friend, all right?

358
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:55,385
You don't have to tell me I'm yours.
But the way I see it, we're a team.

359
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:59,613
<i>Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno.</i>

360
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,989
So, fine.

361
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:06,185
If you wanna go home, then we'll go home.

362
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,881
(SIGHING)

363
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:13,365
Fine. We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.

364
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,652
Good, 'cause we're here.

365
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,656
<i>I had no idea how Barney redirected
the cab without me knowing,</i>

366
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:21,644
<i>but we got out, Dana let us in,</i>

367
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,433
<i>and by God, we licked the Liberty Bell.</i>

368
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,960
- And you know what it tastes like?
- What?

369
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,365
Freedom.

370
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,962
No, actually it tastes like pennies.

371
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,911
Oh, my God. Did you guys really do that?

372
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,419
<i>OLDER TED: We really did.</i>

373
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:40,368
<i>And that was when I realized
why I hung out with Barney.</i>

374
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:46,508
<i>I never got where I thought I wanted to go,
but I always got a great story.</i>

375
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:51,013
So, that girl you were taIking to,
that was Mom?

376
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,577
Kids, every story in a
man's life is like a dot...

377
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:56,335
- in an impressionist painting, and when...
- So that's a no?

378
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,353
Yeah, that's a no.

379
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,629
What? Come on.
