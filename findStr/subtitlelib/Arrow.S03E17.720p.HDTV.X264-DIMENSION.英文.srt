7
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,480
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
When I'm with you,

9
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,310
I don't think about the mission, or...

10
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,220
I trust your judgment.

11
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,690
In fact, I depend on it.

12
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,210
They're designated Task Force X.

13
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,450
This ain't no task force. Let's call it like it is--

14
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,210
a suicide squad.

15
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,530
The choice has been made.

16
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,810
I'm not accepting it.

17
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,470
- There will be consequences. - Was that a threat?

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,700
You tell everyone who will listen

19
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,270
what you've seen.

20
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,280
We're late.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,530
It's 12:45.

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,490
The invitation said 1:00. I'm early.

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,820
And I'm never early.

24
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,750
Yeah, well, the ceremony's at 1:00.

25
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,510
Photos were at noon.

26
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,700
Photos.

27
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,290
Last time Lyla and I got married,

28
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,430
we said our vows on an ATV

29
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,190
in the Registan desert.

30
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,490
This time, she hired a photographer,

31
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,510
so, yes, Oliver, photos.

32
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,090
That whole "Best man" thing, it's more like a "Not so good"--

33
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,050
No, that's all right, we'll photoshop you in, brother.

34
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,950
All right.

35
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,380
Thanks for coming.

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,940
See you brought your plus-one.

37
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,660
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,370
Nice to meet you. Ray Palmer.

39
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,280
John Diggle. You hurt her,

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,820
they'll never find your body.

41
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,450
Nice to meet you.

42
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,670
Pardon me.

43
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,440
Funny, five months since we last saw each other,

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,900
now it's twice in as many weeks.

45
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,980
Ah, it's good to see you, Ray.

46
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,670
Good to see you, too.

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,070
Ohh, that was Lyla.

48
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,880
A friend of hers, Rick, was supposed to be our officiant,

49
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,510
but he just got deployed to the South Sudan.

50
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,020
- What, you don't have a minister? - No.

51
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,160
Okay, what about one of those online ministry certificates?

52
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,580
All I need is good Wifi and three minutes.

53
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,640
Not that I'd officiate your wedding.

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,510
Although I would be honored if you asked me to.

55
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,060
Or, ah...you could just ask me.

56
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm a minister.

57
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,920
It's a long story.

58
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,510
Normally this is the part where the officiant

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,130
offers words of insight about the couple,

60
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,820
their history.

61
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,030
Which is a little difficult for me

62
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,350
because I just met John and Lyla about eight minutes ago.

63
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,940
And I understand that you have written your own vows,

64
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,230
which is great, because that gives me less to do.

65
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,680
You really want to do this?

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,630
Hell yes. Do you?

67
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,870
Even more than the first time.

68
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,550
Good. Because I'm not letting you get away from me this time.

69
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,950
- I'm holding you to that. - Good.

70
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,590
I love you, Lyla.

71
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,930
I love you, too.

72
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,270
All right. John Diggle, Lyla Michaels,

73
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,300
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

74
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,990
Beautiful ceremony.

75
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,150
- Beautiful dress. - Thank you.

76
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,160
Did it come with the cast?

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,540
I... started fighting with a new trainer.

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,380
She's enthusiastic.

79
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,720
- She? - She's a friend.

80
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,220
Today's not about that.

81
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,960
Hey, Laurel.

82
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,780
Hi.

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,270
Nice bouquet.

84
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,250
Ahh, yes. I kind of... caught it.

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,810
Well done.

86
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,640
Thank you.

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,950
Oh, I hope it's ok I brought Ray as my date.

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,520
Ray saved the day.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,600
For the record, I am not the one who used that phrase.

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,220
He's a good guy, and he clearly cares about you, a lot.

91
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,510
Are you happy?

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,510
Yes. Very.

93
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,020
Good. That's all I've ever wanted.

94
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,390
You deserve a good guy and a normal life.

97
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,860
Oliver.

99
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,620
There were eight victims total,

100
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,510
all shot with arrows. However, one escaped

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,450
and has given us a statement.

102
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,820
Which remains uncorroborated,

103
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,100
so the District Attorney's office

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,550
is going to continue to investigate

105
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,130
before filing the charges.

106
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,020
So which one is it; is the Arrow being

107
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,450
implicated here or not?

108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,600
We're not sure of anything yet.

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,460
We have a statement from Mr. Palmer.

111
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,110
While it's hard to ignore

112
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,070
all the good the Arrow has done for the city,

113
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,970
it is equally hard to ignore the evidence of his apparent guilt.

114
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,830
In any case, the Arrow needs to be apprehended,

115
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,390
and at least brought to trial, not justice.

116
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,420
I didn't know he was going to do that.

117
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,490
And I am devoting all of my substantial resources

118
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,590
towards making certain the Arrow is apprehended.

119
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,500
You have to meet with Lance and tell him it wasn't you.

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,230
Word doesn't carry a lot of weight with him right now.

121
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,510
So, bring in the culprit. Figure out who's doing this and why.

122
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,620
Well, we know who's doing this. The League of Assassins.

123
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,920
So this is how Ra's Al Ghul handles rejection, huh?

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,040
No, I think the point is that he doesn't.

125
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,410
He's trying to turn the city against me;

126
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,660
make the offer to take his place more appealing.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,900
Hit the streets. Whoever's doing this is targeting criminals.

128
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,930
We need to know who they're going to hit next.

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,640
We need all the information

130
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,870
that the police have from the crime scene.

131
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,910
Whoever is under that hood has to leave a trail,

132
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,790
something to follow.

133
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,770
How can we help?

134
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,980
Go to Starling City Airport.

135
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,490
Ok, to do what?

136
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,680
It's called a honeymoon.

137
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,880
- Fiji can wait. - No.

138
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,100
Fiji can't wait.

139
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,550
All right? This is still your day,

140
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,210
and I'm not going to let Ra's Al Ghul ruin that.

141
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,650
- Oliver... - You followed me into the lion's den once already.

142
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,570
This time, choose your family.

143
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,470
Go, live.

144
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,860
We got this.

145
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,340
If it doesn't feel right for you to go, we won't.

146
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,520
No, Oliver was right.

147
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,940
It's our turn.

148
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,090
Besides, Felicity and Roy have his back.

149
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,360
Mazel tov, newlyweds.

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,220
Lawton.

151
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,540
What are you doing here?

152
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,420
Hey, when duty calls, we answer, right?

153
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,870
Suicide squad rides again.

154
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,680
Sorry to interfere with your wedding night.

155
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,730
Yeah, I doubt that.

156
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,050
Five hours ago, there was a terrorist attack

157
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,130
in the Republic of Kaznia.

158
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,410
Hospital was supposed to serve

159
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,920
and unite Kaznia's dissident ethnic faction.

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,220
- Wait, is that... - Senator Joseph Cray.

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,350
This hospital was something of a pet project for him.

162
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,730
Of course, he insisted on being at the ceremony.

163
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,420
Agent Michaels, you'll lead task force X on the extraction;

164
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,770
I'll have a plane ready for you in 30 minutes.

165
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm sorry, Johnny.

166
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,700
You go on to Fiji, and I will meet you there

167
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,240
in 48 hours, tops.

168
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,990
No, you won't, because I'm not letting you out of my sight.

169
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,500
You remember what I told you about not letting go?

170
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,090
I meant that.

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,650
Waller.

172
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,540
Count me in.

173
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,280
You have the two of us, Deadshot, who else is on the team?

174
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,940
Who else indeed.

175
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,510
I've always wanted to see the world.

176
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,040
I hear Kaznia's beautiful this time of year.

177
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,180
Anything?

178
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm accessing traffic cameras, ATM cameras,

179
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,130
phone cameras; I'm hacked into 911

180
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,120
and squad car chatter.

181
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,740
- And? - No sign of evil Arrow.

182
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,390
Los Halcones are unloading a huge shipment of narcotics.

183
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,040
The entire gang is going to show up for protection.

184
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,340
This is exactly the kind of thing that fake Arrow would go after.

185
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,090
We really need a better name for him.

186
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,400
When is this happening?

187
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,770
- Right now. I'll suit up. - Roy...

188
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,820
This is the League.

189
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,840
I've got it.

191
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,260
So did you hire a florist?

192
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,420
Yes, we did.

193
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,150
Didn't that cost a fortune?

194
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,090
At my wedding, I'll have the bridesmaids

195
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,480
make the flower arrangements

196
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,940
and I'll spend the extra money on the dress.

197
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,470
- Anything? - No, clear.

198
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,950
You seeing anybody, Cutter?

199
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,140
Of course I am.

200
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,470
The Arrow. And our special day is going to be

201
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,850
the most glorious day.

202
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,300
And then afterwards, we'll make strong,

203
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,330
beautiful babies.

204
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,820
And does he know this?

205
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,890
Listen, I got news for you, stalker--

206
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't get to do what we do and have a family.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,570
Yeah, well, I have a wife

208
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,160
right here and a child to say otherwise.

209
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,200
Let's hold up here.

210
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,790
Yeah, well, let's hope you make it home to her.

211
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,890
But love, children, family--

212
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,500
it's all just a distraction for people like us.

213
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,540
They make us better,

214
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,370
and give us something worth fighting for.

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,230
Love is a bullet in the brain,

216
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,070
and if you believe any different,

217
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,520
you're as crazy as she is.

218
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,220
All right.

219
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,870
Latest satellite flyover reveals warm bodies here.

220
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah, that's pretty solid. Fortified.

221
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,010
How are we going to get everyone out?

222
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,540
Our orders are to retrieve Cray.

223
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,500
No one else.

224
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,840
What about the hostages?

225
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,180
They're not U.S. Citizens.

226
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,030
Are those your words or Waller's, Lyla?

227
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,980
Let's not fight, Johnny.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,350
It's our honeymoon.

229
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,660
See what I mean, John?

230
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,740
I'm not you, Lawton.

231
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,830
Yeah.

232
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,440
I wasn't always me, either.

233
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,130
Just leave the package at the door.

234
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,480
Ma'am, I, uh, I think you're going to want to sign for these.

235
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,040
Oh, my God! Floyd!

236
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,050
Why didn't you tell me you were coming home?

237
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,090
I'm a mess!

238
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,060
No. No, you're perfect.

239
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,970
Mommy, who is he?

240
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,570
Zoey, baby, this--

241
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,550
This is your daddy, remember?

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,140
I told you about him.

243
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,340
He was far away, fighting the bad guys.

244
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,740
Now he's home.

245
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,860
Hiya, Zoey.

246
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,480
You know, your daddy missed you every second of every day.

247
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,270
She just... needs some time.

248
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,830
I got him. Satellite footage of a man,

249
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,770
green outfit, green hood, on the roof near the warehouse.

250
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,620
You have to hurry.

251
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,710
You can't kill them all, Oliver.

252
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,790
Where one falls,

253
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,260
two more arise.

254
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,720
Maseo...

255
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,340
You can't believe in this!

256
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,060
Murdering all of these people just to prove a point!

257
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,850
No. To persuade you.

258
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,570
My master sees something in you.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,650
Don't fight it.

260
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,050
Embrace it!

261
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,150
You know me better than that.

262
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,320
Don't let your recalcitrants take any more lives.

270
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,980
Ok, I had no idea

271
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,120
the sheer number of crazies that were in this city

272
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,960
until you set up that 1-800 line for Arrow tips.

273
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,690
What's going on?

274
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,550
Ray?

275
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,150
Oliver queen is the Arrow.

276
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,770
What?

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,350
I have a 140 IQ

278
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,950
and three Ph.Ds,

279
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
it's pretty hard to insult my intelligence,

280
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,570
but I think you just did.

281
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,470
It all makes sense now.

282
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,920
I mean, your, uh, sudden disappearances,

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,330
your apprehension with helping me on the mission;

284
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,480
You've been working with the Arrow this whole time.

285
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,060
How did you find out?

286
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,620
High spectrum portable radiograph,

287
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,570
colloquially known as the X-ray machine.

288
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,720
Plus, your facial recognition software.

289
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,700
Nice code, by the way.

290
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,430
Hey, you got the suit working.

291
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,190
Last night, I saw your friend Oliver

292
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,520
standing over eight of his victims.

293
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,800
Because he was investigating.

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,730
He's trying to catch an impersonator,

295
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,440
the one who's really doing this.

296
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,520
Please, you have to trust me.

297
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,390
Oliver's not a killer.

298
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,420
This isn't the first time he's been

299
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,140
judge, jury and executioner.

300
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,270
He hasn't killed anyone in nearly two years.

301
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,160
That really is not your best argument.

302
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,080
You have no idea what he's been through!

303
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,890
What he's lost,

304
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,970
how he's grown,

305
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,580
but I do. I know him better than almost...

306
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,980
anyone.

307
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,650
Oliver didn't do this.

308
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,330
You have feelings for him.

309
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,650
Yes. I mean...

310
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,230
No. No!

311
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,340
I did.

312
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,280
But that's...

313
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,390
that's over now.

314
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,220
And, what?

315
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,940
Now I'm supposed to trust you?

316
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,630
From the moment we met,

317
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,530
I've held nothing back from you.

318
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,750
I did trust you.

319
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,080
And I thought that you were someone

320
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,040
who could be a true partner;

321
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,980
that you were someone that I could rely on

322
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,200
in the mission, and in my life.

323
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,030
I wanted that, too, Ray, I still do.

324
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,770
Ray!

325
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,240
What are you going to do?

326
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm going to honor the promise I made to this city

327
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,050
and help them bring the Arrow to justice.

328
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,270
North entrance clear.

329
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,190
Nice work, Deadshot.

330
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,460
We're en route. Move to the X.

331
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,590
Copy that.

332
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,560
Here you go, sweetie.

333
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Eat it.

334
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,570
You don't want to eat it?

335
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,250
There's something wrong with it?

336
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,400
What, it's not as good as mom makes, I guess?

337
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,840
Use your words!

338
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,370
Baby! What's going on?

339
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,620
Nothing, I'm fine.

340
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,350
No, you're not fine.

341
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,210
You're not sleeping, you barely eat.

342
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,640
You can't hold a job, you can't socialize.

343
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,620
You won't talk to me.

344
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,610
We're talkin' right now.

345
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,110
So tell me, what do you want to talk about?

346
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,710
I want to know what happened to my husband!

347
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,570
You need to tell your story.

348
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,050
There are people who can help you.

349
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,620
People who know what it's like to come back from war.

350
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,310
You don't understand. You don't understand.

351
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,130
Nobody understands, do you hear me?!

352
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,320
So make them understand.

353
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,100
Oh, make them understand.

354
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,220
Like this?

355
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,580
You want to make them understand like that?

356
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,990
How about like this?!

357
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,160
Do you want to know what happened to your husband?

358
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,010
Let me tell ya-- he pulled triggers.

359
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,960
And every time he did, someone died!

360
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,240
Ok, every single time.

361
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,960
Lawton...

362
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,170
Stop it.

363
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,590
Please.

364
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,980
Get away from us!

365
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,340
Yes, this is an emergency.

366
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,430
It's my husband. He has a gun.

367
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,290
Find anything on those arrows?

368
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,390
This one is ours. This one is theirs.

369
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,110
I don't see a difference.

370
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,840
Yeah, precisely. They're identical.

371
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,390
He knows.

372
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,010
God, he knows.

373
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,990
Last year, Ray's fiancee

374
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,450
was killed by Mirakuru men.

375
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,450
And now he wants to protect the city,

376
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,700
so he built a suit out of military-grade technology

377
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,750
and he wants to put you in jail,

378
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,850
so he used my software to track you down,

379
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,480
and he scanned you with his X-rays

380
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,880
and now he knows that you're the Arrow

381
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,180
and he's going to tell the cops.

382
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,410
Palmer knows I'm the Arrow?

383
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,530
And he has his own mission to protect the city?

384
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,710
When were you going to tell me this?!

385
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,490
I have been getting a lot of that today.

386
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,890
Look, it's not important. Here's what is--

387
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,660
he's going to tell the police who you are!

388
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,880
Wait, Ray built a super suit?

389
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,390
That's kind of awesome.

390
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,460
And reckless.

391
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,630
Look, he's probably on his way to the precinct right now.

392
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,670
What are we going to do?

393
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,600
The radiography technology is infallible.

395
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,020
These are screenshots of the output with timestamps.

396
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,970
That's a very bold claim, Mr. Palmer.

397
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,790
Especially since we've already been down that road

398
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,990
two years ago when Oliver Queen was exonerated.

399
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,530
'Cause he's smart. See,

400
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,980
I believe he allowed himself to be accused

401
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,010
so as to be ruled out as a suspect in the future.

402
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,990
And your proof is...

403
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,780
X-ray vision?

404
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,740
Digital images can be fabricated,

405
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,540
and I can't go to a judge with any of that.

406
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,900
What about my statement?

407
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,060
You mean your uncorroborated testimony?

408
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,410
You're protecting him.

409
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,640
Of course. Because you and Oliver are old friends.

410
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,570
You hurt yourself signing depositions?

411
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,400
At the gym, actually.

412
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,350
Right, you were training with that

413
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,370
Wildcat Grant, right?

414
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,390
The one who also used to be a vigilante.

415
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,650
You and oliver Queen used to be a couple, right?

416
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,320
How is it you both ended up wearing masks?

417
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,700
A word of free legal advice, Mr. Palmer...

418
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,460
if you go to anyone else, particularly the media,

419
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,790
with these unsubstantiated allegations,

420
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,530
Mr. Queen would have the basis for a slam dunk defamation suit

421
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,980
that would leave you bankrupt.

422
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,890
Who knows, he might even get his company back.

423
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,490
Yeah, you're right.

424
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,940
Court system isn't going to be able to help me here.

425
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,140
Guess I'll just have to seek out justice on my own.

426
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,760
Don't worry.

427
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,840
I'm a United States senator.

428
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,980
Everything's going to be all right.

429
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,240
Get down, get down, down, down, down, now!

430
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,660
We're here for you, senator, but we need to move fast.

431
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,010
All right, everybody, just... stay where you are, keep calm.

432
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,820
We'll explain everything once we're in the air.

433
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,620
What-- no! No! This...

434
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,780
It's all wrong.

435
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,300
They weren't supposed to send anybody.

436
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,500
That was the whole point.

437
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,200
You shouldn't have come here.

438
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,550
You shouldn't have come here.

439
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,640
We've got a gun, we got a gun, go, go, go, go!

440
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,660
My hero!

441
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,630
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back!

442
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,550
What the hell was that lunatic thinking?

443
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,690
Secure these doors. It's not a lot of tables.

444
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,570
Take off that shirt.

445
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,050
The bullet was a through and through, I ain't going to die.

446
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,130
Pays to be sure.

447
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,970
That's not a request, soldier.

448
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,090
You still going to patch me up?

449
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,920
Baby, does it hurt bad?

450
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,720
You were so brave.

451
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,530
Ok, I take it back--

452
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,810
I think I do want to die.

453
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,980
Mockingbird, this is Harbinger

454
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,930
on emergency frequency Delta Charlie.

455
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,590
Task Force X is broadcasting in the blind, over.

456
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,120
Damn it! It's not going through.

457
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,430
I think our signal's being jammed.

458
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,150
Harbinger, this is Senator Cray.

459
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,290
Well, I imagine you must all be feeling,

460
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,390
a little bit confused right about now.

461
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,800
This is a hostage situation. A terrorist attack!

462
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,830
Well, actually, they're not terrorists, they're mercenaries.

463
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,070
They work for me.

464
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,320
Why would you do that?

465
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,300
Because I love my country,

466
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,060
And my country loves a hero.

467
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,330
So this was all theater?

468
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,990
So you could, what, run for president?

469
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,240
There it is. The big picture.

470
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,010
Can you imagine what my poll numbers will be

471
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,360
once I heroically diffuse this tragic situation?

472
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,510
Everybody here was supposed to go home alive.

473
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
That was the whole point.

474
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,410
But now, unfortunately,

475
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,310
you have turned my hostages into witnesses,

476
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,790
And I can't have that.

477
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,970
I'm going to kill you slow, you son of a bitch.

478
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,750
You're outgunned and outnumbered.

479
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,410
But if it's any consolation,

480
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
I am going to nominate the four of you

481
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,900
for the Medal of Honor once I'm president.

482
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,710
You'll be remembered as heroes.

483
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,050
Okay.

484
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,870
Arrow.

485
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,950
Super Suit.

486
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,610
I prefer "The Atom."

487
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,610
You know, I have to admit,

488
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,190
I was a little surprised to find you

489
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,310
on my calendar this morning. Find the place all right?

490
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,400
Laurel Lance called me.

491
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,850
Yeah, the Black Canary.

492
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,150
She tried to shut me up, but it's not going to work.

493
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,630
I didn't kill those people.

494
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,540
Yeah, that's what Felicity said.

495
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,560
An impersonator, right?

496
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,060
I hate when that happens.

497
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,240
Five years on a deserted island.

498
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,770
That kind of thing changes you,

499
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,770
doesn't it?

500
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,420
Must have been difficult,

501
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,400
if not impossible to hold on to your sanity all those years.

502
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,750
And now here you are,

503
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,760
pretending you have everything in control.

504
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,780
Felicity told you the truth.

505
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,330
And you should trust her judgment.

506
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,680
How can I do that?

507
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,080
Her perception of you is clearly clouded

508
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,730
by her emotional attachment.

509
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,650
She's not seeing you for what you really are.

510
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,680
You have no idea what this city is up against.

511
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,250
Actually, I think I do,

512
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,290
And I'm going to stop him.

513
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,810
It's clear.

514
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,300
Reinforcements just arrived.

515
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,120
I see them. Wait.

516
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,180
- Oh, God. - What, what, what, what?!

517
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,010
Thermal strikes. Here, here, here, and here.

518
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,830
They've rigged the hospital with explosive charges.

519
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,360
Killing all our hostages.

520
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,860
With Cray as the lone survivor.

521
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,120
Why did we come here?

522
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,320
We accepted the mission, Lyla. We did what soldiers do.

523
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,490
Except we're not just soldiers, Johnny.

524
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,640
We're parents.

525
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,110
I know parents who won't even fly together

526
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,870
because they don't want to risk orphaning their child.

527
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,510
What were we thinking?

528
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,320
Oh, God.

529
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,130
Our baby girl.

530
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,900
Lawton was right.

531
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,280
Can you please say that again?

532
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,170
Sorry, I, I didn't quite hear you the first time.

533
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,420
The Greddians have rigged the hospital to blow.

534
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,720
We're not going to make it.

535
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,080
Yeah. Yes, we are.

536
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,180
We're going to get these hostages out.

537
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,590
And you and John are going

538
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,340
to make it home to your daughter again.

539
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,070
You got it?

540
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,100
Yeah.

541
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,650
Oh, the things I want to do to you right now.

542
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,140
Floyd Lawton.

543
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,960
Who's asking?

544
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,620
Wasn't a question, merely an acknowledgment.

545
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,670
We've posted your bail.

546
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,990
- We?  - An organization in need of your very particular talent.

547
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,260
Talent?

548
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,870
Killin' people, you mean.

549
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,070
And we will pay handsomely for the use of those skills.

550
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,910
Again with the "We."

551
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,050
Who are you?

552
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,440
Merely a drone.

553
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,460
A piece of a larger entity.

554
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,020
We exist as one organism.

555
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,810
As you might say, a hive.

556
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,670
Well, listen up, honey bee. I'm done shootin'.

557
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,360
I left that life on the battlefield to come home,

558
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,440
be with my family.

559
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,980
I imagine the restraining order your wife filed against you

560
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,590
impedes that plan somewhat.

561
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,430
You'll never be allowed near her or your daughter again.

562
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,210
You have left the battlefield.

563
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,580
But the battlefield never leaves you.

564
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,350
People like you don't get to have a love.

565
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,230
Children, families.

566
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,330
These are just distractions to people like you.

567
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,010
For people like you,

568
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,260
Love is a bullet in the brain.

569
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,220
Who's my target?

570
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,130
His name is Andrew Diggle.

571
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,800
How'd it go with Ray?

572
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,920
Not well. Yeah, your new boyfriend is stubborn.

573
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,890
Once he's made his mind up, that's the end of it.

574
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,640
Sound like anybody we know?

575
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,580
Not only is he untrained, he's unstable.

576
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,290
- Unstable? - Yeah, yes, he's unstable,

577
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,030
Felicity, because he's flying around

578
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,190
in a weapon looking for a man that has already killed 8 people!

579
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,780
He's going to be next.

580
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,410
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

581
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
Excuse me?

582
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,930
You never wanted me to be with him.

583
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,460
- Now, that's not true. - Yes, it is.

584
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,930
All that talk about wanting me to be happy was just talk.

585
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,510
No, I meant what I said,

586
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,230
right up to  the point where I found out that he is just like me.

587
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,520
You deserve better.

588
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,900
What I deserve,

589
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,370
is to be with someone who isn't afraid of being happy.

590
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,460
Ray told me he wanted a true partner,

591
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,630
in his work, in his mission, and in his life.

592
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,940
Ray wants to be a hero and a human being.

593
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,950
Yes, 'cause he hasn't realized yet that he can't be.

594
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,800
I told you that I couldn't be with you

595
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,680
and save the city.

596
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,380
Neither can ray.

597
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,530
He's just too new at this to know that.

598
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,490
What's that?

599
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,060
911 call, suspected gang activity.

600
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,360
At Meltzer power plant.

601
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,160
This could be Maseo's next target.

602
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,140
Call Roy. Tell him to suit up and meet me at the power plant.

603
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,900
There's no one here.

604
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,570
That must be disappointing.

605
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm sorry there's no one around here for you to kill,

606
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,890
But I kind of faked that 911 call.

607
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,380
Palmer.

608
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,280
I'd say you have the right to remain silent, but I'm not a cop.

609
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,460
It's over.

610
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,060
That's it. Nice and easy.

611
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,930
The man you think I am,

612
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,850
He'd kill you here and now.

613
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,360
I told you to back off,

614
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,810
And you didn't listen!

615
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,410
So kill me, go ahead.

616
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,100
Show Felicity the kind of man you really are.

617
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,140
I have nothing to prove to her.

618
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,280
But you do.

619
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,500
She chose you.

620
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,310
So trust her.

621
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,240
I am,

622
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,640
I am truly sorry.

623
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,710
Everything was supposed to work out differently.

624
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,540
Cover the door!

625
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,710
Stop! Or I flip this switch

626
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,470
and I blow us all right to hell right now!

627
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,900
You're bluffing!

628
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,090
You die right along with us.

629
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,850
I want to be President for my legacy.

630
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,970
Dying a hero is as good a consolation prize as any.

631
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,840
The Suicide Squad.

632
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,170
Well, you are true to your name

633
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,470
if you think that the three of you

634
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,450
can just shoot your way in here...

635
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,690
Wait.

636
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,080
There were four of you.

637
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,130
John, 7 o'clock!

638
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,100
You've been a very, very bad boy.

639
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,020
Go, go, go, everybody go, go, go!

640
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,800
Go, go, go, go!

641
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,900
Go, move it, move it, move it, move it!

642
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,880
Move, move!

643
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,340
Come on, let's go!

644
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
Quickly!

645
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,660
Floyd, what about you, baby, how are you getting out?

646
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,840
I'm not.

647
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,310
Lawton, what are you talking about? That wasn't part of the plan!

648
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,500
You said you could find your way down.

649
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,320
Yeah, I lied.

650
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,560
Someone needs to cover your escape.

651
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,020
Me up here is what gets you out down here alive.

652
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,110
Why?

653
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,680
You and your new wife,

654
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,740
you just get back to your baby girl, all right, John?

655
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,370
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

656
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,580
Move, move!

657
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,810
Go, go, go, go, move it, move, move!

658
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,900
Go, come on, go, go, go, go!

659
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,050
-Go, go, go! - Go!

660
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,420
Come on, Floyd.

661
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,440
No! No!

663
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,250
How are you?

664
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,730
My ego's bruised, and...

665
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,880
my arm, and my back, and my rotator cuff.

666
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,850
I'm so sorry about...

667
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,580
all of this.

668
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,920
Well, actually, I...

669
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,140
think I'm the one who owes you an apology.

670
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,800
You told me Oliver was innocent,

671
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,420
and I didn't trust you.

672
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,050
I want you to know that I do.

673
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,740
About what you said earlier...

674
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,130
about wanting a true partner.

675
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,990
Is that offer still good?

676
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,300
Yeah.

677
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,180
Once I make an offer--

678
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,590
The greddian separatists were led by Floyd Lawton,

679
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,300
a former sniper for the United States' Army.

680
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,740
Lawton was discharged five years ago,

681
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,620
and since then has been linked to numerous terrorist organizations.

682
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,700
Lawton died as a result

683
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,830
of an explosion intended for a group of hostages,

684
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,860
including Senator Joseph Cray. But Cray managed--

685
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,790
He paid the hostages for their silence.

686
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,570
Yeah, well, the dollar goes a long way in Kaznia, right?

687
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,510
I tried to set the record straight.

688
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,860
Waller blocked me.

689
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,540
Johnny.

690
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,900
There's something else.

691
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,240
Yes, there is.

692
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,860
I'm leaving Team Arrow.

693
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,590
- What?! - Lawton was right.

694
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,200
I can't keep living like this.

695
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,540
It only works until it doesn't, and...

696
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,050
then what?

697
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,130
I can't do that to Sara.

698
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,970
And what about this city?

699
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,570
The work you and Oliver do,

700
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,900
it's good work.

701
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,100
Not like what I've been doing for far too long.

702
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,130
Which is why...

703
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,270
I resigned.

704
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,830
Lyla! No, you love your job,

705
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,830
and you're damn good at it.

706
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,690
No, if what happened with Cray can be allowed to stand,

707
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,160
I don't want to be good at it.

708
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,980
What I want is to set a good example

709
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,090
for our daughter.

710
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,360
I want her to be proud of me.

711
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,640
Lyla...

712
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm proud of you.

713
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,220
I'm proud of you, Lyla.

714
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,640
Nothing's ever going to change that.

715
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,310
Where are you off to?

716
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,790
Ray has a meeting with the Mayor.

717
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,770
Seems he's had a change of heart about the Arrow.

718
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,720
- Thanks. - For what?

719
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,320
For proving me right.

720
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,800
What'd I miss?

721
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,960
Ohh, not much.

722
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,070
I'm glad you're back.

723
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,210
So am I.

724
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,480
Turns out Lyla and I are not very good at vacations.

725
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,500
Republic of Kaznia, huh?

726
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,020
And Floyd Lawton?

727
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,310
Yeah.

728
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,230
You were right, Oliver.

729
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,230
Doing what we do,

730
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,690
having loved ones at home...

731
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,600
it's complicated.

732
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,440
Well, the things that matter always are.

733
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,090
To Floyd Lawton.

734
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,800
Prochnost.

735
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,650
Any luck finding your imposter?

736
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,210
Still out there.

737
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,150
Oliver, we have to stop this guy

738
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,020
before he puts arrows in any more criminals.

739
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,610
Or... before he starts putting them

740
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,800
in innocent people.

742
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,470
I have it on very good authority that he's being framed.

743
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,240
Hold on a second, Ray. Now you're

744
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,090
telling me you think the Arrow is innocent?

745
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,230
Of these murders, yes. I believe he's being framed.

746
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,770
We need to address the media right away.

747
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,700
Tell 'em what, some rich genius just changed his mind?

748
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,860
Captain, I think you're letting your personal feelings

749
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,770
towards the Arrow cloud your judgments.

750
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,830
Maybe I'm seeing things more

751
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,210
clearly than I have for the last few years.

752
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,320
Enough, both of you! I am tired of listening--
