1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,980
I think, realistically, for 2019 and 2020,

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,580
I'd be surprised if Mercedes' dominance
didn't continue.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,540
Those are the guys
who are always at the top.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,820
[Claire Williams] <i>It's very difficult</i>

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>for teams that don't have the budget
the bigger teams do.</i>

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,480
How can a team like ours
really necessarily compete?

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,380
[Christian Horner] <i>Mercedes are
our biggest competitor.</i>

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,776
They're the team
that are doing the winning at the moment,

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,900
so they're the team that we want to beat.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,920
Formula 1 racing
is very much like war planning.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,820
<i>We set our targets,
develop the power unit,</i>

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,620
<i>and then deploy it on the field.</i>

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,700
We are confident
about what we are able to achieve,

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,740
but we must not let one bit of complacency
creep in.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,540
I need many fellow warriors on my journey.

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,260
We win and we lose together.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,860
Just take it one by one.

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,800
Let's crush them.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,820
My name is Toto Wolff
and I am the team principal

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,140
of the Mercedes Petronas
Formula 1 team.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,460
<i>I was an entrepreneur my whole life.</i>

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,096
- Hi, mate.
- I'm having these guys all over me

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,216
- like you guys.
- [Daniel Ricciardo laughs]

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
[Toto Wolff] <i>In business,
you can always find excuses.</i>

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,340
<i>You can twist the story in your favor.</i>

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,556
- [Ricciardo] See you.
- See you.

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,740
<i>But in motor racing,
the absolute truth of the stopwatch</i>

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,300
<i>will tell you whether you've done
a good enough job or not.</i>

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,020
<i>I like the honesty about it.</i>

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
[beeps]

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,160
[engineer 1] <i>Can you make it
back to the pits?</i>

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,900
[Wolff] <i>Back in the day, this was a team
that was not winning races.</i>

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,320
[bleep]

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,156
[engineer 2] <i>Out of the race.</i>

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>Stop. Stop. Stop.</i>

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,500
In the summer of 2012,
Niki Lauda was asked to join the board

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,100
and to help steer the team
into a more successful trajectory.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,940
At the same time, Daimler approached me,

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,620
whether I was interested
in leading the team.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,560
And this was an offer
that I couldn't turn down.

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,420
<i>Niki was one of the greatest
racing drivers that have existed.</i>

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,060
<i>He has become a world champion</i>

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,800
and then almost died
in a race car accident.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,580
Half his body burned.

45
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,980
Overcoming his own pain, coming back,
winning a world championship

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,340
<i>made him very strong.</i>

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,100
[Niki Lauda] <i>Winning is one thing,
but out of losing, I always learned more.</i>

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,800
Because you don't waste time
blaming somebody else.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,960
Analyze yourself,
change yourself to be successful.

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,500
[William Buxton] <i>Niki Lauda's role in the
success of Mercedes cannot be overstated</i>

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,220
because Niki had the ability
to make things happen.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
Even though he'd stopped racing,
he was such a racer.

53
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,380
<i>Niki was a key element
in convincing me to join the team.</i>

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,300
If it wasn't for Niki
picking up the phone and calling him...

55
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,060
Lewis, I don't think,
would ever have considered moving.

56
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,020
<i>That's Niki. That's his power.</i>

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,300
[reporter] <i>We are here
for the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix.</i>

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,220
All the talk in the paddock right now
revolves around Lewis Hamilton

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,620
and his move to Mercedes.

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,520
In 2013, the tide changed
and we started to become more competitive.

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,100
<i>We were a regular challenger
for race wins and podiums.</i>

[crowd cheering]

63
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,620
Just wanna say a big thank you
to my fans.

64
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Hey!

65
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,880
- You happy, right?
- Absolutely.

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,940
Having had success, been a world champion,

67
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,220
he understands what it's like
to have the pressure in that car.

68
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,700
<i>He is one of the power units

Good morning.

<i>As you can imagine, this is, uh,
very difficult.</i>

80
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,780
Um, very difficult for the team,
for all of us.

[indistinct chatter]

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,980
Uh, I keep looking at the pictures...

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,100
and, um...

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,680
find myself with tears in the eyes
every half an hour...

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,500
because he's not there anymore.

86
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,620
<i>That is somebody that is so dearly missed
in this team,</i>

87

the heart and soul of Formula 1.</i>

[Hamilton] <i>I miss having
conversations with him.</i>

90
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,100
<i>I got to visit Niki.</i>

91
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>We spoke a lot. We were sending videos
to each other when he was in hospital.</i>

92
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,860
I was just trying to send him
positive messages,

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,080
just to keep his spirits up.

94
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,580
He would send me back messages
on his high and his low days.

95
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,340
[Hamilton] <i>We're gonna
lose this race, Bono.</i>

96
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,460
<i>I can't keep the car behind.</i>

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,820
He was with us in spirit, still is.

Niki. Unbelievable job, congratulations.</i>

100
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,860
[Hamilton] That was definitely for Niki.

101
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,420
<i>I really was fighting
with the spirit of Niki.</i>

102

104

I know he'll be, uh, looking down
and I know he'll take his hat off today.

105
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,360
So, I was just trying to stay focused
and trying to make him proud.

Niki's loss will have hurt Mercedes.

And with this kind of a gut punch, yeah,
the question will be asked

110
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,160

this season.

I'm the one-eyed
amongst the blind here, no?

120

[Guenther Steiner] You're the most
important one, though, so...

121
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
you can be late.

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,320
[chuckles]

123
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,260
So arrogant.

124
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,916
Be a bit more intelligent today
than normal.

125
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,740
- What?
- Be more intelligent today.

126
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm always intelligent.
You don't get the humor.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,540
[in German] You can speak German.

128
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,900
I know that you're married
to an English woman,

129
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,500
but you can speak German to me.

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,580
[Wolff] But you have less oxygen
up in the mountains.

131
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,720
[Steiner] Yes, but then, when we come
down, we are the best runners.

You're really stupid

You've been here a thousand times.

138

The only one not is Toto,
so that proves a point.

140
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,780
[journalist] Toto, if I could start
with you, please.

141
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,540
You're celebrating 125 years
in motorsport.

142
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,460
What would it mean to win this race,

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,420
given that you also have
the title sponsorship?

144
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
We're having a dedicated livery,

145
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,260
we're wearing
a different team kit tomorrow

146
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,320
and lots of activities are on the track.

147
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
But on the other side,

148
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,860
it's 25 points that are as many points
as on any other given circuit

149
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,040
and we just need to add
another good race performance

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,720

everything seems all right.

154

That'll do for now.
That'll do for the next 20 minutes.

155

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,460
<i>And I try to provide a framework</i>

167
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,220
<i>for these individuals
to perform at their best.</i>

168
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,216
[technician] What was your other question?

169
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,820
The other question
was in terms of the upgrade package.

170
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,780
[Hamilton] Even though
we're relatively fast,

171
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,520
the front end is really, really weak...

172
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,100
[Wolff] <i>I think the best Formula 1 drivers
have some common traits.</i>

173
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,500
<i>Talent, nurture...</i>

174
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,620
<i>and adversity...</i>

175
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,540
<i>and overcoming the adversity,</i>

176
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,660
<i>and this is the single most important
ingredient I have seen.</i>

177
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,260
[Hamilton]<i> I remember how hard
my parents worked.</i>

178
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,460
They sacrificed everything they have,

179
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
so when I get in the car, I...

180
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,980
<i>I don't want to squander
what they worked for.</i>

181
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,860
Right, any questions?

182
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,280
Drivers okay?

183
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,460
All right, thanks, everyone.

184
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,800
[Wolff] <i>We have the challenge
of managing two drivers within the team.</i>

185

186

<i>with five world championship titles.</i>

187
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,920
<i>Valtteri is
an extremely talented, uh, racing driver.</i>

188
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,920
<i>He's performing on a very high level.</i>

189
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,980
[Valtteri Bottas] <i>To be in the same team
with Lewis,</i>

190
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,440
to be honest,
sometimes it's a pain in the ass,

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,060
because he's pretty quick. [chuckles]
You know, he's tough to beat.

192
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,500
It was a very conscious decision
to take Valtteri on board.

193
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,840
[Bottas] <i>There was many
difficult things to accept</i>

194
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,820
<i>in terms of in which kind of role
I had to be in the team,</i>

195
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
<i>in more like a supportive role.</i>

196
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,820
<i>But it's difficult.</i>

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,980
<i>The only thing I want to do as a driver
is win the race.</i>

198
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,140
<i>When Lewis beats me...</i>

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,000
<i>it's like turning a knife in me.</i>

200
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,580
People can think whatever they want.

201
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm here to win.

[presenter] There are lots
of Lewis fans here, of course.

218
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
He doesn't feel well.

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,920
Can you enlighten us?

220
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,940
Is it dehydration, or what is it?

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,180
Yeah, he's really not feeling well.

222
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,980
There is a virus
making the rounds in the paddock,

223
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,220

224
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
[in English] <i>It's not like man flu,

225

<i>I said to him
that if he doesn't feel well,</i>

226
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,780
<i>he can easily skip the briefings

227

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,540
Shit, it's too hot in here.

229
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,640

[Buxton] <i>Qualifying sets the grid
for Sunday,</i>

235
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,580
so any driver being ill
is an issue for a team,

236
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,660
but especially
when it's your lead driver

237
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,180
<i>and the guy gunning

238
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,740
<i>Obviously, they've got Valtteri

239
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,780
but going into your 200th Grand Prix,
your 125th anniversary,

240
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,900
<i>you want your lead driver there,
fighting fit and leading your charge.</i>

241
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,380
[Bono] Lewis, how you getting on?
Relatively speaking.

242
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
[Hamilton] <i>Yeah, it's...</i>

243
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,540
[Hamilton breathing heavily]

244
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,500
<i>Qualifying's a fast-paced
hundred-meter sprint.</i>

245

High-intensity, high focused,
highly charged.

246

<i>It's all about being calm, composed
and centered,</i>

247
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,880
<i>but I'm getting in the car,</i>

248
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800

329
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,480
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [indistinct chatter in German]

330
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,580
[Wolff]<i> Formula 1 is a hostile environment
that will judge you every single day</i>

331
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,180
<i>and that gives it
a huge intensity and pressure.</i>

332
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,660
<i>And on the free evenings,</i>

333
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,300
<i>you want to leave the hostilities
of the paddock behind.</i>

334
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,500
<i>Most of the evenings,
it was Niki and myself.</i>

335
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,660
<i>We would always travel together.</i>

336
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,640
<i>I lost a friend when he died.</i>

337
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,660
Niki was particular, you know,
when you get in the car.

338
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,980
I guess we are the same.

339
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,500
All that needs to be
in the central position.

340
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,700
Twenty-two degrees.

341
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,180
All these little things in the middle,
then Niki was happy.

342
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,836
<i>Being able to have a dinner together,</i>

343
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,300
<i>which we had every single day
on the racetrack,</i>

344
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,300
<i>is a safe environment that I miss.</i>

345
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,740
<i>I think about our friendship
every single day.</i>

346
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,700
<i>I miss having an ally,</i>

347
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,860
<i>having a sparring partner, a spokesperson
in the paddock.</i>

348
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,620
<i>Since Niki's not around anymore,
it feels different.</i>

349
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,940
I miss him so much.

350
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,980
[Ted Kravitz] <i>Yes! Wet race!
I've been waiting all year for this.</i>

351
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,200
<i>This is fantastic.</i>

352
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
[crowd cheering]

353
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,260
They always say rain is the big equalizer
in Formula 1,

354
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,660
<i>because your equipment
doesn't matter so much anymore.</i>

355
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,380
It's all down to feel.

356
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,540
And where you can find the grip
around the track.

357
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,620
[Wolff] <i>When the weather changes,</i>

358
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,640
<i>it is what makes motor racing excited</i>

359
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,680
because it gives it a certain sense
of vulnerability.

360
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
It's not always the quickest car
and quickest driver wins the race.

361
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
[tools drilling]

362
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,160
[Horner] A bit of patience
in this weather.

363
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,320
[Verstappen] Yeah, and...

364
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,980
good communication.

365
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,740
[Horner] Absolutely.
Just keep us informed.

366
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,176
- You see more than we do on the pit wall.
- [Verstappen] Yeah.

367
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
- [Horner] Dutch weather!
- [Verstappen] Yeah.

368
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,180
[Horner] <i>I have a feeling that if we
can put a bit of pressure on Mercedes,</i>

369
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,220
I think that they could be exposed.

370
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,160
That makes the dynamic,
you know, quite interesting.

371
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,056
[Horner] I hope that we get
an exciting race.

372
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,040
I'd love to see Verstappen and Hamilton
have a good fight.

373
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,660
- Good race.
- That's a good one, yeah.

374
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,020
[Wolff] <i>This is a sport
that is so intense.</i>

375
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,660
<i>It is about delivering 21 times
every single year</i>

376
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,620
<i>against the best competitors.</i>

377
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
We are only as good as our last race.

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,580
[Hamilton] <i>The biggest challenge
for a racing driver</i>

379
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,360
<i>is punching out results
weekend after weekend.</i>

380
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,760
Not making mistakes.

381
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,300
[Bono] Lewis, in terms of the radar,
we think it's gonna be more of the same.

382
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,380
So, light rain
for the next 30 to 60 minutes.

383
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,360
My approach is always one race at a time
because you don't know what's ahead,

384
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,780
so you just focus on what's
in front of you in the present.

385
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,180
[engineer] <i>One minute.</i>

386
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,940
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

387
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,080
[engines revving]

388
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,080
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton gets away
pretty well, but Verstappen is struggling.</i>

389
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,240
[tires screeching]

390
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,780
[Hamilton] It's still slippery
as hell, man.

391
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,160
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, there's a spin.
It's Sergio Perez.</i>

392
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,420
[Sergio Perez] Sorry, guys.

393
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,720
[commentator 1] <i>Huge amount of spray.
This is really testing.</i>

394
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,860
[Bono] <i>Lewis, Valtteri is the car behind
and a gap to Verstappen.</i>

395
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,820
[commentator 2]<i> Verstappen
in his pursuit now of Bottas.</i>

396
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,420
[indistinct commotion]

397
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,700
[engineer] <i>Just be patient, Max.</i>

398
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,720
[Bono] <i>Lewis, let us know
if you think it's ready for dry tires.</i>

399
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,276
[Hamilton]<i> Because you're doing
200 miles an hour,</i>

400
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,200
it's really hard to see
if the track is dry or wet.

401
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,700
I'm okay for now.

402
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,556
These tires are knackered, though.

403
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,800
You go to turn six, it's raining heavily,
you go to turn two, it's dry.

404
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
[Bono] <i>And we have rain in the pit lane.</i>

405
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,420
[commentator 2] <i>Oh! That is Carlos Sainz.</i>

406
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,660
It's still raining.

407
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,700
[commentator 1]
<i>Here's Verstappen losing it.</i>

408
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
[Verstappen] Fuck's sake!

409
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,720
[commentator 1]
<i>Oh! And Leclerc's gone off!</i>

410
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,600
[Charles Leclerc] Fuck!

411
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,840
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton is the
race leader, cruising out in front.</i>

412
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,200
[Bono] <i>Looks good now.</i>

413
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,060
<i>Valtteri six seconds behind,
Verstappen 7.2.</i>

414
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,156
[Hamilton] Box, I lost the frickin' wing.

415
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
[Bono] <i>Yeah, coming in.</i>

416
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,660
[Hamilton] How bad is the damage
to the car?

417
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,060
[Bono] <i>Uh, we need to have a look.</i>

418
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,820
<i>Lewis coming in. He needs a front wing.</i>

419
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,720
[man 1] No, it's Lewis here.
Drive through.

420
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Seventy-six.

421
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,440
[Hamilton] You need to hurry up. I'm here.

422
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,040
[man 1] Don't put these tires on, guy.
Front wing off, please.

423
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,200
[man 2] Seventy-six.

424
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,920
[man 3] Set 16 for Lewis, set 16.

425
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,336
- [man 1] Lift it up.
- [man 2] Wing change.

426
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,520
[Hamilton] Come on, let's go.

427
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,260
Average pit-stop length in Formula 1
is about two seconds.

428
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,100
[Hamilton] Time to get out.

429
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,940
[man 1 talks indistinctly]

430
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,900
So, a minute is a year
in Formula 1 terms.

431
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,780
[commentator 1] <i>Finally, he pulls away
after a minute spent in the pit lane.</i>

432
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,576
[Hamilton] <i>Then I got back going</i>

433
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
<i>and your confidence
really takes a beating.</i>

434
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,100
And then it's really hard
to build it back up.

435
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,220
[commentator 2] <i>There is the Renault
of Nico Hulkenberg.</i>

436
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,700
<i>This is one of the craziest races.</i>

437
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,260
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen
has retaken the lead.</i>

438
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,380
[commentator 2] <i>Stroll's second,
Kvyat's third.</i>

439
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,940
[Hamilton] What position
have I dropped back to?

440
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,660
[Bono] <i>Unfortunately, Lewis,
you dropped back to position 12.</i>

441
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,060
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton got some
catching to do.</i>

442
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,940
[commentator 1] <i>Game on
in the last 16 laps.</i>

443
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,020
I don't think
I've ever been a great loser.

444
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
<i>Or great in defeat.</i>

445
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,260
It's just in my DNA.

446
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,080
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton pushing hard.</i>

447
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,460
[Bono] <i>You were purple sector
three last lap.</i>

448
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,360
<i>Okay, so push, push.</i>

449
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,600
[tires screeching]

450
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,980
[commentator 2] <i>Oh! He just keeps it out
of the wall there, Hamilton!</i>

451
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,900
If a team make a mistake,
it is kind of out of your hands,

452
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,900
but if you've practiced and practiced

453
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,500
and you've put so much focus and effort in
and then you drop the ball...

454
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,800
[commentator 1] <i>A rare error.</i>

455
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,940
...oh, it's really hard to deal with.

456
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,520
[Hamilton] Retire the car.

457
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,820
[Bono] <i>Negative, Lewis, negative.
There's always opportunities.</i>

458
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,380
[Wolff] <i>We must never give up,
even if the situation looks desperate,</i>

459
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,220
because even if
it's just about collecting a single point,

460
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,340
that can make a difference
to a championship.

461
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,100
[Bono] <i>So, Lewis is out of the points.
We're fighting for P2. Come on.</i>

462
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,300
[Buxton] <i>All of the team's hopes
now sit with Valtteri</i>

463
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,620
to bring home the result they want
on their 200th Grand Prix.

464
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,160
In that moment,
you know you have a great chance.

465
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,756
[Bono] <i>Come on, Valtteri.
It's critical to get through.</i>

466
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,460
It always makes you push even harder.

467
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,900
You know you have a great opportunity
to get some big points.

468
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
[crashes]

469
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,140
[commentator 2] <i>And that's Bottas!
Bottas has put it in the wall!</i>

470
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,140
[in German] Fuck! How is this possible?

471
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,440
[Bono in English] <i>Everything okay,
Valtteri?</i>

472
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,660
[Bottas] Yeah, I'm all good.
I'm sorry, guys.

473
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,220
In turn one, there was this one dry line.

474
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,680
<i>I must have gone in
just a tiny bit too quickly.</i>

475
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,540
<i>Obviously,
we are speaking about millimeters.</i>

476
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,600
I just drifted onto the damp part
on the outside.

477
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Immediately, I knew...

478
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,000
there wouldn't be really a way
to catch it.

479
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,260
<i>I knew that was it.</i>

480
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,540
I wasted one of the big opportunities
for the title.

481
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,500
<i>There's so many team members
that are giving their absolute everything</i>

482
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,860
<i>and with one single mistake of one driver,
you can lose it all.</i>

483
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,940
[Bono] <i>Valtteri's just gone off
at turn one.</i>

484
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,940
[Hamilton] How's it gone this bad?

485
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,420
[commentator 2] <i>It has not gone well
for the Mercedes team today.</i>

486
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,860
We lost the race
because we weren't good enough.

487
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,660
Our racing wasn't good enough.

488
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,040
[commentator 2] <i>And it's fireworks
and flames for Max Verstappen,</i>

489
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,940
<i>the winner of the German Grand Prix.</i>

490
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,460
[Horner] Well done, guys.

491
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,660
Fucking mega!

492
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,220
[all cheering]

493
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,940
That was terrible today.

494
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,076
[man] It was more than terrible.

495
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
[Wolff] Catastrophic.

496
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
What did you say?

497
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I couldn't hear you.

498
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,820
A tough day at the office?

499
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,440
No, it was a total crap, fucking shit,
awful day at the office.

500
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
Not a tough day at the office.

501
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,740
<i>When you screw up,
you want to identify the person.</i>

502
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,820
<i>It's how the human mind works.</i>

503
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,780
<i>But we have a no-blame culture.</i>

504
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,260
<i>We blame the problem
rather than the person,</i>

505
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,660
<i>which is easier said than done.</i>

506
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,836
- [journalist] That was not easy, right?
- No.

507
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,020
[journalist] What went wrong?

508
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,100
[Wolff] It all went wrong.

509
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
[host] Okay.

510
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
Who would like to take the first question?

511
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,580
Toto, just how embarrassing
is this for you?

512
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,700
Home race for the team,
having Netflix here,

513
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,100
you know, you've got the outfits...

514
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,820
Everything was poised for the celebration,

515
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,900
but you've ended up with a car in 11th
and a car in the kitty litter.

516
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
Can't be too good.

517
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,940
[Wolff] You want to have a headline
for <i>The Sun</i> from me?

518
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm not gonna give you a headline.

519
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,436
[journalist] I'll do that, don't worry.

520
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Yeah, I know.

521
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,780
Um, it was a terrible day for us.

522
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,580
Should I actually respond to you
when you give me such an answer?

523
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
[journalist] Why not?

524
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Um...

525
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,760
Lewis put the car in the wall

526
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,900
and then we made the wrong call
with the tires.

527
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,180
The tires were not ready.

528
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,860
But, uh, yeah, I wouldn't want to pin it
to one bad decision or one incident.

529
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,640
There was a multitude of things
that went wrong.

530
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,596
[Hamilton] I'm really sorry.

531
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,660
[Wolff] No, when we make mistakes,
we all make them together.

532
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,500
[Hamilton] I'm so fucking sorry, man.

533
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,100
Just rolled out that fucking corner.

534
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,580
Fuck.

535
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,100
I think coming in around the bollard
was the right reaction.

536
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,700
You would have lost tons of time
into the lap with a half-broken wing.

537
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,100
We would have made a better tire decision,
that's for sure,

538
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,260
but the reset reaction is coming in.

539
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,580
You just lost your front wing.
I wouldn't beat myself up on that one.

540
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Yeah.

541
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Fuck.

542
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm still just baffled...

543
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,340
with how it went from
bad to worse today. And, um...

544
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah.

545
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
All I can say is,
just on my behalf, sorry...

546
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,740
for not, uh, pulling through.

547
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,940
[Lauda] <i>Everybody makes mistakes.</i>

548
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>Vital mistakes.</i>

549
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,900
<i>For me, this was not a problem.</i>

550
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,940
[Wolff] <i>We need to remember
that Niki would say</i>

551
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,340
<i>that as a team,
you will always have setbacks.</i>

552
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,940
There's not one single team out there
that wins every race.

553
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,820
But the most difficult races,
the most painful events,

554
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,700
are the ones where you learn the most.

555
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,660
<i>At the end, we will learn from it.</i>

556
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,660
<i>We will recover and come out stronger.</i>

557
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,996
[Geri] Who's your favorite driver?

558
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,120
Whoever's winning for us.

559
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,416
Just make sure the car looks like that
at the end of the session, yeah?

560
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,020
<i>Everybody's expecting
to see the Red Bull cars</i>

561
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,520
<i>near the front of the field.</i>

562
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
[Pierre Gasly] No!

563
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,116
He needed to come in
and change his underwear, I would think.

564
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,560
We're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place.

565
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,140
- Can you win this weekend?
- Yeah!

566
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,300
You can occasionally kiss if you want.

567
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,540
[Wolff] <i>Everybody expects us to win.</i>

568
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
<i>But we need to fight to stay on top.</i>
