00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:05,928
OLDER TED: Kids, I'm gonna tell you
an incredible story.

2
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,327
The story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:11,172
- Are we being punished for something?
- No.

4
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,275
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while?
- Yes.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,910
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,884
<i>It was way back in 2005.</i>

7
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:27,545
<i>I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect...</i>

8
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,519
<I>and living in New York with Marshall,
my best friend from college.</I>

9
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,703
<i>My life was good.</i>

10
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:35,476
<i>And then Uncle Marshall
went and screwed the whole thing up.</i>

11
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,489
Will you marry me?

12
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,026
Yes. Perfect.

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,776
And then you're engaged,
you pop the champagne, you drink a toast,

14
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,790
you have sex on the kitchen floor.

15
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,156
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
- Got it.

16
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:47,692
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

17
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:50,058
Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily.

18
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:52,393
I've been there for all the big moments
of you and Lily.

19
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:56,887
The night you met,
your first date, other first things.

20
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,747
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep.

21
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:00,931
It's physics, Marshall.

22
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,018
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

23
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:08,605
My God, you're getting engaged tonight.

24
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,413
Yeah. What are you doing tonight?

25
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:15,225
<i>What was I doing? Here, Uncle Marshall...</i>

26
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,752
<i>was taking the biggest step of his life.
And me?</i>

27
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:19,989
<i>I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.</i>

28
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:24,147
Hey, so you know how
I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls?

29
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:28,113
Well, now I've got a new favorite.
Lebanese girls.

30
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,767
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

31
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:32,398
Hey, you wanna do something tonight?

32
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:36,648
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

33
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,577
- Hey.
- Where's your suit?

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,078
Just once, when I say 'suit up,'
I wish you'd put on a suit.

35
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:46,514
- I did. That one time.
- It was a blazer.

36
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,585
You know, ever since college
it's been Marshall and Lily and me.

37
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:54,111
Now it's gonna be
Marshall and Lily and me.

38
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:55,934
They'll get married, start a family.

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,012
Before long,
I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor...

40
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,389
their kids call 'Uncle Ted.'

41
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:03,800
I see what this is about.

42
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:08,085
Have you forgotten what I said to you
the night we met?

43
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:11,195
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

44
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,832
- Barney. We met at the urinal.
- Oh, right. Hi.

45
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:18,158
Lesson one, lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.

46
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,749
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two, get a suit.

47
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,962
Suits are cool. Exhibit A.

48
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,362
Lesson three,

49
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,103
don't even think about getting married
till you're 30.

50
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,799
Thirty. Right, you're right.

51
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:31,685
I guess it's just, your best friend
gets engaged,

52
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:34,851
- you start thinking about that stuff.
- I thought I was your best friend.

53
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,564
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
- You're my best friend, Barney.
- Good.

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,845
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play
a little game I like to call,

56
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:44,125
'Have you met Ted?'

57
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,820
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
'Have you met Ted.'

58
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,833
Hi, have you met Ted?

59
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:50,968
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Yasmin.

60
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:55,297
- It's a very pretty name.
- Thanks. It's Lebanese.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,483
Hey.

62
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,538
(GROANS)

63
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,785
I'm exhausted.

64
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,111
It was finger-painting day at school
and a 5-year-old boy...

65
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,406
got to second base with me.

66
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:10,759
- Wow, you're cooking?
- Yes, I am.

67
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,271
Are you sure that's a good idea
after last time.

68
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,149
You looked really creepy without eyebrows.

69
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,205
I can handle this.

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,443
I think you'll find
I'm full of surprises tonight.

71
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,745
So there's more surprises? Like what?

72
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,697
<i>Marshall was in his second year
of law school,</i>

73
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:28,063
<i>so he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.</i>

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,288
Boogedy boo! And that's all of them.

75
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,744
I'm gonna go cook.

76
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:37,017
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

77
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,159
I just couldn't imagine settling down
right now.

78
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:42,869
- So do you think you'll ever get married?
- Well, maybe eventually.

79
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:46,224
Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park.

80
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,977
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

81
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:50,032
Band, no DJ.

82
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:53,166
People will dance,
I'm not gonna worry about it.

83
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:56,172
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

84
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,561
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning
out his own imaginary wedding, huh?

85
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:03,175
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

86
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,187
One more for the lady!

87
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,153
Oh, hey, look what I got.

88
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,069
Oh, honey, champagne.

89
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:21,531
No, you are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

91
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:22,554
I'm not scared.

92
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,567
- Then open it.
- Fine.

93
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,414
Please, open it.

94
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,301
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall.

95
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:31,892
<i>There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.</i>

96
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,578
<i>One you plan out for months,
the other just slips out...</i>

97
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,304
<i>when you're half-drunk at some bar.</i>

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,744
Will you marry me?

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,727
You wanna go out sometime?

100
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,739
Of course, you idiot!

101
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,418
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

102
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,446
What's up, Carl?

103
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,689
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

104
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,817
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart
under your fridge?

105
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,829
No, but dibs.

106
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,101
Where's that champagne?

107
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,582
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

108
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,024
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

109
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,560
It's pretty easy, right?

110
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,572
(LILY SCREAMING)

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,357
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?
This is crazy.

112
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,923
I'm not ready to settle down.

113
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,673
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl?

114
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:23,793
The plan's always been...

115
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,391
don't even think about it until you're 30.

116
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,109
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

117
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:30,028
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

118
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,267
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

119
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:36,924
but if I was, it's like,
'Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?'

120
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:42,593
<i>And there she was.</i>

121
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,560
<i>It was like something from an old movie...</i>

122
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:53,661
<i>where the sailor sees the girl
across the crowded dance floor,</i>

123
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,452
<i>turns to his buddy and says,</i>

124
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,810
<i>'See that girl?
I'm gonna marry her someday.'</i>

125
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,271
Hey, Barney, see that girl?

126
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:04,758
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

127
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,668
- Go say hi.
- I can't just go say hi.

128
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,915
I need a plan.

129
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,482
I'm gonna wait
until she goes to the bathroom,

130
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,944
then I'll strategically place myself
by the jukebox so that...

131
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,957
Hi, have you met Ted?

132
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,092
Hi.

133
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:20,576
Let me guess. Ted.

134
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,329
I'm sorry, Lily.

135
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,631
I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.

136
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,496
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hit her?

137
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,355
Hit me? Please.

138
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,169
This guy can barely even spank me
in bed for fun.

139
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:37,824
He's all, like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt?'

140
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,341
And I'm, like,
'Come on, let me have you, you pansy.'

141
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:45,466
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, it's okay. Go on.

142
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:46,970
So, these spankings,

143
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,966
<i>are you in pajamas or au natural?</i>

144
00:06:51,414 --> 00:06:53,877
- So what do you do?
- I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.

145
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:56,339
- Oh.
- Well, kind of a reporter.

146
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:58,801
I do those dumb little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

147
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:02,953
You know, like,
'Monkey who can play the ukulele.'

148
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,037
But I'm hoping to get some
bigger stories soon.

149
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,107
Bigger, like,
'Gorilla with an upright bass?'

150
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,484
Sorry. You're really pretty.

151
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,526
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,572
See, the one in the middle
just got dumped by her boyfriend.

153
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,131
So tonight, every guy is 'the enemy.'

154
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,474
You know,
if it'll make your friend feel better...

155
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,064
you could throw a drink in my face.
I don't mind.

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,413
She would love that.
And it does look fun in the movies.

157
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,300
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

158
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:33,242
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

159
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,864
Some guy's attempting
to make the world's biggest pancake.

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,134
- Guess who's covering it?
- That's gonna take a week?

161
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,469
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

162
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:42,764
Hey, what's taking so long?

163
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:47,568
I know this is a long shot,
but how about tomorrow night?

164
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:49,580
Yeah. What the hell.

165
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,192
Jerk!

166
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:59,302
That was fun.

167
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,531
De... Wait for it... nied.

168
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,325
Denied.

169
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:05,476
We're going out tomorrow night.

170
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,970
I thought we were playing
Lazer Tag tomorrow night.

171
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:11,487
Yeah, I was never gonna go play Lazer Tag.

172
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:17,601
<i>The next night, I took her out
to this little bistro in Brooklyn.</i>

173
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,719
Wow.

174
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:22,141
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,334
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

176
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,130
<i>Son, a piece of advice.</i>

177
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,967
<i>When you go on a first date,
you really don't want to say Smurf penis.</i>

178
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,751
<i>Girls don't ordinarily like that.</i>

179
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,024
<i>But this was no ordinary girl.</i>

180
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,213
Lily.

181
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,518
How long have you been sitting there?

182
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,619
Stupid eye patch.

183
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:54,018
Mom, Dad,
I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

184
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,230
Marshall, how have I always described
my perfect woman?

185
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,893
Let's see.

186
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:58,948
She likes dogs?

187
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:00,355
I've got five dogs.

188
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,442
She drinks Scotch?

189
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:04,353
I love a Scotch
that's old enough to order its own Scotch.

190
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,207
<i>Can quote obscure lines from
Ghostbusters?</i>

191
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,191
'Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a God, you say, 'Yes!''

192
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,466
And I'm saving the best for last.

193
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,705
Do you want these? I hate olives.

194
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:19,630
- She hates olives. Awesome!
- The Olive Theory.

195
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,356
The Olive Theory
is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.

196
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,371
He hates olives, she loves them.
And in a weird way,

197
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,098
that's what makes them
such a great couple.

198
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:28,110
Perfect balance.

199
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:33,812
You know, I've had a jar of olives
just sitting in my fridge forever.

200
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:36,525
I could take them off your hands.

201
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:38,442
They're all yours.

202
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,168
Oh, it is on!

203
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,871
It is on till the break of dawn.

204
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:48,770
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

205
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:51,680
I gotta get one of those blue French horns
for over my fireplace.

206
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,440
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.

207
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:54,814
- No green clarinet?
- Nope.

208
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,253
Come on, no purple tuba?

209
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,793
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

210
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,698
There you are!

211
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,704
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

212
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,081
Come on, you're covering it.

213
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,173
All right, I'll be right there.

214
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,185
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:13,957
I had a really great time tonight.

216
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,345
Yeah, well.

217
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,357
So, did you kiss her?

218
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,565
No, the moment wasn't right.

219
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,612
Look, this woman
could actually be my future wife.

220
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,403
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

221
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,985
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet.

222
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,511
So, you chickened out like a little bitch.

223
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,941
What? I did not chicken out.

224
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,051
You know what?
I don't need to take first kiss advice...

225
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:37,441
from some pirate who hasn't been single
since the first week of college.

226
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,936
Ted, anyone who's single
would tell you the same thing.

227
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,494
Even the dumbest single person alive.

228
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,685
And if you don't believe me, call him.

229
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:51,352
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag?
Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome.

230
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,559
Oh, I killed you, Connor.
Don't make me get your mom.

231
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,573
Hey, listen,
I need your opinion on something.

232
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:59,506
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

233
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:02,800
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think?

234
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,806
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.

235
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:08,844
She didn't even give me the signal.

236
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,914
What, is she gonna
bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

237
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,926
'Ted,

238
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:15,208
'kiss me.'

239
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:20,028
- No, you just kiss her.
- Not if you don't get the signal.

240
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,193
- Did Marshall give me the signal?
- No!

241
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,206
I didn't, I swear.

242
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,205
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

243
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,923
never gonna happen.
You should've kissed her.

244
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,490
I should've kissed her.

245
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,473
Well, maybe in a week
when she gets back from Orlando.

246
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,840
A week? That's like a year in hot-girl time.

247
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:39,927
She'll forget all about you.

248
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:43,701
Mark my words,
you will never see that one again.

249
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,459
There she is.

250
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:48,325
She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.

00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,873
<i>...persuaded him to reconsider.</i>

<i>- back to you, Bill.
- The guy didn't jump.</i>

256
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,585
I'm gonna go kiss her.

257
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,759
- Right now.
- Look, dude, it's midnight.

258
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,629
As your future lawyer,
I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy.

259
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,972
I never do anything crazy.

260
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,594
I'm always waiting for the moment,
planning the moment.

261
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,673
Well, she's leaving tomorrow
and this may be the only moment

262
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm gonna get.

263
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:17,885
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap.

264
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,132
Okay, not a perfect metaphor...

265
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:20,699
'cause for me
it's fall in love and get married...

266
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,712
and for him it's death.

267
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,359
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

268
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,632
By the way, did I congratulate you two?

269
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,081
- I'm doing this.
- Let's go.

270
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,981
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

271
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,910
Barney?

272
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,115
All right, but under one condition.

273
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,372
Look at you, you beautiful bastard,
you suited up.

274
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:46,156
This is totally going in my blog.

275
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,484
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

276
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:52,004
I gotta do something.

277
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,597
Excuse me. Pardon me, just a sec.

278
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,547
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Hey!

279
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:57,826
Hey!

280
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:59,839
Go, go, go!

Everybody brings flowers.

282
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,982
Okay, moment of truth.

283
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:16,165
- Wish me luck.
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

284
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,267
'This just in.' Okay.

285
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,735
- Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.
- Kiss the crap out of that girl.

286
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,845
Marshall, remember this night.

287
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:29,403
When you're the best man at our wedding
and you give a speech,

288
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,861
you're gonna tell this story.

289
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,680
Why does he get to be the best man?

290
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:36,693
I'm your best friend!

291
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,980
<i>As I waIked up to that door,
a million thoughts raced through my mind.</i>

292

<i>Unfortunately,
one particular thought did not.</i>

293
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,391

- No!
- Get back in there.

299
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,397
Hi.

300
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,818
I was just...

301
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,351
Come on up.

302
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,708
MARSHALL: He's in.

303
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:16,252
So, Ranjit, you must have done it
with a Lebanese girl?

304
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:18,523
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

305
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:21,496
I'm gonna see
if that bodega has a bathroom.

306
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:24,405
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

307
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:28,738
- The women hot there?
- Here's a picture of my wife.

308
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:33,424
(WHISPERING) A simple 'no'
would have sufficed.

309
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,436
She's lovely.

310
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,995
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn
at 1:00 in the morning in a suit?

311
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,007
I was just hoping to...

312
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,184
get those olives...

313
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,262
that you said I could have.

314
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,300
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

315
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:53,921
Are you trying to get me drunk?

316
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,420
For starters.

00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,633
Thank you.

00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:09,271
So, Marshall,
this Olive Theory based on you and Lily.

320
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,998
- Yeah.
- You hate olives.

321
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,165
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
- Yeah, I hate olives.

00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,371
Two weeks ago,
Spanish bar on 79th Street.

323
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,562
Dish of olives. You had some. What up?

324
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,101
You have to swear
that this does not leave this cab.

325
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,138
- I swear.
- I swear.

326
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:31,688
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

327
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,799
Lily asked if she could have my olives.

328
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,197
I said, 'Sure, I hate olives.'

329
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:37,893
But you like olives.

330
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,451
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.

331
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:44,512
Been waiting my whole life
for a pretty girl to want my olives.

332
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:47,518
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

333
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,530
Don't get married.

334
00:15:57,463 --> 00:16:00,151
I think I like your Olive Theory.

335
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,155
I think I like your new French horn.

336
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,287
I think I like your nose.

337
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:08,080
I think I'm in love with you.

00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,159
What?

340
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:11,310
What?

341
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,389
Come on, man, you said your stomach's
been hurting, right?

342
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:17,098
You know what that is? Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.

343
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,933
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.

344
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,749
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

345
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,785
Yeah, I'm scared, okay?

346
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:30,497
But when I think of spending
the rest of my life with Lily,

347
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:33,444
committing forever, no other women,

348
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,033
doesn't scare me at all.

349
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:38,489
I'm marrying that girl.

350
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,657
Lily.

351
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:43,670
Lily, I like olives.

352
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,324
We'll make it work.

353
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,097
(SIGHING)

354
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:00,840
So, Orlando? You gonna hit Disney World?

355
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,649
- You love me?
- Oh, God.

356
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,696
I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that?

357
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,709
Who says that?

358
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,105
- I should just go.
- Hold on.

359
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,250
Wait a minute.

360
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,354
I promised you these.

361
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,409
- Olives.
- Yeah.

362
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,232
Thanks. I love you.

363
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,245
What is wrong with me?

364
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,627
Why are we still sitting here? Let's go.
We can still make last call.

365
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:30,041
What do you say, Lil?
'Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum'?

366
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:35,549
- 'Cause you're a pirate?
- Okay, eye patch gone.

367
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,619
And we can't just abandon Ted.

368
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,593
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

369
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,503
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
Do you think they're doing it?

370
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,070
You think they're doing it
in front of the dogs?

371
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,860
Doggie style.

372
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,972
I knew this girl in college,
she had this Golden Retriever...

373
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,082
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop taIking.

374
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:53,095
Hit it, Ranjit.

375
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,891
So, when you tell this story to your friends,

376
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,033
could you avoid the word 'psycho'?

377
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,233
I'd prefer 'eccentric.'

378
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,020
Goodnight, psycho.

379
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,650
Great.

380
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:15,597
- How do I get to the F train?
- Oh.

381
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:19,743
- Two blocks, that way and take a right.
- Thanks.

382
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,649
You know what?

383
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm done being single. I'm not good at it.

384
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,302
Look, obviously,
you can't tell a woman you just met...

385
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:34,007
you love her, but it sucks that you can't.

386
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,242
I'll tell you something, though. If a woman,

387
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,056
not you, just some hypothetical woman,

388
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,710
were to bear with me through all this,

389
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:46,100
I think I'd make a damn good husband
because that's the stuff I'd be good at.

390
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:50,514
Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father...

391
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:54,041
and waIking her five hypothetical dogs.

392
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,683
Being a good kisser.

393
00:18:57,388 --> 00:19:01,801
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
- Oh, I've got references.

394
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,814
Goodnight, Ted.

395
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,271
- And I'm a good handshaker.
- That's a pretty great handshake.

396
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,352
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.

397
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,018
- What?
- That was the signal.

398
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:28,855
That long, lingering handshake.
You should've kissed her.

399
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,349
There's no such thing as the signal.

400
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,652
But, yeah, that was the signal.

401
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:35,664
Signal.

402
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:40,163
Carl, thank you.
There's something I gotta do.

403
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:43,117
By the way, you should've kissed her.

404
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,575
Carl, you guys weren't there.

405
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,235
I am so turned on right now.

406
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,774
Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal.

407
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,124
- That was not the signal.
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

408
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:00,414
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

409
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,430
To one hell of a night.

410
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,617
That was not the signal.

411
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:12,633
<i>I asked her about it years later,
and, yeah, that was the signal.</i>

412
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,072
<i>I could've kissed her.</i>

413
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:17,845
<i>But that's the funny thing about destiny,
it happens whether you plan it or not.</i>

414
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,892
<i>I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again.</i>

415
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:21,076
<i>But it turns out,</i>

416
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:24,177
<i>I was just too close to the puzzle
to see the picture that was forming.</i>

417
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,639
Because that, kids, is the true story...

418
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:29,097
of how I met your Aunt Robin.

419
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,308
Aunt Robin?

420
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,099
I thought this was how you met Mom.

421
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,562
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

422
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:38,819
Like I said, it's a long story.
