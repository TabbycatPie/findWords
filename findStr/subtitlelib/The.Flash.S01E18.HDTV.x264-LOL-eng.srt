1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:05,371
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,439
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,441
by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,442
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,411
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:16,348
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,051
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,854
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,023
and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,625
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:27,660
Mom!

12
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:28,794
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,096
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,299
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,935
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

16
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:38,304
Same.
Well, as fast as I can run.

17
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,774
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism... A.T.O.M.

18
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,042
What are you gonna
use it for?

19
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,343
To protect the people
of this city.

20
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,712
You think Dr. Wells
killed Barry's mom?

21
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,047
I don't know yet.

22
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,481
But I do know
that Wells keeps secrets.

23
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,017
The way that
he described running...

24
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,587
Feeling the wind
and the power...

25
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:58,224
It's like he was talking
from experience.

26
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,759
Harrison Wells is
The Reverse-Flash.

27
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,364
Eddie, we need your help.

28
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,307
Pedal to the metal.

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,980
We've got a 10-31 in progress.

30
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,248
Shiny Diamond,
18th and Olive.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,582
That's only a few blocks
from here.

32
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,985
Has every crook in Central City
gone crazy?

33
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,953
This is the third attempted
robbery tonight.

34
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,922
Barry.
We got another one.

35
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,728
Hello.

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,663
18th and Olive.

37
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,298
Got it.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,366
Who's this?

39
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,069
Oh. Indecent exposure.
Powell Park.

40
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,338
That ain't something
you should be showing people.

41
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,878
They're getting away, guys.

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,346
They're not getting away,
Eddie.

43
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,915
Let's get these bozos
up ahead of us first,

44
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,317
and then we'll worry about
the idiots at the Shiny Diamond.

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,319
All right.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,686
We're gonna run out
of room, though.

47
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,355
I'll take care of that.

48
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,858
What do you think
he meant by that?

49
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,997
Oh.
That's what he meant.

50
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,969
I think we lost them.

51
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,571
Oh, no, you didn't.

52
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:23,075
And by the way,
you're under arrest.

53
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:28,948
We need to go.
Now. Come on!

54
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:33,485
Uh-uh.
Freeze.

55
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,620
You guys missing these?

56
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,922
On the ground.
On the ground.

57
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:40,893
So, uh, I'm just curious, but...

58
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,995
have you guys not heard of me,
or what?

59
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,368
Nice work, detective.

60
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,007
- Good night, Dr. Kang.
- Good night.

61
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,562
Oh... ow!

62
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:25,058
Synced and corrected by Pacifier

63
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,040
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang,

64
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,943
engineering professor
at Hudson University.

65
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,778
- Just got tenure.
- Hey.

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,614
So, her whole body's covered in
these puncture wounds

67
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:36,682
you see on her face.

68
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,217
Bite marks maybe.

69
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,519
Whatever it was, she must have
gone into anaphylaxis.

70
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,987
- Damn.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,390
The blood sample should tell us
everything we need to know.

72
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,924
I'll run tests
back at my lab.

73
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,060
They can do it faster at
S.T.A.R. Labs.

74
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,929
Well, yeah, but,
I mean, it's just...

75
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,699
It's just what?

76
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,602
It's kind of weird being there
right now.

77
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,171
Barry, you know we have to
play it cool with Wells.

78
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,572
If he finds out
we suspect him...

79
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,673
I know.
I get it.

80
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,043
I just think that we should tell
Cisco and Caitlin.

81
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,411
They could help us.

82
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,112
The more people who know,
the more chance

83
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,547
Wells is gonna find out
we're on to him.

84
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,716
I mean, what if one of them
slips up?

85
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,217
Or panics?

86
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,219
- Or what if...
- What?

87
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,221
What if
they're not on our side?

88
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,856
No.
Absolutely not.

89
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,025
They're not involved in
whatever he's planning.

90
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,494
I mean, Wells is their boss,
their mentor.

91
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,063
They've been with him
for a long time.

92
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,131
I've seen plenty of people

93
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,233
make the wrong choice
for loyalty.

94
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:32,905
Please do not include them
until we can be sure.

95
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,106
All right.

96
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,116
Death by apitoxin.

97
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,151
Honeybee venom.

98
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,822
Bees.
Why did it have to be bees?

99
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,423
Y'all, I don't do bees.

100
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,125
Ain't nobody got time
for bees.

101
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,493
But when a honeybee stings,

102
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,762
the stingers are literally
torn from their abdomen,

103
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,163
and they die.

104
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,731
But there were no stingers
in the body

105
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,033
and no dead bees in the car.

106
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,869
A honeybee can only deposit
.1 milligrams of apitoxin

107
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,137
when it releases
its stinger.

108
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,438
And yet, Ms. Kang was found

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,040
with enough venom in her system

110
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,708
to kill a herd of elephants.

111
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,577
It appears not only is
a meta-human

112
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,481
controlling these bees but also
increasing their toxicity.

113
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,282
Bees communicate
by releasing pheromones.

114
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,984
Maybe this meta's controlling
them through secretion?

115
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,487
Anyone want to join me
in getting a beekeeper suit?

116
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,555
I'm pretty sure
I can outrun a bee.

117
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,257
Just don't run into a lake.

118
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,493
Bees will wait for you
to come up for air

119
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,727
and then they'll sting you.

120
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,795
Discovery Channel.

121
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,098
Turns out there's a lot
to discover.

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,067
Felicity,
what are you doing here?

123
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,036
Can you guys come outside
for a sec?

124
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,681
What exactly
are we waiting for, Ms. Smoak?

125
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,784
Up there.

126
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,120
Is that a bird?

127
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,788
It's a plane.

128
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,628
It's my boyfriend.

129
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:07,766
Hi.

130
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,168
I'm Ray.

131
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,915
So he seems
a little tall for you.

132
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,083
Barry Allen,
are you jealous?

133
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,386
Je... no.
No, I'm not jealous.

134
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,155
I just... I really wish
you would've called

135
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,157
before flying in.

136
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,724
Oh, no, he flew.
I drove.

137
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,461
I'm serious, all right?
Now is not the best time.

138
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,933
Why?
What's going on?

139
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:43,969
Ah, well, my ears popped,
so that's something.

140
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,671
You're lucky
you didn't break your neck.

141
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:48,373
What is it with billionaires
being superheroes?

142
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,809
So have you... picked a name yet?

143
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,979
I'm kind of partial to
The Atom.

144
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,414
Shoo.

145
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,316
You married to that, or...?

146
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:00,652
Your A.T.O.M. suit...

147
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,021
it's quite the technological
achievement, Mr. Palmer.

148
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,990
I'm impressed.

149
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,391
And he is never impressed.

150
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,759
Well, thank you,

151
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,229
but I can't quite seem to
keep it up.

152
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,065
He means the suit.

153
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,499
- Yeah, I mean the suit.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,168
I can attest that
everything else works just fine.

155
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,269
There's nothing
we need to fix in...

156
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,370
That area.

157
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,138
No, no, no.
The sex is great.

158
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,573
God, there's two of them.

159
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,208
I know from Felicity
that you have been

160
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,776
very helpful with Barry
and the Flash suit,

161
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,146
and I was hoping to get
another set of eyes on my...

162
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,082
- Problem.
- Problem.

163
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,351
Any friend of The Arrow's
is a friend...

164
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,885
- Hell, yes.
- Uh, guys.

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,290
We kind of have a lot
going on already.

166
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,092
There's the
meta-human killer

167
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,894
that can control
a whole swarm of bees?

168
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,296
Cool.

169
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,998
I mean, awful.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,501
I'm sure Caitlin and I will
provide ample support, Barry.

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,037
And I will be happy to
sit this one out.

172
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,172
You...

173
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,875
Ray, why don't you stay here
and work on your suit

174
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,845
while Barry and I run to
Jitters for some java?

175
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,980
Sounds like a plan.

176
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,083
- Coffee?
- Sure.

177
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,463
- Hey, Detective.
- Iris.

178
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,598
What are you doing here?

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,433
I am following up
on my story

180
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,934
about crime
in Central City.

181
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,636
Or lack thereof.

182
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,307
Could someone be working
with The Flash?

183
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,941
No.
Of course not.

184
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,243
You caught a flasher,

185
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,477
armed robbers
in a getaway car,

186
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,180
and two jewelry thieves
last night.

187
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,616
I'm just that good.

188
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,685
What is going on with you
lately?

189
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,788
You've been acting
really weird and withdrawn.

190
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,523
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think that

191
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,058
you were hiding something
from me.

192
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,361
Iris, I'm... I'm not hiding
anything from you.

193
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,670
Do you ever go to work?

194
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,072
Oh, you're funny.

195
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:06,345
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris
about The Flash.

196
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,180
You have to.

197
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,850
It's really starting
to affect our relationship.

198
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,920
We haven't had sex
in two weeks.

199
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,588
Which you didn't want
to know about.

200
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,392
Keeping her in the dark
keeps her safe.

201
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,593
I don't agree.

202
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,595
Well, I'm her father.

203
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,829
And I'm her boyfriend.

204
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,498
When does my vote
outweigh yours?

205
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,734
When you become her husband.

206
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,443
You know I left Starling City

207
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,911
to get away from
the mood and brood,

208
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,215
but it looks like
it followed me here.

209
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,449
I know.
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,418
It's like I said before,

211
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,587
now is not the best time.

212
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,089
Barry, I have been through
enough with you

213
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,458
to know when you're
holding something back.

214
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,960
Is this because I told Ray
your secret?

215
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,762
Because he is trustworthy,
Barry.

216
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,497
He wants to help people,
just like you.

217
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,298
I know, that's not what
I'm worried about.

218
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,033
It's...

219
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,937
I really don't want to
put anyone else in danger.

220
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,741
In danger of what?

221
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,942
Barry, hey.

222
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,344
Eddie, hey.

223
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,845
- You remember Felicity.
- Of course.

224
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,113
- Hey.
- Great to see you.

225
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,449
Yeah.

226
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,884
What is wrong with you?

227
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,986
Is everyone in Central City
in a bad mood?

228
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,321
I thought Central City was
supposed to be the fun one.

229
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,825
It's, um...

230
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,394
- It's not...
- Felicity knows.

231
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,595
- Wow.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,197
So everyone but Iris.

233
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,765
It feels that way.

234
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,700
How do you lie to
everyone you care about?

235
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,369
For starters,

236
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,737
don't think of it
as lying.

237
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,273
Think of it as protecting her
from getting hurt...

238
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,674
with a fib.

239
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,243
But Iris can tell
I'm hiding something,

240
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,813
and it's putting
this distance between us.

241
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,548
I have an idea.

242
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,516
Why don't we all
go to dinner tonight?

243
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,886
A little wine and dine
is sure to bridge the gap.

244
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,588
Come on, we all had fun
last time.

245
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,658
Sure.
Why not?

246
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,893
Barry Allen,
fifth wheel.

247
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,196
Well, I can't make
my 3:00 meeting this afternoon.

248
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,731
Also, confirm my dinner
reservation for tonight.

249
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,999
Last time,
they couldn't find it,

250
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,335
and that was unacceptable.
Thanks.

251
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,307
You see that bad man
over there?

252
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,478
Tell your sisters
it's time.

253
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,248
So you put solid oxide
fuel cells into the belt?

254
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,116
Yeah, it's the only place
to hide the hardware.

255
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,587
Hmm, well, they should be
generating enough energy

256
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,088
to power the suit.

257
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,756
It could be
the operating temperature.

258
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,825
I mean, you're essentially...

259
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,027
Overheating the system, yeah.
I figured.

260
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,233
But if we insulate them
with a ceramic compound...

261
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,635
We may improve
the operating efficiency.

262
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,973
You really are quite clever,
Cisco.

263
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:52,077
Some would say I'm the reverse.

264
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,347
You're incredibly clever,
Cisco.

265
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,584
How do you turn
this thing on?

266
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,824
Cisco?
You okay?

267
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,058
Yeah.

268
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,995
I haven't been getting
enough sleep, so...

269
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,597
Cisco, we need you up here.

270
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,772
Killer bees are at it again.

271
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,275
Get a hold of Barry.

272
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,177
Another bee attack.
Folston Tech.

273
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,479
I'll see where Joe is.

274
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,648
- <i> Bee</i> careful.
- For real?

275
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,652
Bad pun. Sorry.
Just don't die.

276
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,368
I'm too late.

277
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,970
Where are the bees?

278
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,072
I don't know.
There's no sign of them.

279
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,619
Found them.

280
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,456
How do I get out of here?

281
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,757
Take the northeast crossway.

282
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,160
It's the quickest way
out of the building.

283
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,332
Guys, they're everywhere.
I'm surrounded.

284
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,347
Barry!

285
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,686
Barry.

286
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,088
He's going into cardiac arrest.

287
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,025
Barry, stay with me.

288
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,237
Cisco!
Barry doesn't have a pulse.

289
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,306
- Step away from him.
- What? Why?

290
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,340
We need to jumpstart his heart.

291
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,175
There's a defibrillator
in the suit.

292
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,848
Charge it to 360 joules.

293
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,651
Charging in three, two, one.

294
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,923
Hit him again.
400 joules.

295
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,359
Charging in three, two, one.

296
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,298
Barry.

297
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,406
Joe.

298
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,512
That is it for
the defibrillator.

299
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:42,681
It is completely fried.

300
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,416
You're lucky to be alive,
Mr. Allen.

301
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,252
I was very specific
that you not die.

302
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,087
Yeah, that's a pretty big thing
for her.

303
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,523
Cisco, what happened out there?

304
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,324
I followed your directions
exactly.

305
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,461
I'm sorry.
I led you the wrong way.

306
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,431
The schematics that we had,
they... they weren't up to date.

307
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,332
What, they weren't up to date?

308
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,167
What do you mean?

309
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,835
That's never
happened before.

310
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,837
What, you think Cisco
was trying to get you killed?

311
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,639
No.
Why would he do that?

312
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,840
That doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,576
I know.
That's why I was joking.

314
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,179
Barry, it's our job
to protect you, and today,

315
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,014
we failed, but that'll just
serve as a warning

316
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,483
for all of us to be
more vigilant in the future.

317
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,852
Good news... the apitoxin
is out of your body.

318
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,487
Your levels are
back to normal.

319
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,489
Terrific.

320
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,292
Ray, Felicity.
We're gonna be late for dinner.

321
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,828
Are you sure that's wise,
Barry?

322
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,995
You just died.

323
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,897
Maybe you should
order in tonight.

324
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,099
Yeah, we could
totally cancel.

325
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,701
I'm fine.
Alive. Hungry.

326
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,070
All right?
Let's go.

327
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,142
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

328
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,777
Why didn't we get
invited to dinner?

329
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,855
Oh.
Thank you.

330
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,957
Hey, guys.

331
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,725
Wow, Iris.
Check you out.

332
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,926
Hi, Felicity.

333
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,194
- Hello.
- Hi.

334
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,697
Hey.
Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

335
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,065
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

336
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,133
- Lovely to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

337
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,434
- Nice to meet you.
- Barry.

338
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,236
<i>Bienvenue chez
Massimo Restaurant.</i>

339
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,371
Mr. Palmer,
your table is ready.

340
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,572
Great.
Shall we?

341
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,809
Yes.

342
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,044
Hey, how did he get
a reservation here?

343
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,646
We've been trying
for months.

344
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,949
I don't know.

345
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,185
Here's your table, sir.

346
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,322
I thought it'd be nice
if it was quiet,

347
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:36,394
so I bought out
the entire restaurant.

348
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,529
Too much?

349
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,230
Just a tad, sweetie.

350
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,871
Joe.

351
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,541
Oh, Cisco.
Hey.

352
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,342
You just saved me a trip
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

353
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,978
I got some info
on our second victim.

354
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,446
Name's Bill Carlisle.

355
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,015
He was recently hired
at Folston Tech

356
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,350
to beef up
their robotics division.

357
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,052
Robotics?

358
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,521
That's just like
the first victim.

359
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,891
Wow.
That is weird.

360
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,196
That's not why
you stopped by.

361
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,366
No, I wanted to talk to you
about Barry.

362
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,901
Okay.

363
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,710
Is there something
going on with him?

364
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,878
Something he's not
telling us?

365
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,146
What do you mean?

366
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:33,051
He hasn't really been
himself lately.

367
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,519
Not that I'm aware of.

368
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,590
It's like something is just
really bothering him.

369
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:42,794
Well, I think he's got
his mind trained on

370
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,262
catching the bad guys, Cisco.

371
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:48,366
And he's probably worried about

372
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,669
when The Reverse-Flash is gonna
show his face again.

373
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,639
Oh, I'm not like The Flash
at all.

374
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:00,311
Some would say I'm the reverse.

375
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,316
Hey.
You okay?

376
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,518
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

377
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,822
It's just... I've got
this crazy headache.

378
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,558
Thank you for the file
and the talk.

379
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,035
- So how did you two meet?
- Work.

380
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,737
Well, actually,
I bought the company

381
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,139
where Felicity was employed,
and so she was forced

382
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,340
to join me at Palmer Tech.

383
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,976
It's not as creepy
as it sounds.

384
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,646
So you two work closely
together?

385
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,214
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.

386
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,982
I guess you guys share
all of your thoughts

387
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:41,085
and feelings and...

388
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,522
Yeah... I share everything
with Felicity.

389
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:48,593
It's nice that you guys have
that level of communication.

390
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:52,430
Oh, well, no,
not every-everything.

391
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,367
I mean, sometimes it's good
to just shut up.

392
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,503
I get that.

393
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,805
Some things are better left
unspoken.

394
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,006
Really?

395
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,442
I-I don't find that
to be true.

396
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,646
Oh, thank God.
It's the food.

397
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,315
Food's here.

398
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,017
Our first course
on the tasting menu

399
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,453
is a quail egg frittata.

400
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,421
Bon appetit.

401
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,689
Barry.

402
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,123
I got to admit, I envy you

403
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,458
spending so much time
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

404
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,061
Harrison Wells is, like,
a personal hero of mine.

405
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,429
I mean, it's amazing just
to actually

406
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,730
be in the same room
with him.

407
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,639
I'll be right back.
Just excuse me.

408
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,641
Okay.

409
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:45,550
Well, I, um...

410
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,751
have to pee.

411
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,326
Okay, you've been acting
super strange

412
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,728
ever since Ray and I
got to Central City.

413
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,096
What is going on with you?

414
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,497
And don't say
it's a bad time.

415
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,532
Oliver might be joining
the League of Assassins,

416
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,034
Laurel's the Black Canary, and
Thea's training with Malcolm,

417
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,336
so I know about bad times.

418
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,904
Okay.

419
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,982
Joe and I found out that
Wells isn't who he says he is.

420
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,219
He...

421
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:25,223
He is the man
that killed my mother.

422
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,358
Oh, my God.
But he's been helping you.

423
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
Get faster, stronger.
I know.

424
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,228
- Why?
- I don't know.

425
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,462
I don't know anything anymore,

426
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,165
especially who I can
and can't trust.

427
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,734
So you think Cisco and Caitlin
are helping him?

428
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,202
That's impossible.

429
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,570
- Is it?
- Yes.

430
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,205
They were trying to
save you today, Barry.

431
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,707
- They did save you.
- Wells has also saved me.

432
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,841
Many times.

433
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,978
I thought that Wells was
a great man,

434
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,148
and I was so wrong
about him.

435
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,183
What if I'm wrong
about everything else too?

436
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:55,186
Hey, guys.

437
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,255
Uh, things are getting
a little intense in here.

438
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,727
Please can't we just have
a nice evening?

439
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:07,398
Okay, so it's my fault that
we're not having a nice evening?

440
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,634
I am your girlfriend.
Who you live with.

441
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,637
I shouldn't have to beg you
to talk to me.

442
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,573
If I could talk to you
about this, I would, believe me.

443
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,176
But I can't.

444
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:21,145
You know what?
I am not hungry anymore.

445
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,447
- Iris.
- You know what?

446
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,681
When you are ready
to act like

447
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,583
we are two people
who love each other,

448
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,717
call me.

449
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,019
I'll be at my dad's.

450
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,928
Thank you for dinner.
I've got to go.

451
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,033
Uh, emergency at
S.T.A.R. Labs.

452
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,869
- Go.
- Sorry.

453
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,208
Well, only 17 more courses
to go.

454
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,780
Containment breach.
Foreign object detected.

455
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,184
Did I get it?

456
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,819
I think I got it.

457
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,921
Where is he?

458
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,999
Thank you.

459
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,934
Let's see what makes this bee
so poisonous.

460
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,704
You saved my life.

461
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:28,012
That is one odd-looking bee.

462
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,548
That's 'cause it isn't a bee
at all.

463
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,918
It's a robot.

464
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
No way.

465
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,418
Unbelievable.

466
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,855
This bot's got a 360-degree
vision system.

467
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,858
I mean, we're talking
multiple micro-cameras

468
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,061
all coming from various angles
at the same time.

469
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,396
Which means...

470
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,830
It can see all around
the room at once.

471
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:20,832
That is...

472
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,266
Amazing.

473
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,235
Disturbing.

474
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,337
It's also next-gen hardware
that's nowhere near the market.

475
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,239
So we're not dealing with
a meta-human?

476
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,574
It's just a mad scientist.

477
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,275
Cisco, you said
the second victim,

478
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,777
Bill Carlisle,
was a robotics engineer.

479
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,879
Let's cross-reference
his previous employers

480
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:35,880
with those of Lindsay Kang.

481
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,381
Allow me.

482
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,884
Mama's been away from
a keyboard for far too long.

483
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,385
Okay.

484
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,724
They both worked
at Mercury Labs.

485
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,125
Let's call Joe.

486
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,861
I think it's time we paid
a visit to an old friend.

487
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,700
Twice in one year, Harrison.

488
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:59,170
You really are vying for
comeback scientist of the year.

489
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,905
Always a pleasure,
Christina.

490
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:01,872
To what do I owe this visit?

491
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,941
Did you finally find
my tachyon prototype,

492
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,077
or are you here to
blackmail me for another one?

493
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,812
Do you have another one?

494
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,514
We came here for information.

495
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,717
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

496
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:17,388
Former employees who were
recently murdered.

497
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,757
My God.
I wasn't aware.

498
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,495
Stung to death
by robotic bees.

499
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,330
You're looking
for Brie Larvan.

500
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,632
Brie Larvan?

501
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,600
A quite brilliant roboticist
who once developed

502
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,603
miniature mechanical bees
for agricultural use.

503
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,005
Kang and Carlisle warned me

504
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:36,407
that Brie was weaponizing
the bees for military use,

505
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,942
so I terminated her.

506
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:41,746
Well, it seems that you would be
on her hit list too, Doctor.

507
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,914
You've got to let us
keep you safe.

508
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,484
I'm all too familiar

509
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,353
with your inability
to protect things, Harrison.

510
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,023
I can take care
of myself.

511
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:56,127
Good day, gentlemen.

512
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,662
Thank you.

513
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,371
Hey.

514
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,473
Okay, so we found
our queen bee.

515
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,509
Brie Larvan.
She's a roboticist.

516
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,377
Joe is running a trace
on her current location,

517
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,578
but so far nothing.

518
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,780
Good.

519
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,014
Where is Ray?

520
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,150
Oh, he's working on his suit
with Cisco.

521
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:20,384
I like Ray.

522
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,486
He seems like
he's a really good guy.

523
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,955
He is a good guy.

524
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,557
Just like Cisco.

525
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,160
And Caitlin.
Girl.

526
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:35,566
Is that why you called me here?

527
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,601
I know that you're in
a tricky situation,

528
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,370
but that's when you need
your friends to have your back.

529
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,739
And how can they
if you won't let them?

530
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,341
It's not that simple.

531
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:46,711
What if Joe is right, and
I tell them, and it backfires?

532
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,879
Wells isn't just their boss,
Felicity.

533
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,916
He is their mentor,
their hero.

534
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,252
My hero.

535
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,189
Look, it's...

536
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,825
I don't know what to do.

537
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,464
When I first met Oliver,

538
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:07,998
before I knew he was The Arrow,

539
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,268
he would... he would ask me
to do weird things for him

540
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,371
like decrypt
a bullet-ridden computer

541
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:15,706
or hack some company.

542
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,441
And when I would ask him why,

543
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,277
he would come up
these ridiculous excuses.

544
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,714
And I always knew he was lying,
but I would help him anyway.

545
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,349
- You know why?
- Hmm?

546
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:30,087
Because I knew Oliver was
a good person with a good heart.

547
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,257
And Cisco and Caitlin?

548
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,459
They're no different.

549
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,907
Hey.

550
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,609
Hey.

551
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,780
So you're really
staying here tonight?

552
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,648
Tonight.
Tomorrow night.

553
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,417
The night after that.

554
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,489
Do you think that
Eddie is cheating on me?

555
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,728
No.
Eddie's not that kind of guy.

556
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,163
Well, then
I don't know what else

557
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,631
he could be hiding from me.

558
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,968
Iris...

559
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,673
Remember when we were kids,

560
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,377
and Joe would come home
from work

561
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:30,080
with that blank expression
on his face?

562
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,982
Yeah.

563
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,651
The "Earth to Joe" look.

564
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,852
How could I forget?

565
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,487
I never understood that look

566
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:41,192
until I started
working for the CCPD.

567
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:45,396
Showing up at crime scenes and
seeing someone murdered...

568
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,933
It can be ugly work.

569
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,668
And I'm lucky.

570
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,603
I get to hide behind
the science of it

571
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,438
and just stay in my lab,

572
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,207
but Eddie,

573
00:27:56,209 --> 00:28:01,745
he's out there every day
in the darkness.

574
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,682
I just... I think that maybe

575
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,418
if he doesn't want to talk
to you about his work,

576
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,388
it's probably because he wants
to keep you in the light.

577
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,993
What?

578
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm just surprised.

579
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,001
You going out of your way
like this

580
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,470
to help me see
Eddie's point of view.

581
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,840
I mean...

582
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,977
Eddie makes you happy.

583
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:37,147
All I ever want is
for you to be happy, Iris.

584
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,888
Welcome home.

585
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,331
It is so fun to watch
grown men play with their toys.

586
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,432
You're so lucky.

587
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:59,069
Ray is so nice and smart
and hot.

588
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,105
Yeah, it's kind of like
I'm dating Barry

589
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,674
but in Oliver's body.

590
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,343
A sentence you will
never repeat to anyone.

591
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,545
Your secret's safe
with me.

592
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:10,981
It must have re-activated.

593
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,816
And if it's being
controlled wirelessly...

594
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:13,918
I can trace its signal
and figure out

595
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,553
where it's trying to go.

596
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,958
- Oh, no.
- Oh, boy.

597
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
What?

598
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,429
The swarm is headed for
Mercury Labs.

599
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,232
Brie Larvan's going after Tina.

600
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,079
Hello, Dr. McGee.

601
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,816
You gonna open the window,
or should I buzz myself in?

602
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,460
How do we stop them?

603
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,329
She's got to be
remotely piloting

604
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:59,597
those bees from somewhere.

605
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,166
We need to stop this bug-eyed
glasses woman.

606
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,335
And her mini bandits.

607
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:06,003
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

608
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,705
Got her. She's in
an abandoned greenhouse.

609
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,039
Barry, you have to
take out Brie.

610
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,507
It's the only way to stop
these nanodrones.

611
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,842
What about Dr. McGee?

612
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,677
The defibrillator
in your suit is broken.

613
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,448
You cannot risk going near
Mercury Labs.

614
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,651
Bees can't penetrate my suit.

615
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,920
- I'll go.
- Whoa.

616
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,155
We haven't tested out
the new power system yet.

617
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,857
We'll do it now.

618
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,059
- I'm following you.
- I'm driving.

619
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,427
And I'm kissing you.

620
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:33,931
Dr. Wells...

621
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:37,167
Mr. Palmer will protect Tina.
Go.

622
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,819
You fired me,
destroyed years of my research.

623
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,855
You took everything from me.

624
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,157
What you were doing was wrong.

625
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
You wanted to harm people,
not help them.

626
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,229
I did what I had to do.

627
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,331
You mean ruin my life?

628
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,632
Sure.

629
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,701
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

630
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,743
Found her.

631
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,178
Felicity, can you jam
their frequency?

632
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,547
I already tried, but I might
be able to redirect them

633
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,848
onto a new target.

634
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,583
Ray, get ready for incoming.

635
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,352
We have the technology.

636
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,284
It's over, Brie.

637
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,486
I know you're trying to
kill Dr. McGee.

638
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,888
You think that she betrayed you.

639
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,391
I can imagine how that feels.

640
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:11,028
You think you understand
the sting of betrayal?

641
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,732
I'll show you what it means
to be stung.

642
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,345
Barry.

643
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,924
Barry, I hacked into
the bees' frequency.

644
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,261
I'm controlling them.

645
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,296
I'm the queen of this hive.

646
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,865
Oh, she's good.

647
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,500
She's like my nemesis.

648
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,902
I've never had a nemesis before.
I kind of like it.

649
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,107
Okay, Cisco.
Now what?

650
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,776
Ray, get to the ocean.

651
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,777
If the bots follow
you into the water,

652
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,345
their electronics will fry.

653
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,646
Got it.

654
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,515
Wait.
But so will my suit.

655
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,799
Cisco, I'm fried.
I'm losing propulsion control.

656
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,637
Can you see the van?

657
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,806
Yeah.

658
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,940
We'll catch you.

659
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,543
- You will?
- We will?

660
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:34,878
We will.

661
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,380
All right.

662
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,651
Keep it steady!

663
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,660
- Whoo!
- The Atom lives.

664
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,530
Oh.

665
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,167
Let's work on some softer gloves
for next time, okay?

666
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,136
Sorry.

667
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,506
Oh, you want to bring it?

668
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,374
It's been brought.

669
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,044
Rude.

670
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,912
Felicity, right now

671
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,149
would be a good time
to do something.

672
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,518
Stay away from Barry Allen.

673
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:19,756
- Felicity!
- Got it.

674
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,097
Boom.
Drop the mic.

675
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,298
It's metaphorical,
of course,

676
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,268
because I don't have
a real mic.

677
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,540
Brie's restrained.

678
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,275
Call CCPD.

679
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,714
Ah.
Some kind of team you have here.

680
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:46,950
Helps to have friends
in your corner.

681
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:06,536
Are you okay?

682
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,238
Cisco!

683
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,776
Come on.
Please.

684
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,311
Wake up.

685
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,113
Cisco's been stung.
He's going into shock.

686
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,781
I'm on my way.

687
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,650
Come on, stay with me.

688
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,957
Hold on.
Back up.

689
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,592
I'm gonna try something.

690
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,704
Cisco.

691
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:50,047
Either my fear of bees is over
or it just got a lot worse.

692
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,982
Thank God you're okay.

693
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,284
I've never had anybody
take a bee for me.

694
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,020
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, bro.

695
00:35:57,022 --> 00:36:00,524
Cisco, you're a hero, man.

696
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,039
- Dr. McGee.
- May I come in?

697
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,942
Yeah, of course.
What can I do for you?

698
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,011
I wanted to apologize.

699
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,647
I should have listened to you
when you warned me about Brie.

700
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:27,284
Perhaps next time I will take
the CCPD's offer of protection.

701
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,686
After we lost
your tachyon prototype,

702
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:34,658
I can understand why
you were hesitant to trust us.

703
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,226
Thank you.

704
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:39,763
Can I ask you something?

705
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:43,867
I couldn't help but notice
some tension

706
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,004
between you and Dr. Wells.

707
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,106
That's all in the past.

708
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:53,677
Do you mind if I ask
what happened between you two?

709
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,281
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

710
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,984
15 years ago, Harrison and I
were thick as thieves.

711
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,686
We were promising
young scientists

712
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,288
in Starling City.

713
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,491
He was such a kind man.

714
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,960
Then everything changed
after Tess died.

715
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,595
They were gonna get married?

716
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,897
I understand how grief
can affect someone,

717
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,132
but this was more than that.

718
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:18,402
It was like,
after that day,

719
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:22,906
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

720
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,441
Good day.

721
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,511
Bye.

722
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:30,013
Doctor.

723
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,783
How's Cisco?

724
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:34,384
Happy to be alive.

725
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:38,355
And sad that Ray is leaving.

726
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:42,993
It was a really brave thing
he did, risking his life.

727
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,261
Selfless.

728
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,064
Yeah.
It definitely was.

729
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,606
And another end to
another exciting adventure

730
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,808
in Central City.

731
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,009
Ah, yes, thank you.

732
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,079
Ray, thank you
for all your help.

733
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,313
- Oh.
- And I hope you

734
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,714
figure out the problem
with your suit.

735
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,183
- I already have, actually.
- Oh.

736
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:07,617
All this time,
I've been looking at

737
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,019
the power source
the wrong way.

738
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,487
I kept thinking
we needed to go bigger.

739
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,023
But the solution, as always,

740
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,826
is simply to go smaller.

741
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:17,694
Oh.
Great.

742
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,331
You okay?

743
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,500
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna be.

744
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,202
Thank you for your advice.

745
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:29,873
I won't even charge you
the 5¢.

746
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,008
Bye, Felicity.

747
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,643
Bye, Barry.

748
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,190
Hey.

749
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,894
What's up?

750
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,796
I, um...

751
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,632
I spoke to Barry
last night.

752
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:56,666
Oh, yeah?

753
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,034
He was trying to help me
understand

754
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,437
why you've been so off lately,

755
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:04,241
why you might be having trouble
connecting with me.

756
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,743
Really?

757
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,211
What did he say?

758
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,747
It was a good explanation.

759
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,583
Valid.

760
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,253
But the truth is,
it doesn't matter,

761
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:18,121
because when
you love someone,

762
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:20,757
you tell them everything.

763
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,325
So if you love me, Eddie,

764
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,762
you'll tell me what is going on
with you, or...

765
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,565
Or what?

766
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,900
You know what.

767
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,868
All right, all right,
who's ready for some...

768
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,671
♪ Karaoke ♪

769
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,008
We are not

770
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,811
going to karaoke,
are we?

771
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,681
No.

772
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:22,018
This is everything we know
about my mother's murder

773
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,554
and The Reverse-Flash.

774
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:29,659
I've been gathering information
on him for a long time.

775
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:34,397
And this is everything we know
about Dr. Wells.

776
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,272
I don't understand.

777
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:45,041
What do Dr. Wells
and The Reverse-Flash

778
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,943
have to do with each other?

779
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,478
Um...

780
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,483
They're the same person.

781
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,685
That's impossible.

782
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,820
Look, Caitlin,

783
00:40:56,822 --> 00:41:01,091
it took me a long time
to believe it too,

784
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:03,226
but it's him.

785
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:06,196
Dr. Wells is a speedster?

786
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,764
He's paralyzed.

787
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,000
Is he, though?

788
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:13,737
And why would he kill
Barry's mother?

789
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,708
It doesn't make any sense.

790
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,711
Cisco.
Say something.

791
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:27,751
I've been having these dreams.

792
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:32,689
Mostly at night,
but sometimes during the day.

793
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,391
But they don't really feel
like dreams.

794
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:38,862
They... they feel real.

795
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,601
What happens in the dream?

796
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,304
Dr. Wells is The Reverse-Flash.

797
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,242
And...

798
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,444
he kills me.

Greg, move your head.
