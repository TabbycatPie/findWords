真高兴你喜欢那栋房子  有几件事跟你说说

一  所有家电都包括在内

44
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,390
我们什么时候
So, when should we --

45
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,620
好  我懂
Yeah. I get it.

46
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,110
我们继续看吧
Well, we'll -- we'll just keep looking.

47
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,230
但这给了房子鲜明的特色啊
Although it does give the house character.

48
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,650
如果那些墙能说话就好了
If those walls could talk.

49
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,060
我同意  不好笑  再见
I agree. It's not funny. Bye-bye.

50

没事  亲爱的  你能卖掉那栋凶宅的

52
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,300
把血迹从我身上弄走

墙[沃尔一家]

56
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,880
{\an8}遵照医嘱  两天不能说话

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,340
{\an8}喉咙很痛  传染性单核细胞增多症很严重

58
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,780
{\an8}作为这个家庭里唯一有槽要吐的人

59
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,530
{\an8}我却不能说话

60

早上好

你想来点咖啡吗

62

天啊不要  我整晚没睡  我得去睡觉了
God, no. I've been up all night. I got to get to bed.

63
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,380
你们能别用搅拌机
Hey, can you guys not use, like, the blender

64
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,940
吸尘器什么的吗
or vacuum or anything?

我需要清静五个小时
I just need five hours.

66
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,160
看来你不停止找新工作了
So, I guess we've stopped looking for a new job?

67
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,760
实际上  是的
Actually, we have.

68
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,130
你女儿自己创业了

我召集了一群姑娘
I put a group of girls together,

我们通过社交媒体宣传俱乐部和别的东西
and we promote clubs and stuff via social media.

72
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,320
听起来不像是靠谱工作
That doesn't sound like a real job.

73
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,000
你的上一份工作听起来都不怎么靠谱了
Your last job barely sounded like a real job.

74
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,320
我们昨晚宣传水烟吧赚了五百块呢
We made $500 last night for promoting a hookah bar.

我还记得你小的时候

你跟我说你希望你的工作是"公主"
You told me you wanted your job to be "Princess."

77
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,930
真想回到那些日子
I would kill for those days.

78
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,080
所以你才穿得像是个水烟[妓女]吗
"Is that why you're dressed like a hookah?"

79
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,450
亲爱的  你又在说听不懂的话了
Honey, you're not making sense again.

80
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,570
你需要躺下休息吗
Do you need to lie down?

81
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,650
妈妈  我就知道你会这样
Mom, I knew you would be like this.

82
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,560
爸爸  你能理解我的事业  对吧
Dad, you understand what I'm doing, right?

83
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,550
当然啦  社交媒体的力量

98
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,690
我们都需要像德怀特一样

你知道我爸爸在军队服役吧

-你好  -我们开始可以吗
- Hello! - Shall we start?

110
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,000
不等卢克的辅导员了吗

马克斯老师正经历一场惨烈的离婚

所以我尽量不让她处理比较有挑战性的事情

114
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,210
我幼小心灵没受伤

我仔细查看了你的成绩单
I have been perusing your transcript.

116
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
随口说句
And, uh, apropos of nothing --

117
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,330
不是每个孩子都注定要上大学的
You know, not every kid is destined for college.

118
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,810
但卢克是  对吧

119
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,870
好吧  我配合演出

120
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,460
现实是  卢克的成绩和分数
The reality is that Luke's grades and test scores

121
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,300
是我们教育者所称的差强人意

122
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,460
那是好事吗
Is that good?

123
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,710
明白我的意思了吧
See what I'm talking about?

124
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,490
所以我们得专注靠
So, we're gonna have to really juice

125
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,290

128
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,060
记得我说过主要由我来说话吗

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,170

学生会主席一事发表声明吗

135
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,060
行啊  这是我的声明  呸

136

我的线人说他被抓到
My sources say that he was caught selling

137
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,960
在分类广告网上倒卖学校的萨克斯管
school saxophones on Craigslist.

138
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,800
看来可以写有"萨"[性]丑闻啊
Well, guess you could say you had a "Sax" Scandal, then.

139
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,430
"萨"丑闻  我要用这个标题
A sax scandal -- I'm running with that.

140

谢谢你全家  很有帮助

141
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,930
说到哪里来了
So, where did we land?

142
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,460
是让卢克吃阿得拉还是怎么  我忘了
We're putting Luke on Adderall or taking him off? I forget.

{\an8}一种治疗注意力缺失或者多动症的药  不宜乱吃
有学生吃了来增加专注力  又被成为"聪明药"

144
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,300
我们根本没在讨论阿得拉
We weren't discussing Adderall.

145
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,570
但阿得拉的确帮助了很多孩子呢
Although, Adderall has helped a lot of kids.

146
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,330
我们需要一个新主席  我为何不去竞选呢
Hey, we need a new president. Why don't I just do that?

147
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,710
也许会很酷
Maybe it'll be cool.

148
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,780
我的确喜欢指挥人

卢克  这责任十分重大
Luke, this is a lot of work.

153
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,470
你确定你能胜任吗

妈妈  这是我一分钟前听到后

155

好吧  我觉得你该去竞选

我想不出一个理由来反对

关于昨晚我有些想说的
So, I have a couple notes about last night.

161
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,930
亚利桑那  我看了你的自拍
Arizona, I was looking at your selfies.

162
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,840
-你爸妈是绿头鸭吗  -什么
- Are your parents mallards? - What?

163
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,290
你那鸭脸是怎么回事
What's with all the duckface?

164
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,270
你看起来就像在参加水边的单身派对
You look like you're at a bachelorette party in Tampa.

165
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,890
而你  卡滕  我竟然看到你在

166
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,740
"红房"酒吧里喝水

167
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,400
我隔天早上需要早起
I had to wake up early in the morning.

168
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,690
是啊  这正是我们想宣传的
Oh, yes, because that's what we're promoting --

169
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,780
一间能让人做出理智决定的酒吧
a club where people make good decisions.

170
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,910
对不起
I'm sorry!

171
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,590
你弱爆了
You are so weak.

172
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,500
真不敢相信我竟然让你在湖人队面前亲我
I can't believe I let you kiss me in front of the Lakers.

173
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,600
我不想学卡滕说话
Not to sound like a total Katen,

174
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,110
可海莉的新工作看起来不怎么样啊
but Haley's new job seems whack.

175
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,110
如果海莉想学宣传推广
If Haley wants to work in promotion,

176
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,020
她该跟我的人学学  梅尔夫·舍希特尔先生
she should learn from my guy -- Mr. Merv Schechter.

177
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,710
他无数伟大的创新发明里包含了
Among his brilliant innovations --

178
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,090
在篮球比赛中散发折扣劵的室内飞艇
the indoor blimp that drops coupons at basketball games.

179
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,300
可惜  那发明后来
Sadly, it was later weaponized

180
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,370
被一些恐怖分子组织装备上了武器
by several terrorist organizations.

181
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,900
杰  你需要把什么蔬菜切丝吗
Hey, Jay, do you need to julienne any vegetables?

182
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,410
-啥  -如果需要  你可以用
- What? - If so, you can use the knife

183
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,090
你外孙在我背上插的那把刀来切丝
your grandson jammed in my back.

184
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,580
那倒值得我一试
Well, that was worth the journey.

185
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,640
发生什么事了  宝贝
What happened, papi?

186
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,000
卢克打算参选
Luke decided to run against me

187
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,390
跟我竞争学生会主席宝座
for Student Council President.

188
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,930
我把人生献给了公共服务事业
I've devoted my entire life to public service,

189
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,580
现在却要受到一个把人生献给了
only to be challenged by a guy who's devoted his entire life

190
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,620
看网上摔滑板视频的人的挑战
to watching skateboard fails on YouTube.

191
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,010
卢克要竞选学生会主席吗
Luke's running for President?

192
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,790
我是说  我爱他  但是...
I mean, I love him, but --

193
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,870
杰说得对  卢克是个蠢货
Jay is right. Luke is a dummy.

194
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,590
我可没这么说过
Never said that.

195
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,350
他想要战  那便战吧
He wants a fight, he's got one.

196
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,970
我要用语言给我的继侄子
I'm going to hit my step-nephew

197
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,750
一点颜色看看
with so many stinging rejoinders

198
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,170
然后他就会哭给他继舅舅看
that he'll be crying step-uncle.

199
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,450
真棒  激情嘴仗
Yes! Dynamic wordplay!

200
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,070
高中的孩子最爱看了
High-school kids love that!

201
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,600
-他输定了  -不一定
- He's gonna lose. - He might not.

202
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,040
你真的想赌运气吗
Really, you want to roll those dice? Hmm.

203
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,830
还记得他上次竞选输了有多抑郁吗
Remember how depressed he got when he lost the last election?

204
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,080
爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

205
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,380
我们的小女孩在这啊
There she is -- our little girl!

206
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,160
米奇尔  你还记得她来我们家之前
Mitchell, do you remember back before we had her

207
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,320
我们是怎么担心家里多一个人
how we were so worried that an extra person

208
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,470
是不是会太挤吗
would make the house feel so crowded?

209
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,630
不  我不记得我们有担心过
Uh... no. I don't remember that at all.

210
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,950
我们错了
Oh, boy, were we wrong.

211
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,780
-你当初不想要我吗  -宝贝  这事跟你没关系
- You didn't want me? - This isn't about you, honey.

212
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,200
我猜你大爸有所图谋
I think Daddy's ramping up to something.

213
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,430
总之  橄榄球队有一名队员
Anyhoo, there's a football player on the team

214
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,170
需要找个地方住到赛...
who needs a place to stay until the end of football --

215
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,780
不  不  不行
No. No, no, no.

216
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,700
-能让我说完吗  -好  你说吧
- Would you let me finish? - Okay, fine. Go ahead.

217
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,780
季结束
Season.

218
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,160
不  他不能住这里
No. He can't stay here.

219
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
小卡  我们没有多的房间
Cam, we don't have the room.

220
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,410
他可以睡书房
He can sleep in the den.

221
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,100
我爱书房  我在书房里看电视
I love the den. I watch TV in the den.

222
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,800
另外  我们现在吵架之后你今晚睡哪里
Besides, where are you gonna sleep tonight after this fight?

223
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,340
他可以住楼上的公寓
He can sleep in the apartment upstairs?

224
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,120
不  我们需要租金来还贷款
No. We need the rent to pay the mortgage.

225
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,930
抱歉  小卡  这事没得商量
I'm sorry, Cam. It's not gonna happen.

226
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,850
教练  我能进来了吗
Coach, can I come in yet?

227
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,850
看  你现在害我陷入一个很尴尬的局面
See, now you've put me in an awkward position.

228
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,090
他为什么不能跟别人一起住
Why can't he stay with someone else?

229
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,790
因为我是他橄榄球教练而他父亲信任我
Because I'm his football coach, and his father trusts me.

230
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,420
小卡  你为什么总是...
Cam, why you always --

231
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,720
-你好  -你好
- Hey! - Hey!

232
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,030
-你好  -好啊
- Hi. - Hey.

233
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,960
你为什么每次做这种重大决定之前
Why do you always insist on making these big decisions

234
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,580
都不先跟我讨论一下
without discussing it with me first?

235
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,030
-我哪有  -你邀请我们
- I do not. - You asked that couple

236
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,030
在租车行碰见的那对夫妻跟我们一起度假
we met at the car-rental counter to vacation with us.

237
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,550
不邀请感觉很没礼貌啊
It would have been rude not to.

238
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,830
可那是我们的蜜月之旅啊
It was our honeymoon.

239
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,390
-抱歉  -门把手掉了
- Sorry, your... - doorknob came off.

240
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,350
-当然啦  大个子  -又掉啦
- It sure did, big guy! - Again?

241
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,220
好吧  那没关系
Okay, that's fine.

242
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,520
我已经有点受不了了
I'm already hating this.

243
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,000
我不想显得在嫌弃你
I don't want to be critical.

244
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,790
你不是吧
You got to be kidding me.

245
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,610
但这个特质是你比较不讨喜的一个
This is not one of your more loveable traits.

246
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,810
-什么特质  -就总是先拒绝一切
- What isn't? - Always saying "No" to things

247
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,650
虽然最终总会想通
and then eventually coming around.

248
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
我们为什么不能跳过不讨喜的部分呢
Why can't we just skip to the good part?

249
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,740
我觉得如果做这种单方面决定的人是我
I think you'd have a different attitude about this

250
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,530
你的态度肯定会不一样
if I was the one constantly making unilateral decisions.

251
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,540
如果是对你很重要的东西  我会支持你的
If it was something important to you, I would support it.

252
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,640
你真的确定吗
Oh. Are you sure about that?

253
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,750
百分之百  而且当你逐渐了解德怀特到
100%, and once you get to know Dwight the way...

254
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,910
像我一样了解他  你会发现他会增加...
I do, you will find that he will enrich --

255
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,080
好了  德怀特  快停止一切动作
Okay, Dwight, please stop moving.

256
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,860
你好  卢克
Hola, Luke!

257
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,370
你们来我屋里想做什么
Hey, guys. What are you doing in my room?

258
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,610
就想来看看我最喜欢的外孙
Just wanted to see my favorite grandson.

259
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,730
你们喝酒了吧
You guys been drinking?

260
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,890
量跟平常都差不多
No more than usual.

261
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
我听到一个传闻
I heard a rumor that you're running

262
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,130
说你要竞选学生会主席
for Student Council President.

263
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,930
是的  我正在写我的演讲稿
Yep. I'm working on my speech right now.

264
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,570
好吧
Good.

265
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,010
要我我肯定不想卷入这破事儿
I know I wouldn't want any part of that nonsense.

266
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,020
我也不想  这事不够性感
Me either -- not very sexy.

267
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,770
这需要花费很多时间  甚至导致你
It takes so much time and then you wouldn't

268
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,180
连骑你的迷你单车的机会都没有
even have a chance to ride your mini-bike.

269
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,210
我没有迷你单车
I don't have a mini-bike.

270
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,080
还没有  但如果你能够配合...
Yet. But if you play ball...

271
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,860
卢克
Hey, Luke,

272
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,990
你得帮我去...
I need you to take the --

273
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,340
你们在这里干什么呢
What are you guys doing in here?

274
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,320
他们想贿赂我不要去竞选主席
They're trying to bribe me not to run for president.

275
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
什么
What?

276
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,840
曼尼多年来努力想当上学生会主席
Manny has been working all his life to be president,

277
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,810
现在卢克大摇大摆横插一脚
and now Luke just salsas in

278
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,360
想夺了曼尼的主席地位
and tries to take it away from him.

279
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,500
这不公平
It's not fair.

280
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,610
听着  这对卢克也很重要
Look, this means a lot to Luke, too.

281
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,290
这给他全新的目标感
It's given him a whole new sense of purpose.

282
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,620
我听够了  我心意已决
I've heard enough, and I've made my decision.

283
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,580
曼尼这学期当主席
Manny will be president this term,

284
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,490
明年我们再帮卢克竞选
and we'll run Luke next year.

285
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,420
我就要毕业了
I'm graduating.

286
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,090
就是这种精神
That's the spirit!

287
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,170
我不想来这一招
I don't like to play this card,

288
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,500
但我是大家长  我发话了
but I am the patriarch, and I have spoken.

289
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,700
这招行不通  老爸  因为我懒得鸟你
Not much of a card, Dad, 'cause I don't really care.

290
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,030
不如你们两个快点离开
So, how about the two of you get going,

291
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,860
因为卢克要准备发言稿了
because Luke has a speech to work on?

292
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,740
你想跟普里契特家的政治机器对着干
You want to go up against the Pritchett political machine?

293
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,590
就这么着吧
So be it.

294
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,840
-再见  外公  -再见  孩子
- Bye, Grandpa! - Bye, kiddo!

295
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,590
卢克  我们需要谈谈
All right, Luke, we need to talk.

296
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,990
外公要冲你来了
Grandpa is coming for you,

297
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,430
他可是曾成功助人赢得竞选
and he has run successful political campaigns before.

298
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,520
他在同性恋还被歧视时
He got Mitchell elected class president

299
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,240
就让米奇尔当选班长
before it was cool to be gay.

300
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,340
我能行的  老妈
I've got this, Mom.

301
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,250
我会在炮台上竞选
I'm running on a gun platform.

302
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,360
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

303
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
我在说  我这两管大炮
I'm talking about... my guns.

304
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,270
好了  来看看你的发言稿
All right, let's look at the speech.

305
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,790
我觉得相当好
I think it's pretty good.

306
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,310
我开场先开布朗校长那几个孩子
I'm opening with a joke about how Principal Brown's kids

307
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,900
看着都像邮递员的玩笑
look like the mailman.

308
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,290
全选  删除
And select all, delete.

309
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,210
我必须做自己
Hey! I got to be me.

310
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,790
不  你必须不像自己
No, you got to be less you.

311
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,100
如果你想赢  就要比曼尼更曼尼
If you want this, you got to out-Manny Manny.

312
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,350
艾丽克斯毕业时我给你买的西服呢
Oh! Where's that suit I got you for Alex's graduation?

313
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,230
都过一年了
That was a year ago.

314
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,770
我现在穿不上了
I can't fit into that anymore,

315
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,040
因为我的两管大...
because of my gu--

316
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,180
知道了  别说了
I know, I got it.

317
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,530
这本来是满的
This was full.

318
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,490
对不起
Sorry.

319
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
你会失望的
You're just gonna be disappointed.

320
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,870
大家早上好啊
Good morning, everyone.

321
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,550
如果你饿了  我在烤面包机后藏了几块饼干
If you're hungry, I hid some cookies behind the toaster.

322
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,510
被我找到了
I found them.

323
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,080
我想了想你昨天说的话
Oh, I was thinking about what you said yesterday,

324
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,030
你说得对
and you were right.

325
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,380
我们应该能自己做决定
We should be able to make our own decisions, you know?

326
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,400
我只能说  再次谢谢你
Ay, all I can say is, thank you again.

327
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,270
戴恩·艾德娜  跟你的养父们问好
Dane Edna, say hi to your foster daddies.

328
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,590
罗纳多  这是什么情况
Ronaldo, what's going on?

329
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,800
我们要在罗纳多带胡娇
Oh, we're taking care of Dane Edna

330
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,280
去亚洲做手术期间照顾戴恩·艾德娜
while Ronaldo takes Pepper to Asia for a medical procedure.

331
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
他没事
Is everything okay?

332
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,390
别担心
Oh, don't worry.

333
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,600
别说出去  他要去老挝做个下巴沟
Between us, he's getting a monkey chin in Laos.

334
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,940
所以这个月大家都有乐子
Oh, so it's a fun month for everyone, huh?

335
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,900
我会想念这个美丽天后的
Mm, I'm going to miss this beautiful diva.

336
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,820
她的胃有点挑剔
Her tummy can get a little fussy,

337
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,970
所以如果你们不确定该给她做什么吃
so if you're ever wondering what to cook for her,

338
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,500
问问自己"帕蒂·卢波恩会吃什么"
just ask yourself, "What would Patti LuPone eat?"

339
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,500
{\an8}知名百老汇老牌女明星

340
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
抱歉  我没问你的意见
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I didn't ask you about this,

341
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,810
但这真的对我很重要
but it's really important to me.

342
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,030
你也说过会支持我的任何决定
And you said you'd support any decision I made.

343
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,960
我不知道你在做什么
I'm not sure what you're doing,

344
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,660
因为你如此难以捉摸
because you're being so subtle,

345
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,000
但如果你觉得这个家里需要
but if you think a giant, slobbery dog

346
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,180
一条流着口水的大狗  那么我绝对配合
is what this household needs, then color me gung ho.

347
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,760
这是她的药
Here are her medicines.

348
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,760
-箔纸包装的是从菊花塞  -好
- The ones wrapped in foil don't go in the mouth. - Okay.

349
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,850
对了  我很抱歉
Ah, yeah. I'm so sorry.

350
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,630
我们训练她要把碳水化合物带离我们身边
We've trained her to take carbs away from us.

351
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,020
我无法理解
I don't get it.

352
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,720
你看着超棒  我爱极了
You look amazing. I love it!

353
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,900
你为什么给我买这身衣服
Why did you buy this for me?

354
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,310
因为我觉得你在台上演讲时
'Cause I thought you would look great up there

355
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,880
穿这套会很帅
when you give your big speech.

356
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,000
我在竞选主席  老妈  我要穿西服打领带
I'm running for president, Mom. I'll wear a suit and tie.

357
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,420
那你就可以直接穿去自己的葬礼了
Well, then you'll be dressed for your funeral.

358
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,880
孩子  你得了解你的观众
Kid, you got to know your audience.

359
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,570
你不认为我能和同龄人有共鸣啊
You don't think I can relate to my peers?

360
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
那这下真是完了个蛋
Well, this is a fine kettle of fish.

361
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,260
我会尽可能温柔地说
I'm gonna say this as gently as I know how...

362
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,460
你会输掉
You're going to lose!

363
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,290
我没打算吼出来  但至少你知道了
Well, I wasn't gonna yell it, but at least it's out there.

364
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,350
等等  你觉得我会输
Wait. You think I'm going to lose?

365
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,070
但你从未觉得我会输过
But you never think I'm going to lose!

366
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,230
听着  你是个好孩子
Look, you're a great kid.

367
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,320
我们只是想说多点便装星期五风
All we're saying is be a little more Casual Friday,

368
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,930
少点圣灰星期三[基督教大斋首日]风
a little less Ash Wednesday.

369
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,600
是啊  走上台说些
Yeah. Go up there and be like,

370
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,150
"你们好啊  牛逼兄弟们"
"Yo! What's up, ballers?!"

371
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,940
"星期一放假  去吃点披萨什么的"
"Mondays off. Like, pizza and whatever."

372
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,280
感觉有点奇怪
This is feeling a little weird.

373
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,140
相信我们
Trust us.

374
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,620
你们觉得有用我就听话
If you really think it'll help.

375
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,390
趁着没忘  把披萨饼的事记下来
Hey, write that pizza-pie thing down while it's fresh.

376
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,940
希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind.

377
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,390
我同意他们在房子里玩取物游戏
I decided it was fine if they played fetch in the house.

378
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,380
没问题  我支持这个决定
Not at all. I support that decision.

379
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,970
我真期待接下来会发生什么
Well, I look forward to what's about to happen.

380
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,380
-好吧  -取到了
- Okay. - There we are.

381
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,470
-好了  -很好
- All right. - Nice.

382
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,380
我出发了  教练  比赛见
Okay, Coach. I'll meet you at the game.

383
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,570
好  谁是冠军
Yes! Who's a winner?

384
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,660
-我是冠军  -谁是冠军
- I'm a winner! - Who's a winner?!

385
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,730
我是冠军
I'm a winner!!

386
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,080
老天
Oh, my...

387
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,030
好吧  我先说
Okay. I'm gonna go first.

388
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,670
我小心眼  故意报复
I was petty and vindictive,

389
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,910
我会找别人照顾这条狗
and I will find someone else to look after the dog.

390
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,830
你有要说的吗
Do you have anything to say?

391
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,480
谢谢你  我知道让你说这话有多不容易
Thank you. I know that couldn't have been easy.

392
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,170
小卡  我对天发誓
Cam, I swear to God --

393
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,130
好好  你说的对
Okay, okay. You're right.

394
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,320
我应该先跟你商量的
I should have consulted you first.

395
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,020
今晚的比赛结束后
I'll tell Dwight that he has to move out

396
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,120
我会告诉德怀特他必须搬出去
after the game tonight.

397
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
谢谢你
Thank you.

398
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,060
虽然你们不在乎  但还是说一声
Not that anybody cares, but for lunch,

399
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,580
我午饭只吃到一粒润喉糖
I had a lozenge.

400
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,040
这事多久能办完
So, uh, how long is this going to take?

401
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,330
我只是需要再订一些宣传用的飞盘
I just need to reorder some promotional Frisbees,

402
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,020
顺便和梅尔夫打声招呼
and say a quick hi to Merv,

403
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,960
这位天才在过去十多年里
the genius who supplied me with coasters

404
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,020
一直帮我做杯垫和钥匙链
and key chains for over a decade.

405
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,850
他甚至还把我的脸印在枕头上呢
He even put my face on a pillow.

406
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,990
这个故事让我想找个枕头来闷死自己
That story makes me want to put a pillow over my face.

407
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,310
咱速战速决行吗  我四点还得去做美黑
Can we just get this over with? I have a spray tan at 4:00.

408
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,140
美黑  谁需要做美黑
Spray tan! Who needs a spray tan?

409
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,300
冬天没得晒太阳的人需要
Someone in winter.

410
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,020
所以美黑优惠劵就得跟冰铲配
That's why you put a coupon on a ice scraper.

411
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,700
厉害吧  又挣够钱送我一个孙子去好大学
Boom! Just sent another grandkid to Brandeis.

412
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,610
他一出手  就是正中红心
He shoots, he scores!

413
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,630
你能相信这位青年才俊的孙子都上大学了吗
Can you believe this young man has a grandkid in college?

414
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,210
年轻与否都是由生活方式决定的
Mm! It's all about lifestyle.

415
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,930
真的  我每天健走八公里
Really, I walk five miles a day,

416
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,560
还做过一大堆整形手术
and I've had a tremendous amount of plastic surgery.

417
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,800
关于你那幢急于卖出去的房产
Oh! I had a brainstorm on that property of yours

418
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,790
我脑力激荡了一番
that you're trying to unload.

419
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,210
就是死过人那幢
You know, where the people -- Ckkk!

420
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,960
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,010
你把它当成卖点
You lean into it. Hmm?

422
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,160
你叫它"大屠杀庄园"
You-You call it "Massacre Manor,"

423
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,580
"唐顿墓园"
"Downton Stabby,"

424
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,950
"杀人魔曼森[大宅]"
"Charles Mansion."

425
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,380
类似的双关梗我能想出无数个
I mean, like, I-I got a million of them.

426
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,370
其实大概还能想出仨
Actually, I probably -- I have three more.

427
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,030
瞧见没  大师
See? A master.

428
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,550
梅尔夫  这是我女儿海莉
Aww. Merv, meet my daughter Haley.

429
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,470
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

430
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,760
你爸告诉我
Your daddy tells me

431
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,820
你被麦德逊大道[广告业]的热情感染了
that you have come down with the Madison Avenue flu.

432
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,960
他说的话我一个字都听不懂
I don't understand anything that's happening here.

433
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,170
我看《嘻哈帝国》时也是这种感觉
I feel the same way when I watch "Empire."

434
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,240
不是吧你
Oh! No, you don't!

435
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,420
有只脏猫总是坐到我新买的劳斯莱斯顶上
Some mangy cat keeps sitting on the roof of my new Rolls.

436
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,870
梅尔夫收集名车
Merv collects cars.

437
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,460
不是我显摆  但我收集的车
Not to brag, but I could do a production

438
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,070
都够拍《十二怒汉》汽车版了
of "12 Angry Men" starring cars.

439
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,880
不是吧你  太妃喵
No, you don't, Taffy!

440
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,830
他的话是什么意思
What-What is he talking about?

441
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,420
感染麦德逊大道的热情是什么
What's Madison Avenue flu?

442
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,370
我好像跟他提过
Oh. I-I may have mentioned that you had a --

443
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,240
你对宣传推广行业萌生了兴趣
a budding interest in the promotional arts,

444
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,190
撞大运的是  梅尔夫的助手
and, total stroke of luck, Merv's assistant

445
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,120
得了很重很重的病
is very, very sick.

446
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,350
等等  你觉得我的事业
Wait a minute. You think my business

447
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,100
和"卡尔的改车行"马桶座圈
is in the same universe as

448
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,630
是同一个宇宙里吗
Carl's Auto Body toilet seat covers?

449
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,380
多亏那个宝贝的福
Carl just opened a third location

450
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,970
卡尔刚刚开了第三家分店了
because of that wizard.

451
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,970
你只剩两条命了  太妃喵
You got two lives left, Taffy!

452
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,210
你就打算这么用这两条命吗
Is this how you want to spend them?!

453
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,250
我不需要找工作  我已经有工作了
I don't need a job. I have one.

454
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,650
你不是"懂你"战队的吗
What happened to "Team Gets It"?

455
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,900
其实我不懂
Well, I don't gets it.

456
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,990
看起来你只是混在舞厅里
Just seems like you're hanging out at clubs

457
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,030
和一群派对女拍照而已
taking pictures with a bunch of party girls.

458
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,190
我也想当个潮爸
I mean, I want to be hip,

459
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,740
但我压根搞不懂这些是在干嘛
but none of this makes any sense to me.

460
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,400
我只是希望你能得到最好的
I just want what's best for you.

461
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,230
多谢"激励"  也多谢你小看我
Nice pep talk. Oh, and thanks for underestimating me.

462
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,110
{\an8}爆米花大亨

463
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,110
如果你是奥威尔·瑞登巴克的爹
You know, if you were Orville Redenbacher's dad,

464
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,920
{\an8}海莉把他和奥维尔·莱特搞混了

465
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,870
飞机永远不会被发明出来
we wouldn't have airplanes!

466
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,920
打败你了
Got ya!

467
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,060
看来九命怪猫也不代表就能次次命大
I guess they don't always land on their feet.

468
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,030
触地得分
Touchdown!

469
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,990
那个德怀特真是厉害
That Dwight's something, huh?

470
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,590
是啊  他还行吧
Yeah! Well, he's fine, you know.

471
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,780
这是项团体性运动
It's-It's a team sport,

472
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,760
他要是不在了大概都没人会想他
so, you know, they probably wouldn't even miss him.

473
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,680
我只想说一句
I just want to say

474
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,110
-我很欣赏您的选择  -谢谢
- I love what you're doing. - Well, thank you.

475
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,050
我都是用这种裤子来搭这件毛衣
I-I wear this sweater with these trousers a lot.

476
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,920
当你的腰部很高
When you're high-waisted,

477
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
要找到能相衬的上下身衣裤真的很难...
it is very difficult finding pieces that work together, so...

478
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,060
你的确看起来很时髦  但她的意思是
Yeah, you look really nice, but what she means is

479
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,920
您选择让德怀特住在你们家的举动很高尚
it's great that you're letting Dwight live with you.

480
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
你收留了德怀特吗
You're taking Dwight in?

481
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,780
-听起来不像你的作风啊  -这个
- That doesn't sound like you. - It's -- It's --

482
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,180
他要逼他搬出去
He's making him move out.

483
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,500
那听起来倒像你的作风
That sounds like you.

484
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,660
你们好  废柴们
Hey, losers.

485
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,270
我就感觉在小卖部[老人站牌]看到的是你
Thought I'd see you down at the concession stand.

486
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,860
你想了多久才想到这个双关语
How long were you working on that one?

487
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,730
这是你给卢克写的演讲稿里的笑话吗
Is that one of the gems that you wrote into Luke's speech?

488
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,220
我告诉你们  卢克的演讲稿是他自己写的
I will have you know that Luke wrote his own speech.

489
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,010
他参与了写作
He contributed.

490
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,750
他在场而已
He was there. Mm.

491
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,470
你这身西装是怎么回事
What's with the suit?

492
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,240
还说我  你为什么穿得跟女歌手麻辣鸡似的
Me? Why are you dressed like Nicki Minaj?

493
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,270
我妈和杰说这样会让我更能引起共鸣
My mom and Jay said it made me more relatable.

494
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,410
我觉得自己像个白痴一样
I feel like an idiot.

495
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,890
是啊  我也是
Yeah. Me too.

496
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,780
我妈逼我穿成这样  好让我更像你
My mom forced me to wear this so I'd be more like you.

497
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,230
说得好像我会用棕色皮带配黑皮鞋一样
Yeah, because I'd wear a brown belt with black shoes?

498
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
你知道我们该怎么做吗
You know what we should do?

499
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,160
弃稿  发自内心去演讲
Throw out our speeches and speak from the heart.

500
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,010
真是个好主意
That's a great idea.

501
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,480
你忘带演讲稿了是不是
Mm. You forgot your speech, didn't you?

502
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,780
{\an8}应该是第五修正案  即不能自证其罪

503
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,780
我要行使第二修正案法
I plead the second.

504
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,420
另外你们该知道
Also, uh, You should know,

505
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,010
三个行凶者里已经有两个被抓到了
they arrested two of the three perpetrators.

506
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,210
宝贝  你来这做什么
Hey, honey. What are you doing here?

507
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,400
证明自己
Making a point.

508
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,780
你们好
Oh. Hey.

509
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,460
我是菲尔·邓菲
Uh, I-I'm Phil Dunphy.

510
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,430
有问题的话  尽管问
Feel free to ask any... questions.

511
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,700
脖子上的纹身不错
Sweet neck tattoo.

512
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,470
别忘了在访客登记簿上签名
Don't forget to sign the guest book.

513
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,380
这些不是你工作上的朋友吗
Aren't these your, uh -- your work friends?

514
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,340
没错  等一下
Yeah. Hold on a second.

515
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,140
亚利桑那  你又撅鸭子嘴了
Hey, Arizona! Quack quack.

516
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,400
抱歉
Sorry.

517
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,280
我知道你不认为我做的是正经工作
Look, I know you don't think what I'm doing is real,

518
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,470
但我们刚刚才通过我们在各个平台上的账号
but we just posted about this terrible house

519
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,270
发布了这间烂房子的出售信息
through all our accounts on multiple platforms,

520
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,870
现在慕名而来的人已经一大堆了
and there's already a ton of people here,

521
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,540
所以说  不用谢啦
so, uh, you're welcome.

522
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,800
我们真不需要搞这些  但好吧
We don't really need all this stuff, but okay.

523
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,630
好了  各位观众
All right, everybody.

524
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,720
在我们的仪仗队粉墨登场
Before our marching band takes the field

带来致敬扎克·埃夫隆系列电影的表演之前

{\an8}美国男演员  曾出演众多青春与歌舞电影

527
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,220
让我们有请两位候选人
let's hear from our two candidates

528
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,960
带来他们学生会主席的竞选演讲
for Student Council President.

529
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,270
首先出场的是曼尼·迪尔加多
First up is Manny Delgado.

530
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,300
实际上  我们打算一起完成这次演讲

531
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,010
卢克和我站在这里  是希望赢得你们的投票
Luke and I are here because we each want your votes.

532
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,230
然而  某些人却一心想改变我们
However, certain people want to change us

533
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,220
让我们变得完全不像我们自己
into being something each of us is not.

534
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,010
-他们居然这样公开羞辱我们  -是我们自找的
- They're publicly shaming us. - We deserve it.

535
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,680
最重要的是你们两位家长学到教训
The important thing is you two learned something.

536
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,070
省省吧  大家长
Save it, patriarch.

537
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,130
我们想说的是  我们是两个
The point is, we are two individuals

538
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,050
拥有着截然不同的个性和想法的人
with our own unique personalties and ideas.

539
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,810
他说得没错
What he said.

540
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,870
最后我赢了
I won.

541
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,840
这次创了学校历史上最低的投票记录
It was the lowest voter turnout in school history.

542
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,330
选民讨厌我们俩个
They hated the both of us.

543
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,750
不过讨厌你更多一点
But you more.

544
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,510
我不得不承认  我确实有点佩服你真的带来了
I got to admit, I'm really impressed that you got

545
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,470
这么一大屋子人  不过他们...
all these people here, but they, um --

546
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,710
看起来不太像会买房子的人
they don't really look like house buyers.

547
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,060
爸  你完全不会看这年代的有钱人
Dad, you have no idea who has money anymore.

548
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,980
看到那个女孩了吗
You see that girl?

549
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,430
她靠玩电脑游戏就能赚进六位数
She makes six figures playing video games.

550
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,550
还有那个男的  他发明了一个应用
And that dude, he invented an app

551
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,550
专门用来吐槽朋友  叫做最佳"损"友
for trashing your friends called App Smear.

552
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,570
他们里面随便谁都买得起这房子
Oh. Any one of these people could buy this house.

553
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,000
而如果他们买下了  我们从你的佣金中抽头
And if they do, you give us a percentage of your commission.

554
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,460
这就是我们的生财之道
That's how we make money.

555
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,510
你是这个房子的中介吗
You the realtor?

556
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,600
正是在下
Indeed, I am.

557
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,160
我挺喜欢这里的
I like this place.

能指给我看看凶案发生的地方吗
Show me where it happened.

559
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,750
就在...这个走廊的尽头
Um, it's...right down this hall.

560
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,830
您先请
After you.

561
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,890
她爸爸可有钱了
Her dad's loaded.

562
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,670
顺便提一下  你看过房子的价格了吗
By the way, have you seen the price?

563
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,540
房东不是这里唯一被砍过的东西  还有房价
The, uh -- The owner wasn't the only thing that's been slashed.

564
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,140
海豚队获胜  21比20
And the Dolphins win, 21-20.

565
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,010
厉害了我的弟
All right!

566
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,860
那个男孩就像职业选手一样
That boy is like a professional.

567
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,860
一个男孩就差不多带整队赢了  太厉害了
It's amazing how one kid can carry a whole team.

568
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,160
我感觉你就是故意说给我听的
I feel like you're doing this on purpose.

569
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
打扰了  普里契特先生
Excuse me, Mr. Pritchett.

570
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,620
我是莱斯丽·关·柯林斯  《每日海豚报》的记者

571
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,220
因为如英雄般收留了德怀特这件事
For heroically taking in Dwight,

572
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,900
您被评为了本月的"海豚杰出人士"
you are this month's "Person with a Porpoise."

573
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,380
这我不敢当...
I don't know about that...

574
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,400
接受吧
Embrace it.

575
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,840
你跟我过来一下
Hey, come over here for just minute, buddy.

576
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
打得好  打得好
Good game! Good game.

577
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,910
-谢谢教练  -没事
- Thanks, Coach. - Yes.

578
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,600
听我说  我有一个你难以接受的事得告诉你
So, listen, I got something kind of rough I need to tell you.

579
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,930
我知道你跟米奇尔不只是室友那么简单
No, I know you and Mitchell aren't just roommates.

580
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,190
我对你的感恩之情难以言喻
I can't tell you how much I appreciate

581
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,470
你为我做的一切我十分感谢
everything you're doing for me.

582
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,500
听我说  我也不知道该怎么跟你开口
Yeah, listen, I don't know how I'm gonna tell you this.

583
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,600
所以我就不说了
So I'm not gonna.

584
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,100
我要你接下来按我说的每句话做
I just need you to do everything I tell you.

585
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,440
把你的头靠到我肩上
Put your head on my shoulder.

586
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,720
就是这样  靠上来
That's it. Get in there.

587
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,980
然后我要你假装你开始哭了
Now, I need you to pretend to start crying,

588
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,450
肩膀多放点感情
really get those shoulders into it.

589
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,200
没错  这样很棒
Yeah, that's it. That's good.

590
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,100
天啊  天啊  他告诉他了
Oh, God. Oh, God. He's telling him.

591
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,420
-别心软  -没错
- Stay strong. - Yes.

592
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,790
现在我要开始哭了  对不起
Now I'm gonna cry. I'm sorry!

593
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,720
我对不起你
I'm sorry!

594
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
好了  最后一步
Okay, final step --

595
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,780
你得坐下  抱住自己膝盖
I just need you to sit down, grab your knees,

596
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,750
然后边摇晃边难过  懂吗
and start rocking sadly, all right?

597
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,950
好了  坐下
All right, sit.

598
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,840
打扰一下  请大家听我说几句
Excuse me. Can I have everyone's attention, please?

599
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,060
想必大家都知道  德怀特的父亲最近被
As you know, uh, Dwight's father was recently restationed

600
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,700
调到佛罗里达驻扎  而我是一开始是想
to Florida and it was my intention to have my family

601
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,200
让德怀特到我家一起住  但不幸的是...
have Dwight live with us, but unfortunately --

602
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,230
不幸的是我们球队的对手啊
But unfortunately for our opponents,

603
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,570
他整季都会一直在队里
he's gonna be with us all season,

604
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,250
