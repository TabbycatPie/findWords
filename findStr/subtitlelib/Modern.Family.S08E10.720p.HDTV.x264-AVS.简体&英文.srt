-杰  -欢迎欢迎
- Hey, Jay. - Welcome!

31
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,420
在杰家过元旦
New Year's Day at Jay's.

32
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,120
我爸正开车过来
My dad was driving in.

33
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,650
经历了上午的挫折后  一切都在好转
Things were looking up after a bad morning.

34
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,110
-乖乖  -真厉害
- Oh! Yeah! - Oh, man!

35
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,390
看看它飞得多高啊
Look how high it goes!

36
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,580
我到时候要试试朝小鸟吐口水
I'm gonna try and spit on a bird.

37
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,720
那哥们是刚坐完下来吗
Did he just get off the ride?

38
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,190
亲爱的  我有点打退堂鼓了
You know, honey, um, I'm getting cold feet.

39
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,900
不然我们还是...
Maybe we should just --

40
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,820
如果你害怕我们就走吧
Well, if you're scared, we should just go.

41
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,740
我很失望  因为在我看来肯定会很爽的
I'm disappointed, 'cause to me, it seemed like a blast.

42
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,300
我的新年新决心是活得更刺激
My resolution to live more dangerously

43
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,050
结果出师不利
was off to a rocky start.

44
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,010
自己去拆我准备的圣诞礼物吧
Help yourself to my Christmas present.

45
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,790
天下最爽的就是在热水浴缸里喝冰鸡尾酒
Nothing like a frozen margarita in a hot tub.

46
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,350
让自然母亲知道她能做的事我们也都能做到
Lets nature know we can do anything she can.

47
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,660
我带走喝
Well, I'll take one to go.

48
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,830
艾丽克斯和我是要来你们的衣橱里
Alex and I are just here to raid your guys' closet

49
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,160
搜刮复古服装而来
for some vintage clothing.

50
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,680
我们要去一个九十年代风格的音乐节
Yeah, we're going to a '90s music festival

51
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,760
叫"当然90音乐节"
called Fo-shizzle-fest.

52
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,760
准备好吃烤猪撑到爆吧
Okay, get ready to pig out!

53
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
6到8小时后才能撑到爆
In six to eight hours.

54
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,570
我负责做去年的感恩节晚宴
I did Thanksgiving dinner last year,

55
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,760
结果没做好
and it didn't go well.

56
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
小卡把火鸡弄爆炸了
Cam blew up the turkey

57
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,580
吓得山羊撞墙自杀
and made the goat kill itself.

58
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,330
总之今天的元旦大餐我要强势回归
Anyhoo, today is my comeback meal,

59
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,720
我决定一切从简  做烤全猪
and I decided to keep it simple and roast a pig.

60
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,200
你先挖个坑
So, you just dig a hole,

61
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,910
铺一层炭  再盖一层蕉叶
you put down a bed of coals, then a layer of banana leaves,

62
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,370
把猪放进去  再用麻布和锡纸包住
lower the pig, cover it with burlap and tin foil,

63
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,450
然后是见证奇迹的时刻
and -- Bam!

64
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,420
6小时后挖出来
Six hours later, you dig it all up,

65
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,310
放到盘子上  又是见证奇迹的时刻
put it on a platter, and Bam!

66
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,530
晚餐就上桌了
dinner is served.

67
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,070
小伙子们
Guys,

68
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,820
不要以为你们的圣诞是在密苏里过的
just because you spent Christmas in Missouri

69
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,310
我们就把你们忘了
doesn't mean that we forgot about you.

70
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,340
拆礼物吧
Open your presents.

71
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,260
好  我先拆
Oh, okay! I'll go first.

72
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,910
瞧瞧
Uh, let's see.

73
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,230
是电子管家的礼品券
Oh, it's a gift certificate for E-Butler.

74
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,870
是礼宾服务
It's a concierge service.

75
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,190
你可以用它做跑腿  买票之类的杂务
Use it for errands, tickets, things like that.

76
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,230
我的天  我太喜欢了
Oh my God. I love this!

77
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,300
就像住在酒店一样
It's like staying in a hotel,

78
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,200
但我用遥控器时不必戴手套防细菌
but I don't have to wear gloves to use the remote.

79
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,780
好了  到我了到我了
Okay, me next. Me next.

80
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,050
是条围裙  上面还带铃铛
Oh... it's an apron with-with bells on it.

81
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,500
上面还写着"过来卡一下"
And it says, "Cam and get it!"

82
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,750
所以这个不是拼写错误吗
Oh, so that's not a mistake?

83
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,220
我额外加钱定做的
We spent extra cash to get that custom made.

84
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,340
我在梦中想到的好点子
Came to me in a dream.

85
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,300
穿上吧  伙计
Put it on, buddy.

86
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,110
我们照一张你们拿着礼物的照片
Let's, uh-Let's get pictures with you guys and your gifts.

87
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,570
杰  歌洛莉亚  你们也一起来
Jay and Gloria, get in there too.

88
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,100
来吧  亲爱的  咱也去
Come on, honey. Let's go.

89
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,100
-天啊  -我帮你系
- Oh, boy. - I'll tie it.

90
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,310
-不用  -好吧
- No, you won't. - All right.

91
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,220
我就说斯黛拉想杀我
I told you Stella was trying to kill me!

92
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,290
-刚才真是吓死人了  -又没出事
- Well, that was a scare. - Nothing happened.

93
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,860
我知道你想说什么
I know where you're going with this.

94
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,330
这就是为什么我一直追着你
This is why I've been hounding you

95
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,440
要你做遗产规划
about your estate planning.

96
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,050
不  米奇
No, Mitch.

97
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,290
不要朝宇宙释放这种负能量
Don't put that horrible thing out in the universe!

98
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,660
爸  你还没做遗产规划吗
Dad, you still haven't done that?

99
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,420
自从乔出生以来他们都没修订过文件
They haven't updated their paperwork since Joe was born.

100
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,100
老天保佑  但万一他们遇到不测了呢
Uh, God forbid something bad should happen to them.

101
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,060
我们都不知道他们想让谁做乔的监护人
We don't even know who'd they want to raise Joe.

102
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,240
你别吓她了行吗
Will you stop scaring her?

103
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,100
至今我花在种睫毛上面的钱
I spend more money on eyelashes

104
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,560
{\an8}吹走掉下来的睫毛可以许愿

105
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,560
已经比你们好多人的医保钱都多了
than most of you do on health care.

106
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
好吧  我今天就做
Fine, we'll do it today.

107
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,560
开始新一年的方式那么多
What better way to start the new year

108
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,470
但有什么能比准备身后事更"开心"
than by preparing for the worst?

109
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,110
说到还生龙活虎的老爸
Speaking of alive dads,

110
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,610
我爸来啦
there's mine! Oh!

111
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,040
见到你太好了
So good to see you!

112
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,050
一路开车过来顺利吗
How was the drive?

113
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,050
棒极了
Fantastic.

114
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,440
开到佛州塔拉哈西时我的收音机坏了
My radio broke around Tallahassee.

115
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,450
但哪里有比美国公路上的广告牌
But is there a better entertainment source

116
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,290
更有趣的娱乐内容呢
than the billboards of America?

117
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,650
根据广告来看  梅毒又要祸害众生了
Apparently, syphilis is making a comeback.

118
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,030
再说  你还有我陪你解闷呢
Plus, you had me to keep you company.

119
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,690
洛林
Lorraine?

120
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,580
洛林是照顾我长大的保姆
Lorraine was my babysitter growing up.

121
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,080
我第一次春心荡漾的对象也是她
She was also my first crush

122
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,240
我第一次做"那啥梦"  梦见的也是她
and also the star of my first, um... "funny dream."

123
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,230
当年菲尔一见到洛林就调皮捣蛋
Yeah, Lorraine used to bring out the holy terror in Phil.

124
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,290
好像他故意想被洛林打屁股似的
It seemed like he wanted to be spanked by her.

125
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,410
我才没有
No, I did not.

126
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,110
你们在一起多久了
How long has this been going on?

127
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,010
我们今年早些时候做陪审团时重新联系上的
Well, we reconnected earlier this year on jury duty.

128
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,880
三重凶杀案  只有我坚持认为凶手无罪
I was the lone holdout on a triple homicide case.

129
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,330
当被告是无辜的时候你是能感应到的
You can just feel when someone is innocent, you know?

130
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,630
但洛林说如果我改投有罪
But Lorraine said she'd go out to lunch with me

131
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,030
她就陪我吃午饭
if I changed my vote,

132
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,270
所以我们就在一起了
so here we are.

133
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,600
-菲尔  你做梦都没想到  -没"梦"过
- Phil, did-did you ever dream -- - No.

134
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,940
我上次见到你时
Last time I saw you,

135
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,300
你还在我胸口
you came up to here.

136
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,780
好了  克莱尔会带你们从那边去后院
Okay, Claire will take you that way to the back yard.

137
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,550
我会从房子里穿过去
I'll go through the house

138
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,270
这样我们就终于能知道哪条路比较快了
so we can finally know which way's faster.

139
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,830
好了  只要回答几个简单的问题
Okay, just a few simple questions,

140
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,670
你们的遗产规划就做好了
and your estate planning is done.

141
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,770
这是什么
What is this?

142
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,070
我们不用额外准备一笔钱给曼尼上大学
We don't need to put aside money for Manny's college.

143
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,410
钱我早就攒够了
I already took care of it.

144
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,290
曼尼出生的时候  我不想依靠任何人
When Manny was born, I didn't want to rely on anyone,

145
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,380
所以我开始把一部分薪水攒起来
so I started saving money from my paycheck.

146
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,590
最后就把曼尼上大学的钱攒出来了
Eventually, I made enough money for Manny's college,

147
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,650
这样如果有什么不测  他也不会有事
so if anything happens, he'll be okay.

148
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,610
真了不起
That's amazing.

149
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,270
我看银行财务报表的时候怎么没发现
How did I not see this in the bank statements?

150
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,970
我为什么要把我有可能哪天
Why would I put money that I might need

151
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,120
就需要带着跑路的钱存进银行呢
to run away with in the middle of night in the bank?

152
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,850
我把它放在跑路包里
I put it in my disappear bag.

153
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,000
虽然这事很难不往心里去  但是...
It's hard not to take that personally, but, um,

154
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,310
那包在哪
where is this bag?

155
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,120
在...
It's in...in...

156
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,780
-你忘了 -不可能
- You forgot? - No.

157
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,990
我特地编了首歌
That's why I made a song

158
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,340
好帮我想起来它在哪
so that it would always help me remember.

159
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,940
* 我的跑路小包  我的跑路小包 *
* My disappear bag, my disappear bag *

160
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,530
* 我把你安全地藏在... *
* I hid you very safely in the *

161
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,460
我不知道了
I don't know.

162
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,400
失陪一下
One second.

163
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,710
小卡  我们要干嘛
Okay, Cam, what are we --

164
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,810
你冷静点
Okay. Just -- Just be cool.

165
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,870
-冷静一点 -怎么冷静[酷]
- Just be cool. - Be cool?

166
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,580
你刚像个乡村手摇鼓一样叮叮当当穿过花园
You just jangled across the yard like a big country tambourine.

167
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,650
好吧  貌似
All right, well, apparently,

168
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,890
火刚熄灭了  而我没注意到
the fire went out and I didn't notice,

169
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,470
现在这只猪冷得就像待会你家人发现
and now this pig is as cold as your family is gonna be

170
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,090
我又搞砸了一顿饭时的气氛一样冰冷
when they figure out I ruined another meal.

171
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,110
这很糟糕
Okay, this is bad.

172
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,240
我爸不喜欢被猪肉吊胃口
My dad does not like to be pork teased.

173
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,180
也许我们能搞到另一只猪来代替它
Well, maybe we can get a replacement pig.

174
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,290
-你觉得你的礼宾卡好使吗 -什么
- Do you think your concierge thing could help out? - Wha--

175
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,240
但我今天才刚得到它
But I just got it today,

176
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,310
而且卡上写了  "专为米奇服务"
and -- and the card says, "For Mitch stuff."

177
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,510
米奇尔  我的一个新年愿望
Mitchell, one of my resolutions

178
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,320
就是在外面少流眼泪
was to cry less outside the home.

179
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,300
求你帮我度过今天的难关吧
Please help me get through this day. Gosh.

180
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,580
你知道他们只买给我六个小时的服务时间吧
You know they only got me six hours, right?

181
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,010
我知道  谢谢你
I know. Thank you.

182
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,810
好吧
Okay.

183
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,460
感谢您致电电子管家  普里契特先生
Thank you for calling E-Butler, Mr. Pritchett.

184
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,570
我能为您做些什么让您的生活更"电"捷
How may I make your day more E-fficient?

185
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,520
我有一个奇怪的请求
Okay, um, well, this is a weird request.

186
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,770
友情提醒  色情服务双倍收费
Keep in mind, erotic tasks are billed at twice the normal rate.

187
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,920
不是的  我需要你偷偷地给我送一只烤全猪
Uh, no, I-I need you to secretly deliver a whole roasted pig.

188
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,090
很高兴为您服务
With extreme pleasure.

189
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,010
这种请求提醒了我为何投身电子管家服务
Requests like these remind me why I E-buttle.

190
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,170
我认得那个声音
I knew that voice.

191
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,350
是基夫斯
It was Keifth.

192
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,560
我刚搬来这里的时候
When I first moved here,

193
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,400
我不过是个年轻的密苏里乡巴佬
I was just a young Missouri hayseed.

194
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,630
有一天我买了张票去看马戏团
I-I bought a ticket to the circus one day,

195
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,730
所有演出的焦点
and there in the middle of all the action,

196
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,260
就是穿着完美修身燕尾服的马戏团领班基夫斯
in an impeccably pressed tuxedo, was Ringmaster Keifth.

197
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,330
我开始出没于各马戏团酒吧  直到我们相遇
I started hanging out at circus bars until we met.

198
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,150
瞬间就互相吸引了
The attraction was immediate.

199
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,460
他年纪比较大  总是屋里掌控大局的人
He was older, always in command of a room,

200
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,130
确实说得通  毕竟屋子不过就是永久型的帐篷
which makes sense because a room is just a permanent tent.

201
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,130
我们交往了六个月
We dated for six months.

202
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,420
他使我变成了
He transformed me

203
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,740
现在大家熟识的长袖善舞的我
into the sophisticate that we all know today.

204
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,770
然后他突然间消失了
And then, he suddenly disappeared.

205
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,670
没有告别  没有留言
No goodbye. No note.

206
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,890
只留下了地板上的一些花生壳
Just some peanut shells on the floor

207
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,000
那一定是...  从他华丽的黑靴子底掉下来的
that must have...fallen from his glorious black boot.

208
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,870
我在小波利尼西亚找到了一家小餐馆
I found a trattoria in Little Polynesia

209
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,070
可以提供一只多的烤全猪
that can spare a fully roasted pig.

210
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,000
不好意思让您久等了
Sorry for the delay.

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
才过了一分半
It w-- It was a minute and a half.

212
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,520
您不知道我多惭愧
You can't know my shame.

213
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,580
我会在一小时内把烤猪包裹送达
I'll deliver the porcine parcel within the hour.

214
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,970
好  太棒了  我们等会见
Okay, that -- that is great. I will -- I will see you then.

215
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,210
你怎么了
What is wrong with you?

216
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,510
我的马戏团男友
Okay, my circus boyfriend who left me

217
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,150
半夜丢下我离开的那个  就是他
in the middle of the night -- that was him.

218
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,580
而他马上要来这里了
And now he's coming here?!

219
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,320
我可不想这么开始[摇铃]新年
This is no way to ring in a new year.

220
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,570
钱肯定在这的某个地方
The money has to be here somewhere.

221
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,260
从我们搬过来后的所有东西都在这了
This is all the stuff from when we first moved in together.

222
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,720
我们为什么会有一盒娃娃头
Why do we have a box of doll heads?

223
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,350
我猜你以为家里没闹过鬼
Oh, I guess you think it's a coincidence

224
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,960
只不过是个巧合
that we have never had evil spirits in this house.

225
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,350
这些遗嘱上的问题怎么办
What about these will questions?

226
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,140
如果我们出了事  谁来抚养乔
If something happens to us, who should raise Joe?

227
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,600
不  杰  别说那样的话
No, Jay, don't say that.

228
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
你听着
All right, look.

229
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,660
如果需要别人来抚养乔
If someone other than us needs to raise Joe,

230
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,050
我投票给米奇和小卡
I vote Mitch and Cam.

231
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,120
很互补的一对
Nice balance.

232
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,260
米奇有责任感  他有文化
Mitch is, uh, responsible, he knows culture,

233
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,520
小卡基本上就是个玩大学橄榄球的妈妈
and Cam is basically a mom who played college football.

234
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,250
而且  乔和莉莉年纪相仿
Plus, Joe and Lily are close in age.

235
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,000
对  但她是不是有点...
Yeah, but isn't she a little...

236
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,900
直言不讳  你说的没错
Direct? You're not wrong.

237
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,370
感恩节时  她足足花了五分钟说我的鼻子
She did five minutes on my nose at Thanksgiving.

238
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,780
你的鼻子是有点大
I mean, it's a little big,

239
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,260
但要说它大得都有自己的邮编了
but to say that it has its own zip code,

240
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,930
我觉得还是太过分了
that was too much for me.

241
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,760
这是什么
What's this?

242
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
别打开  那是
No, that is...

243
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,010
"如果我失踪了或者被发现死了
"If I ever go missing or am found dead,

244
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,260
是我丈夫干的"
it was my husband"?

245
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,580
这是什么玩意
What the hell is this?!

246
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,740
冷静一点
Calm down.

247
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,280
这是我们第一次大吵之后录的
It was when we had our first big fight.

248
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,900
当然  我知道你不会杀我的
Of course I knew that you were not going to kill me.

249
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,290
我只是准备逃跑然后诬陷你
I was just going to run away and frame you.

250
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,770
好奇怪  我们到了这几乎没怎么见到菲尔
Is it weird we've barely seen Phil since we've been here?

251
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,870
这孩子一直都是个流浪者
He was always a wanderer.

252
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,880
这是对天才的诅咒
It's the curse of being a genius.

253
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,090
-菲尔  -我了个特立尼达和多巴哥共和国
- Phil. - Trinidad and Tobago!

254
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,470
你为什么躲着弗兰克
Why are you avoiding Frank?

255
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,250
什么
What?

256
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,610
我
I'm --

257
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,620
好吧  有些事你不知道
Okay, there's something you don't know.

258
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,020
她曾经是你的保姆  你对她有过幻想
She used to be your babysitter, and you had the hots for her.

259
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,120
你怎么知道的
How?

260
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,730
你打算怎么样  亲爱的
What is the plan, honey?

261
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,930
你打算就一直躲着他们吗
Are you just gonna avoid them?

262
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,220
我只是需要一些时间来适应这件事  好吗
I just need a minute to get comfortable with this, okay?

263
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,180
比如  他是不是一直对她有好感
I mean, did he always have a crush on her,

264
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,750
甚至在我妈还在的时候
even when my mom was around?

265
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,880
一个十三岁的少年故意让他保姆
It's one thing for a 13-year-old to position his babysitter

266
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
站在打开的冰箱前  好让他欣赏到
in front of an open refrigerator so that he can enjoy

267
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,700
保姆穿着他从兰德尔妈妈那偷来送她的
the backlit contours of her beautiful body in the silk blouse

268
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,740
真丝衬衫的美妙身姿  这是一回事
he stole from Randall's mother.

269
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,280
但如果他爸也做着同样的事呢
But if he was doing the same thing?

270
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,290
先不管你
Uh, moving past your decision

271
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,870
偷兰德尔妈妈的漂亮衣服的事
to steal trophy clothing from Randall's mom,

272
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,960
或许你可以直接找你爸谈
maybe you could just talk to your dad.

273
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,670
你也知道我们家从不谈事
You know we don't talk in my family.

274
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,780
我们即兴而作
We riff.

275
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,670
或者是讲个段子
We do bits.

276
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,470
知道我爸怎么跟我说祖母去世的吗
You know how my dad told me my grandmother died?

277
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,790
用敲门笑话来跟我说
In a knock-knock joke.

278
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,170
去年的菲尔才会这样说
That is last year's Phil talking.

279
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,120
本着活得更刺激的精神
In the spirit of living more dangerously,

280
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,500
你何不感情上冒次险
why don't you take an emotional risk

281
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,550
试着和你爸坦诚相见
and -- and try and have an honest conversation with your father?

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,260
还有
Also,

283
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,940
我穿的虽不是兰德尔妈妈的短衫
well, I may not be wearing Randall's mothers blouse,

284
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,630
但我想或许你会想要...
but I thought maybe you'd like...

285
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,930
他已经走了
And he's gone.

286
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,920
我怎么说错了
Uh, da-- how am I saying it wrong?

287
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,130
-他叫基斯  -不
- His name is Keith. - No.

288
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,200
基夫
Keef?

289
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
简单得不得了
It couldn't be simpler.

290
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,970
其土夫其斤  基夫斯
K-E-I-F-T-H. Keifth.

291
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,030
夫斯  夫斯
Fth. Fth.

292
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,130
非凡的名字  非凡的人
A remarkable name for a remarkable man.

293
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,900
马戏团领班基本上就是挂个名的职位吧
Isn't ringmaster basically a ceremonial position?

294
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,310
我真想生活在你的幻想世界
Uh, wow. I would love to live in your fantasy world

295
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,110
里面的马戏团能自行运转
where circuses run themselves.

296
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,730
好了  打电话取消
Okay. Call and cancel.

297
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,990
那谁来拯救你的晚餐
Then who's gonna save your dinner?

298
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,490
而且我们并不确定那个服务生就是基夫斯啊
Besides, we don't even know if the concierge is actually Keifth.

299
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,230
我会忘了半夜抛弃我的
I'm gonna forget the velvety baritone

300
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,180
那个柔和男中音吗
that abandoned me in the middle of the night?

301
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,830
还有  他来这里  我会失控
And plus, he walks in here, I lose it,

302
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,520
我不想莉莉看到那场面
I don't want Lily to see that.

303
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,260
她不在
Oh, she's not here.

304
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,660
她要去朋友家过夜  已经走夫斯
She has that sleepover, and she already leffffth.

305
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,080
都不说再见的吗
Without saying goodbye?

306
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,110
然后我突然想到
Then it hit me.

307
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,580
让小卡见那个抛弃他的
It could be therapeutic for Cam

308
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,970
名字滑稽的马戏团人士可能对他有好处
to see this ridiculously named circus person who deserted him

309
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,600
因为那件事可能就是他
because that incident could be the very root

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,080
那么害怕被抛弃情结的根源
of his pretty intense abandonment issues...

311
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,980
这事决不能说不折腾人
which are not unchallenging.

312
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,420
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

313
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,410
去洗手间
To the bathroom.

314
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,470
祝你一生平安
Well, have a nice life.

315
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,580
让菲尔和克莱尔照顾乔怎么样
What about Phil and Claire to take care of Joe?

316
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,110
我不知道  菲尔不是有点傻吗
I don't know. Isn't Phil kind of silly?

317
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,110
你说什么呢  菲尔是很棒的父亲
What are you talking about? Phil is a great father.

318
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,150
他和善
He's kind.

319
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,670
风趣
He's fun.

320
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,220
甚至莉莉都喜欢他
Even Lily likes him.

321
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,650
但他是不是太讨喜了
But is he too likeable?

322
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,850
严肃呢
Where's the gravitas?

323
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,330
他充满活力
He's full of energy.

324
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,950
他感情细腻
He's sensitive,

325
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,350
而且他从不会暴躁
and he never, ever gets grumpy.

326
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,950
好  那你何不现在就把乔交给这个超级老爸
Fine. Why don't you give Joe to Super Dad right now, then?

327
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,310
天啊  你真嫉妒了吗
Oh, my God, are you really jealous

328
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,080
就因为菲尔当可能是比你棒的老爸
because Phil might be a better father than you?

329
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,350
我知道这很蠢
I know it's stupid.

330
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,030
更别说这样的话乔还有了克莱尔
Not to mention the fact that Joe gets Claire in the deal.

331
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,590
她是个极出色的母亲
She's a fantastic mother.

332
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,120
经营公司  绝对的楷模
Runs a company, hell of a role model.

333
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,120
乔找不到比她更好母亲了
He could never do better than that for a mother.

334
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,100
其实吧  菲尔和克莱尔终于养大了孩子们
You know what, Phil and Claire have already raised their kids.

335
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,720
我觉得他们该享受旅行了
I think it's time for them to travel.

336
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,220
那里
There.

337
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,710
我的消失专用包原来就挂在那里
That's where my disappear bag was hanging!

338
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,290
歌洛莉亚都快把你电话打爆了
You have, like, a hundred missed calls from Gloria.

339
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,640
你们必须马上回来
You have to come back right now.

340
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,680
出什么事了吗
Is everything okay?

341
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,870
什么
What?

342
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,460
附近肯定有公交站台
There must be a bus stop nearby.

343
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,780
在那之前  表现得正常点
Until then, just act normal

344
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,940
就像我们没带四万美金
like we don't have $40,000 on us.

345
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,580
你为什么只半句小声说
Okay, why are you whispering only part of a sentence?

346
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,790
会引起注意的
That's going to attract attention.

347
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,500
真的吗
Really?

348
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,720
比你浑身大汗更引注意吗
More than you being covered in sweat?

349
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,310
你看着就像桑拿墙
Because you look like a sauna wall.

350
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,210
你说得对  我该怎么让自己别出汗呢
You're right. How do I make myself stop sweating?

351
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,540
我不知道
I don't know!

352
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,280
别哭  哭比出汗更糟
Oh, don't cry. Crying's worse than sweating.

353
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,180
瞧吧  我也哭了
Oh look, now I'm crying too!

354
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,230
或许我们笑着笑着就不哭了
Maybe we can smile our way out of this.

355
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,260
-菲尔  -怎么
- Phil? - Yeah?

356
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,780
亲爱的  快来  你爸在房车上晕倒了
Honey, come quick! Your dad passed out in the RV.

357
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,750
天啊
Oh, my God!

358
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,110
爸  你没事吧
Dad, are you okay?

359
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,340
没事  克莱尔刚不小心拿水管喷到我了
Yeah, Claire just accidentally sprayed me with a garden hose.

360
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,320
真的吗
Really?

361
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,380
克莱尔
Oh, Claire?

362
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,480
抱歉  卡住了
Sorry, stuck...

363
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,350
就像许多父子关系一样
like many father/son relationships.

364
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,630
这里看着很棒
So, uh, place looks great.

365
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,250
洛林把这里收拾一新
Yeah, Lorraine really spruced it up --

366
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,210
窗帘
curtains,

367
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,270
厕所装了铜护栏
brass safety rails over the privy.

368
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,580
那可真是救命的玩意儿
That was really a lifesaver.

369
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,640
她有次在90号公路上急刹车
She stopped short on the I-90 once.

370
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
我就像中国杂技演员一样翻了出去
I came rolling out of there like a Chinese acrobat.

371
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,900
洛林似乎很不错
Well, Lorraine seems good.

372
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,700
菲尔  你今天似乎有点不对劲
Hey, so Phil, uh, you seem a little off today.

373
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,650
我和洛林在一起  你不会觉得别扭吧
Me and Lorraine -- uh, that doesn't bother you, right?

374
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,970
不  不
No. No.

375
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,660
那就好  这事挺疯狂
Good. It's the craziest thing.

376
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,370
她当时再次介绍自己
She re-introduced herself,

377
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,710
我根本不记得她是我们的保姆
and, uh, I didn't even remember she was our babysitter.

378
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,550
真的吗
Really?

379
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,050
是啊  然后她约我出去
Yeah. Then she asked me out,

380
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,770
你也知道  约我的不多
and you know, I don't get a lot of offers,

381
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,130
我就想  "管他的"
so I thought, "What the heck?"

382
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,190
我猜也是
Sure. That's what I figured.

383
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,470
但我很高兴你过得愉快
But, uh, I'm just glad you're having fun.

384
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,960
我最好去把我这瓶子
Well, I better go fill this thing up

385
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
装满杰昂贵的威士忌了
with some of Jay's expensive Scotch.

386
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,060
其实  门似乎锁上了
Oh, actually, I think the door's locked.

387
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,330
没有  好得很
Oh, no, it's fine.

388
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,760
弗兰克  非常抱歉水管喷到你了
Well, Frank, I'm really sorry about that hose thing.

389
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,590
没什么
Oh, no hard feelings.

390
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,320
我衣服也该洗洗了
Shirt needed freshening anyway.

391
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,210
反正打从
I haven't washed it

392
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,840
上次我们停车下来跟火轮海拍照就没洗了
since we stopped to take pictures at Smokey-Top,

393
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,460
火轮海是犹他州历时最长的轮胎弃置场大火
Utah's longest, continuously burning tire fire.

394
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,790
我猜你也听到了  我完全没什么好担心
As I guess you heard, I had no reason to be worried.

395
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,070
他本来都没意识到洛林曾是我的保姆
He didn't even notice when Lorraine was my babysitter.

396
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,640
而且他们也不是太认真在谈恋爱
Plus, they're not even that serious.

397
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,500
我摸到了他口袋里有戒指盒
I felt a ring box in his pocket.

398
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,490
什么  不可能
What? No way.

399
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,180
真的
Yep.

400
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,980
世上没有别的东西是那个形状了
There's only one thing shaped like that.

401
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,840
才没有  那形状的东西多了
No, there isn't. There's a million things --

402
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,800
魔方  针线包
Rubik's Cube, sewing kit,

403
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,940
火轮海的纪念品轮胎钥匙圈
souvenir tire keychain from Smokey-Top.

404
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,920
我都想不出有什么东西不是那形状了
I can't think of anything that's not shaped like that.

405
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,400
我们就先假设一下我感觉对了
Let's assume for a moment that I am right

406
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,820
那真的是戒指盒
and that was a ring box.

407
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
我觉得挺值得探讨
Maybe it's worth exploring

408
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,160
为什么你爸爸续弦
why the idea of your dad remarrying

409
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,430
会让你这么惴惴不安
is setting you off like this.

410
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,570
或许也很值得探讨
Maybe it's worth exploring

411
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,970
为什么你这么享受把人搞崩溃
why you find so much joy in tearing people down.

412
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,940
在早年
In previous generations,

413
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,510
人们可是会说你们这种人是女巫
they accused people like that of being witches

414
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,450
朝你们泼水  如果尖叫就真是女巫
and threw water at them to see if they screamed.

415
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,230
好棒棒
Great.

416
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,870
女巫
Witch.

417
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,230
{\an8}猎女巫时期有很多毫无科学根据的查女巫手法

418
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,550
我猜您就是普里契特先生吧
Ah, Mr. Pritchett, I presume.

419
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,290
你好  谢谢你辛苦跑这一趟
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

420
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,900
我不太确定我有没有听对你名字
I'm not sure I caught your name.

421
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,270
-基夫斯·班克斯  -太好了
- Keifth Banks. - Yes.

422
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,130
随时为您...
At your --

423
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,220
米奇尔  抱歉打断你了
Mitchell, sorry to interrupt.

424
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,290
我不知道你在跟个普通工人聊天
I didn't know you were with a common worker.

425
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,900
万万没想到
Can it be?

426
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,720
卡梅隆·塔克
Cameron Tucker.

427
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,320
是的  不好意思  您是...
Yes. I'm sorry. You are...?

428
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,520
基夫斯
Keifth.

429
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,090
基夫斯  我好像不记得有认识...
Keifth. I-I don't believe I know --

430
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,290
不对  小卡  你不是跟我说过
No, C-Cam, didn't you tell me

431
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,780
你曾跟一个叫基夫斯的人在一起过吗
you once dated someone named Keifth?

432
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,700
对哦  基夫斯
Oh, yes. Keifth.

433
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,800
你当年是做什么的来着
What was it you did again?

434
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,780
我记得你戴着白手套  然后很多肢体动作
I remember you wore white gloves and -- and gestured a lot.

435
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,680
地铁站的默剧演出者吗
Subway mime?

436
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,250
我是马戏团的领导
I commanded a circus.

437
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,190
是的  现在我想起来了
Yes. Now I remember.

438
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,250
你还好吗
How have you been?

439
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,800
你现在干起送猪到府的行当了吗
I see you're in pig delivery now?

440
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,870
我是一位礼宾人员
I'm a concierge.

441
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,000
马戏团的行当这年头越来越艰难
The circus business has gotten rather difficult.

442
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,390
现在的人没有那种耐心
People today, they don't have the patience

443
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,830
去欣赏早年那种更优雅的演出了
for the more elegant pleasures of yesteryear --

444
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,170
比如看人把头放进狮子嘴里
men putting their heads into lion's mouths,

445
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,610
可怜的侏儒被从大炮里射出
unfortunate little people being shot from cannons.

446
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,170
真不敢相信  你们会在这种情况下重逢
I can't believe you-- you're meeting up again like this.

447
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,890
你们之间肯定有很多话想聊
You must have so much to catch up on

448
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,800
或很多事想处理吧
or -- or -- or work through.

449
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,630
我相信基夫斯比较想
Oh, well, I'm sure Keifth would rather

450
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,520
把东西送到之后就人间蒸发吧
just make the delivery and disappear.

451
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,490
就从这个开始处理
Start there.

452
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,680
说说手里的这问题
To the matter at hand.

453
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,400
要大换烤猪是比较困难的
The swap will be difficult.

454
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,460
幸好我对误导观众目光焦点颇有经验
Fortunately, I have had a bit of experience with misdirects --

455
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,740
只需要叫观众集中注意看着舞台中央
just tell the audience to keep your eyes on the center ring!

456
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,170
他们就不会发现舞台上方的空中飞人
They won't even notice the trapeze act

457
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,100
正在艰难地度过食物中毒反应较大的阶段
suffering through the more vivid stages of food poisoning.

458
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,740
真事  我当时也在场
That happened. I was there.

459
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,310
首先  我放出一只活孔雀
First, I will release a live peacock --

460
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,550
来自东方的异国珍兽  进后院
an exotic beauty of the Orient -- into the yard.

461
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,820
太魔幻
Magical.

462
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,620
然后我需要有能把它吸引进屋的东西
Then, I will need something to lure him inside

463
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,230
好吸引所有人的注意力
to draw the family's attention.

464
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,450
你们有西班牙安达卢西亚的榛果吗
Do you happen to have any Andalusian filberts?

465
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,290
没有
No.

466
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,640
那就用起司小饼干吧
Then Cheez-Its will do.

467
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,310
普通人在这时候都会呆住
Naturally, everyone will be transfixed.

468
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,760
这时趁他们不注意  我们就把猪给换了
And while they're distracted, we will swap out the pigs,

469
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,920
晚餐就起死回生  一切就能继续
the dinner will be saved, and the show will go on.

470
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,910
让我先偷看一眼后院
Just let me sneak a peek at the backyard.

471
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,100
再见啦
Goodbye.

472
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,550
乔
Hey, Joe,

473
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,550
什么东西有两头四脚还会飞
what has two heads, four legs, and can fly?

474
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,830
不知道
I don't know.

475
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,480
我们
Us. Aah!

476
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,370
这样很危险
This is dangerous!

477
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,520
玩心跳才知道自己还活着啊
That's how you know we're alive!

478
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,060
就像我在婚礼致辞时说的
It's like I said in my wedding toast --

479
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,860
你的新娘天不怕地不怕
that bride of yours is fearless.

480
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,670
对啊
Yeah.

481
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,120
而奇怪的是  今天早先我们去了游乐园
Funny thing is, we went to an amusement park earlier today

482
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,440
她却不敢去坐其中一个设施
and she was too scared to get on this one ride.

483
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,070
又或者她假装不敢
Or she pretended to be

484
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,720
这样我就不用承认自己有多怕坐那个了
so that I wouldn't have to admit how scared I was.

485
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,900
我有个感觉  她不是今天
I have a hunch that she's not the only one

486
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,100
唯一一个想保护我感受的人
who's trying to protect my feelings today.

487
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,440
儿啊  你讲话有点含糊不清啊
You seem to be rambling, son.

488
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,580
你早先跟克莱尔拥抱时
When you hugged Claire earlier,

489
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,760
她摸到你口袋里有戒指盒状物
she felt a ring box in your pocket.

490
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,060
什么  那才不是戒指盒
What? That wasn't a ring box.

491
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,130
那是...  我现在在哪里  我老糊涂了
It was...where am I? I'm so old and confused.

492
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,260
别演了
Stop.

493
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,890
我不会否认看到你跟洛林在一起
I'm not gonna say seeing you with Lorraine

494
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,190
没有任何别扭的感觉
wasn't a little bit weird for me.

495
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,120
的确是很疯狂的一件事啦
It was a crazy idea.

496
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,980
我要说的不是这个
That's not what I'm trying to say.

497
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,840
那头猪应该烤熟了吧
That pig's got to be ready, doesn't it?

498
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,830
爸  别这样
Dad, please.

499
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,210
儿啊  我们能不这样吗
Son, can we please not do this?

500
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,570
好吧
Fine.

501
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,350
咚咚咚
Knock, knock.

502
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,670
这还比较像话
That's more like it.

503
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,800
是谁在敲门啊
Who's there?

504
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,390
-你儿子  -哪位你儿子
- Your son. - Your son, who?

505
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,210
你那位不想你因为他而放弃
Your son who'd hate to think you threw away

506
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,850
自己幸福的机会来保护他感受的儿子
a shot at happiness just to protect his feelings.

507
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,440
给你  都在这  从我手里拿走它吧
Here it is. All here. Just take it from me.

508
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,490
这是我这辈子压力最大的一次
That's the most stress I've ever felt,

509
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,310
我可是曾在地底待过两周
and I spent two weeks underground

510
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,890
来做孤独有关的研究呢
as part of an isolation study.

511
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,700
好啦
Okay.

512
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,540
我们现在应该能把这弄完啦
So, I guess now we can finish this.

513
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,880
米奇  米奇  过来帮我们填完这个
Ay, Mitch. Mitch, come. Help us finish.

514
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,640
好的  好的  我们用快问快答来填完这些表
Okay. Okay. We got to lightning round these forms.

515
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,200
你们俩都想得太多了
You guys are overthinking this.

516
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,820
其实答案早就在每个人心里了
Everybody knows in their heart what they want.

517
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,850
大家只是都不好意思做出那决定
They just feel bad about making the decision.

518
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,350
那开始吧  你要选谁做你的遗嘱执行人  请作答
So, who will be the executor of your estate? Go.

519
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,960
你  好的
You. Aww. Okay.

520
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,210
你有什么想要捐给慈善机构的吗
Um, do you want to leave anything to charity?

521
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,820
有
Yes.

522
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,330
一成财产捐给我们去世时最拉风的慈善项目
10% to whatever is sexy at the time we die --

523
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,550
比如像孤儿什么的吧
like, um, orphans or whatever.

524
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,000
好的  好的  下一题那斯黛拉呢
Okay, okay, yeah. And what about Stella?

525
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,960
跟曼尼一人一半
Same as Manny.

526
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,340
不是  他是在问你斯黛拉该由谁来照顾
No, he's asking who's gonna take care of her,

527
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,220
不是问你打算留多少钱给一个杀人凶手
not how much money you're gonna leave to a murderer.

528
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,100
没证据啊
No proof of that.

529
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,310
好吧  感觉那事值得另外谈过
Okay, this seems like a whole sidebar,

530
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,760
我们一会再绕回来讨论这个吧
so we're gonna circle back to that.

531
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,140
下一个  你想要谁来做乔的法定监护人
Um, who do you want as Joe's legal guardian?

532
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,300
别  别去想  按直觉回答一个  好吗
No, no, don't think. Just answer, okay?

533
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,730
如果万一你们两个都遭遇了不幸
If something happens to both of you,

534
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,230
你最想要谁来照顾乔
who do you want to take care of Joe?

535
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,080
我啊  这还用说
Me, obviously.

536
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,720
曼尼  你还太小了
Ay, Manny, you're too young.

537
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,320
而且不久之后你马上就要开始自己新的生活了
Besides, you're about to start your new life soon.

538
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,590
是啊  你应该致力出去播种
Yeah, you should be out sowing your oats

539
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,930
或者致力织布吧
or just sewing.

540
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,140
反正你正好喜欢这个
That's something you like.

541
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,640
我不觉得这有什么大问题
I don't see what the big deal is.

542
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,950
我会雇个保姆  卖了房子  换到小点的公寓里
I'd hire a nanny, sell the house, downsize to a condo.

543
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,770
我在考虑正要蓬勃发展的艺术街区的复式楼
I'm thinking maybe a loft in an up-and-coming arts district.

544
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,020
的确  这些事可能会延迟我大学毕业的时间
Sure, it'll take me a bit longer to finish college,

545
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,340
但反正大学也是生命里最好的一段时光  不是吗
but aren't those the best years of life, anyway?

546
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,390
但最重要的是  他是我的弟弟
The main thing is, he's my brother.

547
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,100
我不会答应让除了我之外的人来把他养大
I'm not letting anybody else raise him.

548
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,350
曼尼  你太贴心了
Ay, Manny. You're so sweet.

549
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,460
难道我是唯一对他已经把
Am I the only one unsettled

550
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,630
这事计划如此透彻而感到不安的人吗
by how much he's thought about that already?

551
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,560
-我的天啊  快看  -什么鬼
-Oh, my God! Look! -What?

552
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,640
施放你的法术吧  大自然的万花筒
Cast your spell, nature's kaleidoscope!

553
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,710
为什么会有一只蓝色的火鸡出现在房子里
Why is there a blue turkey going into the house?

554
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,690
那是孔雀好吗
It's a peacock.

555
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,070
猛吃那一路的起司小饼干啊
It's really plowing through the Cheez-Its.

556
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,680
我们忘记塞苹果在新猪嘴里了
Oh, we forgot to put the apple the new pig's mouth.

557
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,570
这事儿先扔下吧
Oh, just leave it.

558
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,340
你解决所有问题的方式就是扔下吗
Now that's your answer to everything, isn't it?

559
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,650
你骂的对
I deserve that.

560
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,880
我是个傻子  居然以为能在你不提
I was a fool to think I could get through this

561
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,540
我当年如何离开的方式下  处理完这事
without you bringing up the way I left.

562
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,770
你伤透了我的心
Well, you broke my heart.

563
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,900
我并不是故意要伤害你  卡梅隆
I didn't mean to hurt you, Cameron.

564
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,780
我只是不得不去保护自己
I just had to protect myself.

565
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,340
当初我们刚认识的时候  你就仿佛
When we first met, you were just...

566
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,900
未经雕琢的璞玉
pure, raw potential.

567
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,760
你的密苏里腔调
Your Missouri twang.

568
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,080
不懂得怎么弄衬衫袖口的样子
The innocent way your shirt cuffs

569
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,680
显得你单纯又可爱
were no different than your sleeves.

570
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,400
只要你从你乡村的这茧中破蛹而出
Once you emerged from your country cocoon,

571
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,590
而我知道这是迟早的事情
I knew it was just a matter of time

572
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,670
你就会发现世界很大  然后就往天空飞去
before you realized you could do better and moved on.

573
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,670
但你连一声再见都没有说过
But you never even said goodbye.

574
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,940
这些年来 我一直觉得是我做得不够好
For all these years, I-I thought it was my fault.

575
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,100
不  不
Oh, no.

576
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,520
不是这样的
No.

577
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,830
我是一个懦夫
I was a coward.

578
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,480
我就这么跑了  然后加入了别的马戏团
I just ran away to join another circus.

579
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,750
我猜你可以这么说
I suppose you could say the --

580
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,280
你还没称霸的那"环"舞台  名为因果循"环"
the one ring you never mastered was the ring of life.

581
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,160
这吐槽有点狠  但所言在理
Well, that's kind of mean, but sure.

582
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,740
不过看看你们这么漂亮的房子
And look at your beautiful home.

583
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,030
你已经成长为了一个成功人士了
Oh, it's... You've blossomed into the success 

584
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,210
我一直都相信你可以的
I always knew you'd be.

585
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,080
没错
Correct.

586
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,350
我很享受我们在一起的时光  卡梅隆
I did so enjoy our time together, Cameron.

587
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,560
你还记得我们在两个城市来回表演的那一周吗
Remember that split week between Lansing and Kalamazoo?

588
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,610
我的天  我怎么可能不记得
Oh, my gosh, how could I forget?

589
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,310
雨滴落在帐篷顶上
the rain dripping on the canvas.

590
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
马戏团宵禁之后  我偷溜进你的马车里
Me sneaking into your wagon after curfew.

591
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,540
我想那应该是你第一次看见我的大...
I believe that was the first time you saw me...

592
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,350
礼帽没戴在头上的时候
without my top hat.

593
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,520
好吧
Okay.

594
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,670
好了  疗伤完毕
Well, wounds healed,

595
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,190
开始新的篇章  您可以放心走了
whole new perspective, off you go.

596
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,650
再见  卡梅隆
Goodbye, Cameron.

597
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,670
再见  基夫斯
Goodbye, Keifth.

598
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,610
是你啊  亲爱的
Oh, hey, honey.

599
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,210
这是要做什么
I, uh... Whatcha doing?

600
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,600
他这么紧张的样子看起来好可爱
Oh, I think it's cute how scared he is.

601
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,030
对啊  但他去做了
Yeah, but he's doing it.

602
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,230
我愿意
Yes.

603
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,080
一个不怕活得刺激点儿的邓菲家男人
There's one Dunphy who's not afraid to live dangerously.

604
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,330

605
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,160
它们还有两个小时才打烊
They're open for two more hours.

606

一定会平安无事的

607
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,240

小卡  这也太好吃了

你知道的  继上一个感恩节之后

612
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,200
我只是庆幸这次一切都没有出差错

613
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,360
我好爱这个调料
I love this seasoning.

614
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,200
那个坚果口感是哪来的
What gives it that nutty taste?

615
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,610
可能就是坚果啊  亲爱的
It might be nuts, sweetheart.

616
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,830
不可能  他不会放坚果进来的
Oh, no, he wouldn't put nuts in it.

617
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,010
他知道我对坚果过敏
He knows I'm allergic.

618
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,860
借过一下
Excuse me.

619
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,840
我回来了  回来啦

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,200
克莱尔
Claire.

623
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
别装了  他们肯定会发现的
Oh, come on, they were gonna find out.

624
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,230
因为我绝不可能花了15块钱买了这张照片
I'm not spending $15 on this picture

625
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,410
却忍住不给大家看
and not show it to everyone.

626
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,790
我可能需要你把嘴里的东西吐在这张餐巾上
I'm just gonna need you to spit into this napkin.

627
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,020
肾上腺素针马上送到

628
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,040
