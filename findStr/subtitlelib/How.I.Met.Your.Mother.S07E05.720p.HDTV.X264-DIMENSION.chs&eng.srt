<i>孩子们，在2011年十月</i> <i>你们的Robin阿姨在接受心理治疗</i>
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, in October 2011,</i> <i>your Aunt Robin was in therapy.</i>

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,790
<i>让人意想不到的是</i> <i>一切进展良好</i>
<i>And against all logic,</i> <i>it was actually going well.</i>

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,510
为什么？
But why?

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,310
为什么我总要给自己找不开心的理由？
Why-why am I constantly looking for reasons not to be happy?

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,400
也许是最终开心起来这个想法
Maybe because the idea of finally being happy...

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,100
把你吓到了
terrifies you.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,290
我去，全被你说中了
Bro, you are killing it today.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,940
Pshh!
Pshh!

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,490
我们今天状态不错
We got something good here.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,940
我们要征服我对快乐的恐惧!
We are totes gonna conquer my fear of abandonment!

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,380
恐怕我们不能再见了
I can't see you anymore.

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,550
不错
(laughs) Nice.

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,580
"Oh,不！你再也不理我了！"
"Oh, no! You're abandoning me!"

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,620
Oh,不！你再也不理我了?
Oh, no. You're abandoning me?

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,560
对不起，我要搬到阿拉斯加了
I'm sorry. I'm moving to Alaska.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,010
<i>故事就此也许该结束了</i>
NARRATOR: <i>And that might have</i> <i>been the end of it.</i>

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,260
<i>但一周后...</i>
<i>But a week later...</i>

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,310
Kevin?!
Kevin?!

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,480
你怎么来这里了？
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,770
好吧，我对你撒谎了， 我没有搬到阿拉斯加去
Okay, look, I lied to you about moving to Alaska.

22
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,940
但我的确不能再见你了。
I-I had to stop seeing you.

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,220
为什么？
Why?

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,540
因为我觉得你太可爱了
'Cause I think you're cute.

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,380
所以从职业伦理上来说， 假如我对你有感觉的话
And ethically, I can't be your therapist

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,210
我就不能当你的心理治疗师了
if I'm attracted to you.

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,810
噢，我懂了， 你不把我当作病人
Oh, I get it. You dump me as a patient

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,500
是因为要约我出来？
just so you can ask me out?

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,630
不，我不会约你出来。
I'm not gonna ask you out.

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,970
你不会么？
You're not?

31
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,800
不，我们是在心理治疗时认识的。
No. We met in therapy.

32
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,570
跟病人约会是不合适的。
It's inappropriate for me to date a patient.

33
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,690
不论如何，见到你很高兴。
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,500
Hey, 等等
Hey, wait.

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
你是怎么定义"约会"的？
How do you define "date"?

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,140
两个人在一起吃饭
Two people having a meal together,

37
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,190
面对面的坐着
sitting across the table

38
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,640
四目相对
making googly eyes at each other...

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,980
那么，两个人并肩坐 各自吃饭
What about two people eating alone, sitting side by side,

40
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,180
跟服务生四目相对 怎么样？
making googly eyes at the coffee maker?

41
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,700
好吧，那么就不是约会
Okay, it's not a date.

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,120
是的，不是约会
Exactly. Not a date.

43
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,990
<i>从此Robin和Kevin </i> <i>在那个星期的每一天</i>
NARRATOR: And <i>so Robin and Kevin had</i> <i>breakfast alone,</i>

44
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,410
<i>都肩并着肩</i> <i>各自吃早饭</i>
<i>side by side</i> <i>every day that week.</i>

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,380
<i>直到有一天...</i>
<i>Until finally...</i>

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh, hey!
Oh, hey!

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,500
对不起，没出租车了
Sorry. No cabs.

48
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,200
跑了40个街区 才到这里
Ran 40 blocks all the way here.

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,550
也许路上撞到了个老太太
May have knocked an old lady

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,210
但我不确定 我没回头
into the street, don't know, I didn't look back.

51
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,260
我们还是去约会吧！
Let's just go on a real date.

52
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,930
好主意
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

53
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,390
总算成了！
Finally!

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
我等不及要去看电影了

58
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,586
Oh, I can't wait to see that movie.

59
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,550
电影好看么？
Is it good?

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,770
棒极了 等等 假设一下
Awesome. Wait, totally hypothetically,

61
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,220
假如电影情节纠结波折
do you like movies with a shocking twist where all

62
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,940
最后主角死光光， 你喜不喜欢?

我来讲讲发生了神马
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

68
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,800
你们说听过我的老板 Garrison Cootes,是

yeah...
ALL: Yeah...

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,570
我的意思是说， 是他还是另外的一个人

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,980
今天工作的时候
And so today at work,

77
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,130
我试着向他表现出我强硬的一面
I was trying to show him that I'm tough.

78
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,970
我一直在想这事...
I've been thinking about this

79
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,220
假如我们跟Gruber Pharmaceuticals
settlement offer we're about

80
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,300
的和解协议
to get from Gruber Pharmaceuticals.

81

如果少于两千万美元的话
If it's anything less than $20 million,

82

我要抓住那些
then I'm gonna grab

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,060
玷污地球 家园的人的...
those corporate Earth rapists by their...

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,060
等等，我要说明一下
Okay, I'm just gonna say something.

85
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,980
我的肚子里面正怀着孩子
I'm growing a child in my belly,

86
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,900
这个孩子现在正在长耳朵
a child that just developed ears.

87
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,570
这是一件十分薄的毛衣
This is a very thin sweater.

88
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,320
所以你要讲些什么的话...
So please, if you must tell your story...

89
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,940
请讲一些和善点的话...
just make it cheerful.

90
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,550
和善的话
Cheerful.

91
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,690

人们...认识到 我是地球母亲的...
parents... realize that I'm the baddest mother...

98
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,670
捍卫者
nature lover around.

99
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,510
我感觉这简直是在 CCTV6上看<i>色戒</i>
It's like watching <i>The Breakfast Club</i> on TBS.

100
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,430
那么他说了什么？
So what did he say?

101
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,100
Marshall, 弯下腰 让我能把手放到你肩上
Marshall, bend down so I can put my arm around you.

102
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,220
嗯，很好
That's all the way down. That's good.

103
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,180
Gruber Pharmaceuticals 是一家由
Gruber Pharmaceuticals is a company full

104
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,140
一群忠于职守的好心人组成的公司
of well-meaning people doing their jobs,

105
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,220
就跟你我一样
just like you and me.

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,970
弟兄们，我怕Garrison Cootes 变得软弱了
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison Cootes has gone soft!

107
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
他就跟泰迪熊一样！
He's like a teddy bear!

108
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,560
一个泰迪熊还是 一只伊渥克? （一种星球大战的动物，跟泰迪熊长的很像）
A teddy bear or an Ewok?

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,730
平时看起来 既萌又可爱的样子
You know, cute and cuddly around the village,

110
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,650
但是当星级战争一旦开始...
but once the battle starts...

111

他会用巨大的原木 来把你的金属头骨给敲碎
He'll smash in your metal skull with giant swinging logs.

112
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,150
Marshall!
Marshall!

113
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,410
好吧，他会拥抱你
Okay, he'll hug you

114
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,820
直到你平和的同意 关闭死星
until you agree to peaceably shut down the Death Star.

115
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,030

是啊，你看，谁知道恋爱里面的各种规矩？

你看，你在跟一个 不喜欢伊渥克的女孩子约会
I mean, you're dating a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,

139
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,120
九十九个人都会说 "你的心理治疗师"

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,420
为什么？我们 缺建筑了？
Why? Are we running out of buildings?

151
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,890
我们缺无聊的人了？
Are we running out of boring people?

152
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,640
这是件大事，好不？
Guys, this is a big deal, okay?

153
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,780
要是我能让一个孩子对 建筑产生兴趣
If I can get just one kid interested in

154
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,930
成为一名建筑师...
becoming an architect...

155
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,450
OK，你最好就此打住
Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there.

156
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,480
Ted, 这是一门导论课
Ted, it's an Intro class.

157
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,690
不要在导论课上摆一副
Yeah, don't try to <i>Stand and Deliver</i>

158
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,430
<i>为人师表</i>的样子
an Intro class.

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,490
除非这课让你不会再宿醉
Nobody takes an Intro class to get on any other path

160
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,240
否则没人会对 一门导论课有太多兴趣
but the path to not being hungover anymore.

161
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,330
我这知识是从 <i>常识导论</i> 上学来的
I learned that in my Intro to something-ology class.

162
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,750
能在常识导论课上学到这个很好
Well that's fine for something-ology,

163
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,050
但是明早九点整
but tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. sharp

164
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,250
建筑学导论依旧还是要去现场教学
Intro to Architecture is going on a field trip!

165
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,640
一共有200个学生
All 200 of 'em.

166
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,650
现在是9:45.
Well, it's 9:45.

167
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,220
我猜另外170 人都迷路了
I guess the other 170 of you got lost,

168
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,590
那我们开始上课吧
so we'll just start.

169
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,100
有人选这门课
Now, some might say you guys are just taking this class

170
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,570
是因为觉得这门课简单， 或者把建筑学和
because it's easy or because you've confused architecture

171
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,350
考古学搞混了， 觉得我们要像
with archaeology and think we're gonna do

172
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,140
夺宝奇兵里那样 去玩些很酷的东西
some cool Indiana Jones stuff today.

173
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,940
但我认为...
But I think that...

174
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,660
我认为，也许你们之中 有一些人将来会成为建筑师
I think just maybe, we got some future architects in the house.

175
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,280
谁想成为一名建筑师的， 请举手～
Show of hands: who's thinking about a career in architecture?

176
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,200
Well,今天你们会改变的
Well, today, all that's gonna change.

177
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,160
跟我来
Follow me.

178
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,540
Hey. Uh,抱歉
Hey. Uh, sorry,

179
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,440
没有通行证的人 是不能入内的
nobody gets in here without a site pass.

180
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,050
没问题的，我是Ted Mosby, 这座大厦的建筑师
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the architect of this building.

181
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,470
就算你是来大厦进行考古的
I don't care if you're the archaeologist of this building.

182
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,600
也不能入内
Site's closed.

183
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,830
下个景点！
Moving on!

184
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,790
<i>那个早上Marshall的事务所</i>
NARRATOR: <i>That morning, Marshall's firm</i>

185
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,450
<i>正在准备</i> <i>对 Gruber Pharmaceuticals</i>

186
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,900
<i>的索赔</i> <i>Marshall 已经急不可待的</i>
<i>from Gruber Pharmaceuticals,</i> <i>and Marshall couldn't wait</i>

187
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,950
<i>想看到泰迪熊</i> <i>变成一只伊渥克</i>
<i>to see the teddy</i> <i>bear</i> <i>turn into an Ewok.</i>

188
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,860
Gruber Pharmaceuticals  将有毒废物倒入青蛙溪
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped toxic waste into Frog Creek,

189
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,540
而溪水汇入鳟鱼河 最后流入干净湖
a tributary of the Trout River that feeds into Clearwater Lake.

190
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,710
这三者现在都要新的名字了
All three of which now need new names.

191
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,530
现在是为地球母亲 赢得这场索赔的时候了
So it's time to win one for Mother Earth.

192
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,750
让我们干掉这些垃圾吧！
Let's take out the trash, shall we?!

193
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,010
- Yes! - 好，现在每个人带个袋子
- Yes! - All right, everyone grab a bag.

194
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,810
蓝色是可回收的 绿色的当化肥
Blue is recycling, green, compost.

195
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,810
我们走
There we go.

196
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,880
Sheila...
Sheila...

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,000
我们是来听你报价的
we're ready to hear your offer.

198
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,660

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,200
Yeah ,看起来很可观啊～

<i>孩子们</i> <i>我带着这25个学生在</i>
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, I</i> <i>was wandering the city</i>

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,470
<i>只能让你们的Barney叔叔来</i> <i>解救我</i>
<i>when your Uncle Barney</i> <i>came to my rescue.</i>

203
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,110
OK,同学们，其实看一个建筑 怎么建造的没什么意思
Okay, guys, seeing a building get built, not that exciting.

204
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,810
真正有意思的是 看融资方面...
What's really exciting is the financial side of...

205
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,280
坐下，Ted, 我来
Sit down, Ted, I got this.

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,530
Hey, 那个络腮胡子 关灯
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!

207
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,820
大学时代... 一个充满疑惑的时代
College... it's a confusing time.

208
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,920
Oh, 不
Oh, no.

209
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,640
研究表明83%的大学生
Studies show that 83% of all college students

210
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,680
急切需要...
desperately need...

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
性教育！
sex lessons!

212
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,550
开灯!
Lights!

213
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,700
Barney,他们才18岁！
Barney, these are 18-year-olds!

214
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,030
Ted,已经18岁了！
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!

215
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,370
你有女朋友了
You have a girlfriend.

216
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,590
但她不喜欢伊渥克！
But she doesn't like Ewoks!

217
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,470
那又如何？
So what?

218
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,560
那又如何?! Bieber,关灯!
So what?! Bieber, lights!

219
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,100
在1983年, George Lucas 向世界展示了伊渥克
In 1983, George Lucas introduced the world to the Ewoks,

220
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,840
一种生活在Endor的 第二卫星的土著生物.
a race of creatures indigenous to the second moon of Endor.

221
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
现在要介绍伊渥克的 丰富的背景知识
Now, the Ewoks have a rich back-story

222
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
而电影没有向我们展示...
that the movie didn't really go into.

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,410
Barney,你还是直接跳到
Barney, why don't you just skip

224
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,490
跟Nora有关系的部分吧?
to the part about you and Nora?

225
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,240
好吧
(sighs) Fine.

226
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,070
Ah, 对了
Ah, yes.

227
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,340
最后,伊渥克把  <i>星球大战</i>影迷分成两类
Ultimately, Ewoks split <i>Star</i> <i>Wars</i> fandom into two camps:

228
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,430
一类出生于1973年五月25日之前，另一类出生于之后
those born before, and those born after May 25, 1973:

229
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,630
伊渥克之线
the Ewok Line.

230
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,720
所有出生于此线左边的观众
Anyone born on this side of the Ewok Line was

231
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,120
在星球大战出产时 都至少已经超过十岁
at least ten years old when Jedi came out,

232
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,430
他们已经太老了 无法体会到可爱的事物
and thus too old for something so cloying and cute.

233
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,370
出生于这边的人都喜欢 为什么呢？
Anyone born on this side loved the Ewoks because, why?

234
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,400
因为他们让你想起...
They reminded you of...

235
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,490
泰迪熊？
Our teddies?

236
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,960
他们让你想起泰迪熊！
They reminded you of your teddies.

237
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,790
谢谢，Gina.
Thank you, Gina.

238
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,580
你怎么知道她名字的？
How do you know her name?

239
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,120
所以，根据亘古不变的伊渥克之线法则
And so... by the immutable laws of the Ewok Line,

240
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,590
我的29岁的讨厌伊渥克的女友
my 29-year-old girlfriend who hates Ewoks

241
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:54,310
其实至少已经37岁了
must in fact be no younger than... 37.

242
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,600
只比Will的妈妈年轻了一岁
That's only a year younger than Will's mom.

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,810
你怎么知道我妈妈的？ 下课！
How do you know my mom? Class dismissed!

244
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,320
我要一个人待一会
I need to be alone.

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,800
好吧，我们继续
All right, we're moving on.

246
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,190
Ooh，我能来么？
Ooh, can I come?

247
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,270
Hey, 亲爱的
(cell phone rings) Hey, baby.

248
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,770
Hey,我只是想提醒你一下 我们跟Sonya医生约在了4点做体检
Hey, I just want to remind you we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.

249
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,480
我会去的... 我只是感觉...我觉得非常沮丧
I'll be there. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm bummed.

250
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,030
我们拿到和解协议了
We got our settlement offer today:

251
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,320
从一个日进斗金的公司 只拿到24000美元的索赔
$24,000 from a billion-dollar company.

252
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,770
Wow.我觉得 你们肯定不会很高兴
Wow. I take it people aren't happy about that.

253
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,820
我们赢了， 每个人都有香槟和蛋糕！
We won! Champagne and cake for everybody!

254
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,960
他们在 庆祝！
They're celebrating.

255
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
我觉得他们疯了！
I mean, it's crazy.

256
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,430
我们没资格 去吃蛋糕
We have no right to be eating cake.

257
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,850
你们有蛋糕？ 我马上到
There's cake?! I'm on my way!

258
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,330
<i>与此同时</i> <i>这场糟糕的实地教学还在继续</i>
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, the worst field trip</i> <i>of all time was still trucking.</i>

259
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,300
好了，这里<i>这里</i>让人心情澎湃
All right, this, <i>this</i> is exciting, okay?

260
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,690
就在这个房子里
This is the very room

261
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,140
我想到了GNB大厦 的创意
where I had the idea for the GNB Tower.

262
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,010
韦伯大字典把 "灵感"定义为...
Now, Webster's defines "inspiration" as...

Hold一下. 页面还在打开
Hold on. It's still loading.

Well,我 <i>正在</i>  调整我的取向
Well, I <i>was</i> about to get my swerve on.

267
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,040
真的？
You were?

268
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,450
那么，你就是那个治疗师了？
So you're the therapist.

269
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,570
假装一个治疗师
You know, it's one thing to pretend to be a shrink

270
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,630
来勾搭女孩是一件事 这很正常
and bang your patients. That's normal.

271
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,330
但是，来真的， 哥们，这也太坑爹了
But to do it for real? A little creepy, bro.

272
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,920
Okay, 这一点也不坑爹
Okay, it's not creepy.

273
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,000
Ehhhh... 是有点坑爹
BOTH: Ehhhh... it's creepy.

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,840
同学们，举手表决：
Class, show of hands:

275
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,710
跟自己的心理治疗师约会 是不是很坑爹啊？
Who thinks it's creepy to date your therapist?

276
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,340
- 人民的选择 - 出去！
- Pollstered. - Get out!

277
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,380
好吧 我们继续！
All right. We're moving on!

278
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,710
同学们，在你们的左边
So, class, to your left,

279
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,400
你们会看到一些完美的建筑例子
you will see some excellent examples of

我们称之为：窗户
what we'd call windows.

281
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,900
我们现在要去哪里？
So where are we going now?

282
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
我没想法
I have no idea.

283
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,400
这简直就是个灾难
This is a disaster.

284

他们中有些人已经回家了
Some of them are already starting to go home.

285
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,080
而且好像有一家德国人 在跟着我们
Although we seem to have picked up a German family.

286
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,990
等等
BARNEY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,730
刚才Robin和她治疗师的事
That thing with Robin and her creepy therapist

288
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,730
让我有了好主意
gave me an idea.

289
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,700
Ted,我们对于过去的争论
Ted, we have here a way

有了一个前所未有的解决途径！
to solve every single debate we've ever had!

292
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,460
男孩，女孩，黑人，亚洲人，还有德国人
guys, girls, blacks, Asians, a German family.

再也没有更好的机会了!
You can't pay for that kind of focus group!

294
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,750
通心粉色拉能算真正的色拉么？
Is macaroni salad really a salad?

295
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,250
认为不对的人，请举手！
Hands up if you say "no."

296
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,270

Ha, ha. See? 我早跟你说过了.

It's Edward James Olmos.

你情愿跟一个死人
Would you rather have sex with a dead human being

302
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,030
还是跟一个活着的动... 哥们
or a live an...? Dude.

303
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,600
啥事? 注意底线
What? Find the line.

304
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,070
有谁觉得David Hasselhoff帅呆了?
Who thinks David Hasselhoff is awesome?

305
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,740
Hmm. 有道理
Hmm. It's true.

306
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,450
Okay.我有了， 如果你跟一个女孩子约会
Okay. I've got one. If you're dating a girl,

307
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,960
她对自己的年龄 撒谎了
and she lies about her age,

308
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,920
有谁同意 跟她分手的？
who says break up with her?

309
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes, yes, 但假如她的撒谎对象
Yes, yes, but what if the person she's lying to

310
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,280
对年龄的偏见臭名昭著呢？
is notoriously shallow about age?

311
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,630
好吧，但是如果在 开始约会之前
Okay, but what if early in our relationship,

312
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,970
她对不要在两人之间
she made a really big deal

313
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,580
存在谎言做了承诺呢?
about wanting to not lie to each other?

314
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,640
假如她是个辣妹呢?
What if she's hot?

315
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,670
谁要五美元?
Who wants five bucks?

316
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,260
人民的选择!
Pollstered!

317
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,760
让我们开始吧！
Let's do this.

318
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,183
(giggling)

319
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:44,235
(clears throat)

320
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,970
Hmm? Yeah.
(murmurs) Hmm? Yeah.

321
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,980
Mm...
(giggling)

322
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,490
Okay, 真是坑爹啊
Mm...

323
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,990
这简直比日和漫画还坑爹
Okay, this is creepy.

324
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,410
你是我的病人
It's Crispin Glover creepy.

325
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,690
你跟我说了你的私人秘密
You were my patient.

326
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,490
这简直跟你的妇科医生约会一样
You shared intimate stuff.

327
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,497
It would be like dating your gynecologist.

328
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,610
你很脆弱
You were vulnerable.

329
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,110
我们不能对过去 避而不谈
That's not something we can move past.

330
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,280
是不能
(sighs) Guess not.

331
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,500
那么跟你的妇科医生也感觉很差么？
So, dating your gyno, that's bad, too?

332
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,670
Oh, Robin.
Oh, Robin.

333
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,370
开玩笑啦！
Kidding!

334
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,070
我们又有新的蛋糕啦！
Look, we've got another one!

335
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,098
(laughing)

336
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,490
来吧，来咬一口！
Come on, have a bite.

337
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,380
不，这个事关原则！
No, it's a matter of principle.

338
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,850
我不管这个蛋糕有多好吃
I don't care how good it is,

339
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,470
我不会再吃第三块蛋糕了！
I'm not gonna have a third piece of cake!

340
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,500
Okay, 同事们，我们今天过的很开心
Okay, guys, you all had a lot of fun today,

341
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,390
现在让我们... 过的更开心！
but now it's time... to have even more fun!

342
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,590
又是一个蛋糕!
Another cake!

343
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,360
又是一个蛋糕?!
MARSHALL: Another cake?!

344
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,310
你们究竟怎么了?!
What is the matter with you people?!

345
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,850
今天的和解协议就像一坨熊熊燃烧的...
That settlement today was a flaming pile of...

346
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,750
小狗...
puppies...

347
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,540
还没着火的那种！
that aren't on fire!

348
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,710
看看外面环境正在遭受着怎样的破坏,
Look at what's happening to the environment,

349
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,410
而我们却在这里载歌载舞?
and we're here doing the limbo?

350
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,490
我们应该为我们自己感到羞耻
I mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves!

351
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,500
先生，我的意思是...
Sir, all I meant was...

352
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,890
从现在起十年之内
Ten years from right now,

353
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,040
所有在外面的人都会死掉！
everyone outside in that bullpen will be dead.

354
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,510
神马?
What?

355
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,430
我看过最新的报告了,  Marsh.
I've seen the latest research, Marsh.

356
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,000
你知道我总是在说
You know how I'm always saying

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,020
现在拯救地球还不算太迟?
it's not too late to save the planet?

358
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,050
现在拯救地球 已经太迟了！
It's too late to save the planet.

359
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,240
现在我们什么都不能做
There's nothing to do but sit back

360
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,930
只能干坐等死
and await our inevitable doom.

361
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,900
噢，天哪，真是太可爱了
(noisemaker tooting)

362
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,901
Oh, my goodness, a pi?ata!

363
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,330
再给我一分钟，Larry.
Just give me one minute, Larry.

364
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,900
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,250
我们可怕的，难以避免的灭亡!
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!

366
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
当然，你不能 现在出去
Now, of course, you can't go around

367
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,090
告诉所有人
telling all the people

368
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,840
这艘 <i>环保主义</i>的大船
that the good ship <i>Environmentalism</i>

369
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,410
正在驶向落日
has sailed off into the sunset.

370
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,040
这样会引起恐慌
There would cause a panic.

371
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,900
或者，我们能做的是
So, instead, what we do is,

372
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,350
我们去工作， 摆着一张笑脸
we come to work, we put on a happy face,

373
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,600
我们起诉那些大公司
and we sue the big guys

374
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,090
让他们赔偿一些钱 正好用来买蛋糕
for just enough money for some cake

375
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,560
而这之后未过滤的射线 将像晒咸鱼那样的晒干我们
before the unfiltered rays of the sun fry us like chalupas,

376
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,530
我们的肺里 将会填满海水
and our lungs fill up with salt water,

377
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,950
然后我们都死了
and we all die!

378
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,530
Mmm.这蛋糕太好吃了，世界太美好了！
Mmm. This cake is delicious. Everything's fine.

379
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,760
Ugh, 今天糟透了！
Ugh, this day sucks.

380
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,210
Kevin和我分手了
Kevin and I are kaputski.

381
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,830
你觉得这样就糟糕么?
You think that's bad?

382
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,160
这个世界就要毁灭了
The world is coming to an end.

383
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,060
你觉得这样就糟糕么?
You think that's bad?

384
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,200
我女朋友37岁了!
My girlfriend is 37!

385
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,500
我的现场教学 跟想象的差距太大了
And my field trip is not going as well as I'd hoped.

386
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,660
Hmm.
Hmm.

387
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,560
今天糟透了
This day sucks.

388
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,180
Mosby教授, 今天的课结束了么？
Professor Mosby, is the field trip over?

389
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,010
我们想回家了
We'd like to go home.

390
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah, 下课了
Yeah, it's over.

391
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,770
<i>再见</i>（德语）
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

392
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,430
我只是想激励他们,
I just wanted to inspire them,

393
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,890
就像我的老师激励我一样
you know, like my professors inspired me.

394
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,110
但是，到了一天结束
But here we are, at the end of the day...

395
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,660
Hey,同学们，即兴测试，
Hey, class, quick question.

396
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,410
Uh, 有没有人想成为一个建筑师的?
Uh, is anyone here thinking of becoming an architect?

397
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,172
(clucks tongue)

398
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,750
Really?
Really?

399
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,920
Yeah, 哥们. 说真的,
Yeah, dude. I mean,

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,570
所有工作都烂透了
all jobs suck,

401
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
但在下午四点
but it's 4:00 in the afternoon,

402
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,540
你跟你的朋友在酒吧
and you're out at a bar with your friends,

403
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,760
所以看起来似乎也不是太差
so the hours can't be that bad.

404
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,380
所以...
So...

405
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,770
yeah, 我不知道，我会考虑一下的
yeah, I don't know, I'd think about it.

406
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,090
你把我感动了 Oh!
(voice cracking): I got through to you. Oh!

407
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,760
我是说，假如当一名DJ不成功的话
I mean, that is, if becoming a deejay doesn't pan out.

408
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,980
你会成为一名伟大的建筑师的
You are gonna be a great architect.

409
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,100
<i>他成了一名DJ</i>
NARRATOR: <i>He became a deejay.</i>

410
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,070
Robin, 你怎么在这里?
Robin, what are you doing here?

411
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,610
我跟你说过了，我不能当你的心理治疗师
I told you I can't be your therapist.

412
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,450
我知道
I know.

413
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,940
今天我是你的心理治疗师
Today, I am your therapist.

414
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
神马?
What?

415
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,160
你自己说过了
You said yourself,

416
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,410
我总是给自己找不开心的理由
I'm always looking for reasons not to be happy.

417
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,330
现在我要试图改变
Well, I'm trying to change that.

418
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,450
所以我们不能在一起 仅仅是因为
So, if the only reason we can't be together

419
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,450
我对你打开心扉而变得脆弱的话
is because I was in a vulnerable place

420
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,130
在接下来的两个小时里 我们会相互了解
for the first two hours we knew each other

421
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,420
这两小时是你欠我的
then that is two hours of vulnerability you owe me.

422
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,340
坐下
Sit down.

423
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,290
Okay.
Okay.

424
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,810
Okay,但是我必须要提醒你，作为一个专业人士我很有抵抗力...
Okay, but I must warn you, as a professional, I'm immune to...

425
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,780
跟我谈谈你的母亲吧
Tell me about your mother.

426
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,930
她简直就是一个控制狂!
Everything she says is a manipulation!

427
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,270
在我七岁的时候...
When I was seven years old...

428
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,940
Mr. Cootes.
Mr. Cootes.

429
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,820
- Hey. - 对于你昨天说的
- Hey. - Listen, I've been thinking

430
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,740
我想了很久
a lot about what you said yesterday,

431
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,270
我们都会死
about how we're all gonna die.

432
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,580
Oh,我不会死
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

433
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,700
我在科来拉多买了一个废弃矿井
I bought an old mine shaft in Colorado.

434
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,730
我花了六个月 去贮藏罐装食物
I've spent the last six months filling it with canned goods,

435
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,870
还有来复枪 去PT下载了五季的 <i>胜利之光</i>
assault rifles and all five seasons of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

436
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,750
Okay,首先，你可以跳过第二季
Okay, first of all, you can skip season two.

437
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,160
第二，在我们谈话之后...
Second of all, after our talk...

438
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,750
我原本打算 放纵自己的生活
I came pretty close to giving up myself.

439
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,300
但是当我跟我的妻子 去医生那边
But then I went to the doctor with my wife...

440
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
做检查的时候...
and...

441
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,940
我看到了这个.
(taps key)

442
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,942
I saw this.

443
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,370
男孩女孩?
Boy or girl?

444
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,510
我不知道
I don't know.

445
