1
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:03,297
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:07,190
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,259
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,296
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:16,899
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:18,801
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,171
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:25,541
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,478
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,746
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:31,947
Why are you here?

12
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:33,316
Because I want to go faster,

13
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,850
and you're the only
one who can teach me.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,220
Everything you need is on this drive.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,388
It means a lot, you
looking after Barry.

16
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:43,392
Barry's not the only person
here I'm keeping safe.

17
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,495
We found Barry's double,
so where the hell am I?

18
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,296
Reverb.

19
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:50,666
You don't even know
how powerful you are.

20
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,693
My name was Hunter Zolomon.

21
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,737
I thought that if I could find
my doppelganger on this Earth,

22
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,906
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

23
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,176
I've been vibing Zoom, and
every time it's happened,

24
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,577
I've been near that thing.

25
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:04,804
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

26
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:06,808
15 YEARS AGO

27
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,542
Sometimes terrible things happen
to us when we're children.

28
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,355
Things that can define who we become,

29
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,723
whether we want them to or not.

30
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,091
Run, Barry, run!

31
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,726
Some of us become stronger.

32
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,595
The people who took
me and helped me heal

33
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,365
and move past everything that happened.

34
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,201
They're responsible for
who I've become today.

35
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,370
But I know that I'm one
of the lucky ones.

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,871
Come on, Barry.

37
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,106
Not everyone gets
that kind of support.

38
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:33,442
Without it, I don't know
where I would have ended up

39
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:36,920
or what I could've become.

40
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:41,750
EARTH TWO
MANY YEARS AGO

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,720
- James...
- Who do you think you are?

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,290
Do you know what I went
through over there?

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,793
Do you know the sacrifices
I made for you?

44
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,129
I come back after years of
fighting for this country

45
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,440
and this is my welcome home?

46
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:59,768
You think you can walk out on me?

47
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,204
I'm your husband!

48
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,672
You're not my husband.

49
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,707
I don't know what you are right now.

50
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,510
I am a hero, Ashley.

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,380
No. You're a monster.

52
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,782
Run, Hunter, run.

53
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,226
Stay, boy!

54
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:28,030
It's okay.

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,399
Please. Please don't do this.

56
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:33,076
- Shut up!
- No, please.

57
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:42,077
No.

58
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:45,448
You're gonna want to see this, son.

59
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,783
No, James!

60
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,686
Please.

61
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,930
No. No, James.

62
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,599
No!

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,654
CENTRAL CITY
ORPHANAGE

64
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,884
- Name?
- Hunter Zolomon.

65
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:25,321
Father killed the mother.
Kid saw the whole thing.

66
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,589
Next of kin?

67
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,357
No relatives wanted him.

68
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,360
He is all alone.

69
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,530
Follow me.

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,308
And don't dawdle.

71
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,963
KEYSTONE CITY
OPENING SOON FOR PREVIEWS

72
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,888
Okay, you guys. I'm here.

73
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,990
- You got my location?
- You're good?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,426
You don't need to, like,
stretch or something?

75
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,160
No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

76
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,863
Let's take this tachyon
enhancer out for a test drive.

77
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,073
All right.

78
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:15,471
Yeah. I feel that.

79
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:17,940
That is the tachyon device
powering up the Speed Force

80
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,508
in your cells like a
quick charge battery.

81
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,744
- How do you feel?
- Different.

82
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,646
Let's see how long it
takes you to get back here.

83
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:27,015
On my count.

84
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,652
Three, two, one.

85
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,895
Go!

86
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,226
This thing got you cruising.

87
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,795
- How fast does he normally go?
- Not this fast.

88
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,231
Not even close. Are his vitals okay?

89
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,900
Yeah, they're perfect.

90
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,979
Cool. It's like having a
pit-stop attached to your chest.

91
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:57,112
Guys, I can go faster.

92
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,722
Do it.

93
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:14,430
I'm back.

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,899
What... how long was I gone?

95
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,267
Let's put it this way,

96
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,603
you just annihilated your old record.

97
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,606
Yeah, you went four times
faster than you have ever been.

98
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,741
Four times?

99
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,243
- That's as...
- Fast as Zoom.

100
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:32,314
Well, faster actually.

101
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,417
Hey... do we think that...

102
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:37,219
we can get this thing smaller?
It kind of sucks.

103
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:43,091
If it sucks, then, yeah.

104
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,161
All right, so now all we have to do is
figure out how to get back to Zoom.

105
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,931
Yes... just a minor issue.

106
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,132
We closed all the breaches

107
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,567
and have no idea how to reopen them.

108
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,502
We don't... Wells?

109
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:54,837
Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.

110
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,271
Let's keep the breaches closed forever.

111
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,974
Forget about the breaches.
Forget about Zoom.

112
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,275
Wait, I'm sorry,

113
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:01,610
I thought that you were
on board with this.

114
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,247
No. No. I said I would
help you get faster.

115
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,049
I did not say I would
help you give the man

116
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:10,352
who kidnapped my daughter and
tortured her a chance to do it again.

117
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:13,121
Hey, we are not gonna let that happen.

118
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,757
Oh, you're not gonna let that happen.

119
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,391
Gosh, I wish I'd known
that the first time.

120
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:20,563
You don't understand Zoom
is different than us.

121
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,465
Zoom is not tied to anything.

122
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:25,167
Zoom does not care for anyone.

123
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,669
I do.

124
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,236
My daughter's out here
on this Earth somewhere.

125
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,573
I have to find her. We all have people

126
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,041
that we care about. Zoom
will use that against us.

127
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:37,012
Believe me.

128
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,614
Maybe we should just leave it be.

129
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,749
No, no. Look, no. Look, we're...

130
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,751
We're not turning our
backs on another Earth.

131
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,787
We're not gonna let Zoom

132
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,455
get away with everything that he's done.

133
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:52,060
Right now, there is no way
to another Earth, Allen.

134
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,237
Let's keep it that way.

135
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,635
We're getting back to Earth-2.

136
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:02,070
With or without his help.

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,280
Let's go to work.

138
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,844
Hey, where are you going?

139
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,587
We could use your help.

140
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,214
Yeah, I would.

141
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:16,251
It's just I have a date with Scott.

142
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:19,087
- That's the editor?
- Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,956
That's good. No, I'm glad
that you're finding a way

144
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,858
to move on without
anything holding you back.

145
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,092
You deserve that.

146
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:25,561
Yeah, and well, I would have been able

147
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,095
to do it without your support.

148
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,764
It means a lot to me, so...

149
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:29,899
- Of course.
- Thanks.

150
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,901
Yes, for sure.

151
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:36,069
Well, hey, I mean, if you don't get this
breach problem fix by tonight...

152
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,603
bets me on for tomorrow?

153
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:39,808
I can do that.

154
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,217
Okay.

155
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:52,287
Man, I love it when you
train in Keystone City.

156
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,889
Hey, you sticking around after dinner?

157
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,266
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula 1.

158
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,227
No, I can't.

159
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:00,829
I got to get back to the lab.

160
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,397
I'm still trying to find
a way back to Earth-2.

161
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:03,899
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

162
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,634
No, he refused.

163
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:09,304
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

164
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,739
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

165
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,141
about a man I shot at...
and punched in the face,

166
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:14,743
but I think you should listen to him.

167
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,144
Why?

168
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,580
Barry, it worries the hell out of me

169
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,514
the thought that you want
to go back to Earth-2.

170
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,885
I'm faster now. I'm
faster than I've ever been.

171
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:25,187
I'm faster than Zoom.

172
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,289
I can take him down.

173
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,657
All I'm saying is,

174
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,225
you already escaped the
hornet's nest once.

175
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,902
Why go back and kick it again?

176
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,131
- Hey.
- Wally!

177
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,400
We got some pizza here all
the way from Keystone City.

178
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,669
Hope it's cool I
brought my laundry over.

179
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,638
Of course. Barry used
to do his laundry here

180
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,239
all the time when he was in college.

181
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,309
That's cause those machines in the dorm
always eat your quarters, right?

182
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,612
Actually, I'm not...
living on campus anymore.

183
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,947
What? Since when?

184
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,913
Since room and board became way
more expensive than I thought.

185
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,486
Man, I can help you out with that.

186
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,021
I mean, I figured your
money must be tight

187
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:02,157
after paying all your
mother's medical bills.

188
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,860
How much more is it?

189
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,394
No, it's... it's cool.

190
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:07,796
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

191
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,765
Plus I got that mini-fridge
in the garage.

192
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:10,933
You can use that, too, if you want.

193
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:14,003
Joe, I'm good. Really.

194
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,938
All right.

195
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:19,049
Let me just put
these in real quick.

196
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,947
Man, I can't figure
that kid out sometimes.

197
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:27,323
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

198
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,120
Hey.

199
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:38,560
Any ideas?

200
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,830
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,298
is to set off a nuclear warhead

202
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,900
next to the city's
electrical grid, so...

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,803
We're not gonna do that.

204
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,047
I think I thought of something though.

205
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:55,544
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

206
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,912
Reverb.

207
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,414
What were Reverb's
powers on your Earth?

208
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:03,118
He could tap into the multi-dimensional
energies between Earths.

209
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,054
He could see through dimensions.

210
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,122
Find breachers, like Ramon.

211
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,624
I mean, we... we saw Reverb do
more than that though, right?

212
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:12,627
I mean, we saw him shoot
vibrational bursts

213
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:15,030
out of his hands. Really painful ones.

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,431
What do you mean?

215
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,601
I-I mean, Reverb had
the ability to somehow

216
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,071
manipulate that
multi-dimensional energy.

217
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,306
- What's your point, Allen?
- My point is...

218
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,709
if his powers are linked to the energy

219
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,144
that ties together the multi-verse...

220
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,879
if he can manipulate it...

221
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,748
Then he can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

222
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,284
Exactly. And if Reverb could do it...

223
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,520
I could do it too.

224
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,399
Cisco, I think the way
back to Earth-2 is you.

225
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,281
I got nothing.

226
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,783
Try again, okay?

227
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,084
Barry, what if he can't do it

228
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,351
because he thinks he can't do it?

229
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,495
He can do it though. You can do it.

230
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,602
You... it's gonna work, okay.

231
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,604
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

232
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,840
Or maybe I'm just not the
right man for the job.

233
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,342
Right? Let's go.

234
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,644
Cisco.

235
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:30,289
I'm sorry, Barry.

236
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:33,526
It's gonna work.

237
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,996
Detective...

238
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:47,565
I need to ask you...

239
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,267
Oh, you've got company.

240
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:53,839
No, it's... cool. I
should be studying anyway.

241
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,974
Do you know you kind of
look like that guy...

242
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:59,477
- I'm not him.
- Okay.

243
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,687
Later, Joe.

244
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,359
Thank you. Look...

245
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:17,162
I apologize for dropping by unannounced.

246
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:18,997
I just...

247
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,067
have you had any luck
locating my daughter?

248
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,770
Not yet, but I circulated her picture

249
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,337
through every department in the region.

250
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,774
And I reached out to some
friends in Keystone.

251
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,809
She's smart.

252
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,443
She's gonna know how to stay hidden.

253
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,712
- She's...
- We'll find her.

254
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,281
Right.

255
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,384
There's another thing also, Detective.

256
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:42,254
A favor.

257
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:45,123
I would ask you to talk Barry out

258
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,533
of reopening the breaches to my Earth.

259
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,366
I can't do that.

260
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,435
No.

261
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,305
You can't find a way to change his mind

262
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,407
for both our children's sakes?

263
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,309
Look,

264
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:09,181
I think it's just as dumb as you do.

265
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:11,216
but I learned a long time
ago that I can't talk Barry

266
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,351
out of anything once he
sets his mind to it.

267
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,822
Zoom is terrorizing this other world...
your world.

268
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:20,425
He can't let it go.

269
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:24,562
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

270
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,932
Go with Barry.

271
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,033
Help him.

272
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:31,169
Help him?

273
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,004
Why would I do that?

274
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:36,374
'Cause he's got a much better
chance of defeating Zoom

275
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:39,118
if you're involved.

276
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,651
This area has the highest levels

277
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:49,321
of residual trans-dimensional energy.

278
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,731
Should be able to open the
breach that used to be here.

279
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:57,062
It's right here. This is it.

280
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,064
For real? In this Patch
Adams nightmare right here?

281
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:01,399
- Yeah.
- Love it.

282
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,901
All right.

283
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,670
Look, dude, if this doesn't work,

284
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,740
I'll stop asking you
to do this, all right?

285
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,617
Okay.

286
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,721
What?

287
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:26,191
I can't do it.

288
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,459
That's right.

289
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,028
You can't.

290
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,863
What are you doing here? You said...

291
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:34,332
I know what I said.

292
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,501
But you're not gonna stop, are you?

293
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,136
No.

294
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,305
Okay, Barry Allen, then
I'm gonna do what I can

295
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,341
to make sure you don't get killed.

296
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,277
I recalibrated these

297
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,645
to the electromagnetic
frequency of this Earth.

298
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:51,983
It should help you access enough
of the trans-dimensional energy

299
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:55,353
to manipulate it.

300
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,455
Just like Reverb.

301
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,823
All I'm missing is the guyliner

302
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,159
and the transformation's complete.

303
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,936
Take 'em out for a spin.

304
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:34,926
(T)(U)S(U)B(T)IT(U)L(O).(CO)M

305
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,337
It's working.

306
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:59,317
Keep coming, Cisco. Keep coming.

307
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,227
It's working.

308
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,901
Hey, what... what happened?
You were doing it.

309
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,070
No, no, no, no. I-I can't do this.

310
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,872
- What?
- I can't. Don't.

311
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,574
Please, don't ask me to do this.

312
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,951
Please.

313
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,893
Hey. What do we got?

314
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,658
It's your tachyon
absorption enhancer upgrade.

315
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,760
Retrofitted from when it was
used to steal your speed,

316
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,497
to now give you more of it.

317
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:42,798
Almost done.

318
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:44,400
That's amazing. Thank you.

319
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,269
You're welcome.

320
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,070
Is Cisco back yet? Have we seen him?

321
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,306
- I haven't seen him.
- Check his workshop.

322
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,175
Yeah, all right.

323
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,177
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:57,588
We just came by to see if
you guys needed some help.

325
00:16:59,312 --> 00:16:59,748
Sure.

326
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,185
- Yeah. - We can always use
an extra set of hands.

327
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,540
- Do you want to help me in the med bay?
- Yeah.

328
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,589
Some advice?

329
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,424
This whole Wally thing...

330
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,100
He won't let me help him.

331
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:14,029
It's probably 'cause you're not
offering the right kind of help.

332
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,899
Wally doesn't want your help
paying for a place to live.

333
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:20,469
He wants you to offer
him a place to live.

334
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,471
- Why didn't he just say that?
- I don't know.

335
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,139
So he does want to live in our house?

336
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:25,741
Yeah, man.

337
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,444
Look, Wally's never lived
with his father before.

338
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,421
And trust me, that is a big deal.

339
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:31,755
And you're good with it?

340
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,418
I mean, you know, it's been you
and me for so long, and I love that,

341
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,152
but having Wally around
would be cool too.

342
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:41,023
Just we won't get to have as
much pizza from Keystone.

343
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,725
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.

344
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:45,261
Have to get used to that.

345
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,698
They really have a
special bond, don't they?

346
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,167
Yeah, they sure do.

347
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:55,371
Are you okay?

348
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:59,442
I don't know what I am.

349
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,410
Last night, I was
supposed to go on a date.

350
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,946
My first real date since Eddie died,

351
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:07,916
but at the last second, I just...
I couldn't do it.

352
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:11,987
Is it because of Eddie
or because of Barry?

353
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:14,457
I've noticed the way you've
been looking at him recently.

354
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,191
Is it that obvious?

355
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:18,461
Only to a woman who's been
through the same thing.

356
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:19,928
Everything seems to be telling me

357
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,331
that Barry and I are
meant to be together.

358
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,467
I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

359
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:27,035
In the future, we're supposedly married.

360
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,204
And now that I'm finally
ready to move on,

361
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:31,974
I just wonder if that
should be with Barry.

362
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,943
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

363
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:38,213
Do you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

364
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,391
Maybe for you.

365
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,030
Hello?

366
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:52,736
- Joe?
- Wally, I'm up here.

367
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,900
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

368
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,168
It's not done yet.

369
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,436
I mean, you can decorate
it how you like.

370
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:02,438
- Make it your own.
- Wait, Joe.

371
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,106
What is this?

372
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,409
Wally, forgive me.

373
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,277
When Barry and Iris went to college,

374
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,546
they couldn't get away fast enough.

375
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,014
They wanted nothing to
do with their old man.

376
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,650
It didn't even occur to me

377
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,286
that you might feel differently.

378
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:21,557
It's embarrassing, but it took
Barry to help me see that.

379
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,794
So, if you still haven't
found a place to live,

380
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,061
live here.

381
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:30,800
I mean, it's yours if you want to.

382
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,568
You're serious?

383
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,570
I'm not gonna do your laundry.

384
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,405
And I'm not washing dishes after you.

385
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,441
And this bed is going to be made
every morning before you leave.

386
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:40,275
And there will be no
beer in that fridge,

387
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,986
but yeah, it's yours.

388
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:46,482
When can I move in?

389
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,751
Whenever you want.

390
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,619
All right.

391
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:52,429
Thanks, Dad.

392
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:04,641
Hey, man.

393
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:12,708
Look...

394
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,943
I know what it's like...

395
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:18,514
Zoom, getting in your head,

396
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:21,291
how scary that can be.

397
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:27,523
It's not Zoom.

398
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,392
It's me.

399
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,159
What do you mean it's you?

400
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:34,830
It's like right now
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

401
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,365
I got the midi-chlorians.

402
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,166
I've got the goods.

403
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,068
The force is strong with me.

404
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:41,837
That is something I can feel.

405
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:45,941
But if I start opening
breaches into other worlds,

406
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,913
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then...

407
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:53,416
what if this is how I become Vader?

408
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,284
Dude, you're never
going to become Vader.

409
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:57,620
You don't know that. That
is what happened to Reverb.

410
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,055
He learned how to use his abilities,

411
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,324
and when he felt that,

412
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,827
when he felt that power,

413
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:06,862
he succumbed...

414
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:08,672
to the dark side.

415
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:13,035
Look, I get it. I-I really do.

416
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,638
Every time I've learned a new ability,

417
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,106
I've been terrified about
what it might mean for me.

418
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,842
What it could do to me, you know?

419
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:23,378
But you were there with me

420
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:26,248
when I learned how to run on water,

421
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,183
when I ran up a building,

422
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:31,887
or traveled through time.

423
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:33,255
Just like I'm gonna be there

424
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,425
every step of the way with you.

425
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:38,393
You got something that Reverb never had,

426
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:41,464
and that's Caitlin and Joe

427
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,499
and Iris and Wells and me.

428
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,701
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

429
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,235
And we're more than just friends.

430
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,939
We're your family.

431
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:51,340
So what do you say?

432
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,867
Ready to put those things on
again, and go another round?

433
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:00,649
Let's do it.

434
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,593
All right.

435
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,660
You're all set.

436
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,428
He won't even know it's there.

437
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:16,264
'Cause whoever said
aesthetics aren't important.

438
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:18,266
Not me.

439
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:22,204
Let's go.

440
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:24,840
Hey, Cait, I know how hard

441
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,409
this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

442
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,777
I know, and I want to be supportive.

443
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:31,446
I just... I can't face Jay.

444
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,582
Or whatever his real name is.

445
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,250
What does that mean?

446
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,585
Well, you remember when I was looking

447
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:37,920
for his doppelganger, right?

448
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,922
Yeah. And you couldn't find him.

449
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:42,157
Because there is no Jay
Garrick on this Earth.

450
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:45,093
His doppelganger's name
is Hunter Zolomon.

451
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:48,697
Hunter Zolomon?

452
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:50,298
Are you sure?

453
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:53,368
Yeah, why?

454
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:57,339
Well, because on my Earth,

455
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:01,384
Hunter Zolomon was a
convicted serial killer.

456
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:04,947
That's Jay?

457
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:08,584
No, that is Hunter.

458
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,553
Last public photo of Hunter Zolomon.

459
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,655
Instantly recognizable. And
people from my Earth...

460
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,623
on my Earth, serial
killers are an anomaly,

461
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,959
so a lot of media attention to this.

462
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:18,827
There was a podcast.

463
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:21,997
When Hunter was 11, his
father killed his mother

464
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,532
right in front of him.

465
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:24,900
Father sent to prison,

466
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,702
Hunter grew up in the
foster care system.

467
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:30,539
Years later he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder.

468
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,611
23? That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter type level.

469
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:37,880
After the trial, Hunter was sent

470
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,648
to the Saint Perez Mental Asylum

471
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:44,219
for the Criminally Insane...

472
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:47,322
given daily electroshock therapy.

473
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:50,192
Cure him of his urges and
then faded from view.

474
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:53,095
Until the night your
particle accelerator exploded.

475
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:56,231
That's right. The dark matter
crept into the mental asylum.

476
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,266
I had thought...

477
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:00,368
piping the explosion underground
would limit exposure.

478
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:01,804
I was wrong.

479
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,723
All it did was create
an unstoppable monster.

480
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,980
NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER CAUGHT!

481
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:04,375
He's not unstoppable.

482
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,836
Jay doesn't know that we
know who he really is.

483
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:10,572
He thinks that his past is a secret.

484
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:14,576
- So?
- I think I have an idea

485
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:16,987
of how we can stop him.

486
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:24,422
Are you sure Jay can't get in here?

487
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,991
Pretty sure, but just in case.

488
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,393
How do you use this?

489
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,161
All right, so you aim it,

490
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:32,564
- and then you pull the trigger.
- Smart ass.

491
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,765
Barry and Cisco are in position.

492
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,066
Let's hope this thing works.

493
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,102
- You ready, buddy?
- Yeah.

494
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:40,538
You've always believed in me.

495
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:44,517
- Thank you.
- You got this.

496
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,166
Reverb's doppelganger

497
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:11,068
has increased his powers.

498
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:13,638
Hatred is a strong motivator.

499
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:18,543
You were unwise to reopen the breach.

500
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:21,479
I'm not gonna let you terrorize
another world anymore.

501
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:25,617
Without your speed,

502
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,687
you won't be able to stop me.

503
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:30,863
Let's see.

504
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,699
- Zoom's gaining on Barry.
- He can't catch him.

505
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,342
He better not.

506
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,315
- That was close.
- Too close.

507
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,351
The tachyon device is working.

508
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:02,729
Here they come.

509
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,468
They're here.

510
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,838
You've gotten faster.

511
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:24,676
Good. There'll be more for me to take.

512
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,252
You want my speed?

513
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,060
Catch me.

514
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:01,186
You're gonna want to see this, son.

515
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,501
- Get him, Barry.
- It's working.

516
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,546
No!

517
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,064
How did you figure out who I was?

518
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,463
You made a mistake.

519
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:55,341
You told Caitlin who
your doppelganger was.

520
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,040
I had to do something to get
her to stop trying... to fix me.

521
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,283
She's a smart girl.

522
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,948
- And that I was Zoom?
- The Velocity-9.

523
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,415
When you run fast enough,

524
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:15,152
it turns a speedster's lightning blue.

525
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,821
We would have helped you.

526
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:20,725
We would have done anything
we could to save your life.

527
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:23,561
Not everything.

528
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:26,097
Caitlin found you a cure!

529
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,032
A temporary one!

530
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,901
I'm dying, Barry!

531
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,837
There's only one thing that
can get me what I need.

532
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:34,271
And you just don't care

533
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:36,440
how many lives you destroy
trying to get it?

534
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,011
- How many people you kill?!
- No, I don't!

535
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:43,956
That feeling was taken
from me a long time ago.

536
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,088
We're not so different, you know.

537
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:54,158
What happened to us when we were kids.

538
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,328
You could have just as easily become me.

539
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,096
No.

540
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:01,799
I'd never become like you.

541
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:05,503
I got to say...

542
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:11,250
that was smart using...
my parents against me.

543
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:15,914
Oh, family. Such a weakness.

544
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:17,715
Not for all of us.

545
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:21,753
Well, that's where you're wrong.

546
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:24,196
It's time I get what I came for.

547
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:29,060
You're not getting anything from me.

548
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,897
You're not getting anything
from anybody ever again.

549
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:36,434
On any Earth.

550
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:39,771
You can't lock up the darkness.

551
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:41,914
What did you just say?

552
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:50,289
You can't lock up the darkness.

553
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,770
No!

554
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,571
- He was right there.
- I know.

555
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,140
I mean, we had him.

556
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,483
We had him. I can't believe it.

557
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,596
- Wally?
- Up here!

558
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,499
YOUR SPEED FOR WALLY

559
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:03,500
Hey, hey, hey. Where are we?

560
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,214
Where are we?

561
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:10,080
Help! Somebody please help!

562
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:21,058
There's only one person
who can help you now.

563
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:29,526
The Flash.

564
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:31,894
The Flash? Why would he help me?

565
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:34,264
He doesn't even know who I am.

566
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:38,142
Someone he cares about...

567
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:44,182
cares about you.

568
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:51,614
Dad?

569
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:52,982
Dad.

570
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,159
Coffee?

571
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:01,558
We're gonna get him back.

572
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:04,460
What if we could stop Zoom
through a vibe somehow?

573
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,761
We could weaponize the goggles...

574
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,197
Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.

575
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:10,600
Okay, what if we modify the pulse
rifle to emit a low-level EMF?

576
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,768
We don't have the equipment
to modify the pulse rifles now.

577
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,537
Then we do another
snatch and grab mission.

578
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:16,606
By the time we scale those
cliffs, Zoom could already...

579
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,882
I need a minute!

580
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:51,841
Barry, I know you...

581
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:55,978
can't give up your speed
to that monster, but...

582
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,614
I also know that I want
to get my son back,

583
00:33:57,624 --> 00:34:00,750
and I don't know what to do.

584
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,294
I do.

585
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:09,158
Wally, he's... he's part of the family.

586
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,494
He's... he's a part of...

587
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:14,330
our family.

588
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,332
And we do whatever we have to

589
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:19,769
to keep the ones we care about safe.

590
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,437
No, you...

591
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,205
you can't give up your speed.

592
00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:25,549
That's not your decision.

593
00:34:29,855 --> 00:34:33,090
This is the only way, Joe.

594
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:43,559
- Barry, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

595
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:45,695
I mean, we don't even know
if he'll be able to hear me.

596
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:47,905
He'll hear you.

597
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,525
I see him.

598
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,597
Wally's alive.

599
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,593
Thank God.

600
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,537
Do you see Jay?

601
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:27,812
I see him.

602
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:32,274
He can sense me.

603
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:34,151
Jay?

604
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:40,115
Vibe.

605
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,326
He'll do it.

606
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:46,230
Barry will give you his speed.

607
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,304
Babe.

608
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,678
- Dad?
- Wally, hold on.

609
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,889
Let him go.

610
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:19,555
We had a deal.

611
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,466
My speed for Wally's life.

612
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,364
Hand him over, and it's yours.

613
00:36:28,374 --> 00:36:29,665
- You okay?
- Yeah.

614
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:31,433
You need to get out of here now.

615
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:32,935
- Okay.
- Go fast.

616
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:35,512
- Cisco!
- Let's go.

617
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,918
Let's get this over with.

618
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,564
This thing is how I stole

619
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:04,267
The Flash's speed the first time.

620
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:06,135
Now all he needs to do is run,

621
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:11,073
and his Speed Force will
transfer into this vial.

622
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,809
but only as long as I calibrate it.

623
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:17,046
Get to work.

624
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,923
Wells.

625
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,759
One day...

626
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:34,004
I'm gonna knock that smug
expression clean off your face.

627
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:44,206
So this was your plan all along?

628
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:47,243
Ever since the skies parted
and showed me another world...

629
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,111
with another speedster.

630
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:51,613
Once I saw you, I came here,

631
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:55,017
figured out what I had to do.

632
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:56,819
How are you still alive?

633
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:58,287
We saw you die.

634
00:37:58,297 --> 00:37:59,755
You did.

635
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:02,599
So what was that? A speed mirage?

636
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,802
Speed mirage?

637
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:10,666
No. Even I'm not that fast.

638
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:14,136
I knew that I couldn't be on
two Earths at the same time,

639
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:17,340
so I went back in time and...

640
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,375
met another version of myself.

641
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:22,445
Your time remnant.
Like the Reverse-Flash.

642
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:25,481
I also knew that the only way
to make Barry become faster

643
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:30,560
was if you all witnessed
your old pal Jay die.

644
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,456
When did you decide to do that?

645
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:36,825
Oh, once you closed all the
breaches, went to Earth-2.

646
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:38,827
Believe me, getting my time remnant

647
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:42,831
to agree to me murdering him
took a bit of convincing.

648
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:46,535
But once he saw the... well,
the genius in my plan,

649
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:49,579
he was all for it.

650
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:54,877
Who's the man in the iron mask?

651
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:57,388
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

652
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:00,849
Why the charade?

653
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,851
Running around dressed like The Flash?

654
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,953
To give people hope, Detective.

655
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,055
Hope?

656
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:09,525
So I could rip it away from them.

657
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:11,460
It's so fun

658
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,738
pretending to be a hero.

659
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:19,235
You are no hero.

660
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,478
You're nothing but a monster.

661
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,142
You're a monster.

662
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:28,352
No!

663
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,328
- Barry.
- It's all right, Joe.

664
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:20,963
He's slowing down.

665
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:24,266
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

666
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:27,377
He's becoming human again.

667
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:30,885
SPEED FORCE SAMPLE
100%

668
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:41,783
Barry, are you okay?

669
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:45,762
I'm okay. I'm okay.

670
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:11,547
- Thank you, Flash.
- Jay, stop.

671
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:13,524
Please.

672
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:19,688
If anything you ever
said to me was true,

673
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:22,191
or anything we ever shared was real,

674
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:25,327
then please just let him go. Please.

675
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:28,531
I know some piece of
you did care for me,

676
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,400
so if you have any humanity left,

677
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,943
then please, let him go.

678
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:49,426
Caitlin!
