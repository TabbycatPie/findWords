1
00:00:01,426 --> 00:00:05,272
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,318
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,604
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,908
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,210
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

6
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:21,947
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,</i>

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,716
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

8
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:27,836
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

9
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:29,164
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

10
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,887
How come you haven't given me a code name?

11
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,422
What do you think I should be called?

12
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:33,723
Golden Glider.

13
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:36,593
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

14
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,514
Why didn't you just kill me?

15
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:43,633
Well, I guess you owe me one now too.

16
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:45,235
<i>My name is Jay Garrick.</i>

17
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,854
<i>Where I came from,
I was a speedster, like you.</i>

18
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,906
When you created the
Singularity above Central City,

19
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:52,642
you also created a portal
connecting our two earths.

20
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,577
<i>I somehow ended up in your world.</i>

21
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,413
There isn't just one breach.
There's 52 of them.

22
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,915
But the most significant breach of all

23
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:03,086
appears to be here, inside S.T.A.R. labs.

24
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,596
Hey, Iris. What's up?

25
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,548
Barry, I need your help, now!

26
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,552
- Were those gunshots?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:23,806
I'm at Baldwin Tower!
I can't find a way out.

28
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,311
Window... is there window?

29
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,646
Over here!

30
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:32,181
Yeah, up ahead.

31
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,870
Okay, I'm by the window. Why?

32
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:39,372
Okay, great, you're gonna need to jump.

33
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,324
What? Are you crazy? Barry, no way.

34
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:43,493
Iris! Do you trust me?

35
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,695
Yes. I trust you.

36
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,880
Okay, then jump.

37
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,835
I can do this. I can do this.

38
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,184
- All right. You good?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:10,386
All right. Wait...
how many guys are up there?

40
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,054
Two. They both have guns.

41
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,023
Okay.

42
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:18,328
Okay, now they're taking little naps

43
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,163
till the CCPD wakes them.

44
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:22,332
So what exactly were you thinking?

45
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,083
I got a hot lead on a real estate scam.

46
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:26,285
I mean, these guys have been
illegally evicting people,

47
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:27,620
breaking up families.

48
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:29,789
Okay, look, no story is worth your life.

49
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,674
Thank you for coming!

50
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:32,959
Yeah.

51
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,511
I can't wait to write about this.

Pretty amazing, isn't it?

54
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,522
Still can't believe what I'm looking at.

55
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,275
52 breaches in Central City,
and the biggest one

56
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,427
just happens to be in our basement.

57
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:54,430
- We need a name for it.
- It's not a pet, Cisco.

58
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,149
No, it's a wormhole.

59
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,817
Professor Stein, what are you doing?

60
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,203
Your blood pressure is 147 over 82!

61
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:01,904
You could pass out again.

62
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,322
Oh, it's merely a few points

63
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,658
above the 140 average for someone my age.

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,943
Besides, I have some ideas
I would like to contribute

65
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:09,545
to this discussion, Dr. Snow.

66
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,164
And I want to hear them.

67
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,966
This isn't just a wormhole.
It's my way home.

68
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,385
Back to Earth Two.

69
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:18,554
Jay, you really think that we can use this

70
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,623
as some kind of bridge
from your world to ours?

71
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,226
Zoom uses the breaches. Why can't we?

72
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:24,644
We don't know how.

73
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,596
Everything I put through just bounces back.

74
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,648
If Zoom's using these
breaches to transport people

75
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,651
from Earth Two, maybe it takes a speedster.

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,822
- He's not gonna...
- Yeah, he is.

77
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:43,479
Maybe I'm not fast enough.

78
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,647
I don't believe your speed

79
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:46,282
is the entirety of the issue, Barry.

80
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,284
It might be the breach's stability

81
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,585
or lack thereof. He's right.

82
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,421
We need to think of the breach as a door,

83
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,923
and on Earth Two, there's another door.

84
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,374
In between, we have a hallway,

85
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:57,543
but the hallway's constantly shifting,

86
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:00,263
twisting, collapsing upon itself.

87
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:01,931
And the doors keep moving with it.

88
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,050
So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

89
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,601
And then I can jump through it.

90
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,471
Exactly, it would serve
as a kind of cannon.

91
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:09,856
A speed cannon.

92
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,608
We should hang out more.

93
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,010
All right. No more tests today.

94
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,280
All of you are leaving now, as am I.

95
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,781
Cherish the gift of youth

96
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,683
as I will go cherish my much needed nap.

97
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,286
Clarissa's already on
her way to pick me up.

98
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,528
Joseph.

99
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:36,966
You're wearing your wedding ring.

100
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:39,719
Divorced men take them off. Widowers don't.

101
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,758
I need you to leave town.

102
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,678
And you thought you could pay me

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,396
to walk away from my own daughter?

104
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:53,065
Last time, you walked away for free.

105
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:59,105
No amount of money is gonna
keep me away from Iris.

106
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,890
It has been 20 years, Francine.

107
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,725
Why did you show up now?

108
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,894
Now I'm different.

109
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:06,362
Now I'm ready.

110
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,414
No. Now you're too late.

111
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,082
Iris is fine without you.

112
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,201
You've done...

113
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,506
You've done a wonderful job, Joe.

114
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,925
Better then I ever could,

115
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:23,212
but right now, she needs her mother.

116
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,464
Losing the love of your
life isn't something

117
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,217
you can just get over in a few months.

118
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:30,052
I would know.

119
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,089
Would you?

120
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:38,561
You have 48 hours to leave Central City.

121
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:41,063
I'm not going anywhere.

122
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,044
Hey! Hey! The Flash!

123
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,379
What?

124
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,663
The drinks that they're serving today.

125
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,165
They're called "The Flash."

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,300
A brewed coffee with an
extra shot of espresso

127
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,885
to keep you running all day.

128
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:05,120
But you should maybe just,
you know, have one of those.

129
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,090
Yeah, no, my...
my friends, ordered these.

130
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,559
I didn't even realize...

131
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:12,929
Are you sticking around to celebrate?

132
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,231
I don't know, should I?

133
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,849
You know, actually, never mind, I can't.

134
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,901
I have to head into work.

135
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,653
- Okay.
- But it was great to see you.

136
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:22,071
- Yeah, good to see you.
- Okay, bye.

137
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,607
Bye, Patty.

138
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,577
- All right, four Flashes.
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,496
Be careful... apparently,
they are super-caffeinated.

140
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,815
First I have a day named after me.
Now I have a drink.

141
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,251
Well, all the things you do,
rebuilding this place,

142
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:37,036
protecting people...
everyone's appreciative, right?

143
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,422
- Mm-hmm, I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

144
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,924
Hey, you guys think
Professor Stein is okay, right?

145
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,343
I mean, Clarissa would call
if there was anything wrong.

146
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,678
- Yeah.
- All right.

147
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,762
I'm just gonna call and check in.

148
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,265
I'll be back. Uh...

149
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,633
I don't see that call going well.

150
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,101
Young lady,

151
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:54,770
these repeated intrusions are interrupting

152
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,472
what should be a speedy recov...

153
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,608
Oh, I'm so sorry.

154
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,343
Don't apologize.

155
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:04,063
You can bump into me any day, Cisco.

156
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,315
Lisa Snart.

157
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,984
You here to double-cross us again,

158
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,620
or are you and your big bro
holding up coffee shops now?

159
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,321
I need your help.

160
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:15,291
In your dreams, Sister Cold.
You know I could call The Flash.

161
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,460
He'd be here in like two
seconds... Probably one.

162
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:18,911
Call him.

163
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:24,550
Oh, okay. I'm gonna call him. Mm-hmm.

164
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,335
You really want me to call The Flash?

165
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,504
I need his help too.

166
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,892
My brother's been kidnapped.

167
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,680
All right, so you really want us

168
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:42,051
to just believe that
Captain Cold was kidnapped?

169
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,936
- I saw it happen.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,404
Last night, Lenny, me, and Mick

171
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,772
were knocking over the cashier's cage

172
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,107
at Central City Racetrack.

173
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,326
Does it physically pain your family

174
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,744
not to rob people?

175
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,829
I never finished the job.

176
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,698
After Mick torched
through the side entrance,

177
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,533
I looked back for Lenny
and saw him getting thrown

178
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:58,868
into the back of a van.

179
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,536
And why didn't you and Mick follow?

180
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:02,088
I would have.

181
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,507
Someone hit me from
behind and knocked me out.

182
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,125
When I came to, Lenny was gone,

183
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,843
and Mick already made off with the cash.

184
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,628
How do we know this isn't
some kind of a trap?

185
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,097
If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

186
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,748
he would have let Mardon,
Simmons, and Bivolo

187
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,433
take that honor, remember?

188
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,185
- Yeah, I remember.
- Good.

189
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,420
Then you'll also recall
that you owe Lenny a favor

190
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,889
for saving your life.

191
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,591
Time to make good on that debt, Flash.

192
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:24,426
I do not like her.

193
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,697
Yeah, but she makes a point.

194
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,649
What? We should at least hear her out.

195
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,401
Right?

196
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,269
Even if I wanted to help,
how are we supposed to find him?

197
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:35,454
Not a problem.

198
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,106
See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

199
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn't have time to
place a tracker on it,

200
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,825
so I devised a method of locating it

201
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,211
by borrowing some military technology.

202
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,796
See, the gun works the
same as thermal imaging,

203
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,498
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

204
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,250
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

205
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:49,885
Whoa, look at that.

206
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,338
The gun's UV thermal
reading was last picked up

207
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,523
at 5th and Hoyt eight minutes ago.

208
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,093
All right. Let's see if you're a liar.

209
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,071
Snart.

210
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,740
Barry.

211
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,775
Are you okay?

212
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,410
Peachy.

213
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,911
Okay.

214
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:19,031
I'm supposed to be here to rescue you.

215
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,616
That's not necessary.

216
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,318
You can speed along now.

217
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,588
Look, Snart, if these guys
are making you do this...

218
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,322
No one makes me do anything.

219
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,542
Then why does your sister
think you've been kidnapped?

220
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,766
What's taking so long?

221
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,050
I got held up.

222
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,336
Always the excuse with you.

223
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,306
Look at that.

224
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,108
I didn't think you had it in you, son.

225
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,943
Thanks, Dad.

226
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,448
Come on.

227
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,899
We're behind schedule.

228
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:58,520
You know what they say.
"Live fast, die young."

229
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,457
<i>Talk to me. What's going on?</i>

230
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,076
Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun.

231
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,411
His vitals are bottoming out!

232
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,298
I'm bringing the heat right now.

233
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,386
What?

234
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:16,672
The suit. What's happening?

235
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,207
Therma-threading, baby.

236
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,425
It's a little something I added

237
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,727
for situations exactly like this one.

238
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,569
Please, please tell me it's working.

239
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,824
Yeah, it works, but Snart's gone,

240
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:37,827
and Lisa has a lot of explaining to do.

241
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,737
So your brother was not kidnapped.

242
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:47,640
He was pulling a job with your father.

243
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:51,327
What? No, Lenny would never do that.

244
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,146
Oh, just like he would never

245
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,014
try and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

246
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,651
Are you sure it was my dad?

247
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,487
- That's him.
- Lewis Snart.

248
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,873
Convicted of larceny, armed robbery,

249
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,376
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.

250
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,962
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

251
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,680
He's a bad guy.

252
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:13,850
You and your entire family are criminals.

253
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:16,603
Why should we trust anything you say?

254
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,511
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.

255
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:27,697
I got it being a daughter.

256
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,540
Let me go. I got this.

257
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,131
I see you found my hiding spot.

258
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,133
This is usually where I come

259
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:51,004
to, you know, get away.

260
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,876
First time my father came after me,

261
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:59,178
I was seven.

262
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,049
Second time, I was eight.

263
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,518
That's when I learned
that a bottle hurts worse

264
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,820
than a fist.

265
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,559
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

266
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,280
I must have been a slow learner,

267
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:21,034
because the lessons never stopped.

268
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:32,428
I'm sorry, Lisa.

269
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,682
Lenny practically raised me.

270
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:36,933
If it weren't for him,

271
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,936
I would have turned out a lot worse.

272
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:42,922
I know, how could I be any worse?

273
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,891
I didn't say that.

274
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:48,094
You didn't have to.

275
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:51,114
But believe me, there is worse.

276
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:54,117
And, look, he may be a jerk brother,

277
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,536
but he's the only jerk brother I've got.

278
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,941
He protected me.

279
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,961
Now it's my turn.

280
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,829
If he's with my dad,

281
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,583
he is in serious trouble.

282
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:12,919
Please.

283
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,287
You've gotta find out what's going on.

284
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:29,068
Hey, baby.

285
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,486
Dad!

286
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,654
What are you doing here?

287
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,855
Came to check in

288
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,640
on my favorite crime-fighting reporter.

289
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:35,658
Dad!

290
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,196
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

291
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,664
Hey, Iris.

292
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,149
Editorial needs your photos and story ASAP.

293
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,700
Congratulations, Detective.

294
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:48,538
Your daughter's exposé
just made the front page.

295
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,757
What?

296
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,375
I am so happy for you.

297
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,544
A little bit jealous, but I'll get over it.

298
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,328
Thanks, Linda. I got lucky.

299
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,047
No, she's being modest.

300
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,966
Your daughter's a serious badass.

301
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,051
You don't have to tell me.

302
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,353
Well, better let you get back to work.

303
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:05,638
Wait, there was something that you wanted

304
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,889
to talk to me about, right?

305
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,142
Later, it can wait. Go be fabulous.

306
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,110
Okay.

307
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:24,123
Back from the dead so soon, Barry?

308
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,375
Pass me the salt.

309
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,880
Don't spill. It's bad luck.

310
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,886
Why are you working with Lewis?

311
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:39,205
Lisa told us you hate him.

312
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:43,042
Things are...

313
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:45,561
complicated with family,

314
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,214
as you know with your own parents, hmm?

315
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,683
Tell me what's going on.

316
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,268
Let me help you.

317
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,603
Don't waste your time trying to save people

318
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,271
who don't want to be saved.

319
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,024
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just about you, all right?

320
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,826
I'm betting whatever you two are up to,

321
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,277
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

322
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,829
Don't worry, I remember our deal.

323
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:06,833
You leave me alone, I
make sure no one dies.

324
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,584
All right.

325
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:11,403
You're a criminal, Snart,

326
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,872
but you live by a code.

327
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,406
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't,

328
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:18,544
like he won't care if people die.

329
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:22,682
That's why I can't leave this alone.

330
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:26,418
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

331
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,754
I don't care.

332
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:32,058
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

333
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,530
We'll see about that.

334
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,901
Thanks for dinner.

335
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,499
Iris' mom is alive.

336
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:59,451
I lied to Iris, you, everybody.

337
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,421
Why?

338
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,056
I felt like I didn't have a choice.

339
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:08,010
Francine did so many things wrong.

340
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,430
Just about everything.

341
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:12,932
I don't know.

342
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:16,769
Now I feel like my one
wrong might be worse.

343
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,474
Look, Joe.

344
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:25,978
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

345
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,115
and I know that you
always have a good reason

346
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,366
for the decisions you make.

347
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,818
And obviously, you were worried

348
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,503
that Iris would go down the wrong path

349
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,122
if Francine raised her.

350
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:37,623
Look at Snart.

351
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,992
He's a criminal because
he had Lewis for a father.

352
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:40,960
That could have been me.

353
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,428
Oh, come on. Never.

354
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,097
Yeah, because I had you.

355
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,665
And so did Iris.

356
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,604
You just gotta trust in
that and tell her the truth.

357
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,639
Yeah, how do I do that without hurting her?

358
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,891
She's not a little girl anymore.

359
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,177
You should have seen her
in action the other day,

360
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,646
putting her neck on the line for a story.

361
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,481
She can handle anything that comes her way.

362
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,317
I just lied to her for so long,

363
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,286
I'm scared she's not gonna
understand or forgive me.

364
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:08,955
I could lose her.

365
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:12,491
No, she's gonna forgive you.

366
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:15,711
You just gotta give her a chance.

367
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,752
We make our move at 9:00.

368
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:24,637
That's when the cleaning crews go in

369
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,305
and the daytime shift leaves.

370
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,540
Now we'll go up in the service elevator

371
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,376
to the 27th floor.

372
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,011
They got a two-man team of armed guards

373
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,680
working the 27th through 29th floor,

374
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,548
but if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

375
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,317
we should be able to get in and out.

376
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,935
And if the timing doesn't work out?

377
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,487
Then those guards don't make it home.

378
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:42,989
But if we start on the top floor,

379
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,390
there's a service elevator that will...

380
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:45,992
Son, you and I both know

381
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:48,744
that there's casualties
in this line of work.

382
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:54,166
Rutenberg, you're the tech guy.

383
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,369
Did you find a solution
for the vault hallway?

384
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,070
Not yet.

385
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,992
That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

386
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,909
Fine. How about you?

387
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:07,079
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

388
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:08,464
gonna look after the power source

389
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:09,882
for the laser grid?

390
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,218
It's a cold gun, and yes,

391
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,020
but I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

392
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,472
That gun is the only reason you're here,

393
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,641
so shut up before I make you...

394
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,428
Ow, my... my head.

395
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,864
Oh! My head! Aah!

396
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,700
Feels like it's gonna...

397
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,461
Nobody talks to my son that way.

398
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,879
Nobody.

399
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:51,250
Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

400
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,135
Okay, I may have done a
quick preliminary assessment

401
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:54,470
of my own.

402
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:56,138
Something is definitely weird.

403
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:00,926
- Oh.
- Decapitation.

404
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,678
- Yeah.
- Yikes.

405
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,313
We're still recovering parts
of the head, so the ID

406
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,714
is taking a little longer than normal.

407
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,182
Aah!

408
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,435
Sorry, I thought I stepped on an ear.

409
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,887
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

410
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,073
Oh, hell no.

411
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,824
Doesn't look like the head was sliced off

412
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:17,276
with any weapon I'm familiar with,

413
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:18,861
and I'm familiar with most weapons.

414
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,362
Yeah, you're right.

415
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:22,531
Perforation around the
neck... it's too jagged.

416
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,283
It's almost like the head was blown off.

417
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,786
Like a meta-human who
can explode heads, right?

418
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,705
Not necessarily.

419
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:35,594
Traces of thermite.

420
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,245
- Bomb residue?
- Uh-huh.

421
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,014
But then why wasn't the rest
of the body blown apart?

422
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:41,760
- I don't know.
- The victim is David Rutenberg,

423
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,479
security systems expert,
and guess who's on his list

424
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,197
- of known associates.
- Hmm?

425
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,949
- Lewis Snart.
- Lewis Snart.

426
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:51,568
Isn't he related to Leonard
Snart, aka Captain Cold?

427
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,537
- Please don't call him that.
- Okay.

428
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,238
- One second.
- Sure.

429
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,607
Come here. I think this guy
is part of Snart's crew.

430
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,110
So Snart put a bomb in
him to keep him in line?

431
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:04,280
No, Snart wouldn't do that,
but his father would.

432
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,782
So Lewis is killing people,

433
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,000
and Snart's still working with him?

434
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:08,335
What happened with the deal you had?

435
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,003
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

436
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,923
So you think Lewis put
a bomb in his own son

437
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,424
to force him to pull off a heist?

438
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:16,126
Snart still wouldn't do it.

439
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:17,761
He'd dig the bomb out of
his own head if he had to.

440
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,296
So it must be something
else that Snart cares about.

441
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:25,235
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

442
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,410
Thought you might be hungry.

443
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,445
Ah, good to know whatever Earth you go to,

444
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,647
there's always a Big Belly Burger.

445
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,082
Thank you very much.

446
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,750
Looks like you're making progress.

447
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:44,287
Slowly.
Should be able to do this a lot faster.

448
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,922
You miss it, your speed?

449
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,925
Yeah. Surprising how much.

450
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,711
So what will you do when
you go back to your Earth?

451
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,296
I don't know.

452
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:56,433
Guess I'll just have to
get used to being...

453
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,768
Normal?

454
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,854
Yeah.

455
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,442
Two years ago, I was just a scientist

456
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,677
slowly trying to save the
world by purifying heavy water

457
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,446
without residual radiation.

458
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,647
Important work.

459
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,066
Yeah, it was,

460
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,035
but after the Particle
Accelerator exploded,

461
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:17,204
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life,

462
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:18,622
I could save one before breakfast.

463
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:21,124
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

464
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,577
There's nothing like that rush.

465
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,546
You guys have been fighting so
many battles, one after another,

466
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:29,966
I'm not sure Barry's had
time to take it in,

467
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:33,203
to appreciate how great it can feel.

468
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:37,474
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

469
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:40,010
It's about helping however you can,

470
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:42,929
wherever you're needed most.

471
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:46,850
I think that Jay Garrick,
physicist, has just as much

472
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,736
to contribute as Jay Garrick, superhero.

473
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,387
Maybe more.

474
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:57,661
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

475
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:00,413
- Hmm?
- An extra set of hands.

476
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:03,566
Specifically ones with
a surgeon's precision.

477
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,568
Me?

478
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,403
Sure, if you think I can really help.

479
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:08,738
<i>Hey, Caitlin?</i>

480
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,341
We need you up here, like, right now.

481
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,260
Sorry.

482
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,885
Oh, boy.

483
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,887
What is it?

484
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,357
Lisa,
there are traces of thermite on your skin.

485
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,392
Thermite?

486
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:30,727
Like an explosive?

487
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,979
Not <i>like</i> an explosive.

488
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,449
It's a bomb.

489
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,451
When you were knocked out,

490
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,705
your dad must have injected you with it.

491
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,748
Hey, Dad, what's up?

492
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,552
Your message was pretty
cryptic, even for you.

493
00:22:58,723 --> 00:23:02,458
Hey, baby, I need you to sit down.

494
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:07,264
Dad, what's going on?

495
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,602
Okay.

496
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,856
When I was still a beat cop,

497
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,409
me and my partner were on patrol,

498
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,662
and dispatch came on the radio.

499
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:25,031
A little girl had called in.

500
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:29,252
She said her mom had taken some pills

501
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,671
and she wouldn't wake up.

502
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:35,258
And the little girl gave the address.

503
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,660
The address was mine.

504
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:43,600
By the time I got here,
your mother was unresponsive.

505
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,835
Passed out on the couch.

506
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:49,723
And in the kitchen, the stove was on.

507
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:51,608
There you were, standing in front

508
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,443
of an open flame.

509
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:54,944
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

510
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:59,115
- Wait, my mom...
- Your mom was a drug addict.

511
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:01,684
This wasn't the first time

512
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,871
something like that had happened.

513
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,524
I got Francine into another rehab,

514
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:11,861
and a couple days later,

515
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:14,464
she was gone.

516
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:18,918
I looked everywhere for her,
but wife of a cop,

517
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,137
she knew how to disappear.

518
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,089
I couldn't stand...

519
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:26,393
the thought of you growing up

520
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,877
thinking you were abandoned.

521
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,596
Going to sleep at night thinking

522
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,098
your mother left because you weren't enough

523
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,850
to make her stay, that you weren't loved,

524
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,569
because I loved you.

525
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:41,858
I loved you with everything I got.

526
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,411
Then we took Barry in,

527
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,696
and I saw the trauma he
was going through and I...

528
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,331
I was sure.

529
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,867
I was sure...

530
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,036
that I did the right thing.

531
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,587
Not giving you that burden.

532
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,006
What do you mean "Mom left"?

533
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,242
I...

534
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,677
I don't... I don't understand.

535
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,213
I don't understand. What
are you telling me?

536
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:06,883
Your mother's alive.

537
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,585
She's here in Central City.

538
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,604
She wants to see you.

539
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:18,278
All these years, I thought...

540
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,098
Daddy, you told me that my...

541
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,268
I know.

542
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,769
I should have told you sooner,

543
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:30,490
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

544
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,710
The mother you thought you remember...

545
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,112
the perfect mother and the
stories I made up for you...

546
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,748
that is the mother you deserve,
and I knew Francine

547
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,967
couldn't be like that.

548
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,752
She would only break your heart.

549
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,308
I'm so sorry.

550
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,936
Dad...

551
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:03,406
It's okay. I understand.

552
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,442
You were just trying to keep me safe.

553
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,681
The micro-bomb casing must be made

554
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:19,433
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

555
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,152
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,

556
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,853
I can surgically excise it.

557
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:24,438
Put the magnet down!

558
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,140
This is a really concentrated bomb.

559
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:27,725
It's gonna combust if it's exposed

560
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:30,278
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

561
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:33,648
What's he talking about?

562
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,366
Air.

563
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:38,636
The bomb will explode if
it comes in contact with air.

564
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,037
Don't worry, Lisa.

565
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,505
We're gonna find another way to get it out.

566
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:43,958
Scientific minds. Can we confer, please.

567
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,410
What if Flash speed extracts it?

568
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:47,745
Nope, it's too risky.

569
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:50,257
I'm gonna find a way to get it out.
I just need a little time.

570
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,376
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

571
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,344
until you figure out how
to disarm the bomb.

572
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,381
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next and when.

573
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,633
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

574
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,885
Their tech guy is dead,
so I'm betting they're

575
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,104
gonna need a new one.

576
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:05,889
I'm saying I'm gonna
infiltrate Lewis' crew.

577
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,609
You're gonna pretend to be a criminal?

578
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:10,010
How hard can it be?

579
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,118
These visits are getting old.

580
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,706
Third time's a charm.

581
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:26,710
I told you, I don't need saving.

582
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,529
But your sister does.

583
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:33,199
I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa.

584
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,635
Lewis told you he'd kill her

585
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:36,202
if you didn't help him, right?

586
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,871
Look don't worry.

587
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,973
My team's working on a
way to remove the bomb.

588
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,476
I hope you got that gun
of yours ready to blast

589
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:46,212
'cause...

590
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,931
Who the hell's this?

591
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,384
Lenny said you needed new tech.

592
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:54,554
What's up, I'm Sam, so...

593
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:59,076
Heh!

594
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,661
You tellin' me you think this kid

595
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,896
can crack a Draycon keypad?

596
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:06,033
I did help Snart steal
the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

597
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,784
from Central City Museum last year.

598
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,836
That was locked up behind
an AmerTek Industries

599
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:13,340
Phase Three Suppression Door
with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

600
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,175
So...

601
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:18,578
Couldn't have done it without him.

602
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,080
Draycon's my jam.

603
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:31,024
Okay, Sam. Let's go.

604
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,276
Right now?

605
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,111
You got a problem with that?

606
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,863
No, all good. Can't wait.

607
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,371
Oh, this should be fun.

608
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,993
Keep quiet and follow my lead.

609
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,995
Just like old times.

610
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,047
You watching the Diamonds' game?

611
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:56,466
Yeah, the Salamanders are killing 'em.

612
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,052
IDs.

613
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:00,286
What floor are you going to?

614
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,722
27th.

615
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,565
Hey, what's the hold up, guys?

616
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,233
I mean, you wanna call management

617
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:16,687
and explain why the toilets
are still overflowing?

618
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,155
We're all on the clock, right?

619
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,190
Yeah, you guys are good to go.

620
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,992
Thanks.

621
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:24,828
You enjoy the game, guys.

622
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,697
Diamonds don't stand a chance.

623
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,281
Not tonight they don't.

624
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,756
Hold on. Did you hear that?

625
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,758
I got it.

626
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,679
It's two armed guards.

627
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,381
Guess your timing didn't
work out after all.

628
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,266
Yeah, that's why I got a Plan B.

629
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:48,518
'Cause you always needed one.

630
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,854
Yeah, but...

631
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,505
your sister turned out

632
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:54,841
to be a disappointment also.

633
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:59,279
All right, what do you guys
say we get on with the job?

634
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,315
Guards are gone. Must have taken a break.

635
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:05,518
Yeah, must have.

636
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,741
Okay, Sam.

637
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:12,743
Show us what you got.

638
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,995
Yeah, all right. Gonna just...

639
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:20,467
You guys just keep a lookout and I'll...

640
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,483
Boom!

641
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,652
Told you Draycon was my jam.

642
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,721
- Nice job, Sam.
- Yeah.

643
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:43,690
It's good to go out on a high note.

644
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:53,583
I'm sorry, Barry.

645
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,603
What are you gonna do
to me with that thing?

646
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:21,657
Operating pressure on
this is over 1,000 PSI.

647
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,091
This will easily suck the micro-bomb

648
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:25,427
out of her neck and into the barrel of this

649
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:28,313
with one high-powered shot.

650
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:30,699
There is one slight risk.

651
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,868
Besides shooting a high-powered weapon

652
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,786
directly against my neck?

653
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:38,606
The gun does use compressed air.

654
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:44,413
I trust you, Cisco.

655
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,805
Okay, son. Make me proud.

656
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,091
Like I care.

657
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:06,601
Ha, now what?

658
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,663
I told you, I had a better way

659
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,749
past the lasers.

660
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:24,286
Step aside. Time for another lesson.

661
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:30,008
You've got 125 seconds
before the system defrosts.

662
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,210
- Then what?
- Sirens.

663
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,228
How do you feel?

664
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,679
Like we should have put down some plastic.

665
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:54,783
It's not funny.

666
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,185
Yeah...

667
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,787
but I like it when you smile.

668
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,525
Okay, ready?

669
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,329
Shoot me, Cisco.

670
00:33:13,504 --> 00:33:15,220
It's... d... Flash!

671
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:16,838
Cisco, how's it going with Lisa?

672
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,890
Kind of in the middle
of it right now, buddy!

673
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,892
All right, we need that bomb out.

674
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:23,044
The heist is going down right now.

675
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:29,717
Time's up.

676
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,487
Let's get out of here.

677
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:36,107
Only place you're going is
back to Iron Heights, Lewis.

678
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,694
- Ah, you wanna bet?
- Do I wanna bet?

679
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,229
Do not bet! Give me a minute.

680
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:42,614
Tell me this, what kind of man

681
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:44,115
puts a bomb in his own daughter?

682
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:46,535
A very rich man.

683
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:50,505
Shoot him, son.

684
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,352
Kill him or you'll never
see your sister alive.

685
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:09,774
Do it, Cisco.

686
00:34:16,816 --> 00:34:18,266
I got the bomb out!

687
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,934
Lisa's safe.

688
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,824
Aah!

689
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:31,129
You're working with The Flash?

690
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,114
I thought you hated him?

691
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,550
Not as much as I...

692
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:37,669
hate you.

693
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:52,100
Lisa was safe.

694
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:54,352
Why did you do that?

695
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,304
He broke my sister's heart.

696
00:34:57,406 --> 00:35:00,308
Only fair I break his.

697
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:10,165
Last time I was in Iron Heights,

698
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,178
- I was visiting my Dad.
- Yeah, me too.

699
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,247
- And yet you killed him.
- He deserved it.

700
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:20,418
- Is that funny to you?
- No.

701
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:23,355
What's funny is I finally
figured out your secret.

702
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,473
And what secret would that be?

703
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:28,660
You'd do anything to protect your sister.

704
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,480
Well, I know your secret too.

705
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,833
Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.

706
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:36,318
You won't.

707
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,540
Today just proved what I've always known.

708
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,625
There's good in you, Snart.

709
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,713
And you don't have to admit it to me,

710
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:49,664
but there's a part of you that knows

711
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,667
you don't have to let your past define you.

712
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:54,553
A part of you that really wants

713
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:57,139
to be more than just a criminal.

714
00:35:57,141 --> 00:36:00,609
So I should be a hero like you, Barry?

715
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:03,695
What exactly does that pay again?

716
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,731
It's just a matter of time.

717
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,450
Something you'll have a lot of in here.

718
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:11,186
Not as much as you think.

719
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:14,022
Be seeing you.

720
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,500
You really think that leopard's

721
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:27,535
gonna change its spots?

722
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:29,888
I do.

723
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,540
Maybe we should transfer him
to the meta-human wing anyway.

724
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,876
I already got Patty on the paperwork.

725
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:39,548
Hey, I wanted to thank you

726
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,050
for the advice you gave.

727
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:43,935
I told Iris.

728
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:46,054
She's gonna sit down with Francine.

729
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:48,890
It was hard, but it was for the best.

730
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:51,226
I'm glad. Any time.

731
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:53,495
- You're a good son, Barry.
- I know.

732
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:59,918
Thank you.

733
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,840
Fancy seeing you here.

734
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:06,908
We have to stop running
into each other like this.

735
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,294
I know, we should just make
a schedule or something.

736
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,745
Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have,

737
00:37:10,747 --> 00:37:12,464
you know, my people call your people.

738
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,249
See, that's the problem.
Neither one of us have people.

739
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,934
So how are we possibly gonna do this?

740
00:37:20,857 --> 00:37:23,608
- There. My number.
- Oh!

741
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,862
That's what you meant, right?

742
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:29,531
Yes, it...

743
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,066
- No.
- Yea... I...

744
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,401
No you didn't.

745
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:34,319
You know what, though?

746
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,937
I've actually been meaning
to give you my number

747
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,956
in case you had questions about a case.

748
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,708
You know, sometimes when
you call through dispatch,

749
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,076
- it gets all jammed up...
- Mm-hmm.

750
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:42,327
And this is efficient.

751
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,962
And as law enforcement colleagues,

752
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,248
- efficiently is important.
- Yes, it is.

753
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,834
No, that's a... yeah...
That's exactly what I was thinking too.

754
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,002
'Kay, great. Awesome.

755
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,387
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'll see you.

756
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:53,722
Yeah. Oh!

757
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:55,057
Ope! Just kidding.

758
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:56,892
Okay. Thanks.

759
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:58,093
Yep.

760
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:03,648
So, taking off?

761
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,768
Thought I'd say good-bye and thank you.

762
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,304
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.

763
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:12,858
- Not even you.
- It's more than that.

764
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,827
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

765
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,812
I hate feeling weak.

766
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:20,115
It's hard for me to trust people.

767
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:22,150
I trusted you.

768
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:27,339
You know, you might
actually be my first real friend.

769
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:31,259
Is any of that true?

770
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:49,111
Till next time, Cisco.

771
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:50,395
Later, Golden Glider.

772
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,000
Ta-da! The speed cannon.

773
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:16,371
Wow! Look at that.

774
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,090
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

775
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,927
Mr. Garrick, I am quite impressed

776
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,211
by what you've accomplished during

777
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:24,729
my recent wellness hiatus.

778
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:26,681
- Have you tested it out yet?
- Not yet.

779
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:27,983
You wanna do the honors?

780
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,269
No, no, no, no. Now that I...

781
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:33,104
now that I am back to optimum health,

782
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:35,824
Please allow me.

783
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:40,445
Excelsior!

784
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:43,365
- How did you stabilize it?
- CFL Quark Matter.

785
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,617
Ah, negative energy density

786
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,836
with positive surface pressure.
It's genius.

787
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,505
You created CFL Quark Matter?

788
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:51,739
It's something we perfected on my Earth.

789
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:53,074
I'll show you sometime.

790
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:55,760
You mean, sometime in the next few minutes?

791
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,683
Oh, yeah I guess this is it, huh?

792
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:06,137
- Time for me to go back home.
- Right now?

793
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,590
I mean we still need your
help with the Breachers.

794
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:10,892
My first priority is Zoom.

795
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:12,594
I need to find out what he's up to.

796
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:14,029
How he stole my speed.

797
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:16,481
But you can do that here and, you know,

798
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,984
if you go back, then we can't get in touch

799
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,703
with you when we need your help or...

800
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:25,874
with Zoom or whatever else.

801
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:27,826
It would be nice to be
able to pick your brain

802
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,778
every once in a while,
get some more speedster tips.

803
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:38,803
Okay... Once we take care of Zoom,

804
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,923
- I'm going home.
- That's fair.

805
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:44,959
Good, 'cause I could use a shower, a shave,

806
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:47,395
and some sunlight.

807
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:51,349
I'll, see you later.

808
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:54,269
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

809
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,137
Well, it appears

810
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:58,907
that a little rest heals all maladies.

811
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:00,574
I... I couldn't feel...

812
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,529
- Professor?
- No, no, no, no get back.

813
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,914
Come here.

814
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,093
Professor Stein! Professor Stein!

815
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:19,544
Can you hear me, Professor Stein?

816
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,212
What happened to him?
He went up like Firestorm,

817
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:22,214
but the flame, why was it blue?

818
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,791
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.

819
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:31,815
