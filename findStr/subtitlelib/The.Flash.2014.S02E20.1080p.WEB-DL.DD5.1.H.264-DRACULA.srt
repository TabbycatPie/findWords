1
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:02,500
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,570
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,656
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:11,526
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:15,196
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,248
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,752
but, in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,005
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,708
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,459
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,545
- He's your brother, Cisco.
- Not by choice.

12
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,797
So Mom tells me you're
still working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,716
We couldn't do what we do without Cisco.

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,267
Oh, he's loyal. Just like a dog.

15
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,102
We had a deal.

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,438
My speed for Wally's life.
Hand him over, and it's yours.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,390
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

18
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,858
He's becoming human again.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,226
Aah!

20
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:47,896
I know some piece of you did care for me.

21
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:51,232
Please, let him go.

22
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:52,984
- Caitlin!
- You are gonna get

23
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,403
your speed back, Allen,
and I'm gonna help you do that.

24
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,955
- How?
- By creating another

25
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,207
particle accelerator explosion.

26
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,745
[dramatic music]

27
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:06,581
[sirens wailing]

28
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,228
Barry, there's a high-speed chase

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,481
heading south on Milton Ave.

30
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:19,351
[tires screeching]

31
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:20,569
We lost 'em.

32
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:22,104
[laughing]

33
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,605
Not gonna lose him, though.

34
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,607
You wanna bet?

35
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:28,660
[engine revs]

36
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:32,164
Oh! Oh! You wanna play?

37
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,449
Okay! All right.

38
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,285
Get ready to bring it!

39
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:39,371
- They're not slowing down.
- Of course not!

40
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:42,841
[tires screeching]

41
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:45,260
There's our out... the tunnel!
Take the tunnel!

42
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:47,963
They're headed for the Fifth Street tunnel.

43
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:49,465
Satellite can't project in there.

44
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,300
What? You just thought of this now?

45
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:53,218
I didn't think he'd actually
try to outrun The Flash!

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,554
Lightning. Lightning toss!

47
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,189
He wants to do the lightning toss.

48
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,607
Nope. No lightning. It's a hologram.

49
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,642
- Remember?
- Just...[grunts]

50
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:02,644
No. No, no. The wind-up!

51
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:04,446
So we can block their field of vision.

52
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:05,647
Yes! Of course.

53
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,319
All right, Cisco.

54
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,204
This is where all
those countless hours gaming

55
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:14,623
in your basement are about to pay off.

56
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,326
Fingers, don't fail me now.

57
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:19,294
Leerooooy...!

58
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:24,049
- Ah, my eyes!
- What is this?

59
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,968
[tires screeching]

60
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,925
Hands in the air!

63
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,768
I need a breather.

64
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,019
I didn't think this hologram thing

65
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,605
was gonna work, but so far, so good.

66
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,907
[laughs] I mean,
I figured if they could get 2Pac

67
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,742
rapping again at a concert,
we could definitely get

68
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,194
The Flash running around Central City.

69
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,079
- It's not gonna last.
- There it is.

70
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,281
It's not gonna be long
before someone figures out,

71
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:58,200
"Oh, wait. You never say anything.

72
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,452
You never touch anything.
Oh, wait. You never go indoors"

73
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,204
Okay, well, without Barry's speed,

74
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,541
- this is as good an idea as any.
- Actually, I beg to differ.

75
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,593
I think a better idea, instead of playing

76
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,044
"Hoodlums and Holograms"

77
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,380
would be to rebuild the particle accelerator

78
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:13,432
- to get Barry's speed back.
- Yeah, Wells,

79
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,384
- that's what you keep saying.
- That's right.

80
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,886
Look at what that explosion
did to this city.

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,888
Not to mention, last time
we tried something like that,

82
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,191
we blew a hole in the universe
and created, like,

83
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,559
50 portals to your Earth.

84
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,277
Which is exactly how Zoom and his henchmen

85
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,197
- got here in the first place.
- I told you.

86
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,948
I know how to contain the explosion.

87
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,284
- Really?
- Yes.

88
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,570
You know how to contain
a dark matter explosion

89
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,823
that, last time, just radiated
all of Central City?

90
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,209
You tried this on your Earth, remember?

91
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,743
Didn't go so well.

92
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,328
And, even if you could contain it,

93
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,580
I thought you said that Barry couldn't tap

94
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,248
into the Speed Force anymore.

95
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
It wasn't connected the first
time he got his powers.

96
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:50,252
Look, I have your Wells's data.

97
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:52,421
The Harrison Wells from this
Earth, I have his science.

98
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:54,923
I know what chemicals
need to be in your body.

99
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,226
I know how the lightning needs
to bond with the dark matter

100
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,977
from the particle accelerator explosion.

101
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,564
I can recreate the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

102
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,932
This will work.

103
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:07,653
Your subterfuge... is not gonna last.

104
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:11,607
But more importantly...
it's not gonna save Snow.

105
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,993
[pensive music]

106
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:17,112
It's not gonna bring your Caitlin back.

107
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:19,197
You wanna be ready should Zoom return...

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,585
if Zoom returns... when Zoom returns...

109
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,454
there is only one way to do it,

110
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:28,040
and that's by getting your speed back.

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,477
Hey.

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,145
- Hey.
- How are you?

113
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,531
- You made it.
- Yeah.

114
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,483
- Look at this.
- Come inside. Get warm.

115
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,785
Yeah. Wow.

116
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:02,791
- Sure is a pretty drive up here.
- It is that.

117
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:10,666
I can't help but wonder why
a speedster needs a car.

118
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:15,304
Because I am no longer a speedster.

119
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,172
You've lost your powers?

120
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:21,343
I gave them up to save Wally, Joe's son.

121
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:25,647
Zoom had him, so it was either
give him my speed, or...

122
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:30,185
I couldn't let Wally die.

123
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:34,439
No. You couldn't.

124
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,327
Now Jay has taken Caitlin, and
we have no idea how to save her.

125
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,995
Jay took Caitlin?

126
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:42,247
Jay. It's... yeah.

127
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:47,869
Turns out Jay Garrick is not
the Flash from Earth-2.

128
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,204
He's Zoom.

129
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,256
Garrick?

130
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:53,842
Garrick, yeah. Why?

131
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,210
My mom's maiden name.

132
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:00,432
Maybe... maybe Wells is right.

133
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:03,385
Maybe I should try to get my powers back.

134
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,220
How would you do that?

135
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,889
By recreating the
particle accelerator explosion.

136
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,941
And getting struck by lightning again?

137
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:14,863
That doesn't seem like
the safest option, does it?

138
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:17,733
No.

139
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:23,238
I've watched you grow
ever since you became The Flash,

140
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,043
and I am so proud of that man.

141
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,630
But ask yourself,

142
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,299
do you really need powers

143
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,752
in order to be that person?

144
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,474
It just feels like every time something good

145
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:45,927
happens in my life, it's taken away.

146
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:51,767
Well, maybe it's time
we did something about that.

147
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:59,408
It looks like the Vacuum.

148
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,576
Uh, what's the Vacuum?

149
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:04,579
- No "Fringe" on Earth-2. Noted.

150
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,248
What is that thing?

151
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,451
That is how Barry's gonna
get his speed back.

152
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,037
This is what you've been
working on in the workshop?

153
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,955
Someone has to worry about Zoom.

154
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:17,459
- Okay. Barry cannot do this.
- He has to, Ramon.

155
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,960
You keep calling me that, but that's...

156
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:21,880
[dramatic music]

157
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:26,718
Dante?

158
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:32,107
What did you see? Zoom? Did you see Zoom?

159
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,192
No.

160
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:37,896
I saw my brother.

161
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:41,233
I got to go.

162
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:42,901
See where everybody is.

163
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,402
Hey.

164
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:45,570
Henry?

165
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,539
Iris. Hi.

166
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,241
It's so good to see you.

167
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,460
Aw, you too.

168
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:54,229
I guess Barry
dragged you back for a bit, huh?

169
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,215
Looks like maybe for good.

170
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,050
Wait, what? Seriously?

171
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:03,338
Yeah, yeah, I figured I spent
enough time away from my son.

172
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,006
Have you told Dad?

173
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:07,726
No, I wanted to tell him in person.

174
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,427
Yeah. I think he's with Wally at CCPD.

175
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,730
I'll give him a call.

176
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:14,349
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. Let's get settled.

177
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:17,269
[pensive music]

178
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,244
Your sister called,
checking in when we'd be home.

179
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,413
- As in, we need to get going?
- Thanks.

180
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,531
You know your sister.

181
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,750
Okay, move it. Let's go.

182
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,120
Do you ever get sick of this job?

183
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,454
Being a cop?

184
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:40,425
Oh, looks like someone inherited the West

185
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,928
I-need-to-help-people gene.

186
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,381
Ever since The Flash saved me, I just...

187
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:48,049
I don't know if designing cars

188
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,303
is what I'm meant to do with my life.

189
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:54,689
Well, I'm sure there's something out there

190
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,474
that'll satisfy your need for speed

191
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:59,027
and helping people, but, until then,

192
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,730
you should stick with engineering.

193
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,398
It's much safer.

194
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,233
We should get going before Singh comes up

195
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:07,152
with something for me to do.

196
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,572
Zoom!

197
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,874
Hello, old friend.

198
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,242
Stay away from him.

199
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:16,044
Do not move.

200
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,462
Or what?

201
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:21,132
You've tried your guns on me once before.

202
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,584
[dramatic music]

203
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,253
No! Don't hurt them.

204
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,590
Let them go, please.

205
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:40,151
Tell everyone that this city is mine.

206
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,688
Anyone who disobeys me

207
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,942
will meet their end.

208
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:53,114
All right. Clear out!

209
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:14,082
- Caitlin's with Zoom.
- Why would he bring her here?

210
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,450
To show power.

211
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,069
That's exactly what he did on my Earth.

212
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:20,571
- What are you talking about?
- The first thing he did

213
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:21,789
was murder people.

214
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,408
Slaughtered a bunch of policemen.

215
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:26,163
Then recruited every
meta-human he could find.

216
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,833
And those that disobeyed, he killed too.

217
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:31,719
- Where are the police now?
- Outside the precinct.

218
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,505
He'll kill them, Joe. He'll kill them all.

219
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,257
Not with Caitlin with him.

220
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,559
She talked him out of killing
everyone when he took over CCPD.

221
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,593
That's what we're gonna rely on?

222
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,011
Snow talking him out of it?

223
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,897
Joe, you need to get
those guys out of there.

224
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,899
What if they set up at Jitters?

225
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,518
That's a good idea... it's just
a block away from the precinct.

226
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,236
And then what? What happens next?

227
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,105
You saw what Zoom did on my Earth.

228
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,107
He will do the exact same thing here.

229
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,075
Barry, we need to get you your powers back.

230
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,329
- There must be another way.
- There's not.

231
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:01,332
There's not.

232
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,900
I'm gonna get word to Singh.

233
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:05,369
Get him to set up a task force at Jitters.

234
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,037
- And then what?
- I don't know yet,

235
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,540
but I'm gonna make sure
Wally and Jesse are safe.

236
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,387
You know they're gonna figure
out a way to stop you, right?

237
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,474
Who? Barry? Wells? The police?

238
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:29,693
No. Nobody can stop me now.

239
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:31,228
Not anymore.

240
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,697
So... what's your plan?

241
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:37,568
You're just gonna kill everyone?

242
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,905
Not everyone.

243
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,907
Then why are you keeping me here?

244
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,080
'Cause I don't want to be alone anymore.

245
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:53,751
I am never going to be with you.

246
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:56,921
You think that you're not like me,

247
00:11:56,923 --> 00:12:00,140
but I've seen the darkness
inside of you, Caitlin.

248
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:03,811
Just like it was inside Killer Frost.

249
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:08,065
All you have to do... is unlock it.

250
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:14,772
[whoosh]

251
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,075
[sighs]

252
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,376
[rock music]

253
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,211
Hey.

254
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:39,096
There she is.

255
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:42,266
Still refuse to dress
like a grown-up, I see.

256
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:43,517
One grape soda.

257
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,219
Ah, no. I'm good.

258
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,271
Thanks.

259
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,474
So... what's wrong?

260
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,976
What? Something has to be wrong

261
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,644
for me to want to catch up with my brother?

262
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:54,778
Yeah, that's usually the way it works

263
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,196
with you, isn't it?

264
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,149
Actually, I had this...

265
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,785
feeling that I should come see you

266
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,654
and make sure you're okay, so...

267
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,539
Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped

268
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,157
by Snart and his pyromaniac friend again.

269
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,660
Us. You. Me. Us. They kidnapped both of us.

270
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:11,045
Yeah, well, you're not the one

271
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,213
who almost had his hands frozen off.

272
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,749
Lucky I can still play the piano.

273
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,501
Well, my octaves haven't quite
been the same,

274
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,836
but not that that matters to you.

275
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:21,171
Dante, I called you, more than once,

276
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,140
but, of course, you didn't answer.

277
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,175
Like I said. Only when something's wrong.

278
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,595
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,515
I don't know why I thought

280
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:33,851
that whole experience... that was it.

281
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:37,104
That was gonna bring us closer.

282
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:40,190
Cisco, we haven't been close
since we were kids.

283
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:43,410
I don't think anything's
ever gonna change that.

284
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:46,330
[pensive music]

285
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,501
All right. We'll bring down

286
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:51,585
some more supplies later.

287
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,370
How you can reach us.

288
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,789
And exactly how long
are we supposed to be in here?

289
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,875
Until someone lets you out.

290
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:01,762
This isn't ideal... none of it...
but Zoom's here,

291
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,931
and until he's taken care of,
this is what we're doing.

292
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,766
This is the safest place
for the two of you right now.

293
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:07,217
What are you gonna do?

294
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,219
- Whatever we can.
- Joe, let me do something.

295
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,188
Wally, there isn't anything
you can do right now.

296
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,523
Sit tight.

297
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,608
Okay, well, what about the...

298
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,646
bathroom? [both chuckle]

299
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,864
This room have Wi-Fi at least?

300
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,571
Wally and Jesse are all good.

301
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,790
[sighs] Thank you.

302
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:35,796
So this is what it takes
to get Barry his speed back.

303
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,998
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,918
It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.

305
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,303
I told you before,
once Barry makes up his mind,

306
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,389
it's impossible to change it.

307
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,725
Well, then we need to convince
him that this is the only way,

308
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,927
before he decides not to do it, right?

309
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,395
Shouldn't have to convince anyone

310
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,597
to do anything against his will.

311
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,234
Joe, we're talking about Barry, right?

312
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,353
I mean, I can't... I can't imagine

313
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:02,106
you don't feel the same way.

314
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,657
I mean, right now, I don't know what

315
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,192
the right thing to do is.

316
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:06,527
Seems clear to me.

317
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,246
This isn't just about your son.

318
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:11,832
Henry, this is about
the people in Central City.

319
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,668
About saving those people.
This is about stopping Zoom.

320
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,920
Your daughter is safe.

321
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:20,374
This could kill my son.

322
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,126
I'm not gonna let that happen.

323
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,794
The last time he was struck by lightning,

324
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,295
he was in a coma for nine months.

325
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,464
How did that happen? I know what I'm doing.

326
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:30,968
You are messing with something
that is out of your control.

327
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,470
And what if it did work? I mean, what then?

328
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,355
Joe? He goes up against Zoom,

329
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:39,193
the monster that snapped
his back and almost killed him,

330
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,312
and then took the one thing
that he's convinced now

331
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:44,198
that he needs in order to make him whole?

332
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,035
This is the way. This is the only way.

333
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:50,704
The people of Central City need The Flash.

334
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,789
Guys.

335
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:59,663
I know that you care about me,
each of you, in your own way,

336
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,248
and you all have
your own point of view on this,

337
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,583
but this decision is mine.

338
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,671
I have to make it on my own.

339
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,729
Can you put the Diamonds game on?

340
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:18,482
Ah, sports. That's my cue.

341
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:21,185
All right, well, this was fun.

342
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:25,105
Um... good hang. Whoa. Wait.

343
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,941
Gonna take care of that, right?

344
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,359
Dude, you invited me.

345
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,862
Unbelievable.

346
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,116
Hey, hold up!

347
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:40,204
Oh, no.

348
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:42,623
What? Cisco?

349
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,508
Hey, wait.

350
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:49,263
Yo! I need a lift home.

351
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,514
You still don't have a car?

352
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,715
Some of us don't have

353
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,801
a fleet of company cars at our disposal.

354
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,269
Dude, it's on the way.

355
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:56,970
Yeah, okay. Come on.

356
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,106
[dramatic music]

357
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,692
[both grunting]

358
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,864
You okay?

359
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,297
Hello, Vibe.

360
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,117
Simmer down, Reaper.
We got no beef with you.

361
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,702
Maybe not,

362
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:33,654
but I've got beef with you, Vibe.

363
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,039
Why does he keep calling you that?

364
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,373
I don't know.

365
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,209
You killed my brother, so, now, you die.

366
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,078
Oh, my God.

367
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,797
You're "Princess Bride" -ing me right now!

368
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,000
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else, Inigo.

369
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:49,003
I don't think so. My brother was Reverb.

370
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:52,423
Remember now?

371
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,731
- Move!
- He looks...

372
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,733
- Get... get... get in the van!
- He looks like...

373
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:03,934
Now!

374
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,908
I knew there was something wrong.

375
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,242
Every time I see you, we get attacked

376
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,994
by lunatics with crazy weapons!

377
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:20,834
Come on! He's gonna
blast us with that thing!

378
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:21,835
No, he's not!

379
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,420
[tires screeching]

380
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,005
[grunts]

381
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,457
Go! Go!

382
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,542
[tires screeching]

383
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,517
You want to tell me exactly
what you've gotten us

384
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,435
into this time?

385
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,604
He calls himself Rupture.

386
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:43,440
Another meta-human under Zoom's
control from my Earth.

387
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:45,726
Great, so he's bringing more
of his friends over.

388
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:48,062
That's what I told you he would do.

389
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:50,781
Okay, well, Zoom must've
lied to fake-Dante

390
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,316
and told him
I was the one who killed Reverb,

391
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:53,817
'cause dude wants me dead.

392
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,069
We got to do something.

393
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,854
What else do you know about him?

394
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:59,073
He gets his power
from that scythe he wields.

395
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,291
Thing's legit too... it almost
took half the van with him.

396
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,960
All right, then that's what we need to do.

397
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:05,045
We need to figure out a way
to get it away from him.

398
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,498
Right. Okay, all right.

399
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,049
I'm sure I can come up with something.

400
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:11,468
I just have to figure out
a way to not tell Dante

401
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,671
why this psychopath looks exactly like him.

402
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:17,725
[pensive music]

403
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,927
You know what you need to do.

404
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:24,598
I need a minute.

405
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,296
Hey.

406
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,799
Hey.

407
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:46,170
It should be an easy decision.
Why isn't it?

408
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,589
I mean, it's not like you're picking out

409
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:51,141
what sweater you're gonna wear.

410
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:53,844
Getting hit by another
particle accelerator explosion?

411
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:56,313
I mean, come on.
What if something goes wrong?

412
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:59,516
What if...

413
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:03,771
I thought bringing my dad here
would make this easier.

414
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,739
It's just made it a lot harder.

415
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,691
Yeah, I can understand him
not wanting you to do it.

416
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,660
He just wants you to be safe.

417
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:13,030
What about you?

418
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:14,581
I mean, I don't know if I could go through

419
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,867
what I went through last time
if you get hurt.

420
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,041
Are you okay?

421
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,881
Not really.

422
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,383
What's up?

423
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,770
Do you remember when I told you

424
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,439
that I didn't want you going to Earth-2

425
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:40,607
if you felt like you
didn't have anything left here?

426
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:44,144
Yeah... because Patty left.

427
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:48,198
It wasn't just because of Patty.

428
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,150
What do you mean?

429
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:54,238
Barry, you've always
had someone to come home to.

430
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Me.

431
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:02,880
I've just been thinking a lot lately...

432
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:07,718
About us.

433
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,638
What Wells said about us
being married in the future.

434
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,341
And on Earth-2.

435
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:17,978
And I can't help wondering if...

436
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,431
maybe we were meant to be together.

437
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:30,524
So...

438
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:34,194
when I told you how I felt
about you last year...

439
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:36,747
I wasn't available in that way.

440
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:42,336
But... but I am now.

441
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:46,290
Why are you telling me this now?

442
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,710
Because, Barry, I need you to know

443
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:55,265
that it doesn't matter to me
if you're The Flash or not.

444
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:59,386
You, Barry... that's who I want
to see if I have a future with.

445
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:05,192
I mean...

446
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:09,113
if you still want that too, of course.

447
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:21,458
I should go see if Jesse
and Wally need anything.

448
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,809
[dramatic music]

449
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:39,977
Come on.

450
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,404
Yes!

451
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:52,489
[door opening]

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,749
And?

453
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:06,336
He got away, but I'll find him.

454
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,038
Later.

455
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,874
He needs to pay
for what he did to my brother!

456
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:15,095
And he will. Later, Rupture!

457
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:16,380
What do you want me to do?

458
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:19,466
The police have gathered again.

459
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:23,303
They think I've spared their lives.

460
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:27,224
Tonight... show them they're wrong.

461
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:35,566
You disapprove?

462
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:38,035
You said you would spare them.

463
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:40,320
I need to teach them a lesson.

464
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,705
Is that why you change your voice?

465
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:44,541
So that everyone will be afraid of you?

466
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:49,246
I'm not a monster!

467
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,749
As you once said...

468
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,752
[deep, distorted voice]
I'm nothing but a monster.

469
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:00,757
[whoosh]

470
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:09,816
Can we come out now?

471
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:11,184
- No!
- No!

472
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:13,604
[computer chiming]

473
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:15,105
Something's blinking over here.

474
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,779
- From CCPD.
- That's Caitlin.

475
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,499
- What about Caitlin?
- She sent us a message.

476
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,335
Rupture is gonna attack Jitters tonight.

477
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:31,171
We got to move, Barry.

478
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:33,540
What are you gonna do, slugger?

479
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:41,048
Having The Flash might
be the best way to stop Zoom

480
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,716
and all the metas he's sending over.

481
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:46,103
But, look, until we know for sure

482
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:49,056
that setting off the accelerator
will work, it's too risky.

483
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:51,608
Not just for me. For the entire city.

484
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,694
Countless others that would be affected

485
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,312
if the explosion is not contained.

486
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:56,863
- Yes, but Allen...
- Stop, Wells.

487
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,533
Look, I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.

488
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:02,703
Sorry.

489
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:03,870
We're gonna have to figure out

490
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:05,739
how to do this without The Flash.

491
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,366
- Joe, did you reach The Flash?
- He'll be here.

492
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,034
Great, these guys are almost ready.

493
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:29,153
Put it on "1."

494
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:30,805
Hey, we're all set up.

495
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,289
Are you sure this is the best plan?

496
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,208
Look, I know you can't help as The Flash,

497
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,827
but stopping one of Zoom's
cronies sends him a message

498
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:38,829
that we won't be intimidated.

499
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,915
You think I made the right decision?

500
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,166
I don't know, Bare.

501
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:43,467
Whether you made the right one or not,

502
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:45,553
you're gonna have to live with it.

503
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:46,921
Yeah. All right.

504
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:58,683
What is this?

505
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:01,102
You went to another Earth?

506
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:02,853
You weren't supposed to read that.

507
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,189
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

508
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,991
So, yeah, I read it.

509
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:09,493
Look, I got to go, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

510
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,362
No, man, we're gonna talk
about this right now!

511
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:12,947
Okay, let's talk about this now.

512
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,532
What did you want me to say?

513
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:16,834
"What up, fam?
I know you probably don't care,

514
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,786
"but I'm going off
to another Earth for a hot sec.

515
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,421
"If I don't make it back
in time for dinner,

516
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:22,123
it probably didn't go so well."

517
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,008
Why did you even go in the first place?

518
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,711
Because my friends needed my help.

519
00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:28,679
What kind of help?

520
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:31,549
- They needed me to vibe.
- Vibe?

521
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:35,519
That's what that lunatic
called you, who attacked us.

522
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:37,605
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

523
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,474
[pensive music]

524
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,198
I have powers.

525
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,650
[laughs] Powers?

526
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,655
What, you're, like, a meta-human?

527
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:03,831
I was affected

528
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,966
when the accelerator
went off two years ago,

529
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:11,172
and now I see things, vibes... of people.

530
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:14,508
Like visions?

531
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,260
So that's why you called me.

532
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:18,345
Yeah.

533
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,348
I had one of you, or at least
I thought it was you,

534
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,351
until your "World of Warcraft"
doppelganger showed up.

535
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,853
You killed his brother?

536
00:27:25,855 --> 00:27:28,856
No, I didn't kill his brother.
Of course not.

537
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,524
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

538
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:34,195
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

539
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:38,365
We haven't been close in years and...

540
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,668
and there's nothing
we can do to change that.

541
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:47,291
Look, I got to go.

542
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,376
Um...

543
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:52,046
just wait for me here, okay?

544
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:05,059
You all set, Cisco?

545
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:06,894
Yeah, we're set.

546
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:09,280
Here he comes.

547
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:12,233
[dramatic music]

548
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,370
[glass shattering]

549
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:27,581
Now, where has everybody gone?

550
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,670
[whoosh]

551
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:35,222
Flash? Not who I was expecting,

552
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:36,757
but you'll be a nice warm-up.

553
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,011
Too slow, Rupture.

554
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:51,488
Come on, Flash!

555
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,357
All right. Time to win an Oscar.

556
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,243
Let's do it.

557
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,590
[Taser fires, electricity crackles]

558
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:12,760
[grunting]

559
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:13,928
Get up.

560
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,130
Are we the guys you were looking for?

561
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,798
Hope you like being alone, 'cause you won't

562
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,051
be talking to anyone at Iron Heights.

563
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,636
[laughs]

564
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,272
Cisco, we got him. All good.

565
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,974
Get back! Get that camera back.

566
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,560
Breaking news coming out
of Jitters coffee shop.

567
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,979
CCPN has learned that a meta-human

568
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:35,316
was just apprehended after
an altercation with The Flash.

569
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:37,735
You told them Rupture was coming.

570
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,621
How? How?

571
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:49,046
Oh, you... are smart, aren't you?

572
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,464
You betrayed me!

573
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:53,884
You said you would spare them.

574
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:55,502
I guess...

575
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,887
[voice distorts, deepens] now we're even.

576
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:57,889
Jay, no!

577
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,427
My name... is Zoom.

578
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,233
[guns cocking]

579
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:13,153
Oh, my God. No!

580
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,265
Make sure you get this.

581
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,434
- What the...?
- They got to get out of there.

582
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,987
[energy surging]

583
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:29,156
Everybody move!

584
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:32,526
[neck bones snapping]

585
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,362
[dramatic music]

586
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,539
- Barry, don't!
- No!

587
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:50,343
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

588
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:53,513
Hey, stop! Stop! God...

589
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,298
you've made your point.

590
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,718
Not quite yet.

591
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,355
[gasps and coughs]

592
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:04,891
You're an even bigger disappointment

593
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:08,228
than your brother.

594
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:18,121
Central City...

595
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:23,493
the Flash you've seen
in your streets is a fake.

596
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:27,414
A hologram meant to give you hope.

597
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:32,752
But there is no more hope,
there is no more Flash,

598
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:37,474
and there's no one left
to protect your city...

599
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,676
from me.

600
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:45,932
Tell the rest of your force, Captain,

601
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,603
that their policing days are over.

602
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:56,443
You're only alive because of Caitlin.

603
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:59,830
Try something like this again,

604
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:02,249
and my affection for her

605
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:06,620
won't stop me from killing you...

606
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:09,089
or the rest of this city!

607
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,458
[whoosh]

608
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:29,276
Did you see this?

609
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,230
That's what you left to go do, wasn't it?

610
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:35,565
Look, man. I know you're mad at me.

611
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,701
We haven't been close in a long time.

612
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:41,571
[sentimental music]

613
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,823
I want things to change.

614
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:49,129
You're my brother.

615
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,252
Okay.

616
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:00,840
Okay.

617
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:11,234
You know that wall's not
just gonna open for you, right?

618
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:12,686
It might.

619
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:16,573
Yeah, trust me. It won't.

620
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,191
We shouldn't be in here.

621
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:20,243
We should be out there with them.

622
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,779
Why? So Zoom can take us again?

623
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,448
- No, so we can help stop him.
- What are we gonna do?

624
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,918
I mean, we don't have any powers.

625
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,703
I don't know.

626
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:34,457
Hey, you're pretty quick
at solving unsolvable problems.

627
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,877
Let's figure it out.

628
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:40,714
I will see what I can do.

629
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:42,349
It won't be long now.

630
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,517
He's moving faster
than he ever did on my Earth.

631
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,219
So what's next?

632
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,271
Next, he'll recruit every
meta-human he can find,

633
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,889
and then force them to do what he wants.

634
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,191
How many could be left?

635
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,726
We defeated most of them, didn't we?

636
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:55,562
No. You're not even close.

637
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,948
This...

638
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,784
is a list of meta-humans from my Earth.

639
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,285
Ones that are known, anyway.

640
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,037
The particle accelerator explosion

641
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,538
was contained on my Earth.

642
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
That didn't happen here.

643
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:10,410
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

644
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:12,245
Because of The Flash.

645
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:14,297
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around...

646
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,249
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

647
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,751
We don't know that.

648
00:34:17,753 --> 00:34:19,803
What more do you need?

649
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:21,588
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans.

650
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,806
We've seen him do that. I told you

651
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:23,890
he would kill those officers.

652
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:25,258
We saw him do that too.

653
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,509
What more do you need?

654
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:29,929
[dramatic music]

655
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:33,850
Let's do it. I want to do it.

656
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:42,492
One of the cops that Zoom killed
tonight, he had a son.

657
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,361
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

658
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:47,614
And now, another kid has to grow
up without one of their parents

659
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:51,951
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

660
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:57,340
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

661
00:34:57,342 --> 00:35:00,460
I enabled him to rule this Earth.

662
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:01,628
I need my powers back.

663
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:06,299
Let's do it.

664
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:08,518
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

665
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,820
So how does this work?

666
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:24,104
It's an abbreviated version

667
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:26,156
of the accelerator evil Wells built,

668
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:30,444
except Harry is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

669
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:33,113
to direct it to Barry
instead of the entire city.

670
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:35,032
Good. Last thing we need

671
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:37,785
is more meta-humans
running around Central City.

672
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:43,507
So... Barry just gets in,
we turn it on, and that's it?

673
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,342
Yeah.

674
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,628
No. Not exactly.

675
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,296
In addition to recreating
what happened with

676
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,215
the particle accelerator explosion,

677
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,133
we also have to recreate
what happened to Barry.

678
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,019
Getting struck by lightning.

679
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:56,303
That's right.

680
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:57,688
Wait, so how are you gonna do that?

681
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,023
It's not even raining outside.

682
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:01,058
Well, Ramon, you have the wand.

683
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,810
The one I made for Mark Mardon?

684
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,812
No, the one you built
for the Harry Potter convention.

685
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:07,064
Yes, of course,
the one you built for Mardon.

686
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:09,283
How do you know about
the Harry Potter convention?

687
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:12,703
- Get the wand. Get on the roof.
- Why the roof?

688
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,955
Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

689
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:18,826
and that, Ramon, is gonna be you.

690
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:30,170
All right, I'm on the roof. Wow.

691
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:32,673
I've never actually been up here before.

692
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:34,842
I think I can see my apartment from here.

693
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:36,560
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

694
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:38,178
When I give you the signal,

695
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,514
you're gonna create
a lightning storm above you.

696
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,349
So I'm just supposed
to stand here in the middle

697
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:44,351
- of a lightning storm?
- Really, Ramon.

698
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:46,103
Chances of being struck are slim, indeed.

699
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,988
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it.

700
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,691
All we need is one lightning
bolt to strike the satellite.

701
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:52,526
The satellite circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

702
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,695
Barry's in the breach room. Just do it.

703
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:56,080
Yeah. I'm doing it.

704
00:36:56,082 --> 00:36:58,532
Mozart better watch out.

705
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:01,702
Cisco Ramon's about
to conduct something nasty.

706
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:08,425
You're gonna feel these
clamps, but they're necessary.

707
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,428
- [clamps locking]
- [grunts]

708
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,632
- You good?
- Yeah. You?

709
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,887
I'll be fine, Joe.

710
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,229
Barry, whatever happens,

711
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:32,232
it will never change
the way that I feel about you.

712
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:49,917
Son...

713
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,753
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

714
00:37:55,558 --> 00:38:00,928
Being The Flash...
that's the best version of me.

715
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,983
If I don't have my speed, I'll
never be that person anymore.

716
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,520
I have to do this.

717
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:11,105
Okay.

718
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,076
You ready, Allen?

719
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,833
All right, then.

720
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,119
Here we go.

721
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,845
Think of it as hotwiring a car, right?

722
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:36,964
So there's a motor inside the wall.

723
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,799
So all we have to do is provide electricity

724
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,301
- to make it turn on.
- Exactly.

725
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,137
So we just do a little here...

726
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,688
- [electricity sizzles]
- [gasps]

727
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,640
And voila!

728
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,559
- [deep rumbling]
- Do you feel that?

729
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:51,145
Yeah, what's happening?

730
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:53,814
Particles are becoming unstable.

731
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:55,365
Ramon, get ready!

732
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,284
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

733
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,875
[metallic clanging]

734
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:06,910
- [injectors piercing]
- [grunts]

735
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,829
Why are you doing this?

736
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,831
The night Barry was struck by lightning,

737
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,666
he was doing fingerprint analysis.

738
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,551
Those chemicals got in his system then,

739
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,170
and they are going in now.

740
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:17,671
So you're injecting them into him?

741
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:19,006
We have to recreate everything

742
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:20,557
that happened to Barry that night.

743
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,343
I'm okay, Iris! [panting]

744
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:26,897
- Hold on, Barry.
- God!

745
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:29,850
- He's going hydrostatic.
- Almost there. Almost there.

746
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:31,985
- Wells!
- Almost there.

747
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,821
Ready, Ramon?

748
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:36,023
Ready!

749
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:39,576
- Now!
- Expecto Patronum!

750
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:42,246
[lightning crackling]

751
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,615
Great Scott! It's working!

752
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:50,254
No!

753
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:52,256
[whoosh]

754
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:54,625
[screaming]

755
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,210
Initiating collision.

756
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:10,641
Barry!

757
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:13,527
[electricity crackling]

758
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:37,050
[electricity crackles]

759
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:38,669
It worked!

760
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:41,672
Is everyone okay?

761
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:43,924
What happened?

762
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,520
No!

763
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:03,193
No. What did you do to my son?

764
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:04,695
[whoosh]

765
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,787
You thought you could give
The Flash his speed back?

766
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,876
Well done.

767
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:22,429
You killed him instead.

768
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,534
