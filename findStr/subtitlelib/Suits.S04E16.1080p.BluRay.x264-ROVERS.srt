(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,845
- Jeff...
- Jessica, you were right.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,651
We either need to have both
or it's not going to work.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,730
Effectively immediately,
I'm tendering my resignation.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,402
Forstman doesn't throw money around
without getting something in return.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,410
- He's gonna get money in return.
- Money is third on his list.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,729
The first two are getting back at people
and getting control of people.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,763
Son of a bitch. You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,564
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,802
Yep.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,282
After Woodall lost his job,
Forstman got him installed at the SEC.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
- Where's the proof?
- In Eric Woodall's bank accounts.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,485
This is ridiculous.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,762
- I'm your boss.
- Gentlemen, give me a minute.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,123
You're forcing me to turn you in
for what you did twelve years ago.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,321
CHARLES: You're not gonna do that,

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,204
because you did it, too, pal.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,849
Anyone else ever loses faith in me,
it doesn't matter.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,644
But with you, it's different.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,405
I should go.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,686
Why?

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,244
You knowl love you, Donna.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,886
Sing, sing, won't you
sing for me?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,924
Beast in your belly,
you've got to let it breathe

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,970
- MAN: To Harvey.
- CROWD: To Harvey. Cheers.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,761
Beast in your belly, Lord,
you've got to let it breathe

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,808
Breathe for me

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,529
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,050
Jay, can I get a Macallan 18?

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,528
You know, usually
when someone wins their first trial,

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,962
they at least pretend to finish the drink
their fellow ADAs bought them.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,844
- I'm sorry, do we...
- Know each other?

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,282
- Not yet. But today's your lucky day.
- And why is that?

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,368
Because it's the day
you get to meet Donna.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,607
- And let me guess, you're Donna.
- Oh, you have no idea how Donna I am.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,609
Well, Donna, I'm Harvey...

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,801
Harvey Specter.
You really think

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,331
I'd be talking to you
if I didn't know who you were?

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,442
And how exactly
do you know about me?

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,325
I know about everybody.
What I don't know is,

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,568
why is this the first case
you ever took to trial?

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,570
Because it was a white-collar crime,
not some drug dealer on the comer.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,331
- Which makes it the kind of case...
- That puts your name in the paper.

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,169
- You're not just a pretty face, are you?
- No, I'm not.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,527
So, maybe you should buy me a drink

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,642
and we can continue this conversation
in the comer.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,045
Jay?

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,446
Nothing % better <i>than</i>
blood on blood

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,923
<i>I promise, brother,
you are safe with us</i>

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,001
Sean, what are you doing in my building
in the middle of the night?

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,491
I thought we were done
with you following me.

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,649
I'm not following you,
I'm waiting for you.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,641
I need your help.

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,127
You need my help
or the SEC needs my help?

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
We both do.
But at the moment,

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,603
I care more about me
than I do about the SEC.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,767
I can't find the money.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,001
What do you mean
you can't find the money?

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,850
What the hell have you been doing
for the last three months?

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,849
- Looking for the money.
- Then look harder.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,928
Because Woodall isn't
in the charity business.

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,246
Forstman buys people

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,089
and we handed them
to you on a silver platter.

64
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,486
And I stuck my neck out for you

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,608
when I accused my friend
of being on the take.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,801
Now, if I can't follow
through with that,

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,809
Eric Woodall walks.
Charles Forstman walks.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,571
Well, what makes you think
I can find the money when you couldn't?

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,602
I don't know if you can or not.

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,404
But they're going to shut me down
in five days

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,806
and I need all the help
I can get.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,850
Okay. Enough about me,
let's talk about you.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,121
Ooh, my favorite subject.

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,607
- Well, you know what I think?
- Hmm?

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,529
I think your favorite subject
didn't come up to me

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,130
just to find out why I went to trial.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,364
- You want something.
- I sure do.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,970
And I think I might be ready
to give it to you.

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,841
It's not sex.

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,801
Then never mind.

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,442
(CHUCKLES)

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,882
Wow. You're going to be
that honest about it.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,126
Saves time.

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,050
Well, in that case,
I want to move to your desk.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,808
And why is that?

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,650
Because it's no secret
that in a few years

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,444
you're going back to
Gordon, Schmidt and Van Dyke.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,642
And let me guess,
you want to come with me when I do.

89
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,081
- No, I don't.
- Then why?

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,524
Because I'm going to be an actress

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,841
and I want somebody
who understands

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,884
that there's more to life
than just the DA's office,

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,804
and that I can give my all to them,

94
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,809
but still step out
for the occasional audition.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,843
- So, you're stepping out on me already?
- Yes.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,970
But the important thing is
I'm telling you about it in advance.

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,567
- Macallan 36.
- I didn't order a Macallan 36.

98
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,569
It's from the gentleman over there.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,490
DONNA: Okay.
I don't know who that is,

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,847
but I'm telling you right now,
he is bad news.

101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,965
You look... different.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,128
I will take that as a compliment.

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,444
I meant I wasn't expecting
to see you like that.

104
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,726
I... I know what you meant.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,889
What you really meant was that you
weren't expecting to see me at all.

106
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,802
- Excuse me?
- Come on, Harvey.

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,970
Ever since Mike came back to the firm,
I've basically been non-existent to you.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,001
What's going on?

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,051
Cahill can't find the money.

110
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,125
What do you mean
he can't find the money?

111
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,446
What's he been doing
this whole time?

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,528
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- And what did he say?

113
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,563
He said he's in trouble
and he needs our help.

114
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,688
And I'm going to tell you
what I couldn't tell him.

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,246
He can't find the money because
he's been looking in the wrong place.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,849
- So, where's the right place?
- I don't know exactly.

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,804
But somewhere, there's a person
Eric Woodall cares about

118
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,764
- and that's where the money went.
- And why can't we tell Cahill that?

119
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,723
Because I don't want him
to know howl know it.

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,808
- How do you know it?
- Because I know.

121
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,770
You want a chance to exist?

122
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,769

Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry. I...

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,686
You don't need to fake it, Donna.

146
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,923
I'm not faking it.
She was a sweet woman.

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,809
She was a friggin' battle-axe,
is what she was.

148

There wasn't a day
that went by when I didn't want to

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,041
rip out one of her varicose veins
and strangle her with it.

150
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,726
Okay, I don't think you're in touch with
how you're really feeling right now.

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,242
How I'm feeling is that she left me
high and dry just like she always did.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,810
- You expect her to keep working?
- Look at this.

153
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,530
It's her entire estate laid out on paper.

154
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,847

she plans within an inch of her life.

156

these things are bequeathed properly.

No, she wanted them
to be in here with me.

- Okay. Louis,

but you're not throwing her ashes

- anywhere without me.
- Okay, fine.

with Harvey for you?

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,364
Just because I've got a bad reputation?

169
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,644
Because I'm not accepting a drink
for putting your rival behind bars.

170
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,886
You've got the wrong idea, pal.

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,890
I didn't buy you that
for putting my enemy away.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,367
I bought you that
for how you put my enemy away.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,810
Okay. You got me.

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,963
- What are you talking about?
- You.

175
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,051
You've got something special.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,287
And I want people with something
special working for me.

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,365
Why exactly would
I want to work for you?

178
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,806
I can think of a million reasons,

179
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,809
because that's the signing bonus
I'm going to give you.

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,887
And that's a hell of a lot more money

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,161
than you're ever going to make
as a lawyer.

182
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,687
What if I told you
I don't practice law to make money?

183
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,963
Then I'd ask you
what are you practicing for?

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,205
- To bend people to my will.
- Then bend people to your will for me.

185
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,210
And make a lot of money
on top of it.

186
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,530
Well, here's the thing, Mr. Forstman.

187
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,806
Not that it's any of your business,

188
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,406
but I'll be making half a million a year
in no time.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,209
Half a million a year is dick.
My gardener makes that.

190
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,043
Then go offer your gardener a job,
because I'm not interested.

191
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,920
Just so you know,

192
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,804
if you change your mind
and come back to me,

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,168
it's not going to be
the same conversation.

194
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,722
Thanks for the drink.
Good luck, Mr. Forstman.

195
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,927
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

196
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,407
If Forstman gave the money to someone
Woodall's close to,

197
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,801
we need to start
by compiling a family tree.

198
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,729
I meant, why aren't you
at school today?

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,289
Because I'm going
to prove to Harvey that I exist.

200
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,964
Okay. Now that you mention it,
what was that last night?

201
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,286
Ever since you came back,

202
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,562
it's like you and Harvey
speak this secret language,

203
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,681
and I'm not a part of it.

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,171
Rachel, come on.
We have a history.

205
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,009
I'm not talking about history.
I'm talking about respect.

206
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,724
Okay. You don't know
what you're talking about

207
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
if you think Harvey
doesn't respect you.

208
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,487
Are you going to tell me that last night
he didn't give you a look that said,

209
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,769
"You don't need to tell her the full story
because she doesn't need to know"?

210
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,962
Rachel, he didn't give me that look
because he doesn't respect you.

211
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,082
He gave me that look
because he's ashamed.

212
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,289
What are you talking about?
(SIGHS)

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,170
Let's just say that I'm not the only one
that Charles Forstman duped.

214
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,528
- Harvey got taken by Forstman?
- Yes.

215
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,210
And he only told me because he had to

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,924
when we were in the middle of
that takeover battle.

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,085
That's why Harvey's
so slow to care about anybody.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,962
Forstman used somebody
he cared about.

219
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,843
Holy shit, I never even
thought about that.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,764
- Who do you think it was?
- I don't know.

221
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,923
But I have a pretty good guess.

222
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,403
Well, what do you think?

223
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,051
I think this place is a dump

224
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,401
and I'm busy. So, why don't you
tell me why we're here?

225
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,321
I want to open a restaurant here.

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,329
Marcus, there's already
a restaurant here.

227
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,847
And it isn't working.

228
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,849
Which is why they're going
to lose their lease.

229
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,042
Take a look. I've got a chef.

230
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,004
I've got a liquor license.
I've got renovation plans.

231
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,202
I have everything I need.

232
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,167
Except the money.

233
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,202
- I need $150,000.
- Are you crazy?

234
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,641
Come on, Harvey.
This is my dream.

235
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,165
I know I can make this work.

236
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,009
I'm not saying you can't.
But I don't have that kind of money.

237
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,281
What are you talking about?

238
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,247
You're the big time lawyer
who just got his name in the paper.

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,205
My name in the paper
doesn't pay me extra money.

240
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,163
I make $50,000 a year.

241
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,084
And you said you were going to be
a corporate lawyer.

242
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,964
Yeah. And when I am,
I can help you.

243
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,447
- But right now...
- I don't give a shit about right now.

244
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,001
I give a shit about when you were
supposed to be my big brother.

245
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,043
- But instead, what did you do?
- I know what I did.

246
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,050
Then you know I can never get a loan
for as long as I live.

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,680
Marcus, when are you going
to take responsibility for your own shit?

248
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,689
What the hell does it look like
I'm trying to do?

249
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,206
I came to you first
because I know you'd want me to.

250
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,165
But if you don't come through,

251
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,930
I'm going to go to Mom.

252
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,168
You don't mean Mom,
you mean him.

253
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,363
And you're not taking
a nickel from that man.

254
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,643
Me taking his money isn't going to make
what he did to Dad any worse.

255
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,804
That's bullshit and you know it.
And I'm not going to let you do it.

256
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,121
Hey, Harvey.

257
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,004
How the hell are you
going to stop me?

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,809
HARVEY: Am I crazy
or is that the same dress

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,048
you were wearing
the last time I saw you?

260
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,845
You must be crazy, because I don't wear
the same dress ever.

261
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,566
Then you must spend
a fortune on wardrobe.

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,371
But I have to say
it's worth it.

263
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,009
I suddenly get the feeling
this isn't just a drop by.

264
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,403
- I want to move up our timeline.
- Harvey, we have a deal.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,047
I put myself on the line for you.
And our deal is not going to change.

266
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,083
I could just pay you
the money back and move on.

267
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,167
And if you could do that,

268
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,328
you wouldn't be here
asking to come back.

269
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,125
How much money
did Marcus lose this time?

270
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,890
He didn't lose anything.
He wants to start a restaurant.

271
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,330
He doesn't want to start shit.
He owes somebody something.

272
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,687
You don't know that.
He's turned his life around.

273
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,689
What I know is, he has a problem

274
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,882
and he's looking
to get money from you.

275
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,883
And you're not going to get it from me.

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,004
Then I'll get it somewhere else.

277
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,489
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- I got a job offer from Charles Forstman.

278
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,881
Look at me.

279
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,330
I don't care what he's offering you.
Don't take it.

280
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,922
Because he's got a bad reputation?
You think I don't know that?

281
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,202
I think there are a lot of things you think
you know that you don't.

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,369
What I know is that you're either going to
help me or Charles Forstman is.

283
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,925
It's up to you.

284
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,171
Harvey, I can't make
you listen to me.

285
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,681
But what I'm not going to do
is let you come here

286
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,691
and leverage me with some bullshit offer
from a shady banker.

287
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,327
So, do what you're going to do.
But don't say I didn't warn you.

288
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,927
You can buy
all the Wonder Bread you want, Eric,

289
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,286
but you can't take it
with you to prison.

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,641
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to remind you

291
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,850
that once they find the money,
it's all going to come tumbling down.

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,570
They're not going to find the money.

293
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,970
- Because there is no money.
- Not in your accounts.

294
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,168
But I know what Cahill doesn't.

295
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,169
Forstman gave it to
somebody you care about,

296
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,930
and if I tell him that,
it will be too late.

297
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,201
I know what you're trying to do.

298
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,846
You're trying to bait me into
moving the body.

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,128
We both know you're not dumb
enough to do that.

300
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,130
I'm here to get you to cut a deal
and turn Forstman in.

301
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,561
You don't have the authority
to cut a deal.

302
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,408
No, but I can get Cahill to,
after you hire me to represent you.

303
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,926
You mean hire the fox
to watch the henhouse?

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,003
- Not a chance.
- Eric, they're closing in.

305
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,011
And when they do,
you're going to want to call me.

306
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,367
So, why don't you take my card?

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,408
(SIGHS) This is ridiculous.

308
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,042
Woodall's got 30 people it could be,
or it could be none of them.

309
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,168
- I know that but this is ourjob.
- No.

310
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,170
Our job is to help Harvey get Forstman.

311
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,890
If you're thinking what I think
you're thinking...

312
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,280
- I am and you are, too.
- Rachel, we are never

313
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,765
going to get Harvey to go after Forstman

314
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,883
- for what they did 12 years ago.
- Why?

315
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,128
- Because of his brother?
- Yes, because of his brother

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
or because he's ashamed.

317
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,286
Either way, he knows it's a possibility.
He doesn't need me to tell him about it.

318
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,971
No. He just doesn't need
me to tell him about it.

319
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,730
- Rachel.
- This is not about that.

320
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,801
Look. I can't tell him
because I'm not supposed to know.

321
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,331
- But you can.
- And I just told you,

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,771
he doesn't want to hear it.

323
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,160
And when has that
ever stopped you before?

324
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,281
- This is different.
- Why?

325
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,765
Because he's ashamed.

326
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,801
Then he's not thinking right.

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,968
And he needs your help
more than ever.

328
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,407
- Then we're both telling him.
- Mike, I don't need the credit.

329
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,841
No, this isn't about credit.
This is about us.

330
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,486
He can't tell me something
and expect me not to tell you.

331
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,526
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, where have you been all day?

332
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,606
Why, is there something
you want to talk about?

333
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,767
Yeah, where you've been.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,445
Sean Cahill was at my door last night...

335
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,961
Harvey, Norma passed away.
I've been helping Louis.

336
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,609
Norma died?
That's terrible.

337
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,641
I thought you couldn't stand her.

338
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,446
I couldn't, but I assumed
Louis loved her, so...

339
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,491
- Do what you need to do.
- Oh.

340
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,121
Because she was his secretary,
he must have loved her.

341
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,441
- That's not what I meant.
- But it is what you said.

342
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,449
Okay, Donna.
What's wrong?

343
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,766
How about we start with the fact

344
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,769
that I have been wondering
for the last 10 hours

345
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,611
if you're going to acknowledge
what happened last night.

346
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,404
But you're you,
so of course you're not.

347
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,841
I'm not going to acknowledge it
because nothing happened last night.

348
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,962
Why? And don't tell me
I know why.

349
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,690
Because it would have been a mistake
and you know it.

350
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,007
What I know is something happened.

351
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,006
And you ran away,
but not before you told me you love me.

352
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,527
I did that because
I wanted to make you feel better.

353
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,804
- What did you just say to me?
- No, that's not what I meant.

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,445
- I didn't say that to...
- Because you pity me?

355
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,722
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I said it because I love you,

356
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,127
- and I wanted you to know it.
- Love me how?

357
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,011
- Why does that have to come...
- Love me how?

358
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
That's what I thought.

359
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,003
You either can't answer or you won't.

360
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,448
Which is bullshit, because obviously
you don't just look at me this way.

361
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,523
You're capable
of looking at me that way.

362
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,091
But you don't want to
let those worlds collide

363
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,730
because you're afraid
to risk anything.

364
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,730
- Because we have everything.
- No, Harvey, you have everything!

365
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,569
So, you're saying you want everything?

366
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,445
I don't know, Harvey.

367
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,609
But what I do know is,
I don't want your pity.

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,725
Oh, the world
is all around us

369
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,804
But have you noticed me?

370
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,801
Yeah, the world has
overshadowed me

371
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,331
What are you doing here?
Nobody finds out where I live.

372
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,561
I do.

373
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,763
CHARLES: Oh, hold on a second.
Let me turn this off.

374
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,803
HARVEY: You've got to be kidding me.
You're watching Wall Street?

375
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,322
- A monthly ritual, to remind myself.
- Of what?

376
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,563
Of what a pussy Gordon Gekko is.
Now...

377
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,691
Want to tell me
what changed your mind?

378
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,410
- I decided I wanted the money.
- And you turned me down.

379
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,851
So... (INHALES SHARPLY)

380
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,924
Now you're going
to tell me why you want the money.

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,565
My brother needs
$150,000 for a restaurant.

382
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,531
Now we're getting somewhere.
(CLEARS THROAT)

383
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,689
Let's have it.
Okay, you want it?

384
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,606
Here it is.

385
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,807
It's not just a restaurant,
it's a second chance.

386
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,649
Marcus has a gambling problem.

387
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,886
- And I gave it to him.
- Mmm-hmm.

388
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,402
And you think this is his way out?

389
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,886
- I know it is.
- Hmm.

390
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,442
We're not a good fit.
Because restaurants fail.

391
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,604
And when this one does,
you'll leave.

392
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,801
So, you might as well
leave right now.

393
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,445
Then how about we bet on it?

394
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,681
You're going to gamble on something

395
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,729
to get your brother
out of a gambling problem?

396
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,730
- I didn't say I had a problem.
- I think maybe you do.

397
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,166
When you always win,

398
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,968
it's not a problem.
(LAUGHING)

399
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,645
I think I might like you, pal.

400
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,286
Louis. I got your message.
What's going on?

401
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,731
What's going on is,
they're trying to screw me

402
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,808
- and I need you to be bad cop.
- What?

403
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,285
MORTICIAN: Have you made
a decision, sir?

404
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,570
No, I haven't made a decision,
you shyster dealer of death.

405
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,808
Okay. I think maybe
we're going to need another minute.

406
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,041
No, we don't.

407
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,885
I don't need another minute to see that
this looks like a pot from Home Depot,

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,650
this looks like a lamp
from Motel 6,

409
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,643
and this looks like
a goddamn howitzer shell.

410
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,849
You are lucky that I don't take
this mockery of a final resting place

411
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,325
and shove it up your ass.

412
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,283
- Louis, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough!

413
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,243
I've been handling
this bullshit for two days

414
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,249
for a woman who was supposed
to be handling things for me.

415
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,641
Louis, this isn't about the urn.

416
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,046
Oh, please don't give me
that touchy-feely shit.

417
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,965
And why the hell
are you not being bad cop?

418
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,081
Because that's not what's needed.

419
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,929
Oh, bullshit it's not what's needed.

420
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,565
- Louis.
- You don't care about me.

421
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,684
You never cared about me.
All you care about is yourself...

422
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,404
And your stupid sister,
and your Hummel figurines,

423
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,808
- and your Murder, She Wrote reruns.
- Louis, I'm not Norma.

424
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,247
She's gone...
And it's gonna be okay.

425
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,930
She was a battle-axe!

426
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,931
(CRYING)
But she was my battle-axe.

427
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,845
I know.

428
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,770
Oh, God, she didn't
just leave me high and dry,

429
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,644
she left me for good.
(SOBBING)

430
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,969
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

431
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,088
- HARVEY: Both of you?
- We both work for you.

432
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,290
Which is why we're both here to say
maybe it's time we explore other options.

433
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,728
You got to be kidding me.
You spent two days on this,

434
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,001
and you're ready
to throw in the towel?

435
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,771
We've spent two of our five days on it,
and we still don't have a name,

436
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,002
so we think it's time to consider...

437
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,971
- What?
- Going after Forstman

438
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,809
for whatever he did to you
12 years ago.

439
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,131
- You told her?
- Yes, I did.

440
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,322
Because like I said,
we both work for you.

441
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,646
Which means we both want to help.

442
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,569
You think I haven't wondered
how to go after Forstman

443
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,127
- 100 times in the last dozen years?
- And why don't you?

444
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,527
- Because I'm not the only one at risk.
- MIKE: You mean your brother.

445
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,886
Yes, I do. And I'm not gonna
bring him into this,

446
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,650
because he didn't do anything wrong.

447
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,843
- Harvey, I'm not saying...
- Did you hear me?

448
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,885
He doesn't just have
a gun to my head, okay?

449
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,922
He's got one to my brother's.

450
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,326
And how many times
have you told me

451
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,760
that when someone
has a gun to your head,

452
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,850
- you figure a different way out?
- This is Charles Forstman.

453
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,570
- There is no other way out.
- Harvey, there's...

454
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,808
I gave you a job to do.
Now do your goddamn job.

455
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,647
- RACHEL: Well, that was a bust.
- MIKE: We had to try.

456
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,125
Did we? I told you
he'd be pissed off, and he was.

457
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,687
Yeah, and you also told me he needed to
hear things that he didn't want to hear.

458
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,961
Okay, well, now all he heard is,

459
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,844
not only can't he trust me,
he can't trust you either.

460
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,883
That's not what he heard,
and you know it.

461
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,571
What he heard was that you're the
closest person in the world to me,

462
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,968
I am never gonna keep things from you,
and I'm not the only one in his comer.

463
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,048
I'm the closest person
in the world to you.

464
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,482
- Of course you are. How can you even...
- I'm not questioning it.

465
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,887
I'm the closest person
in the world to you

466
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,849
and I wouldn't be
on your family tree.

467
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,521
- You're talking about Woodall.
- Yes, I'm talking about Woodall.

468
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,210
Woodall's married.
We checked his wife. Nothing.

469
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,447
That's the thing.
We're not married.

470
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,369
Okay, I really don't think
this is the time to bring that up.

471
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,086
I'm being serious. We've exhausted
every person that's related to him.

472
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,044
Maybe it's time we found
someone who isn't.

473
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,849
- That's genius.
- Thank you.

474
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,243
Now I really don't understand
why Harvey doesn't respect you.

475
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,642
It's too soon.
It's too soon for that joke.

476
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,162
(SIGHS)
Too soon.

477
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,210
- HARVEY: I can have any one?
- CHARLES: Take your pick.

478
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,204
It doesn't matter,
'cause you're gonna lose.

479
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,284
That's funny.
I look at it like I'm gonna win twice.

480
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,529
I get to drive a badass car,
and I get to kick your ass.

481
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,369
Cocky. I like that.

482
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,090
A guy like you,
I'm surprised you could stand

483
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,089
working for Cameron Dennis
in the first place.

484
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,085
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't like cocky.

485
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,125
Take, for instance,
what's his name, DuPont?

486
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,086
What's he up for? Tax evasion?

487
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,009
- Insider trading.
- Yeah, whatever.

488
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,407
The point is, after what you did
the other day,

489
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,891
why aren't you leading that?

490
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,766
- Because this is Cameron's case.
- If I were him, it'd be yours.

491
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,690
Harvey, you are his star player,

492
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,768
and he's not even
putting you in the game.

493
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,087
And on top of that, he didn't have
the balls to announce

494
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,765
whether he's going
after DuPont or not.

495
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,723
Don't you worry
about Cameron Dennis.

496
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,729
DuPont's gonna get
what's coming to him.

497
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,688
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- What are you talking about?

498
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,689
Well, you're loyal to the guy
you work for. I like that.

499
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,645
So you were just talking shit about him
to see if I'd jump on board?

500
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,887
And you didn't...

501
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,527
Which is why we don't
have to race anymore.

502
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,687
- You're saying I got the job?
- I'm saying welcome to the team.

503
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,042
Well, that's all well and good,
Charles, but we're still racing.

504
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,566
We sure as hell are.

505
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,842
We just have to find
something else to bet on.

506
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,081
- Hey, Sean. Good to see you.
- Don't give me that shit.

507
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,249
Did you confront Eric Woodall
yesterday morning at his supermarket?

508
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,966
I ran into him by accident.
I like the produce there.

509
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,770
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

510
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,451
Did you approach
the subject of an SEC investigation

511
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,046
with the express purpose
of intimidating him?

512
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,801
I approached him with the express
purpose of hiring me as his lawyer.

513
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,928
Why the hell would you do that?
You're supposed to be helping me.

514
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,850
And if he's willing to admit what he did,
that is helping you.

515
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,964
And instead, he's claiming that
I sent you there to intimidate him.

516
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,844
Then I guess
that's the way it's breaking.

517
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,961
What the hell
are you talking about?

518
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,925
He's either gonna buy what I'm selling
or cover his tracks.

519
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,850
And if he covers his tracks,
you need to be there.

520
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,203
- Are you asking me to follow him?
- No, I'm telling you to follow him.

521
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,163
I can't do that.
I don't have authorization.

522
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,089
Didn't stop you following me.

523
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,849
Enough. He's filing charges
of harassment against me.

524
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,564
We do this, nothing sticks.

525
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,803
Then we might not get him
because I have nothing.

526
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,485
Well, let me give you
a little extra motivation.

527
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,489
Remember,
Woodall knows all about

528
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,728
Louis Litt's little
Forstman transgression.

529
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,803
So if he gets exonerated,

530
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,042
who do you think's gonna be
the first person he goes after?

531
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,168
So, instead of going to Jersey
for your produce,

532
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,084
go get me something
I can use.

533
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,004
You're having a drink by yourself?
What's going on?

534
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,771
What's going on is,

535
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,327
I just finished having them
scrape Jeff's name off his door.

536
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,122
So why don't you tell me
why you're here, Harvey?

537
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,164
Cahill's having trouble getting evidence
against Forstman and Woodall.

538
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,361
I'm aware of that.

539
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,801
Then you should also be aware
that if Woodall keeps his job,

540
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,087
he's likely to go after Louis.

541
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,646
I could've done that math,
and so could you, so...

542
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,691
I might be able to
help them get Forstman...

543
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,040
On something else.

544
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,724
Does this have something to do

545
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,922
with when he offered you
that job 12 years ago?

546
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,087
Yes.

547
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,080
I told you that man was trouble.

548
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,091
And I told you I wouldn't abandon
Marcus and you were wrong about him.

549
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,565
So this has something
to do with Marcus.

550
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,926
Yes, it does.

551
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,931
(SIGHS) Well, if you are
asking me to choose

552
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,089
between your brother and Louis,
you know who I'm choosing.

553
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,726
- I'm not asking you to do that.
- Then what are you asking?

554
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,649
I want your help
to get my mind right.

555
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,129
(SIGHS)
Here's the thing, Harvey.

556
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,009
Jeff's gone, and he's gone because
of the choices I made.

557
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,729
So I'm not sure if I can help you
get your mind right,

558
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,921
because right now...

559
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,161
Mine's not right.

560
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,368
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

561
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,201
Hang on a sec.

562
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,001
. HEY-
. HEY-

563
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,725
You didn't come down here
just to give me my start date.

564
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,486
I came down here to tell you
I think you have something special,

565
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,682
and I'd love nothing more
than to have you on my desk,

566
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,962
but I'm leaving the DA's office.

567
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,729
Does this have something to do
with that Forstman guy

568
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,291
buying you a drink
the other night?

569
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,243
I thought you didn't know who he was.
(CHUCKLES)

570
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,327
Well, I looked him up

571
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,408
because I thought
I was gonna be working for you.

572
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,448
- And I'm telling you, he's shady.
- Because he's got a bad reputation?

573
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,444
Oh, I don't care what his reputation is.

574
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,009
You don't know this about me yet,
but I know people,

575
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,884
usually better than
they know themselves.

576
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,844
And the same way
I know you are a good person,

577
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,122
I can tell you that man
is rotten to the core.

578
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,442
You're just trying to get me to stay
so you can work at my desk.

579
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,087
(SCOFFS) Listen to me.

580
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,364
I don't care whether
I work on your desk or not.

581
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,687
You're making a mistake
if you take a job with that man.

582
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,406
Then I guess I'm making a mistake,
because I already did.

583
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,361
It was nice knowing you, Donna.

584
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,641
(SIGHS)

585
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,208
So you're keeping her here after all.

586
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,007
(CHUCKLES)

587
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,281
Yeah, I couldn't throw her off the roof
after you got me to cry.

588
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,561
I'm glad.

589
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,250
Donna, I can't thank you
enough for what you did.

590
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,249
Oh, you're welcome, Louis.

591
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,931
The truth is,
I needed this more than you know.

592
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,361
Well, I get it.

593
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,566
You needed a distraction after
everything you just went through.

594
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,002
- Uh, yeah. Something like that.
- Truth is,

595
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,209
I could use a distraction myself.

596
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,683
Well, there is one thing
that you still need to do.

597
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,407
You need to start thinking
about a new secretary.

598
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,451
Donna, I know
I've asked you this before,

599
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,527
but we're so much closer now
than we were then, and...

600
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,929
Louis, I work for Harvey.
You know I can't be your secretary.

601
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,845
But we have this bond...

602
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,247
You and I.

603
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,441
Shakespeare, The Gun Club.

604
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,404
We've always spoken the same
language, and you know it.

605
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,967
- Louis, I can't.
- I get it.

606
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
We're better as friends.

607
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,446
Hey.

608
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,250
How about I set up
a little farewell for Norma

609
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,648
as my last official act
as your interim secretary?

610
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,170
Thank you, Donna.

611
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,570
Are you sure we've got
the right address?

612
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,841
I'm positive.

613
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,765
Can I help you?

614
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,922
Uh, yes, is there
a Maryanne McGrath here?

615
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,122
- Who can I say is asking?
- We're with Pearson Specter Litt.

616
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,760
We'd like to speak with her
in regards to an ongoing case.

617
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,206
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

618
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,288
You just said she was here.
I don't understand...

619
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,561
Maryanne has advanced Alzheimer's.

620
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,966
- But she's 55.
- It's early onset,

621
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,806
and hers is particularly aggressive.
I'm sorry.

622
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,166
Can I ask how long she's been a patient?

623
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,321
We're not supposed to disclose any...

624
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,920
Please. It's really important.

625
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,684
She was moved here
about a year and a half ago.

626
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,883
- And before that?
- I don't really know,

627
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,129
but I don't think
she was getting the best care.

628
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,287
Thank you.

629
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,128
My mother's 55.

630
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,490
You know, and if she's only here

631
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,284
- because Forstman pays for it...
- I know.

632
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,091
Harvey wants us to find
the person Woodall's close to.

633
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,242
- That's all we can do.
- Well, "All we can do"

634
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,124
is gonna send her back
to some horrible facility.

635
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,969
- We don't exactly know that.
- Yes, we do.

636
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,124
Rachel, it's terrible.

637
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,242
I don't like it any more than you do,
but it's not up to us.

638
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,649
I know. It just sucks.

639
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,769
HARVEY: You goddamn liar.

640
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,005
Oh, don't be mad.

641
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,761
Yeah, Conchita
tells everybody I'm not home.

642
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,565
You know what I'm talking about.

643
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,489
DuPont Investments
dropped through the floor today,

644
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,649
and you sold short based on something
that I told you in confidence.

645
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,368
I don't recall
you telling me anything at all.

646
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,686
You son of a bitch.

647
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,609
You made over
$100 million on that trade.

648
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,844
Yeah, I did. Welcome to
the real world, pal.

649
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,371
My real world doesn't involve

650
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,926
befriending young attorneys
to get inside infonnation.

651
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,606
Maybe you're not the right man
for me, after all.

652
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,165
You think I still
want to work for you after this?

653
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,363
You wanted competition and money.
You got the competition.

654
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,361
Here's your money.

655
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,329
You can shove that
million dollars up your ass,

656
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,728
because I'm not only not taking your job,
I'm gonna prosecute you.

657
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,928
Then you might as well
add your name to the indictment

658
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,084
since you've already
shared in the profits.

659
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,044
- What are you talking about?
- Take a look at this check.

660
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,525
It's not $1 million.

661
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,770
It's $850,000.

662
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,968
Bet you can guess
where the other $150,000 went.

663
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,046
- What did you do?
- You know what I did.

664
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,083
Marcus had nothing
to do with this.

665
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,204
He wouldn't have had you said yes
right away. But you didn't.

666
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,569
- We're giving you the money back.
- You're gonna break his little heart.

667
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,964
He thinks that money
came from you.

668
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,849
And you snatch cash out of an addicted
gamblefs hands, take away his dream,

669
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,042
only one way that story ends.

670
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,810
So you can either pout about it

671
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,690
or you can embrace it

672
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,402
and prove to everyone I was right when
I said I saw something special in you.

673
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,284
Someday the shoe's
gonna be on the other foot, Charles.

674
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,801
Words spoken by
every loser I've ever met.

675
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,001
See you around, pal.

676
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,010
It's Woodall's first wife.

677
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,604
Her name's Maryanne.
They grew up together.

678
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,441
They got married when they were 21
and had it annulled six months later.

679
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,530
- And what's the money for?
- She has Alzheimer's.

680
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,768
Don't tell me.
He moved her to a high-end facility

681
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,280
and pays for round-the-clock care.

682
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,811
And the problem is,
we called the company

683
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,842
that handles the billing, and...

684
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,771
And everything's in cash up front,
probably paid five years in advance.

685
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,248
And Maryanne couldn't tell us
because she doesn't speak.

686
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,450
Which means we don't have any proof.

687
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,125
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go get us some proof.

688
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,642
- You did this?
- Mike and I both did.

689
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,491
- Then why isn't he here?
- You know why.

690
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,965
Because it was more you than him.

691
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,404
You did a good job, Rachel.

692
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,728
Shopping, renting videos.

693
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,280
- You must be going stir-crazy.
- That's all right.

694
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,731
My suspension is about to expire.

695
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,726
HARVEY: Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.
We found Maryanne.

696
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,644
I'm told she's doing well
at the new facility,

697
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,723
you know, the one
Forstman's paying for.

698
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,245
You son of a bitch.

699
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,567
I'm not here to exploit your tragedy, Eric.

700
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,808
- I'm here to tell you it's over.
- Well, if this were over,

701
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,763
you'd be with Sean Cahill right now,

702
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,248
which means you're still
looking for me to cut a deal.

703
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,289
I'm looking for you
to turn on Forstman.

704
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,085
You accost me
for the second time in three days

705
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,804
and throw Maryanne's name around
like a bargaining chip,

706
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,890
and you think I'm gonna help you?
Drop dead.

707
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,850
Eric, please.

708
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,486
The reason I knew to look for someone
that you cared about was that

709
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,965
Forstman did the same thing to me.

710
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,891
He finds your weakness
and presses down

711
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,247
until you don't have the will
to stand up to him.

712
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,370
With you, it was an ex-wife
with Alzheimer's.

713
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,606
With me...

714
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,604
It was a little brother
addicted to gambling.

715
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,521
I don't care.
You don't have proof,

716
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,688
and you're not gonna get it
in the next 24 hours.

717
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,610
You're right, I don't.
But here's the thing.

718
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,402
Cahill may have a deadline, but I don't,
and I don't care how long it takes,

719
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,524
because I'm gonna find that proof
if you don't turn on Forstman.

720
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,166
LOUIS: A lot of you don't know this,
but the truth is, I hated Norma.

721
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,966
I hated her clogs,

722
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,731
her mustache,

723
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,841
her stupid seasonal sweaters.

724
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,881
But the thing I hated most about her
was her favorite story

725
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,801
about how Abe Vigoda
asked her to marry him in 1975.

726
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,844
I mean, we get it.
You were hot.

727
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,123
You turned him down, and it was
the biggest regret of your life.

728
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,643
And like everything you ever said,
I couldn't stand it at the time.

729
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,604
But now that you're gone,
I understand what you meant.

730
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,883
Don't let the moment pass.

731
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,762
Don't let the people you love walk by you

732
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,281
without letting them know
how you feel about them,

733
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,643
because life slips by,
and then it's over.

734
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,047
And I'm not gonna let
another minute pass me by

735
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,322
without letting you know
how much you mean to me.

736
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,124
I love you, Norma.

737
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,369
Thank you, Louis.
That was a lovely ceremony.

738
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,642
- That was beautiful, Louis.
- I couldn't have done it without you.

739
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,922
- Oh, that's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

740
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,051
I couldn't even see how I felt
without you showing me.

741
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,328
And the truth is, Donna, you know me
better than I know myself.

742
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,883
Like I said, Harvey

743
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,766
has no idea
how lucky he is to have you.

744
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,330
I'm gonna turn
from the start line

745
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,091
And then we're leaving,
we 're leaving

746
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,480
'Cause you told me
that the stars are mine

747
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,127
You didn't mean,
didn't mean it

748
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,326
Hey, don't color my heart
Blues and grays

749
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,366
Don't tell me
that I'm not okay

750
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,404
Don't color my heart

751
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,444
'Cause I'll make it through

752
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,244
CHARLES: Looking for the money
I supposedly gave Eric Woodall?

753
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,606
You want to save me the trouble
and just admit what you did?

754
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,843
Now, where would be the fun in that?

755
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,921
Fine. Keep playing your games,
but this time, you're gonna lose.

756
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,370
Why, because you think
you convinced Woodall to give me up?

757
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,890
Yeah, he came to see me.

758
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,604
Said you tried to get him
to turn me in.

759
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,730
What I said was,
you're an arrogant bastard

760
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,729
who's spent his life
manipulating people.

761
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,640
And you're the loser who only cares
about competition. (GRUNTS)

762
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,609
- Not my fault you can't beat me.
- I can this time.

763
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,883
Oh, I don't think so, pal, because...
(INHALES SHARPLY)

764
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,240
He turns on me, I turn on you.

765
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,169
If you're talking about 12 years ago,
let me remind you,

766
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,840
- we were both part of that deal.
- Yes, we were.

767
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,283
All three of us were,
you, me, and your brother.

768
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,727
- You leave my brother out of this.
- Not a chance.

769
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,888
And you don't leave
this Woodall thing alone,

770
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,809
by the time I'm done,

771
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,888
all anybody will know
about 12 years ago

772
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,411
is you gave me a tip

773
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,809
and made sure your little brother
profited from it.

774
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,445
I didn't give you shit.

775
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,491
You tricked me into giving you
inside information

776
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,807
and then blackmailed me
by giving Marcus money

777
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,490
he didn't even know was dirty.

778
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,810
That may be the truth, but they're never
gonna hear it from me.

779
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,811
I'm afraid they just did.

780
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,847
SEAN: Hi, Charles.

781
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,806
- Sean Cahill. Nice to meet you.
- Who the hell are you?

782
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,691
I'm the guy from the SEC
that isn't in your pocket.

783
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,811
- I asked Sean to follow Woodall.
- Couldn't. No authorization.

784
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,844
But I had no problem getting
authorization to follow you.

785
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,169
Which is howl knew
when to turn this on.

786
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,448
You're wearing a goddamn wire?

787
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,768
For someone
whose favorite movie is Wall Street,

788
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,724
- that's got to be pretty embarrassing.
- Son of a bitch.

789
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,207
You may have gotten the better of me
12 years ago, Charles,

790
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,922
but this time, you didn't.

791
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,211
So remember what it feels like,
because I know I will.

792
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,569
Harvey, this isn't over.

793
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,206
Words spoken by
every loser I've ever met.

794
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,050
HARVEY: See you around, pal.

795
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,651
Two for two.

796
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,082
He didn't touch my balls.

797
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,361
DONNA: Black, two sugars,
splash of vanilla.

798
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,045
How do you know
that's how I take my coffee?

799
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,049
The same way
I know you're not taking that job.

800
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,481
You know I'm not taking that job
because I came into work today.

801
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,807
No, Mr. Specter.
I knew you weren't taking that job

802
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,571
the second you walked away
from me the other night.

803
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,523
I told you I know people better than
they know themselves.

804
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,406
Well, what did you do with Tina?

805
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,886
Oh, I had Big Bertha reassign her.

806
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,525
- To who?
- Do you really care?

807
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,160
- Not a bit.
- Good.

808
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,885
Here's the deal.

809
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,489
I will take a bullet for you.
And I don't mean that literally.

810
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,290
But what you do for me is,

811
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,925
when I need something,
you give it to me.

812
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,844
It's not just a one-way street.

813
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,009
Will you also do some
actual secretarial work?

814
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,921
Take a look at what I did
with your calendar there, hotshot.

815
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,725
Holy shit.
When'd you get that done?

816
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,922
Hmm. I told you
I'm not like every other secretary.

817
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,925
I'm Donna.

818
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,485
Then let's get to work.

819
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,650
But for the record,
I don't take vanilla with my coffee.

820
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,121
You will after you taste that.

821
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,727
- Oh, my God, this is awesome.
- When will they learn?

822
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,331
(EXHALES)

823
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,126
Perfect timing.

824
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,966
- And what are we celebrating?
- Our win.

825
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,920
"Our win."

826
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,922
- I like the sound of that.
- Me, too. Where were you?

827
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,682
I'll get into that in a minute.
I want to talk to you for a second.

828
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,887
What is it?

829
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,324
Rachel, you know I told you I loved you
from the second I met you.

830
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,769
- Well, you loved my pencil skirt.
- I loved your face.

831
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,161
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

832
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,961
You're the most amazing woman
I have ever met,

833
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,844
and you're not just beautiful,

834
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,961
but you're sweet
and caring and kind,

835
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,010
- and brilliant, and tenacious.
- Mike, are...

836
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,926
Are you doing
what I think you're doing?

837
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,001
(CHUCKLES)

838
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,003
I called your father today.

839
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,083
And then I went to get
Grammy's ring cleaned.

840
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,731
Oh, my...

841
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,887
I don't want to go 40 years

842
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,401
wondering why I didn't
do this one day sooner.

843
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,561
(SIGHS)

844
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,644
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

845
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,087
I love you...

846
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,970
And I always will.

847
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,447
You're my whole life.
(SIGHS)

848
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,724
Will you marry me?

849
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,729
Yes.

850
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,764
- Yes?
- Yes.

851
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,041
(LAUGHS)

852
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,801
Here.

853
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,731
Oh, my God.

854
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,729
It's beautiful.

855
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,164
She wore it every day
for almost 60 years.

856
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,170
(SOFTLY) So will I.

857
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,922
(BEEPS)

858
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,889
(PHONE LINE RINGING)

859
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,963
- MARCUS: What's up, dickhead?
- What's up, loser?

860
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,721
Hey, Harvey. Good to hear from you.
Whatk going on? Everything okay?

861
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,046
Yeah, everything's okay.

862
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,970
I just haven't talked to you in a while
and wanted to see how you were doing.

863
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,641
<i>I'm great. Katie? good.
The kids are good. Everything3 good.</i>

864
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,207
Great. That's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

865
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,648
You sure there's nothing going on?

866
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,891
Nothing. Like I said, I just haven't talked
to you in a while, and I miss you.

867
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,007
<i>I</i> miss you to o, Harvey,

868
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,929
but unless you got
something else, I've got to go.

869
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,010
- The kids are in the bath.
- Nothing else.

870
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,121
Love you, Harvey.

871
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,491
I love you, too.

872
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,810
(BEEPS)

873
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,401
. HEY-
. HEY-

874
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,762
Listen, I was thinking
about what you said,

875
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,929
about me pitying you.
And I don't.

876
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,042
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

877
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,083
I think you're one
of the most amazing women

878
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,522
- I've ever met, and just because I...
- I'm leaving you, Harvey.

879
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,002
What?

880
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,162
This isn't working for me anymore.

881
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,689
Donna, I know how you're feeling,

882
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,284
but you just went
through something huge,

883
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,845
with being on trial, and, uh...

884
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,969
You need to give it time.

885
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,090
You can't just quit.

886
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,851
I'm not quitting.

887
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,004
I'm going to work for Louis.

888
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,041
Donna.

889
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,126
Donna, please.

890
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,850
I love you, Harvey.

891
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,087
Walk this empty
northern hemisphere wide

892
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:48,083
And the kingdom it came,
well it all fell down

893
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,289
It all fell to dust

894
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,886
Watch it all fly around us

895
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,206
Watch it all fly around us

896
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,604
Oh, while you were sleeping...
