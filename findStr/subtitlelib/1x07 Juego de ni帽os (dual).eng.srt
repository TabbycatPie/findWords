1
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,207
My knee!

2
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:26,331
- Oh, my God, my knee.
- Sorry, I didn't see you. You all right?

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,690
Yeah, I don't know.
Listen, help me up, will you, mister?

4
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,445
- Thanks.
- Come on.

5
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:35,372
- Yeah, yeah, I think it's gonna be okay.
- You sure?

6
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,491
- Yeah, listen, thanks for your help.
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,769
- Chump.
- Chump?

8
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,844
What did he mean by-?

9
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,963
Hey! Hey!

10
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:49,013
He took my wallet.

11
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,926
Yes?

12
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,004
This is your wake-up call, Sullivan.

13
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:06,892
Wake up and dig the bum trip
you're about to take.

14
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,965
Bum trip? Who is this?
Where are you calling from...

15
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:13,523
- ...1968? Who is this?
- Listen, man...

16
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,686
...kill the Lesko story
before the Lesko story kills you.

17
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:22,165
It's me.

18
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,803
Say the word, baby,
and he'll kiss the sky.

19
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:38,008
- Hi there.
- Hey! Hey!

20
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:42,366
Turn on, tune in, drop out.

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,884
And, Lesko, there was one problem.

22
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:58,170
You know the computer disk
with all of Sullivan's notes on it?

23
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,369
Some kid swiped it.

24
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:00,602
1x07 "CHILD'S PLAY"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

25
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,327
They don't know who killed him or why.

26
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:15,202
- Barry, I was hoping that maybe you-
- I'm already on the case, Tina.

27
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:19,048
I'll do whatever I can,
on or off duty.

28
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,245
The Arkham exposé, I remember that.

29
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,007
- He was some writer.
- The best.

30
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,482
But you know,
Phil always hated these awards.

31
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,484
He called them bowling trophies.

32
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,372
It never stopped him
from letting me put them up.

33
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,001
Joan, I'm so sorry.

34
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:41,123
This is a friend from the police
department. Barry, Dr. Joan Sullivan.

35
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:44,091
Hi. Pleased to meet you.
I was a big fan of Phil's work.

36
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:47,802
You and me both.
Will you look at this dress.

37
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,771
It took me an hour
to get the dog hair off.

38
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,242
Joan's a vet, Barry.

39
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,847
Phil always said it'd be impossible
to have children...

40
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:59,449
...because they'd have to compete
with the animal kingdom.

41
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,925
Phil hated me in black.
He said I looked like someone died.

42
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,403
- Oh, Joan.
- What am I gonna do?

43
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:23,122
Hey, Earl. Earl. Come on.

44
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,204
Hey, don't we get enough of that?

45
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:32,171
You just keep wasting my time, Duvivier.
All you give is talk.

46
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,927
Hey. Hey. Will you relax, all right?

47
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:37,653
And, you, if you don't take
that foot off my bumper...

48
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:40,646
...I'm gonna chew it off at the ankle.

49
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,405
Thank you.

50
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,885
Look, we are setting the next
major trend in the drug market here.

51
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,329
I think we know these guys.

52
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:55,088
Come on, I'm gonna make you so rich
it's gonna take you weeks to spend it.

53
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,086
Yeah, that's a swell sales pitch,
but we still ain't seen jack.

54
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,605
You ain't seen jack?
All right, well, meet Jack.

55
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,525
This is Blue Paradise.

56
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:06,651
The clouds of heaven are now
being sold right here on earth.

57
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:10,488
Even for a guy like you though,
the first one's always free.

58
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,203
- Beautiful.
- Good.

59
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,602
You're under arrest. Spread them, pal.

60
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,925
Pal?

61
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,402
Look, we could've been pals, all right.

62
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:29,612
But now, how about I spread you two
all over the sidewalk, huh? Excuse me.

63
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:36,768
Hey, ladies, not on the car, all right?

64
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:52,563
Don't look at me like that.

65
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,324
Tie, please.

66
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,292
What am I doing here?
A guy can't have car trouble anymore?

67
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:35,683
What is this?
What are you booking me on?

68
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,641
How about suspicion of a stolen
necktie, gerbil. Come on. Let's go.

69
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,405
Jerk.

70
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,491
Hey, Barry, I got a deli tray in the back.
You want a sandwich?

71
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,564
- Two.
- Sure.

72
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,486
- Okay, guys, what happened?
- We had a line on Blue Paradise...

73
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,326
...this new designer drug
just hitting the street.

74
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:56,644
The bust went bad.
But the dealer got collared anyway.

75
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,532
- We had a little help.
- From whom?

76
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:01,923
Don't tell Lieutenant Garfield.

77
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,004
The Flash saved our lives.

78
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:08,007
- What, you don't think he's for real?
- Absolutely not.

79
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,812
Hey, maybe you guys
have been undercover too long, huh?

80
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:14,522
- What happened to the Paradise?
- It went down the drain.

81
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:18,163
Now every alligator in the sewer's
grooving to the colors.

82
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:30,127
Sullivan's editor said he was working
on a piece about Blue Paradise.

83
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:33,126
- But there's nothing in his files.
- Maybe someone killed him...

84
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,363
- ...and cleaned out the evidence.
- I don't know.

85
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,922
Only fingerprints on the files
were his own.

86
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:41,005
- I should get back to the lab.
- I got a lunch date with Sabrina.

87
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,812
We're going to some new place
called Eggzadica.

88
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:47,648
- You ever eat a poached ostrich egg?
- I have not. Would not. Will not.

89
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:51,328
Hey, me neither, man. Strictly
turtle-eggs benedict for me, thank you.

90
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,723
- See you back at the ranch, man.
- Right.

91
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,644
Lose your keys?

92
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:14,204
Yeah. I mean, my dad did.
He's always locking them in the car.

93
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,762
- He's a doctor. And he needs his bag...
- Oh, yeah?

94
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:20,323
...because there's a sick baby
across the street in the building.

95
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,849
Sounds serious to me.
Maybe I could help you out.

96
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,732
Wrong car. Help!
Somebody call the cops!

97
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,804
Police!

98
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,889
- Can I tell you something?
- What's that, Murph?

99
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,886
- Bean dip is my world, man.
- Really?

100
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:43,126
- So is lard, cholesterol, salt and cancer.
- This has salt?

101
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:46,251
Book this little hoodlum
for attempted theft, auto.

102
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,167
- Nice collar, Bar. Anybody killed?
- A young delinquent.

103
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,121
- It's truly a shame.
- Let me go, huh? I'm a victim of society.

104
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,443
Keep your eye on this one
while I get an officer...

105
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,490
- ...from juvenile hall.
- You got it.

106
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:01,042
If you can do that
and eat at the same time.

107
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:06,850
All right, young man. Can you say,
"I'm in big trouble"?

108
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,243
What are you doing?
Hey, this is a no-smoking area.

109
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:13,088
Hey, kid, at your size, you can't afford
to stunt your growth. Put that thing out.

110
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:21,007
Last kid that did that's
now called Stumpy.

111
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:23,050
His name is Terry Cohan, age 13.

112
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,410
He ran away from a foster home
in St. Louis nine months ago.

113
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,326
He's got a history of running away,
surviving on petty theft.

114
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:32,087
A kid like that living
on the street for nine months?

115
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,131
- What's the procedure from here?
- Well, if he's drug-free...

116
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,523
...and if his foster parents want him...

117
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,969
...and if we can convince the St. Louis
authorities to pick up the tab...

118
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,725
...he'll be sent back.

119
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:45,930
The paperwork will take a week.
Till then...

120
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:49,290
- ...he'll be locked up.
- Like hell.

121
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:52,809
- Take those cuffs off.
- Yeah, sure. Sorry, I'll get right on it.

122
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:56,886
Carmen, come on. Listen,
I don't wanna put the kid in jail.

123
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:01,171
I just thought a good scare
might help set him straight, that's all.

124
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,046
Stay!

125
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,603
- What else can we do?
- Look, Barry.

126
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:09,243
You can drop the charges, but I'll still
have to take him to juvenile hall.

127
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:12,405
Unless Terry can stay
with a responsible guardian...

128
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,610
...until we can contact
his foster parents.

129
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,047
Say...

130
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:22,649
...you've got one of those nice, big
warehouse apartments, don't you?

131
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,691
- Yeah, it's big.
- And a dog that loves kids.

132
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,525
Yeah, Earl loves kids.

133
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,242
Carmen, wait a minute. Now, you don't
think that I'm the right guy for this.

134
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:35,850
Send me to jail, all right? Just save me
from another bleeding heart.

135
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,451
All right, Terry, come with me.
I'll take you down to the hall.

136
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,365
Hold it.

137
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,042
I guess we could...

138
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,566
...give it a try.

139
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,362
What do you say, Terry?

140
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,450
You got cable?

141
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:58,169
Here's my car over here.
But you know that.

142
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,244
Listen, Barry.

143
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,685
Thanks.

144
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:04,965
You're welcome.

145
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,764
- Hey, isn't that a bank robbery going on?
- A bank robbery?

146
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,163
There's no bank in that...

147
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:52,964
Cory? Hey. Hey, Cory.

148
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,532
Cory?

149
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,328
Cory, come on. Where are you?

150
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:58,687
Cory?

151
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,331
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, I'm...

152
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:05,405
I'm just trying to give you a break, kid.
All right?

153
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,845
So...

154
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,322
...this is some place you got here.

155
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,004
Cory. Hey. Hey. Take-

156
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:19,370
Taught her everything I know. My sister.

157
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,764
Lesko.

158
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,847
Never disturb me when I'm working.

159
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,652
- Never.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

160
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,007
Well...

161
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,767
...is our greasy little pusher
out of jail yet?

162
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:11,164
Duvivier should be free tomorrow.
The pigs lost the evidence.

163
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,882
They'll never make anything stick. Why
do you even keep him around? He's-

164
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:19,683
Duvivier is like a one-celled organism
driven by a single thought:

165
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,651
Greed.

166
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:25,647
He'll put the Paradise on the street
almost as fast as I can make it.

167
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:27,646
But...

168
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:30,725
...how long will I be able to make it...

169
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,727
...with Sullivan's story drifting
about on that disk?

170
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,725
Pepper...

171
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:42,090
...twenty years of life underground...

172
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,293
...have made me a very cautious man.

173
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,445
- If the cops find out I'm still alive-
- I checked around.

174
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:51,411
That kid on the skateboard,
the one that took Sullivan's bag...

175
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,087
...he works Helltown
as a pickpocket and a shoplifter.

176
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:58,212
- Why aren't you searching Helltown?
- Word's out he got pinched by the man.

177
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:02,412
Then in the morning, go down to the
police station and find out where he is.

178
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,803
How am I gonna do that?

179
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:09,287
One of the fabulous properties
of Blue Paradise...

180
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,133
...is the rush.

181
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,205
Pepper...

182
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,084
...do you love me?

183
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:33,971
- When you're nice to me, I do.
- I'll be nice if you get Sullivan's disk.

184
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,923
And kill the kid.

185
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,483
Lesko!

186
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:45,572
Never disturb me when I'm laughing.

187
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:58,364
- Free surprise.
- Hey. Hey, let me see that. All right?

188
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,808
- Hey, mine.
- Look, Cory, this isn't a toy, all right?

189
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,565
Dinner's ready.

190
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,611
- Our secret. All right?
- Okay.

191
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,845
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

192
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,766
- I'd like you to meet a friend, Tina.
- Hi.

193
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,925
- I'd rather eat with Earl.
- Cory!

194
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,163
So, Barry, this your new squeeze, huh?

195
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,769
No, this is not my new squeeze.
She's a good friend, like I told you.

196
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,286
- Come on.
- Hey.

197
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:31,366
Well, that's a relief, okay, because she's
too fine a babe for a dipstick like you.

198
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:35,526
Well, thank you. I think.
You volunteered for this?

199
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,571
- I don't have a mommy.
- That's so sad.

200
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:42,248
Isn't it? I'd feel better
if you gave me $ 100.

201
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,246
Come on, Earl. Earl, come on.
Here's some spaghetti.

202
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,643
Look out! You see why
I didn't clean up the place.

203
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,088
The Mongol hordes
would just wreck it again.

204
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,005
What will you do
when you go to the lab?

205
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:53,606
- Take them with me?
- Barry.

206
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,684
Julio had his three nephews
there once.

207
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,925
They made that stink bomb, and
the station was evacuated for two days.

208
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,926
Good point. Well, I don't know.
What do you suggest, daycare?

209
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,368
- The circus?
- What about Joan?

210
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,569
She's got a lot on her mind,
don't you think?

211
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,327
She loves kids. Maybe having
them around would do her good.

212
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,848
- These two?
- She's a vet.

213
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,130
And your little boy's
been missing for how long?

214
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,004
Two days.

215
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,093
I can't believe he'd run away.

216
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:29,929
We don't have much,
but I try to make a good home for him.

217
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:32,971
Don't worry, we'll find him for you.

218
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,203
They usually don't go far.

219
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,762
I hope you're right.

220
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,166
Listen...

221
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,972
...do you have an aspirin or something?
A glass of water?

222
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,283
Sure. I'll be right back.

223
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,364
Thank you.

224
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:13,442
Earl's a picture of health, but how
did he get spaghetti sauce all over him?

225
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,331
The little monsters.

226
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:19,805
- I understand. They're a real handful.
- Both hands. And the way they eat...

227
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,248
Joan, they're a mouthful too.

228
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,563
You think you're gonna
be able to handle them?

229
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:27,930
Yeah. Like I said on the phone,
I could use the help.

230
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:31,608
And frankly, having someone else
to worry about can't hurt.

231
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:33,411
You forget...

232
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:37,282
...how much time you give
the people in your life.

233
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:41,049
Joan, I hope you don't mind, but I've
gotta ask you a couple of questions.

234
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,363
- Barry.
- It's okay, Tina.

235
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:45,372
What was your husband working on?

236
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,286
We had a rule at home.
Work stays at the office.

237
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:52,492
The only thing I do know is that he had
been bringing home a lot of dead files.

238
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,928
- Stuff from college.
- Were there any notes?

239
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:56,811
An address book, anything like that?

240
00:17:56,973 --> 00:18:01,728
Phil lived out of his file-a-data,
and he had that with him in the car.

241
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,408
Oh, no! Oh, gosh!
Oh, come on! Oh, God!

242
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:08,406
Oh, come on, come on, come on!
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

243
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,690
Let's get out. Come on. Come on, you.
Go. Let's go. Out! Out! Out!

244
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,605
This is not a good idea, young lady!

245
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:17,004
- These are not stuffed animals!
- Hey, you. Ándale. Here you go.

246
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:19,767
As for you, young man,
you are old enough to know better.

247
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,448
- They looked cramped. So sue me.
- That cuts no ice with me!

248
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,969
These are sick animals.
You might have hurt them.

249
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,051
Just for this...

250
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,443
...you're both walking Brutus.

251
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:36,965
Brutus? Which one is Brutus?

252
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,053
Come on, Brutus. Move it, huh?

253
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,812
Summer of love is here again.

254
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,565
Candles?

255
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:51,203
Hey, incense? Peppermint?

256
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,888
- Spare change?
- Get a job, hippie.

257
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,493
I got a job.

258
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,007
Hey, Pepper.

259
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:14,733
This is West.
I found the kid you're looking for.

260
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:22,485
- Hey, Terry, your shoe's untied.
- Very funny. Make me laugh next time.

261
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,168
Hi. Cute dog.

262
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,244
Watch out. He's an attack dog.

263
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,524
Listen. I'm kind of lost.
Do you know the way to the waterfront?

264
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:38,721
- Yeah. Follow the seagulls. Come on.
- Hey. I'll never find it by myself.

265
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,804
How about taking a ride,
showing me the way?

266
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,807
- Are you crazy? Get lost.
- I've got a gun in my purse.

267
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:51,246
- Get in the van.
- Brutus, attack!

268
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:55,205
Get away!

269
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:11,448
Brutus, I like a mouse with an attitude.

270
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,170
- Do it harder, Pepper.
- Wow, you really do have a third eye.

271
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,927
I have more eyes than you can count.

272
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:28,405
A pair of them told me you tried to grab
the kid and got stopped by a schnauzer.

273
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:31,371
Well, hey, the mutt had rabies.
He almost ripped my face off.

274
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,763
- Do I have to send someone else?
- No.

275
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,924
- I thought you could handle this for me.
- I can.

276
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,492
Then what are you going to do?

277
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,653
Well, you know that report
I stole from the station?

278
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,565
It said the kid never went to juvie.

279
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,611
He's in custody of some cop
named Barry Allen.

280
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:49,649
Okay. Find out who he is.

281
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:54,482
Have someone watch the station.
Get a license plate number.

282
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,124
Bribe some DMV slave and get
a home address. Must I do everything?

283
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,688
You're wearing patchouli oil.

284
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:05,242
That's very nostalgic.

285
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,162
A police scientist.

286
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:12,363
I wonder if his civil servant's
brain can grasp...

287
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:16,367
...the elegant complexities
of Blue Paradise.

288
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:20,647
It might just blow his mind.

289
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,161
Barry. Barry.

290
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:33,525
- Thanks, Julio.
- You look beat, man.

291
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:38,369
Cory's on my bed. Terry's on the couch,
I'm on the floor with Earl. He snores.

292
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,525
Well, you're the one who
wanted to play bachelor father.

293
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,285
- The Sullivan murder.
- Yeah.

294
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,284
- Think it was a Mob hit?
- No. No way.

295
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:48,968
Bomb was amateur night. You can pick
up that stuff from any hardware store.

296
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,648
Radicals in the '60s used to build them,
but those guys aren't around anymore.

297
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,486
But Sullivan was on to that
Blue Paradise story. Maybe he...

298
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:58,486
...crossed a drug dealer or two?

299
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,803
I need his notes.
They're in his file-a-data...

300
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,565
...and that went up in the blast.

301
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,247
No, it didn't.
File-a-datas are made out of leather...

302
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,928
...and the only leather we found
at the crime scene were from his shoes.

303
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,009
I've gotta find that notebook.

304
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,967
You were careless, Duvivier.

305
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,886
Don't ever sell my wares
to people you don't know.

306
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:34,011
Come on, Lesko,
the cops had nothing on me.

307
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:38,132
I'd never give your name up, you know
that. They're just part of the equation.

308
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:40,966
I have been at this since before
you were even a bad idea...

309
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,772
...and I've never let the law
be a part of any equation.

310
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:46,322
What am I supposed to do
about the Flash?

311
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:49,530
The Flash?
You sure you're not hallucinating?

312
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:53,527
Hallucinating? Lesko, I don't hallucinate.

313
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:57,083
I think you're confusing me with
one of your brain-dead hippies here.

314
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:01,451
And who dresses you guys anyway?
It ain't the '60s anymore-

315
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:05,129
There was a whole lot less peace
and love back then than you think.

316
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:08,330
Could you watch the car?
I just had it redone.

317
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,885
Thank you.

318
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:16,965
Moe.

319
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,045
Thank you.

320
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:26,090
The idea, Duvivier, is to make people die
if they don't get their Paradise...

321
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,323
...not if they do.

322
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,570
Now go and spread my gospel.

323
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:41,884
I want everyone to share my dreams...

324
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,613
...and my nightmares.

325
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,685
Even with 100 Duviviers,
it's moving too slowly.

326
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:02,368
I need to find a way
to get us the entire city.

327
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:07,364
A population of addicts thanking me
with their bank accounts...

328
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:11,367
...for admitting them to Paradise.

329
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:19,691
Washing cats, shampooing dogs. This
has to be the boring-est day ever spent.

330
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:22,765
- Well, Cory enjoyed it.
- Yeah, she was just being polite.

331
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:26,892
Is that why she asked Joan to let her
close up? You know, went right by me.

332
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:30,170
Listen, since it's just us, why don't
we go out for a pizza. Or four.

333
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,244
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah.

334
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:36,565
You know, you're making a mistake.
You know? I mean...

335
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:40,802
Stick us in a home, we're out of here.
Me and Cory are better on our own.

336
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:44,329
- You think so?
- When did you leave home?

337
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:47,849
- When I was 19, for college.
- You going back?

338
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:51,847
- No, of course not.
- You get my point.

339
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:10,247
- Okay, baby. We're on.
- Wow, yeah!

340
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:31,845
Barry?

341
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:34,364
Hey, Barry, you okay?

342
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:37,487
Barry! Barry!

343
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:39,405
Gotcha, kid!

344
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,685
Barry!

345
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,284
- Barry! Barry!
- Come on!

346
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,646
You can't get away with this!
My dad's a cop!

347
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:39,048
You guys should have worn
your seat belts.

348
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:44,321
- Flash!
- Never accept rides from strangers.

349
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,443
- I'm telling you guys, I saw him.
- Blurry, kind of like a red ghost?

350
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,092
Yeah, that's him.

351
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:57,404
Sure. Why don't you two form a club?
You can join too, Allen.

352
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:00,770
- I never seen him.
- They hire you on a jerk quota, Murphy?

353
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,685
That's two.

354
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:07,165
Hey, Murph, I got some cold drinks over
there. Come on. Thanks for the pizza.

355
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:13,921
Okay, Terry, who are these guys?
Why'd they grab you?

356
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:17,449
How should I know?
You're the one with the rap sheets.

357
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,843
Well, all right, let's take a look.

358
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:25,845
Looks like both these guys
have a lot of narcotics arrests.

359
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:31,364
- You involved with drugs, Terry?
- Hey, come on, I'm not that stupid.

360
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,850
My life is hard enough.

361
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,564
Barry. Those two guys you brought in
are freaking out in lockup.

362
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,803
Stay here, Terry.

363
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,925
Man, they look like hell.
But they don't seem to be-

364
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:50,802
Five seconds ago, they were jumping
around, screaming like apes in a cage.

365
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,009
- No lie.
- Open the cell. Let me check them out.

366
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,733
- Are you sure, Allen?
- I gotta check them out.

367
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,084
Careful, Barry.

368
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,812
Okay.

369
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,405
Barry, look out!

370
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,363
Time to die, friend!

371
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:21,604
I got him! I got him!

372
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,243
Call the paramedics!

373
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:36,166
- This one's dead.
- So is this one. What are they on?

374
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,563
Blue Paradise.

375
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:42,610
Terry, take your sister upstairs.
Get her ready for bed, all right?

376
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:47,051
Good night, Cory. Thank you. You were
great with Mrs. Galuchi's weird dog.

377
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,568
- What a knucklehead.
- No kidding.

378
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,452
See you tomorrow.

379
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:56,205
- Barry?
- Yeah, sweetheart.

380
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:58,933
We don't get to stay here forever?

381
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,689
I'm afraid not, Cory.

382
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:05,613
But listen, maybe we can find you
someplace you can.

383
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:07,491
Yeah, right.

384
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,131
- Joan, listen. Thanks for everything.
- Yeah.

385
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:18,842
If it weren't for you, those kids
would run me into the ground.

386
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:22,926
But I just... I don't know.
They're so hard-boiled.

387
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,812
Were we as cynical at that age?

388
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:30,688
- How are you getting along with...?
- There's nothing yet.

389
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,650
- I'll keep you posted.
- All right.

390
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,485
- Okay?
- I'll see you in the morning...

391
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,484
- ...when you drop the kids off.
- Yeah.

392
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:40,487
And, Barry, thanks again.
It really is great therapy.

393
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,450
- Yeah, shock therapy, huh?
- Bye-bye.

394
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,171
Bye-bye.

395
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:52,851
Well, she's all conked out.
You know, Allen...

396
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:55,368
...you're all out of potato chips
and stuff.

397
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:57,444
I wonder why.

398
00:29:57,853 --> 00:30:00,321
Terry, I've been talking
to the cops down in Helltown...

399
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:04,691
...and it seems they're looking
for a skateboard snatch-and-run artist.

400
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:06,684
Could that be you?

401
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:09,162
- Yeah, well, way past my bedtime, huh?
- Yeah.

402
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:11,167
Come on.

403
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:14,009
All right.
Okay, what do you want me to do?

404
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:16,528
Learn to say,
"Will there be fries with that, please?"

405
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:19,002
Equal opportunity counts for zip
when you're 13.

406
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:21,892
Those kidnappers are dealers.
Didn't snatch you for no reason.

407
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,647
Look, I've seen these crackheads
and these needle freaks.

408
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:27,202
And they all end up
like those two in jail.

409
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:31,249
I've got Cory to take care of.
Who else is gonna protect her, you?

410
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,928
No, I'm just trying to find out who
you've gotten messed up with and why.

411
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:37,812
Now, what have you lifted lately?

412
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,811
- Terry!
- Nothing! A doll, a knapsack.

413
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,282
A knapsack? Okay. From where?
From whom?

414
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,569
Some car in front
of the Daily News building.

415
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,485
The Daily News building?

416
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:51,531
- What kind of car?
- I don't know! It was a red car, okay?

417
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,172
When was this, huh?

418
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,925
- Look, it's important!
- All right!

419
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:57,049
- This was last week?
- Yes, it was last week!

420
00:30:57,213 --> 00:30:59,010
- Just stop grilling me.
- Sullivan's car.

421
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:02,131
- What did you grab? Where is it?
- You're a really dull dog, Allen.

422
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,012
You know that? I mean,
you take us into your house...

423
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:06,731
...you let us trust you.

424
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:09,612
All this social-worker crap
to get me to cop to some boosts!

425
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:13,209
- Man, you are way off base.
- To hell with that and with you! Okay?

426
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:17,048
- Why don't you give me a break?
- Me and Cory got along fine before you.

427
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:20,967
- Nobody wants us. We don't need you.
- I am trying to help you!

428
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:24,492
Look, the only one
in this whole stinking town...

429
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:28,168
...who hasn't been jabbing me
is the Flash.

430
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:31,885
All right.

431
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,530
The Flash!

432
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:56,890
- What are you doing here?
- Keeping an eye on you.

433
00:31:57,053 --> 00:32:00,011
- You've made a lot of enemies.
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.

434
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,733
You definitely saved my bacon
back there.

435
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,724
How do you do it?

436
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:06,804
The speed, I mean.

437
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,130
It just happens.

438
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:11,488
- Do you wanna check it out?
- Are you serious?

439
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:15,843
Just keep your balance.

440
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,444
Awesome!

441
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:39,482
I may be fast, Terry, but there's
some things even I can't run away from.

442
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:43,006
- Like what?
- Like trouble, for one.

443
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:46,370
Word on the street is you'd do almost
anything to protect your sister.

444
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,524
What happens if you end up
in juvenile hall?

445
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,606
- Hey, I'm not gonna get busted.
- Don't kid yourself.

446
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:55,607
Look, I know life's been hard for you.
But you can't do it alone.

447
00:32:58,093 --> 00:33:01,244
Find someone to trust.
Someone who can help you.

448
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:05,443
What you're involved in is bigger
and more dangerous than you know.

449
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,684
All right, man. Listen, I-

450
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,163
I never went through the bag.

451
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:19,565
- All I wanted was the doll for Cory.
- Yes! Here it is.

452
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:25,526
I'll tell you one thing.

453
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:29,049
We're a lot closer now
to figuring this whole mess out.

454
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:40,645
Well, I analyzed the Blue Paradise.

455
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:44,089
It's an extremely powerful
hallucinogen euphoric.

456
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,562
With a healthy load
of amphetamine for a boost.

457
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,769
The smallest amount
could rewire your head.

458
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:52,323
Yeah, I've seen a few rewired
heads lately. Rewired to death.

459
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:53,767
Barry, who's behind all this?

460
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:58,085
I don't know. According to Sullivan, only
person capable is Beauregarde Lesko.

461
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,608
- Lesko? Who's that?
- An outlaw chemist.

462
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,367
Went berserk in San Francisco
in the late '60s.

463
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:07,446
Only problem is
he died 20 years ago.

464
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:12,373
- Joan, listen, thanks for babysitting.
- No problem.

465
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,171
Thank Tina too.

466
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,167
- I think we're on to something. Bye.
- Bye.

467
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:22,765
All they had were mushu fajitas.

468
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,124
- I'll pass.
- You'll pass?

469
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:29,842
Julio, look at this. I accessed the file
from the Central City Library.

470
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:31,651
- Check it out.
- So? This isn't news.

471
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:34,281
Yeah, but this is. FAA report.

472
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:37,126
Plane went down over the Pacific.
No bodies were recovered.

473
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:41,605
Only evidence that Lesko was on that
plane was his signature on the charter.

474
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,409
- What's this?
- The most advanced hallucinogen...

475
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:48,009
...I've ever come across. Fries your brain
before you wanna kick the habit.

476
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,084
Nobody but Lesko
could have synthesized it.

477
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,051
- What are you trying to say?
- I think Lesko faked his death...

478
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:55,522
...went underground.
Now he's back, bigger than ever.

479
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,366
That's what Sullivan discovered,
and it cost him his life.

480
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:02,845
So you're saying Lesko is still alive
and the kid has Sullivan's evidence?

481
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:08,403
Yeah, dispatch. Allen, Crime Lab. You
have a squad car watching my house?

482
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,848
- No, no. Just checking. Thanks.
- Relax. You sent the car hours ago.

483
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:15,573
Nobody is gonna get those kids.

484
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:20,489
- Why can't I go with you?
- Because it's business, Cory, okay?

485
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,042
What kind of business?

486
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:29,643
I'm gonna sell something to a guy,
and with the money he gives me...

487
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:32,202
...it's enough to take care of us
for a long time.

488
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,489
- Does Barry know about this?
- No.

489
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:38,248
No. Barry's all right.
He's a great guy...

490
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:41,849
...but sooner or later, he's gonna have
to put us in a foster home.

491
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:44,090
But with the money I'll get, hey...

492
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:48,405
...we can go wherever we want
and no one's gonna tell us what to do.

493
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:52,486
- That would be great, right?
- I guess.

494
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,645
Okay. Now, listen up.

495
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:57,373
I'm giving one of these to you, all right?

496
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,444
And I'm gonna keep the other one.

497
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:03,606
If I'm not back in a couple of hours,
you give that to Barry.

498
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:07,690
And don't worry, because everything's
gonna be cool from now on.

499
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,165
Okay.

500
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:16,212
Lesko. Lesko, chill out.

501
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:21,003
I've been sitting outside his apartment
all night. I'm tired, I'm hungry and-

502
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:26,282
I know! But there's a cop car
parked right out in front.

503
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,364
What am I gonna do?

504
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:32,929
Wait a minute. Something's going down.

505
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,522
- Okay.
- Where did you come from?

506
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:51,368
I called the false alarm. By the time they
figure that out, we'll be out of here.

507
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,763
Just take me to Lesko.

508
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:58,287
What's the matter? You ever see
a drug-free face before? Step on it.

509
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:07,171
- All right, call if you hear anything, okay?
- Okay. Bye.

510
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,561
Thanks.

511
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,247
Well, I checked the zoo. No luck.
There's an APB out.

512
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:13,563
- Barry, we're so sorry.
- Don't be silly, Joan.

513
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,567
I know what these kids are capable of.
Cory, listen to me.

514
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:20,611
If you know anything at all about this,
you must tell me.

515
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,525
I can't. I promised Terry.

516
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:26,208
But Terry could get hurt.
So we have to help him.

517
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,693
He went to sell something
and get big bucks.

518
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:32,889
- Sell what?
- One of these.

519
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:36,409
- A dragon?
- No, this.

520
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:58,290
Johnny, how you doing?
You look good tonight.

521
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:01,206
Excuse me. Could I speak to you
two ladies for a second?

522
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:05,048
Don't worry. I'll get you in.
I know the owner. We're good friends.

523
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:07,602
I was just wondering if...

524
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:11,761
...you two girls would maybe like
to take a little trip to Paradise?

525
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,248
Get off me, man. You got nothing
on me. I'm clean.

526
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:34,644
You're dirty as the drugs you deal.
Now tell me where Lesko is.

527
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,850
- Lesko? What's Lesko?
- I can take you apart faster than a car.

528
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:40,243
No tools required.

529
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:45,326
All right, it's the old
Fillmore Central, downtown.

530
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,325
Thanks.

531
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:07,769
Well, well, well,
if it isn't our favorite rodent.

532
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,366
Come on, dirt bag, let's go.

533
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:11,809
Look, Mr. Lesko.

534
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:15,170
I've got all your dirt right here
on the disk.

535
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:20,407
- The price I'm asking is cheap.
- A million dollars.

536
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:24,528
Kids. Why not 2 million? Or 5?

537
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:29,005
It doesn't matter. What makes you think
you'll live to spend a nickel?

538
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:34,604
I made a copy. Anything happens to me,
it goes straight to the police.

539
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:38,283
Did anyone ever tell you
how the universe works?

540
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:40,284
It's the duality of life:

541
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:44,002
The yin, the yang.
The Tao, the balance.

542
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:46,768
Now, it's true that you
have something that I want...

543
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:50,687
...but if I dose you with Blue Paradise,
I'll have something that you'll want.

544
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:53,328
You'll be so desperate
for another fix...

545
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,485
...you'll sell your own sister.
And then maybe...

546
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:58,883
...maybe I'll give you more.

547
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:02,887
But not until you give me
the second disk. And I promise you...

548
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:06,285
...you will hand it over gladly.

549
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:08,045
Moe.

550
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,886
Relax, Terry. You're going to have
lots of company.

551
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:22,889
I've filled enough canisters to strap to a
half-dozen choppers I've got standing by.

552
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,486
Imagine...

553
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:29,649
...a shimmering cloud of Paradise
drifting over Central City as she sleeps...

554
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:33,965
...and come tomorrow morning,
we'll have a town full of addicts.

555
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,645
Pepper...

556
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,883
...you may do the honors.

557
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:48,926
- Ready to get turned on, junior?
- Is it okay if I just say no?

558
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,086
What a trip.

559
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,523
What is that?

560
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:02,526
Just a bad flashback, Lesko.

561
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:10,642
Terry, take off!

562
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:17,123
Get up!

563
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,243
Get those canisters together. I want
them on the copters in an hour!

564
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:58,492
- Hey. Hey, Flash, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

565
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:03,205
Lesko hit me with some of that Paradise,
but I think I burned it out of my system.

566
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:05,688
You went through that brick wall
like a ghost.

567
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:09,687
I guess my molecules were vibrating so
quickly I passed right through the wall.

568
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:13,045
Weird.

569
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:30,126
Hey, Lesko! You ready to rock?

570
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:23,773
All right! Yes!

571
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,052
Wish I could change your minds.

572
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:40,807
New York can be a pretty tough town
on your own.

573
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,249
So you want me to drive you
to the bus station?

574
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:50,002
I mean, you got a long ride
to New York as it is.

575
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:53,927
No. I think we'll walk.
Listen, thanks for everything.

576
00:43:54,093 --> 00:43:57,688
- We'll send you a postcard.
- All right. Here you go.

577
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:59,764
Bye, Barry.

578
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,844
So long, sweetheart.

579
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:07,523
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait.

580
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:10,082
Joan came here to see you, all right?

581
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:13,165
Joan, you coming to New York
with me and Terry?

582
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:16,730
I don't think so.
But I might have a better idea.

583
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:19,202
How would the both of you like
to come live with me?

584
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:21,443
That way we could
take care of each other.

585
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:24,207
- You set this up, didn't you?
- Well...

586
00:44:24,653 --> 00:44:26,883
- Come on, Cory, let's get out of here.
- Terry.

587
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:31,126
All right. That's what you want, fine.
All right. I'm going to New York.

588
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,885
Terry, wait a minute.

589
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:37,526
I've known you for a few days, all right?
And I know you're a tough guy.

590
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:41,092
Are you tough enough
to do the right thing?

591
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:46,851
Okay. All right. For Cory.

592
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:49,529
- But only under one condition.
- What?

593
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:52,571
Next person who asks me
to shampoo a cat dies.

594
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:55,202
- Deal.
- All right.

595
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,886
All right.
