34
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,590
I got you a doughnut.

35
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,850
Apparently.

36
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,350
What are you doing today?

37
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,270
My least favorite thing in the world.

38
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,710
Looking for an apartment?

39
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,170
Yeah, I'll be out of here in 48 hours,

40
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,560
for both of our sakes.

41
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,460
What about your old apartment?

42
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,880
Kenny got arrested,

43
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,040
so I don't think he needs it anymore.

44
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,230
I don't think being neighbors is such a great idea.

45
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,370
We had a fight.

46
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,500
I bought you a doughnut.

47
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,040
A really big fight about some really big issues

48
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,850
that aren't gonna go away because you got me a doughnut.

49
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,130
Remember that Usher-themed party I had?

50
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,910
I remember searching the entire house for a TYLENOL.

51
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,720
Is it too late to apologize for that?

52
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,690
No. Never.

53
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,540
I miss you, Daddy.

54
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,960
Who are you talking to?

55
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm talking to...

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,190
To the chair?

57
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,200
If you can't fall asleep on your own,

58
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,300
you can have that Ambien you've been asking for.

59
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,650
You sleep, I go away.

60
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,660
I don't need an Ambien.

61
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,130
Okay.

62
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,870
I'll be keeping an eye on you, Dr. Glassman.

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,750
Trying to hop a fence, Mac?

64
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,310
I wanna go home.

65
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,280
We will, sweetie, as soon as we fix you up.

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,290
Mac has Fragile X Syndrome.

67
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,560
A genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability,

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,550
behavioral issues, and hyperactivity.

69
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,730
The good news is that the picket hasn't compromised

70
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,210
any vital organs, major nerves, or arteries.

71
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,290
The bad news is that it splintered inside his shoulder.

72
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,010
Oh, let's get this stick out of you, Mac.

73
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,390
- Will it hurt? - Not a bit.

74
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,920
You're gonna sleep through the whole thing.

75
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,520
Third time's the charm, right, Shaun?

76
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,770
Her name's Bill...

77
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,610
short for "Sybil."

78
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,240
She likes things nice and simple.

79
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,870
Possible internal bleeding, heel bone calcaneus fractures,

80
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,280
tibial pilon fractures, and cervical fractures.

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
Her name's Kitty Kwon.

82
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,380
Hey, Kitty. You know where you are?

83
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,130
Unfortunately, yeah.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,620
I was 150 feet from the summit.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040
Would've been the first female free solo.

86
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,280
Free solo?

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,190
Climbing without ropes.

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,720
Let's tidy up these bleeders, irrigate the wound,

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
and close him up.

90
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,130
How do you find a new friend?

91
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,880
Lea is very mad at me.

92
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,560
Well, whatever you did to her, apologize.

93
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,670
I did. I said, "I'm sorry."

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,550
It may take even more than that.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,330
Make a statement. Go big.

96
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,780
An apology's an apology.

97
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,140
If she doesn't accept it, just walk away.

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,980
And there we have the entire spectrum of male response...

99
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,840
dazzle them or dump them.

100
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,050
Just be nice to her, Dr. Murphy.

101
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,920
I don't like you looking like this.

102
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,830
I want you in a suit

103
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,560
with one of my famous ties.

104
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,800
I had more ties than birthdays.

105
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,220
How did that happen?

106
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,910
- You know what's funny? - What?

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,300
I only have great memories of you.

108
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,580
What about all those other memories?

109
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,140
Why can't I remember them?

110
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,070
Good memories are like a beautiful song.

111
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,460
You don't want them to ever end.

112
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,630
I don't think that's all we should talk about.

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,230
You're looking awfully sleepy.

114
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,840
Our clock is ticking. We need to get to the good stuff.

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,960
You know, Dad, the real reason I'm here.

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,410
The surgery went very well.

117
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,770
We got every bit of picket, and Mac is recovering nicely.

118
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,440
- Oh, thank you. - He should be able to go home today.

119
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,520
This is all good news, Nicole.

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,340
I know. I know. I was -- I was just...

121
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,610
I was hoping to have one night without him.

122
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,570
Katherine!

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,980
- Mom. Dad. - Thank God you're alive.

124
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,470
Thank you.

125
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,310
Unfortunately,

126
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,600
there's still a serious issue we have to deal with.

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,460
Kitty has cervical fractures.

128
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,050
She broke her neck.

129
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,940
Luckily, we can repair it by fusing her spine.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,470
Your range of motion will be restricted,

131
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,650
but when everything else heals,

132
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,150
you should be walking within three months.

133
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,170
Will I be able to climb again?

134
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,330
Not at that level, and certainly not free solo.

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
They should've just left me on that mountain to die.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,090
Then I think you'll prefer the second option...

137
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,670
The Odontoid Screw Procedure.

138
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,830
It doesn't involve vertebral fusion

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,140
and could maintain your full range of motion.

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,800
Seriously? Sign me up!

141
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,950
The spinal fusion surgery is generally preferred

142
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,530
because it has higher healing rates

143
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,730
and more favorable long-term results.

144
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,470
But the screw procedure's less invasive,

145
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,030
so there's reduced collateral injury

146
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,690
and no permanent damage.

147
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,160
Would she be able to climb again?

148
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,750
Free solo? Everything?

149
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,010
Eventually, yes.

150
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,210
Can I say yes now?

151
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,170
Yes!

152
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,440
No.

153
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,570
If you give her this operation, you'll be killing her.

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
You can get help.

155
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,230
You mean IEPs, speech therapy,

156
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,390
or a behavioral mod?

157
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,740
Have you considered a residential facility, a group home?

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,380
Give him away? To strangers?

159
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,800
To professionals who can help him.

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,280
He was abandoned by his father.

161
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,010
I'm all that he has left.

162
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,810
God, he was such a beautiful baby.

163
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,010
And he was perfectly normal, walking, talking...

164
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,470
but just after he turned two,

165
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,600
we noticed a change.

166
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,110
He started to lose his words. He was going backwards.

167
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,980
When we got the test results,

168
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,100
everything we'd hoped for our perfect, little boy was...

169
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,500
was gone.

170
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,380
By the time he was nine, he was too much for my husband.

171
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,880
And that was before his growth spurt

172
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,200
and before his mood swings became...

173
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,260
I don't want to give him up. I... I just...

174
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,690
I just wanted a break for one lousy night.

175
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,550
Nobody blames you for that, Nicole.

176
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,680
And you don't have to send your son anywhere.

177
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm sure that'd be devastating for a kid like Mac.

178
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,980
I don't go to church, I swear,

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,330
and I have sex with strange men.

180
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,590
Your room's on the left.

181
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,100
Yes, it would.

182
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,310
Then he'd get used to it.

183
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,860
It started with a broken arm and a concussion.

184
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,560
The next time, it was a shattered femur and a ruptured spleen,

185
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
then a broken pelvis,

186
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,720
then a skull fracture

187
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,850
that put her into a coma for three days.

188
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,700
She needs this crazy...fix.

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm not an adrenaline junkie!

190
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,930
Okay, when I climb, adrenaline is the enemy.

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,940
I need to be calm, relaxed, and focused, or this happens.

192
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,300
You've always wanted me to believe I can do anything I want.

193
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,710
Each time that I summit, every roadblock in my life melts away.

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,130
It's what I live for.

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,100
We... we just want you to keep living.

196
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,550
And I will, Dad,

197
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,560
but I can think of worse things than dying doing what I love.

198
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,420
Mr. and Mrs. Kwon, I understand how you're feeling,

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,310
but your daughter's 18.

200
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,660
It's her decision.

201
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,250
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.

202
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,520
I'd like to proceed with your surgery.

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,580
Remember you telling me when you grew up,

204
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,740
you wanted to be a nurse... A "Male nurse"?

205
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,440
- You're deflecting. - Yes, I am.

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,170
I'm deflecting. I am...deflecting.

207
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,020
What is the point, Maddie?

208
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,130
Let's get to this, Daddy. What do you say?

209
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,570
- Who are you talking to? - Shaun, what are you doing?

210
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,500
You don't sneak up on me like that.

211
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,290
You may be experiencing delirium

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,980
with possible auditory and/or visual hallucinations.

213
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,420
- I'm fine. - It may be a symptom of severe post-operative...

214
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,990
Shaun, Shaun, I'm fine.

215
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,210
I'm just... I'm really... I'm just really tired.

216
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm...

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,910
I'm remembering.

218
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,640
Lying to your little buddy.

220
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,250
I thought you two were Gilligan's Island- tight.

221
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm just remembering.

222
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,540
Okay.

223
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,260
Lea said I was a total jerk and a jackass,

224
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,810
even though all I did was tell her the truth,

225
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,250
and then I did everything right,

226
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,790
but she still got mad at me again.

227
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,130
I thought this was Maddie time.

228
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,290
I asked for advice,

229
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,230
and Dr. Park told me to go big

230
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,440
and Dr. Melendez told me to walk away

231
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,070
and JL the anesthesiologist,

232
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,720
she told me to be nice, but I don't know which...

233
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,570
Shaun, Shaun, Shaun, I just... I'm not

234
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,900
in the best wisdom mode at the moment. Okay?

235
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,310
I'll tell Dr. Dulay you may be experiencing psychosis.

236
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,990
I'm not psychotic, Shaun.

237
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,230
There's no need to bother her.

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,990
It won't bother her. It's her job.

239
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,690
- Shaun, stop! - He won't listen to you, Daddy.

240
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,000
- He never does! - Maddie, please! Will you please!

241
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm having a vision.

242
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,690
Just a vision.

243
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,850
Maybe it's the drugs. I don't know.

244
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,060
You're talking to Maddie.

245
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,030
Shaun, can you keep this between us?

246
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,770
Please? Just for a little while.

247
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,520
Okay.

248
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,230
We both know he can't keep a secret worth a damn.

249
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,150
We'd better get to it.

250
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,180
I don't want to get to it.

251
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,750
I want to talk about the rest of it.

252
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,860
I want to talk about the...the...

253
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,680
the Usher parties and the ties.

254
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,650
Why can't we talk about your track meets?

255
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,470
Because we're past that, Daddy.

256
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,470
We need to talk about why you're talking to a ghost,

257
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,490
why I'm not sitting here for real, holding my father's hand.

258
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,060
Good dreams, please. Good dreams.

259
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,390
You want good dreams?

260
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,550
Go ahead. Take your pill.

261
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,170
This has got to happen, Daddy. You know it.

262
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,530
What if they're right? What if we are, in effect,

263
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
killing their daughter by giving her the surgery she wants?

264
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,300
These are not issues doctors should think about.

265
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,570
That's what we tell ourselves

266
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,970
because it makes it easier for us to just do our job

267
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,680
and not worry about whether we're helping or hurting.

268
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,810
For all we know, on her next climb,

269
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,800
she may meet her soul mate.

270
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,450
If, on the other hand,

271
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,520
you're not God and, like the rest of us,

272
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,660
you have no idea what will happen to her,

273
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,350
then you should back off.

274
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,630
Focus on the medical issues,

275
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,380
because as long as Kitty's a competent adult,

276
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,680
it's all moot.

277
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,620
This is the two-bedroom.

278
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,660
The one-bedroom went about an hour ago.

279
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,940
Oh, no. I wanted the one.

280
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,620
Sorry. This has a much bigger living room and a much better view.

281
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,120
And a much bigger price.

282
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,340
Oh, I didn't know it had a fireplace!

283
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,810
Damn it, Willow, I just fell in love with this place,

284
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,630
which is just cruel, since I definitely can't afford it.

285
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,320
You fall in love very quickly.

286
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,590
Shaun?

287
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,590
I found a cheaper apartment

288
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,970
with comparable amenities.

289
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,530
I wrote down the address.

290
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,710
What are you doing here?

291
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,390
You said you hated apartment hunting,

292
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,520
so I decided to help you.

293
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,410
That's being nice.

294
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,230
And don't forget about the doughnut.

295
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,150
That isn't being nice. It's being creepy.

296
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,400
- Did you follow me here? - No.

297
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,760
I saw the rental address

298
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,180
highlighted on your tablet this morning.

299
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,470
That is creepy, too.

300
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,800
You know, I didn't ask for your help, Shaun.

301
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,070
I do not need your help, and I don't want your help.

302
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,000
Katherine, if you won't reconsider this surgery...

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
- I won't... - then we have to consider other options.

304
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,910
The decision is yours,

305
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,730
unless we have you declared mentally incompetent.

306
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,520
You're saying that I might be crazy?

307
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,520
You were in Vienna for my Sweet 16.

308
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,870
I was the keynote speaker.

309
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,060
And that birthday card signed by your secretary.

310
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,260
What's the point, Maddie?

311
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,450
All the committees and councils and boards,

312
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,340
evenings, weekends, holidays...

313
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,270
- I was working my ass off. - That's just an excuse.

314
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,500
You were avoiding me.

315
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,770
Oh, I was avoiding you?

316
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,100
When I was home, you paid no attention to me

317
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,890
or anything I had to say.

318
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,290
I heard you've been experiencing some delirium...

319
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,310
...possibly hallucinations.

320
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,220
Shaun.

321
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,430
I kept our secret

322
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,030
for 30 minutes.

323
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,140
He betrayed you. He's not a friend.

324
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,880
It could just be ICU psychosis

325
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,140
brought on by lack of sleep, but, as you know,

326
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,020
or would know, if you weren't psychotic,

327
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,210
it could be a lot worse.

328
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,140
It could be an indicator of surgical complications,

329
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,000
like infection or cerebral ischemia.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,130
I'm not psychotic. I'm just tired.

331
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,730
Oh, my God.

332
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,720
Either take the pill or I'm gonna knock you out.

333
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,390
All right. Nighty-night.

334
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,560
How sweet.

335
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,610
You're willing to risk your life to finish our little story.

336
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,290
This is ridiculous!

337
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,600
Why do you say that, Kitty?

338
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,780
This is about two overbearing parents who just can't let go.

339
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,340
She wants to kill herself.

340
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,770
I fell off that mountain. I didn't jump.

341
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,300
You said you'd be happy to die

342
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,690
as long as you were climbing.

343
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,090
Mom, what I meant is, people take risks all the time,

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
risks that reduce their lifespan,

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,900
every time they get into a car or they smoke a cigarette.

346
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,630
We're all doing the same thing,

347
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,720
just calculating our chances and hoping we defy the odds.

348
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
What about when you took the sleeping pills?

349
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,250
It was four years ago, after I'd been dumped on Twitter.

350
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,530
And I'd called my parents as soon as I had done it.

351
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,260
It was hardly a suicide attempt.

352
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,110
You spent the night in the ER.

353
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,880
They said you nearly died.

354
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
Ugh. I'm such an idiot.

355
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,580
I... I... I thought the window was open.

356
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,920
That's what I get for keeping them so clean.

357
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,810
Possible nerve, vessel, and ligament injury,

358
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,180
and she's lost a lot of blood.

359
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,710
Let's get her into an OR now.

360
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,250
Mom! No!

361
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,660
I'll stay with him.

362
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,430
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

363
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,130
Ask Deezer.

364
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,710
Mom, where are you going?

365
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,700
No!

366
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,520
No!

367
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,640
2 milligrams lorazepam.

368
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
And some ice.

370
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,200
Kitty believes the surgery her parents want

371
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,260
will make her an invalid.

372
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,320
That's not true.

373
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,630
She won't be able to be a top athlete,

374
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,900
but the impairment will be minor.

375
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,880
She'll be able to enjoy an active and safe lifestyle.

376
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,970
That minor impairment could be as much

377
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,610
as a 50% restriction of head rotation

378
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,980
and a reduction in flexion extension.

379
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,130
That's worst-case scenario.

380
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,820
It's a permanent disability.

381
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,650
All kids make bad choices.

382
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,600
Kitty's may be worse than most,

383
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,640
but are we really gonna hobble an adult woman?

384
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,710
Adult? She's 18.

385
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,710
It's the definition.

386
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,230
And two months ago, she was 17 and a helpless child?

387
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,570
I mean, she's obviously just as immature

388
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,680
and unreasonable as ever.

389
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,580
This is about your mother, isn't it?

390
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,710
If you could've controlled her,

391
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,510
you would've prevented a lot of pain to herself and others.

392
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,890
Thank you. I think I have enough to make my decision.

393
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,170
I'm sorry

394
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,500
that I hit you.

395
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,800
When you get scared,

396
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,630
do you think about something that helps you?

397
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,750
Deezer.

398
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,890
Do you?

399
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,830
Think about something?

400
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,010
School change their dress code?

401
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,190
I'm not going to school.

402
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,080
Mr. Decker's still substituting.

403
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,320
I know Ken.

404
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
Dated him in high school.

405
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,230
He's a real horse's ass.

406
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,570
Tough titmouse. Get dressed.

407
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,990
Tough titmouse.

408
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,380
I see a vibrant, engaged young woman.

409
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,870
But I also see a reckless disregard for your life.

410
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,770
And it's not clear to me if that's a pathological state

411
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,200
or simply a product of youth.

412
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,730
But either way,

413
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,670
I have to err on the side of the preservation of that life.

414
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,650
No.

415
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm sorry, Kitty.

416
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,280
No.

417
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,320
Oh, my God.

418
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,670
Nothing I ever did was enough.

419
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,020
When I was home, you were out

420
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,890
or you were high, or both.

421
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,190
You don't remember that, do you?

422
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,190
You've always found lots of time for Shaun.

423
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,230
Oh, stop. Shaun has special needs.

424
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,820
- He had no one else. - I had needs.

425
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,490
I was lost and confused. I needed my father!

426
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,570
Now? Now you tell me? Now?

427
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,570
When it... when it mattered,

428
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,410
when it might've made a... a difference,

429
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,700
you... you turned me away every time,

430
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,330
screaming, "You don't know me!"

431
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,830
- You don't! - I know.

432
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,110
I know!

433
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,880
I have no idea who you are!

434
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,250
I have no idea what you wanted,

435
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,590
what you wanted from me!

436
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,670
- I wanted you to be there! - I was there!

437
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,340
Not enough, obviously. Otherwise...

438
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,200
Otherwise?

439
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,210
Otherwise...

440
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,960
Otherwise...

441
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,880
You were such a happy little girl.

442
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,440
We were best friends.

443
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,840
I... I don't get it.

444
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,470
What happened?

445
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,950
What made you so unhappy?

446
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,020
You did.

447
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,540
My only sin was growing up.

448
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,000
When I couldn't be your little pinafore princess anymore,

449
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,540
you wanted nothing to do with me.

450
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,570
That's not true.

451
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,740
I loved you, and I still love you.

452
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,740
I hate you.

453
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,910
And I died hating you.

454
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,310
Think I'm gonna let you off that easy?

455
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,530
The night.

456
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,410
Let's talk about that.

457
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,750
Tequila... Stat.

458
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,720
I went big.

459
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,350
♪ Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown ♪

460
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,850
♪ I set out to get you with a fine-tooth... ♪

461
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,400
Karaoke?

462
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,700
Hershey meant everything to me, Shaun.

463
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,280
I took the biggest chance of my life going back there.

464
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,790
And then it just...

465
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,330
then it just went away.

466
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,380
But I knew I could come back here

467
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,400
to get the support of my friend,

468
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,400
who was so different because he was so open

469
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,060
and nice and honest.

470
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,190
But you gave me nothing.

471
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,860
You... you never even asked me once,

472
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,240
"What happened in Hershey?"

473
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,200
You just...

474
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,830
you just didn't care.

475
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,990
It went very well.

476
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,130
We should've given all of the sensation back in your hand,

477
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,240
but we do need to monitor your motor strength and perfusion.

478
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,150
Okay.

479
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,480
We know Mac caused your injury.

480
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,360
No, I told you... I... I cut it on a window.

481
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,700
No, Mac has never hurt anyone.

482
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,930
What were you doing to him?

483
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,000
Trying to help him.

484
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,810
You need to find a place for Mac.

485
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,170
That is not our call.

486
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,790
You're overwhelmed, Nicole.

487
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,840
There's no shame in admitting you need help to get Mac help.

488
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,930
He'll hate me.

489
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,360
You got to move out.

490
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,320
Soon as they find someone who'll take you.

491
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,120
Okay, stop.

492
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,080
Not everything is about you.

493
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,470
Doctors say I'm dying,

494
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,420
and there's nothing they can do about it.

495
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,550
Tough titmouse.

496
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,650
He won't hate you.

497
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,730
He'll just be very scared.

498
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,170
You have been given an enormous challenge

499
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,910
that a lot of people couldn't handle.

500
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,240
I know you'll find the strength to keep going.

501
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,370
I will.

502
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,710
Thank you.

503
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,840
Five years from now...

504
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,520
I want you to tell my parents something.

505
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,690
Tell them I never want to see them again.

506
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
Dr. Melendez, I know a kid who had a lot of issues,

507
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,670
got into a lot of trouble, fights, mainly with his dad.

508
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,030
And when I met his dad, I understood.

509
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,200
He was a real piece of work.

510
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
So, I stepped up, found the kid a place to live,

511
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,210
got him a pretty decent job.

512
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,130
But he was already too...broken.

513
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,350
He needed a lot more than a friendly cop.

514
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,880
He needed a doctor.

515
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,880
The next guy he got in a fight with had a gun.

516
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,680
Nicole trusts you.

517
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,600
And that's why you have to give her permission to let go.

518
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,720
How are we supposed to give advice

519
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,330
without dragging our baggage into it?

520
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,670
Maybe our baggage informs our advice,

521
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,090
gives us perspective,

522
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
maybe even wisdom.

523
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,810
Maybe you're confusing baggage with experience.

524
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,060
What's the difference?

525
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,810
If I knew, I wouldn't be up here.

526
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,170
Mom was out of town.

527
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,790
I can't take any more of this.

528
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,500
You caught me high for the umpteenth time.

529
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,000
Maddie, why are you doing this?

530
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,410
The night I'd broke another promise,

531
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,630
and you decided to quit the bargaining

532
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,250
and the threats and take action.

533
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,670
So you dragged me outside and locked the door.

534
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,130
I prayed you would come and find me.

535
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,260
Why didn't you come and find me?

536
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,850
I thought that

537
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,640
you would go to Jessica's.

538
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,000
I thought you'd go to Aunt Becky's.

539
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,460
If I had any idea...

540
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,670
Oh, if you thought I'd die that night,

541
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,780
you would've let me back in? Good to know.

542
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,030
How could you do that?

543
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,550
Why would anyone do that?

544
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,280
I don't get it!

545
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,040
How dare you do that!

546
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,040
Maddie, look at me!

547
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,350
I died that day, Maddie.

548
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,590
I died that day, too.

549
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,520
I don't get it! I don't get it!

550
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,340
I don't get it!!

551
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,890
I... I... I...

552
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,440
- Is there a problem? - No.

553
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,820
I just wanted to talk to you before we started the surgery.

554
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,070
Kitty doesn't want you here when she wakes up.

555
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,820
She'll change her mind.

556
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,700
With time, she will change her mind.

557
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,460
I have somebody in my life who's self-destructive,

558
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,830
and there have been times

559
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,420
when I could've forced her into treatment, and...

560
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm sure it would've helped...

561
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,510
for a while.

562
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,090
But...

563
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,430
I think I have been pushing you because

564
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,020
I sometimes think I made the wrong choice.

565
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,860
But she would've hated me.

566
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,780
And I would've lost her.

567
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,880
You're trying to save your daughter,

568
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,950
but I think you're gonna lose her.

569
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,700
Forever.

570
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,210
If we do this, she will grow and learn.

571
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,590
And when she walks down the aisle with her loving husband,

572
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,430
and when she holds her baby in her arms for the first time,

573
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,940
we may not be there,

574
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,020
but those are the gifts we're giving her.

575
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,150
And it's enough.

576
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,320
It will have to be enough.

577
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,800
Maddie, please.

578
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,010
Maddie... Maddie, look... look at me.

579
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,800
Maddie, don't...

580
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,600
- Maddie! - 2 milligrams haldol.

581
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,520
No... no, don't... No, I... I can't let...

582
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,100
I... I can't have her leave me like this.

583
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,360
Maddie.

584
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,980
Please don't leave me like this, Maddie.

585
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,110
I should've held on to you. I sh...

586
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,880
I sh... I should've...

587
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,510
I should've held on to you

588
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,800
until... un... until you talked to me.

589
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,120
I should've held on.

590
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,870
I...

591
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,370
Your mother

592
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,670
wanted to send you to rehab.

593
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,650
And I said no.

594
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,210
I... I said "No".

595
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,380
I can fix it!

596
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,260
"She's my little girl! She'll listen to me!"

597
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,470
I wanted to be the hero.

598
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,660
I wanted to earn you back.

599
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,100
I wanted you to love me again,

600
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,230
like you did once upon a time.

601
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,280
It was stupid.

602
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,860
And I... I don't know what to say,

603
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,030
except I'm sorry.

604
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,960
I... I'm sorry.

605
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

606
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,600
I know you loved me, Daddy.

607
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,900
I loved you, too.

608
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,650
If you send Mac away,

609
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,570
there will be people who think you let him down,

610
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,490
question your love for him.

611
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,950
They'll say you gave up on him as a parent

612
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,530
and took the easy way out.

613
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,290
They may even hate you for it.

614
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,840
But those people,

615
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,210
they don't understand.

616
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,590
I didn't.

617
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,160
Giving him up will be the hardest thing

618
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,850
that you will ever have to do.

619
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,960
But maybe you need to do it

620
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,440
because of your love for him.

621
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,010
The surgery went well.

622
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,680
As long as you stick to the program,

623
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,140
you'll be walking within eight to twelve weeks.

624
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,470
Or less.

625
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,060
Great.

626
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,120
You know, your parents did this

627
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,690
because they love you, Kitty, so much.

628
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,280
I know.

629
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,750
Mom, I'm sorry!

630
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,840
No, Mom!

631
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,520
No! Shut up! Stop it!

632
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,250
You gather up all your crap?

633
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,330
Yes. I checked three times.

634
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,150
Good, 'cause anything you leave,

635
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,790
I'm chucking.

636
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,470
I'm scared.

637
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,060
Tough titmouse.

638
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm not a hallucination.

639
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,360
You've been asleep for 13 hours.

640
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,530
Was seeing Maddie therapeutic?

641
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,500
She said she loved me.

642
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,340
That's very good.

643
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,300
Or maybe it was just me telling myself that.

644
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,550
You always tell the truth.

645
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,770
Thank you, Shaun.

646
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,160
Hey, kid.

647
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,170
Neil!

648
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,040
Mi amorcita.

649
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,840
I almost did my puzzle.

650
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,930
I can see that.

651
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,570
That's a great job, Gabi.

652
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,560
Mom and Dad gave it to me for my birthday.

653
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,390
Yeah. I... I remember.

654
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,730
Are Mom and Dad coming for me today?

655
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,110
Oh, mama.

656
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,940
No.

657
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,110
No, no, they can't.

658
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,240
Gabi, we love you,

659
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,160
but you have way more fun here than at their place.

660
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,210
I think I see a piece of the cow.

661
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,740
Thank you for letting me crash.

662
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,290
Yes.

663
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,960
You

664
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,840
rented an apartment?

665
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,340
No.

666
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,010
I'm gonna get an Airbnb.

667
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,680
All right.

668
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,100
What happened in Hershey?

669
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,900
Do you care?

670
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,700
I tried to...be nice,

671
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,410
and I tried to go big,

672
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:49,810
and I don't want to walk away,

673
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,500
and everyone likes doughnuts.

674
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,090
And I don't know how to answer that.

675
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,340
Just be honest.

676
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,020
I...

677
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,530
don't care what happened in Hershey.

678
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,410
But I care that you care.

679
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,750
You want to try that song again?

680
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,260
Oh, yes!

681
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,970
Then, okay.

682
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,430
