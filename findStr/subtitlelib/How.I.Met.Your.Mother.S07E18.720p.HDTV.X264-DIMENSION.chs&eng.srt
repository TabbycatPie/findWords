00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,270
<i>孩子们  2012年伊始有点混乱</i>

<i>巴尼遇见了一个叫昆茵的女孩</i>

12
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,280
<i>凯文收回对罗宾的求婚</i>

<i>我告诉罗宾</i>

00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,870
我爱你  罗宾
I love you, Robin.

<i>马修告诉罗宾</i>
<i>Marshall told Robin...</i>

19
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,050
你还是搬出去吧You got to move out.

20
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,110
<i>罗宾照办了</i>
<i>And Robin did.</i>

21
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,770
我现在甚至不敢去开她卧室的门
I can't even open her bedroom door anymore.

22
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,590
我干嘛这么多愁善感
Why do I have to be so sensitive?

23
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,470
我不知道  兄弟
I don't know, bro.

24
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,220
看看我和那个叫昆茵的小妞
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

25
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,240
我就从来不会念叨着说
You don't hear me prattling on

26
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,880
她的笑容有多迷人
about how beautiful her smile is,

27
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,820
她的长发有多像蜜糖色的绸缎般顺滑
how her hair is like a waterfall of honey-colored silk,

28
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,910
她的双眼有多像被旭日的光芒
how her eyes are like a warm South Sea

29
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,250
亲吻着和煦的南海
kissed by the fire and gold of sunrise.

30
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,000
我连她长什么样都不记得了
I don't even remember what she looks like.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,590
哥们  显然你喜欢她
Dude, you obviously like her.

32
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,080
你不能从字里行间听出来吗  泰德
Can't you read between the lines, Ted?

33
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,360
显然我喜欢她
I obviously like her.

34
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,600
这种事怎么会发生在我身上
How did this happen to me?

35
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,940
我什么时候变得又娘又痴情了
When did I become such a gooey romantic?

36
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,920
我觉得这样挺好的
Look, I think it's healthy

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,050
你对一个女人产生真感情
that you have real feelings for a woman

38
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,480
而不是只当成她当成玩物
instead of just seeing her as an object.

39
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,480
换吗
Switch?

40
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,520
当然
Sure.

41
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,420
但是为什么是昆茵呢
But why Quinn?

42
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,750
我是说  你和她过了一晚
I mean, you spent one night with her,

43
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,640
她还有点刻薄
and she was kind of mean.

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,370
我们就是心有灵犀
We just connected.

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,660
无论感情上  理智上  精神上
Emotionally, intellectually, spiritually.

46
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,410
就是说床技一流吗
So, mind-blowing sex?

47
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,970
刻骨铭心啊
Mind-blowing sex!

48
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,090
完事后一小时  我都还是斗鸡眼
For an hour afterwards, I couldn't uncross my eyes.

49
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,930
这样超赞的  因为我再来第二轮的时候
Which was awesome, because when I went back for seconds,

50
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,360
就像在跟一对双胞胎玩三人行
it was like having a three-way with twins.

51
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,530
那就打给她吧
So... call her.

52
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,570
如果我知道怎么联系她  早就打了
I would if I knew how to get in touch with her,

53
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,280
可我没她电话  我都快疯了
but I can't, and it's driving me crazy.

54
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,950
我放眼望去  看到的都是她的身影
Everywhere I look, I see her.

55
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,550
我看见她走在街上
I see her walking on the street;

56
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,770
看见她去商店购物
I see her shopping in the store;

57
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,690
看见她在那跳钢管舞
I see her dancing on that pole.

58
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,680
我也看见她在那儿跳钢管舞
I see her dancing on that pole, too.

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,130
我的天  那是昆茵
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

60
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,090
先生们  掌声欢迎卡玛
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.

61
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,540
我真很感激你们收留我
I really appreciate you guys taking me in.

62
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,250
我现在无家可归了
I mean, I'm homeless,

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,770
我和泰德之间的关系还是有点尴尬
things between me and Ted are still kind of weird.

64
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,920
所以有朋友陪伴真好
So, it's nice to be around friends.

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,310
你想住多久都行  宝贝
Well, stay as long as you want, sweetie.

66
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,230
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

67
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,230
我给你买了本日记本
Now, I got you a journal.

68
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,520
我知道听起来很逊
I know this sounds lame,

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,770
但是把烦心事写下来  真的会有帮助
but it really helps work through stuff to write about it.

70
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,610
"亲爱的日记  干掉马修妈妈的幻想"
"Dear Diary. The fantasies of killing Marshall's mom

71
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,780
"变得越来越逼真了"
"have become more vivid.

72
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,410
"今天  我剥了她的头皮..."
"Today, I scalped her with a ..."

73
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,070
错了  那本是我的
Whoops, that one's mine.

74
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,500
这本给你
This is for you.

75
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,080
-你会在这玩得很开心的  -拜托  伙计们
- You are going to have so much fun here. - Oh, guys, please,

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,170
你们不必费心思要哄我开心
do not feel like you have to keep me entertained.

77
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,370
罗宾  如果你不想寻开心
Well, you shouldn't have come to East Meadow, Long Island,

78
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,390
就不要来长岛的东梅多
Robin, if you didn't want to be entertained.

79
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,470
真的吗  我过去以为这里没什么好玩的
Really? I didn't think there was a ton to do here.

80
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,780
显然是有人还没听说过
Oh, apparently, someone hasn't heard

81
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,290
尤宁古城的微缩模型博物馆
of the Uniondale Miniatures Museum.

82
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,570
你为了十九世纪的布艺慕名而来
You'll come for the 19th century thimble art,

83
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,280
而让你驻足的会是小瓶盖上画的荷兰大师们
but you'll stay for the Dutch masters on bottle caps.

84
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,440
另外  你还可以和两位
Plus, you'll be bowling with two

85
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,590
东梅多山猫队的创始人一起打保龄球
charter members of the East Meadow Alley Cats.

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
"我们是一支超爱热狗
"We're a hot dog eating team

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,310
外加沉迷保龄球的队伍"
with a bowling problem."

88
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,110
雪莉想出来的好梗
Shirley came up with that one.

89
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,320
雪莉是个保龄球高手
Great bowler, Shirley.

90
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,580
满分三百  她那天得了二百八
She hit 280 the other day.

91
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,850
可惜  是体重到达二百八
Unfortunately, that was on her bathroom scale.

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
<i>罗宾搬出去后</i>
<i>When Robin moved out,</i>

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,890
<i>那间空卧室</i>
<i>there was a hole in my life</i>

94
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,810
<i>成了我生命中的空洞</i>
<i>in the shape of an empty bedroom.</i>

95
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,180
<i>我只好用新的嗜好来填补空洞</i>
<i>I filled it with a new hobby.</i>

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,190
你在我原来的房间里干嘛
What are you doing in my old room?

97
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,240
这间房空着  让我心烦
This room being empty was bumming me out,

98
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,910
我决定找点健康的事做
so I decided to do something healthy

99
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,030
让我可以不去想你
that would take my mind off you.

100
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,270
在一个不通风的房间里
Well, nothing says healthy

101
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,910
一边熏着40磅的猪腰子
like smoking 40 pounds of pork loin in an unventilated room

102
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,770
一边幻想着在与前女友对话  可一点也不健康
while having an imaginary conversation with your ex.

103
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,800
就冲你这么说  不给你吃
Just for that, you're not getting any.

104
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,160
不给我吃是吧
I'm not getting any?

105
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,890
这房根本是在熏你的猪腰子
You're the one smoking your own meat.

106
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,800
我该拿昆茵怎么办
What am I gonna do about this Quinn thing?

107
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,930
我想再约她出来
I want to ask her out again,

108
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,540
但我不确定我介不介意她是脱衣舞女这事
but I don't know how I feel about her being a stripper.

109
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,790
你怎么会介意这个呢
Why would you have an issue with that?

110
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,510
我是说  你都跟重刑犯
I mean, you've dated convicted felons,

111
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,190
专门送自己的孩子  参加各类选拔赛事的妈妈

112
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,390
军火商  大赛妈妈们约会过
arms dealers, pageant moms.

113
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,880
我很可能会对昆茵动真情
Hey, Quinn is someone I might want to get serious with,

114
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,550
而不是假装自己是
not just pretend to be a judge

115
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,270
能帮助她四岁女儿当选小城小姐的裁判
who could help her four-year-old clinch Little Miss Biloxi.

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,700
蒂凡尼的妈妈为了那后冠真是使了浑身解数啊
Tiffany's mom really wanted that tiara.

117
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,880
在一个八百万人口的城市中
In a city of eight million people,

118
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,590
你恰好走进了她工作的舞厅
you happened to walk into the club where she works?

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
也许这就是命运
Maybe it's destiny.

120
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,170
不会  "命运"是甜瓜园舞厅的脱衣舞女
No, Destiny strips at The Melon Patch.

121
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,940
她们是人  泰德  尊重点搞搞清楚
They're people, Ted; try to keep them straight.

122
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,410
等等
Wait a minute.

123
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,820
如果这就是命运呢
What if this is destiny?

124
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,560
我刚说过...
I just said...

125
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,350
如果上天
What if the universe

126
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,030
安排我们相遇是有原因的呢
is throwing us in each other's path for some reason?

127
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,160
跟我刚说的差不多...
More or less exactly what I...

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,230
我不管你说了什么  这就是命运的安排
I don't care what you say, this is destiny!

129
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,260
该死的  泰德
Damn it, Ted!

130
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,050
你怎么就不相信真爱呢
Why can't you ever root for love?

131
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,820
昆茵
Quinn...

132
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,190
不  你听好
No, listen,

133
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,020
在这里就叫我卡玛  好吗
in here I'm Karma, okay?

134
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,440
好
Got it.

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
是这样  卡玛
Uh, look, Karma,

136
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,120
我发誓
I swear

137
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,810
我从没说过这些鬼话
I never say crap like this, but...

138
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,860
我想或许冥冥之中
I think maybe the universe is

139
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,340
上天自有安排
telling us something.

140
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,300
你想再跟我约会一次吗
You want to go out again?

141
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,360
抱歉  我不和客人约会
I'm sorry, I don't date customers.

142
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,680
那命运呢
What about Destiny?

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,500
我听说她跳槽去甜瓜园舞厅了
I heard she's over at The Melon Patch now.

144
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,390
不  我是说我们是天造地设的一对
No, I mean like fate telling us that we're supposed to be...

145
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,400
听着  巴尼
Oh, listen, Barney,

146
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,140
我的经理在狠狠瞪着我呢
my manager is really giving me the stink eye.

147
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,310
我得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

148
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,640
好  等等  等等
Okay, wait, wait.

149
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,680
要是我付钱请你跳舞呢
What if I pay for a dance?

150
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,230
那样你的经理就高兴了
That way, your manager's happy,

151
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,710
然后我也能跟你解释
and then I can to tell you

152
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,500
为什么你得再和我约会一次
why you should go on another date with me.

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,100
听听也无妨
I guess there's no reason why not.

154
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,980
好的  首先  我们有很多共同点
Okay, first off, we have a lot in common.

155
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,310
比方说
For example,

156
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,690
咱俩的钱大多都是从
both of our jobs are largely financed

157
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,460
烂醉如泥的亚洲商人身上赚的
by drunk Asian businessmen.

158
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,580
亲爱的日记
Dear Diary.

159
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
今天是我岛上生活的第四天
It is day four on this island,

160
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,510
当地人都管这里叫"长"岛
which the natives have dubbed "Long Island,"

161
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,470
或许是因为
perhaps referencing

162
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,410
在这里时间漫"长"  度日如年吧
how each hour here feels like it may never end.

163
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,670
目前为止  他们欢迎了我的到来
So far, they have welcomed me

164
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,240
我也见识到些许他们的无聊生活
and given me a rare glimpse into their bizarre way of life.

165
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,110
"娱乐"  对于他们来说就是沙弧球
By "Entertainment," they mean table shuffle board,

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,180
绣花课  和其它毫无刺激的活动
macramé classes, and other non-stimulating activities

167
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,850
这些活动在曼哈顿
which are only used in Manhattan

168
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,300
只是用来镇定瘾君子或精神病罪犯的
to calm down drug addicts and the criminally insane.

169
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,990
这是一个没有文字的社会  他们的菜单上
A preliterate society, their menus display pictures

170
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,850
有的只是食物的图片
of the food they offer,

171
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,440
所有人都被迫一餐唱四五次
everyone is forced to sing "Happy Birthday"

172
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,730
生日快乐歌
four or five times a meal,

173
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,220
点心上还有烟花在燃烧
and dessert has fireworks in it.

174
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,250
在家中  他们常穿着名为"毛毯衫"的原始裹尸布
In their lairs, they often don a primitive shroud called a "Snugget,"

175
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,880
而且他们对每晚九点前上床习以为常
and it is not uncommon for them to go to sleep before 9 P.M.,

176
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,750
因为他们  害怕
fearing, as they do,

177
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,980
夜晚
the night.

178
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,890
还有  日记  我觉得写你真是犯傻
Also Diary, I think writing in you is stupid,

179
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,780
不过你是莉莉送的礼物
but you were a gift from Lily,

180
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,110
而且她正看着我
and she's watching me right now.

181
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,930
伙计们  我不好意思住太久
Guys, um, I don't want to overstay my welcome,

182
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,600
而且帕拉里斯让我去她那里住
and Patrice said that she would take me off your hands.

183
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,580
你们有没有火车时刻表或...
So, do you have a train schedule or...

184
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,530
有是有
Oh, yeah,

185
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,800
可...
um, but-but

186
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,470
火车出了点问题
there's a-a problem with the train.

187
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,220
大问题
Big, big problem.

188
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,410
发生了...
There was a...

189
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,440
-罢工  -是雷击[两者同字]
- Strike. - A lightning strike.

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,740
击中了一个正在罢工的纠察员
That hit one of the picketers who was on strike.

191
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,290
那时候下着雷雨
During a thunderstorm.

192
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,800
另外
Plus,

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,760
你不会想成为帕拉里斯的负担
you don't want to be a burden on Patrice.

194
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,760
对啊  她可能都不想你过去呢
Yeah, she probably doesn't even want you there.

195
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,500
你们怎么怪怪的
You guys are being weird.

196
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,240
天啊  罗宾  真抱歉
Oh, my God, Robin, I am so sorry.

197
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,800
我这就拿去洗
I'll throw these in the wash.

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,490
明天早上就能烘干叠整齐了
They'll be dry and folded in the morning.

199
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,130
或许得等周末
Or the weekend.

200
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,160
到时我们再谈你搬家的事吧
And we can talk about you leaving then.

201
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,330
或许永远不谈
Or never.

202
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,340
等等  莉莉  为什么不...
Wait, Lily, why don't...

203
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,820
八点三刻  该睡觉了
8:45, time to hit the hay.

204
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,090
晚安
Good night!

205
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,630
泰德  你在忙活什么
So Ted, what healthy,

206
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,090
健康得来又一点都不疯狂的活动啊
not-at-all-crazy activity are you up to now?

207
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,940
我之前喜欢玩熏肉  可现在我有新的爱好
I liked smoking meat, but now I've got a new passion:

208
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,220
木头
wood.

209
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,420
你听到了你自己说的傻话了吗
You hear these things that come out of your mouth, right?

210
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,040
于是我回到了情欲小野猫舞厅
So I went back to the Lusty Leopard.

211
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,510
你知道吗  巴尼
You know what, Barney?

212
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,850
我是说过我不和客人约会
I know I said I have a rule about not dating customers,

213
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,680
可你说服了我...
but you may have convinced me to...

214
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,580
曲子结束了  我得走了
Song's over, I got to go.

215
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,560
等等  别  什么  说服你什么
Wait, no, what? Convinced you to what?

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,610
抱歉  可我的经理正瞪着我
I'm sorry, but manager's giving me the stink eye.

217
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,980
别来烦我们了  经理
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

218
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,780
你刚才要说什么
What were you saying?

219
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,050
我正要说
Well, I was going to say

220
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,200
我真的发现你特别...有魅力
that I do find you very... charming.

221
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,790
幽默风趣
And funny...

222
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,580
还很性感
and sexy.

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,460
令人兴奋  聪明机智
And exciting and smart.

224
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,750
你真了解我
You so get me.

225
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,720
知道吗  巴尼
You know what, Barney?

226
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,000
我从来没这样过
I have never done this before,

227
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,700
可你有个特别之处...
but there's just something about you.

228
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,760
所以我想我的答案是...
So I guess my answer is...

229
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,930
曲子结束了
The song's over.

230
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,730
把你的想法说完
Well, just finish the thought!

231
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
-可经理不允许  -天啊
- But the manager. - God,

232
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,150
我恨经理
I hate manager.

233
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,250
给  你的答案是...
There. Your answer is...

234
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,090
我们真应该多了解一下彼此
We really need to know each other a little better.

235
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,740
给我说说你自己
Tell me about yourself.

236
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,940
我能对你说什么
Well, um, what can I tell you?

237
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,150
我...
I'm, um...

238
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,440
有魅力  幽默风趣
charming and funny

239
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,500
又性感  又...
and sexy and...

240
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,240
令人兴奋  又聪明机智
exciting and smart.

241
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,550
哪有姑娘能抵抗你这样的人啊
Well, how can a girl say no to that?

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
我们要不要...
How about we...

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,810
出去...
go out on...

244
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,400
这些曲子真是太短了
Ugh, these songs are so short.

245
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,530
你到底给了昆茵多少钱
Uh, how much exactly did you give Quinn?

246
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,050
八九百
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

247
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,890
外加我那只不记得价格的劳力士
plus whatever my Rolex is worth.

248
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,240
我知道
I know.

249
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,890
泰德  我觉得我恋爱了
Ted, I think I'm in love.

250
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,930
昆茵完全是在耍你
Quinn is totally playing you.

251
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,700
什么
What?

252
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,260
胡说八道
That's ridiculous.

253
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,220
如果她是在耍我
If she were playing me,

254
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,240
那为什么她会愿意和我约会
why would she agree to go on a date with me?

255
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,670
你不同于其他那些蠢货
You're different than the rest of these schlubs.

256
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,430
仅此一次  我要为你破例
This one time only, I'm going to break my rule.

257
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,810
明晚咱们出去吧
Let's go out tomorrow night.

258
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,110
太好了
Sweet!

259
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,280
糟糕
Oh, shoot.

260
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,260
明天我得工作
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

261
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,150
我有个好主意
Hey, brainstorm.

262
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,070
我们就在这里约会怎样
What if we just have our date here?

263
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,790
那就在这约会
It's a date.

264
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,380
那不是约会
It's not a date.

265
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,270
是你去脱衣舞厅  付钱看大腿舞
It's you going to a strip club and paying for lap dances!

266
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,170
如果不是约会  她为什么说跳四支舞送一支
If it's not a date, why'd she say every fifth dance was free?

267
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,600
这本来就是"情欲小野猫"周五晚上的特惠活动
Because that's the Lusty Leopard's policy on Friday nights,

268
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,130
居然我比你还了解  真是气死我了
and I'm so mad at you that I know that!

269
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,290
亲爱的日记
Dear Diary.

270
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,270
这是在长岛生活的第六天
It is day six on this island,

271
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,740
我开始觉得自己不像客人  更像是囚犯
and I begin to fear I am more captive than guest...

272
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,190
早上好  亲爱的
Morning, sweetie.

273
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,040
打门球吗
Up for croquet?

274
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,260
莉莉  你洗完我的衣服了吗  我得...
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done washing my clothes yet? Because I...

275
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,280
真是抱歉
Oh, I am so sorry.

276
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,500
你的衣服不幸被我装进
Your clothes accidentally wound up in the bag

277
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,410
捐给善心二手衣店的包里了
I donated to Goodwill.

278
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,590
你把我的衣服给捐了
You gave away my clothes?

279
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,400
你的衣服对东梅多的百姓来说  太华丽了
They were a bit fancy for East Meadow.

280
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,930
大家都盯着你看
People were staring.

281
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,180
另外  我们还有一件毛毯衫
Besides, we have an extra Snugget.

282
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,650
试试吧
Try it.

283
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,070
试试吧  罗宾
Try it, Robin.

284
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,310
他们试图把我同化  亲爱的日记
They're trying to make me one of them, Diary.

285
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,410
我开始害怕
And I begin to fear...

286
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,650
自己或许喜欢被同化
I may like it!

287
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,930
真不敢相信我们在脱衣舞厅
I can't believe we're at a strip club,

288
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,910
而这里最大的娘炮[波霸]就是你
and the biggest boob in here is you.

289
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,070
泰德  这是正式的约会
It's a real date, Ted.

290
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,820
显然你还没见到迪沙佛那对巨乳姐妹花
And clearly you haven't seen the DeSalvo twins.

291
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,870
她就在那边
She's right over there.

292
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,910
巴尼...  我擦咧
Barney... Yowza!

293
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,800
你不是在约会
You are not on a date.

294
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,740
那好  证明给我看
Okay, look, prove it.

295
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,910
证明她不是在利用你
Prove that she's not just taking advantage of you.

296
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,890
带她去别的地方约会
Get her to go out with you anywhere but here.

297
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,920
好吧
Fine!

298
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,640
帅哥  想来支舞不
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

299
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,290
当然
Yeah!

300
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,070
不过有个条件
Uh, one thing, though.

301
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,230
我们去别的地方约会吧
Um, you'd be okay with us having a date

302
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,820
你没意见吧
somewhere besides here, wouldn't you?

303
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,290
就等你说这句话呢
I was hoping you would ask that.

304
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,910
抱歉这包厢价格太高了
I'm sorry it's so expensive in here,

305
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,470
但是这里舒适又没人打扰
but it's nice and private, huh?

306
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,460
没错  还很浪漫呢
Absolutely. And romantic!

307
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,600
这是我们第一次像情侣那样独处
It's our first getaway as a couple!

308
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,730
亲爱的日记  我清楚地意识到
It's become clear to me, Diary,

309
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,650
我必须得来一个绝命大逃亡
that I must attempt a dramatic escape.

310
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,860
我会在吃饭的时候假装胃疼
I will fake a stomachache during dinner.

311
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,930
然后趁马修和莉莉出门玩宾戈游戏的空档
Then, after Marshall and Lily leave for bingo night,

312
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,600
宾戈游戏  一种填写格子的游戏
在游戏中第一个成功者以喊"Bingo"表示取胜而得名

313
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,600
从后门溜走
I will sneak out the back.

314
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,100
我会偷走雪莉的车  直奔火车站
I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal and drive to the train station.

315
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,130
雪莉四十二岁  有一辆老人代步车
Shirley's 42, by the way, and rides a Rascal.

316
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,730
我发誓  这绝对堪比《机器人总动员》的下半部
I swear, it's the second half of Wall-E out here.

317
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,180
我就知道
Bingo...

318
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,110
宾戈游戏会取消
was canceled.

319
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,100
帅哥  想来支舞不
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

320
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,620
不用了  我不是来光顾的
No, I'm not a customer.

321
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,450
我女朋友在这里工作
My girlfriend works here.

322
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,940
她在那儿...
She's right over...

323
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,060
仅此一次  我要为你破例
This one time only, I'm gonna break my rule.

324
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,370
明晚我们出去吧
Let's go out tomorrow night!

325
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,560
太好了
Sweet!

326
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,560
糟糕
Oh, shoot!

327
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,490
明天我得工作
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

328
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,960
我有个好主意
Hey! Brainstorm!

329
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,950
不如我们就在这里约会吧
What if we just have our date here,

330
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,610
进贵宾室喝点香槟  怎么样
maybe in the Champagne Room?

331
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,750
那是我们的专属地盘
That was our spot.

332
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,510
帅哥  想来支舞吗
Hey, gorgeous, You want a dance?

333
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,080
是快步舞吗
Is it a jig?

334
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,280
如果是  那该跳完了吧
'Cause if so, it's up.

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,640
抱歉  我只能靠《性感教师》最后的情节来铺梗骂你
Sorry, I only had the last verse of "Hot For Teacher" to work on that.

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,640
《性感教师》  范海伦乐队的歌曲

337
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,220
你刚算什么
What was that?

338
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,620
你对那个人分明是故技重施
You laid exactly the same line on that guy that you did on me!

339
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,130
亲爱的  那只是我说来哄那些好骗的废材而已
Sweetie, that is just something I say to these gullible losers here.

340
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,230
这招对他们屡试不爽
They fall for it every time.

341
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,690
一堆废材
Bunch of losers!

342
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,310
天啊  又是经理
Oh, gosh, manager again.

343
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,220
他看着我  好像在说
He's looking at me like,

344
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,000
"卡玛  为什么你不让贵宾室的客人加钟"
"Karma, why aren't you booking more time in the Champagne Room?"

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,850
我这就帮你加
Well, we'll show him.

346
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,320
不对  你又在耍我
No! You're playing me again!

347
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,110
你都舍不得花点心思
And you're not even trying hard!

348
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,470
经理根本不在  你指着的是一株植物
There's no manager there; You're pointing at a fern!

349
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,260
泰德说得对
Ted was right.

350
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,570
他现在肯定在家  嘲笑我多有傻
I bet he's home right now, laughing at how dumb I am.

351
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,120
我这算自食其果吧  绝对算
Did I deserve this? Absolutely.

352
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,550
我有时候是吹牛吹过了头
I have told some outrageous lies.

353
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,820
我说过自己是名人
I have told women I was famous,

354
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,150
战争英雄
a war hero,

355
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,290
和我上床可以治愈近视
that sex with me would cure their nearsightedness.

356
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,810
巴尼
Barney?!

357
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,880
是我活该  你对我做的一切再过分都不为过
I probably deserved everything you did to me and more.

358
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,600
但是我一直在努力
But I have been trying,

359
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,590
努力成为一个更好的人
and trying hard to be a better person.

360
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,110
谢谢你让我知道  我也曾是一个好人
Thanks for showing me I had it right before.

361
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,580
抱歉我们让你有点喘不过气
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel a little suffocated,

362
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,700
可你刚刚真是打算偷偷溜走吗
but were you really just gonna sneak away?

363
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,260
我只是想念城市的生活了
Well, it's just... I really miss the city.

364
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,880
我知道你们喜欢这里  这很好
I know you guys love it here, and that's fine,

365
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,030
我们不喜欢这里
We don't love it here!

366
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,920
什么
What?

367
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,500
拜托  罗宾
Come on, Robin,

368
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,780
这算什么生活啊
what kind of life is this?

369
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,800
参加凯纳斯特纸牌比赛
Going to canasta tournaments

370
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,800
凯纳斯特纸牌是是使用两组纸牌的桥牌游戏

371
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,670
还有高中曲棍球决赛
and high school field hockey playoffs?

372
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,540
我觉得北贝尔摩会称霸全州
Oh, I think North Bellmore can take state.

373
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,630
就索菲娅那踝关节  深表怀疑啊
With Sophie's ankle? Doubtful.

374
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,060
好吧  可如果你俩过得这么不快乐
Okay, but if you two are so unhappy,

375
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,270
何不直接搬回曼哈顿呢
why don't you just move back to Manhattan?

376
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,100
因为郊区更适合孩子啊
Because the suburbs are better for the baby.

377
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,900
谁说的  一个连你们自己都不快乐的地方
Who says? Who says any place is better for the baby

378
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,060
又怎么能适合孩子呢
if you two are unhappy in it?

379
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,610
不说了  我们现在定居在此了
No, no, we live here now.

380
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,510
而且  如果能有个朋友搬来长住的话
And, you know, this place wouldn't seem so bad

381
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,170
这里其实也没那么糟糕
if... we got one of our friends to move out here.

382
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,600
你们俩啊
Oh, guys...

383
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,210
那我还不如去自焚呢
I would rather set myself on fire.

384
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,870
<i>第二天早上  巴尼发现</i>
<i>The next morning, Barney learned that </i>

385
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,110
<i>即使身处人口八百万的大都市</i>
<i>even in a city of eight million people, </i>

386
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,120
<i>也还是躲不开卡玛[报应]</i>
<i>there's no escaping Karma.</i>

387
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,050
抱歉  不能闲聊  经理盯着呢
Sorry, can't talk; manager's watching.

388
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,480
如果我伤了你的心
Look, I am sorry

389
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,590
我很抱歉  那是工作需要
if I hurt your feelings; it's a job.

390
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,860
是吗  我的工作
Yeah, well, at my job,

391
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,320
就不会靠撕裂别人的心来赚钱
we don't rip out people's hearts for money.

392
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,060
我公司曾短暂支持过一个干这行的朝鲜实验室
My company briefly backed a lab in North Korea which did,

393
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,670
可我们卖掉它了
but we sold it!

394
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,510
我在那俱乐部工作了一整年
You know, I've worked at that club for a year.

395
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,830
你基本算那里的半个住客了
You practically live there,

396
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,380
可约会那天你都没认出我来
and you didn't even recognize me the night we went out.

397
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,010
所以别在我面前装什么受伤的乖宝宝
You can't pretend to be some hurt little victim with me.

398
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,110
我很了解你
I know you.

399
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,100
你当然了解我
Well, of course you do.

400
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,890
我把不为人知的事都告诉你了
I told you things I don't tell anybody.

401
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,860
我对你坦诚相见
I was honest with you.

402
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,240
没错  我会相信你有个黑人同志的哥哥
Yeah, because I believe you have a gay black brother,

403
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,850
有个寂寞到自制熏肉的好友
a friend lonely enough to smoke his own meat

404
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,100
还有个曾经追随超级游民乐队四处巡演的妈妈
and that your mom was a groupie for Supertramp.

405
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,480
那乐队就是以她而命名的
They named their band for her!

406
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,480
Supertramp也有超级荡妇之意

407
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,550
这些你都记得吗
You remembered all that?

408
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,950
没错
Well, yeah. I mean,

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,700
比起那首听过8000遍的
you're more interesting than the lyrics

410
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,540
"往我身上撒点糖"  你要有意思多了
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me" for the 8,000th time.

411
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,540
威豹乐队歌曲

412
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,920
真是讽刺
You know, it's funny.

413
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,870
几乎我遇到的所有女人
Almost every woman I've ever met was wrong

414
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,250
都错在让我有机可乘
to give me a chance.

415
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,150
你是第一个错在不给我机会的女人
You're the first woman who's wrong not to.

416
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,300
大杯黑咖啡
Large black coffee...

417
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,730
还有他点的东西
and whatever he's having.

418
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,060
都算在我账上
It's on me.

419
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,110
跟她要一样的
The same.

420
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,220
-谢了  -没事
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

421
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,410
再帮我买一千七百杯  咱们就扯平
1,700 more of these and we're even.

422
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,300
曲子刚好结束了
Uh, the song just ended.

423
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,070
是不是意味着你该走了
That mean you got to get going?

424
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,120
不
No.

425
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
你有时间陪我坐会儿吗
Do you have time to sit with me?

426
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,100
不知道  我的表还戴在你手上呢
I don't know. You're wearing my watch.

427
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,140
陶器  现在你又开始玩陶艺了
Pottery. Now you're making pottery.

428
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
人家需要个新花瓶
I needed a new vase...

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,570
还需要些盘子
and some plates.

430
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,790
和一些碗
And bowls.

431
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,890
我做的瓷器陈列橱设计不够稳妥
The china cabinet I built had some design flaws.

432
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,610
干嘛不直接把这房间弄成客房呢
Why don't you just turn this into a guest room?

433
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,680
客房
A guest room?

434
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,750
你是说弄成一间随时能住人
You mean a room ready and waiting

435
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,310
可住的那个人却不存在的房间吗
for someone who isn't there?

436
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,530
一间用来提醒我依旧孤身一人的房间吗
A room devoted to reminding me that I'm still alone?

437
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,980
我不需要那些
Yeah, I don't need that.

438
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,040
泰德  不管你往这个房间里堆多少东西
Ted, no matter how many things you put in this room...

439
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,890
我还是会占有一席之地
I'll still be here.

440
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,240
进来吧
Come on in.

441
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,440
谢了
Thanks.

442
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,370
谢谢你把我剩下的东西都收拾好
Oh, um, thanks for packing up the rest of my stuff.

443
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,780
不用谢  来点咖啡吗
No problem. Uh, you want some coffee?

444
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,900
-好啊  -好的
- Uh, sure. Yeah? - Yeah.

445
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,990
你过得如何
So, how are things?

446
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,890
-过得不错  你呢   -好极了
- Good! You? - Great!

447
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,290
-这马克杯其实是我亲手制作的  -是吗
- You know, I actually made this mug. - Oh, yeah?

448
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,250
抱歉  咖啡有点太猛了
Yeah, sorry, coffee's a little strong.

449
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,660
你在莉莉和马修家住得怎么样
How was your stay with Marshall and Lily?

450
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,090
有点怪怪的
Uh... A little weird.

451
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,840
其实他们不喜欢住在长岛
They're not loving Long Island.

452
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,630
我想他们内心深处已经意识到
I think deep down, they realize

453
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,130
那地方不适合他们
it just... isn't a good fit.

454
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,790
有时要承认这一点挺难的
It's hard to admit that sometimes.

455
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,580
的确如此
Sure is.

456
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,720
不过我想勇敢面对  跨过这道坎
But I guess it's better to face it and move on

457
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,200
也好过勉强自己委曲求全  对吧
than try to force something that just isn't meant to be, right?

458
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,320
深有同感
I think so.

459
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,340
没错
Yeah.

460
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,460
你准备如何处置我原来的房间
So, what do you think you're gonna do with my old room?

461
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,920
还没认真考虑过呢
Haven't really thought about it.

462
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,280
几天以后

463
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,850
谁稀罕曼哈顿啊
Who needs Manhattan?

464
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,050
没错
Yeah.

465
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,310
是泰德  他问我们
Hmm, it's Ted. He wants to know

466
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,490
想不想去市里玩
if we want to hang out in the city.

467
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,460
九分钟后有一趟车
The next train leaves in nine minutes.

468
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,840
亲爱的莉莉和马修  或许你们不知道
Dear Lily and Marshall, I don't know if you know this,

469
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,220
但我从未把你们的名字从租契上划掉
but I never took your names off the lease.

470
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,630
今天  我划掉我的名字
Well, today I took my name off it.

471
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,450
这间公寓现在归你们了
The apartment is now yours.

472
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,160
而且我想我终于找到
And I think I finally figured out

473
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,360
处置罗宾房间的最佳方法
the best thing to do with Robin's old room.

474
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,450
对我来说  如今总觉得这房间有旧情在牵绊
See, for me, this place has begun to feel a little haunted.

475
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,930
一开始  我以为是罗宾
At first, I thought it was haunted by Robin,

476
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,970
但现在我想其实是我自己
but now I think it was haunted by me.

477
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,100
不忘旧情事  难拥新生活
Well, no ghost is at peace until it finally moves on.

478
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,890
我需要改变
I need a change.

479
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,880
我想你们也一样
And I think you do, too.

480
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,230
这间公寓需要开始新的生活
This apartment needs some new life.

481
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,220
所以  请把我们的旧家  打造成你们的新家
So, please, make our old home your new home.

482
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,710
旧情自此断
It is now ghost-free.

483
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,230
爱你们的  泰德
Love, Ted.
