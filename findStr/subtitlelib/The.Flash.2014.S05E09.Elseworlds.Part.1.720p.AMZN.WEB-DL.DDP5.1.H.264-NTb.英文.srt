17
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,740
My name is Barry Allen,

18
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,110
and I am the fastest man alive.

19
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,500
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

20
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,030
But secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

21
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,050
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

22
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,410
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

23
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,980
she changed the present.

24
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,420
And now our world is more dangerous than ever,

25
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,050
and I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

26
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,320
I am the Flash.

28
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,780
You failed.

29
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,830
Why are you doing this?

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,280
You did this to yourself.

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,480
And now all of you will perish.

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,640
My name is Dr. John Deegan, and I, like most of you,

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,730
I'm a psychiatrist.

35
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,050
Do you know what my patients tell me the most?

36
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,510
They feel inferior.

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,920
I'm here to tell you, whether we admit it or not,

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,550
some people, they're just born lucky,

39
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,940
which leads us to the real problem, imperfection.

40
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,680
How can we ever hope to feel like

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,140
supermen or superwomen

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,200
without first becoming super ourselves?

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm here to tell you how, folks.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,450
If we utilize eugenic insights, I feel--

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,740
Hey, Frankenstein, go back to your mad scientist lab.

46
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,970
Ma'am, ma'am, please-- would you wait, please?

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,150
Folks, folks, folks, please listen.

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,130
I'm just saying, we can truly help our patients.

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,470
Listen to me!

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,410
Idiots!

52
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,480
Doctor.

53
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,120
Dr. John Deegan.

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,770
I need your help, John.

55
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,100
Go find someone else to prank, douchebag.

56
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,540
My God, what are you?

57
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,390
Something beyond your comprehension.

58
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,740
I've traveled far to this place and time

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,370
to lay this precious burden at your feet.

60
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,730
Use this book to reshape the world as you see fit.

61
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,790
Show them what a real god can do, John.

62
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,460
Why me?

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,340
You have vision.

64
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,150
That book holds the key to your transformation, John,

65
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,480
and all you have to do is open it.

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,510
Use it wisely, John.

67
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,740
The universe is in your hands.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,950
I can--I can see...

69
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,150
I can see everything.

70
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,520
And a word of advice:

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,670
think big.

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,440
Honey, breakfast is ready.

76
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,910
Honey.

77
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,860
It'll get cold.

78
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,050
What?

79
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,930
Morning.

80
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,680
Look, babe, they're perfect this time.

81
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,500
What if Barry walks in?

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,450
What if he could have seen that?

83
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,520
See...

84
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,300
Where's Barry?

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,550
Did you get enough sleep last night?

86
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,730
Look, babe, I know that we haven't caught Cicada,

87
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,010
but Caitlin's immunity can help us.

88
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,970
Who's Cicada?

89
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,000
Our big bad.

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Barry, are you okay?

91
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm Barry?

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
What is wrong?

93
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,730
Honey, hi. Talk to me.

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,740
I did not get enough sleep.

95
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,330
Are you--you sure it's not my cooking?

96
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:01,950
'Cause...

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,280
No, no.

98
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,810
These smell delicious.

99
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,910
Thank you.

100
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,810
You know what?

101
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,960
I think that you call Captain Singh

102
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,170
and you ask for a day off.

103
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,530
Look, with all the superhero-ing you've been doing,

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
I think you've earned it, honey.

105
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,260
You think maybe I should go into S.T.A.R. Labs?

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,720
What-- what?

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Only my husband would think working on Speed Force equations

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,170
would be called a day off.

109
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,730
I love you, Barry Allen.

110
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,590
I love you, Iris West-Allen.

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,640
Break in at Ivo Labs.

112
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,630
Cisco's on comms.

113
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,350
I'll meet you guys at S.T.A.R. Labs.

114
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
Whew. That's a rush.

115
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,710
Sorry, I polished it last night

116
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,230
and left it on our dresser.

117
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,260
Oh, Barry, what have you done this time?

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,080
Barry, we got a break-in at Ivo Labs,

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,120
two armed men going after diamonds,

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,090
the ones they use for conductors.

121
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,350
Hey, pump the brakes.

122
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,540
You're gonna have to hang a U-ey,

123
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,920
'cause you passed Ivo by about 18 blocks.

124
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,790
Found it.

125
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,430
Someone's excited to get to work.

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,850
It is too early for this.

127
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,570
Forget it, Flash.

128
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,970
We're leaving with the diamonds, or this guy dies.

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,180
I said back off.

130
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,610
Hey, what are you doing there?

131
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,800
Just hit the guy with the lightning punch.

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,850
You have failed this city.

133
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,650
Pretty sure that's not your line.

134
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,930
Your adrenaline levels are off the charts.

135
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,130
What's going on?

136
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,850
Overkill much?

137
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,990
Cops are on the way.

138
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,290
Why don't you just let them take over from here?

139
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,630
So he's fine, Caitlin?

140
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,970
Oh, God, thank goodness.

141
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,220
Really? There are no anomalies?

142
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,890
I don't-- I don't have a brain tumor?

143
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,670
Nothing?

144
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,440
Barry, you're in perfect shape.

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,180
Babe, tell me about it. I mean, hi, these abs.

146
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,400
And they're all mine.

147
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,690
Maybe we could lay off the public displays of affection,

148
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,340
just at work, you know?

149
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,510
Since when?

150
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,630
You're always saying that touch is your love language.

151
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,740
That's right, Ralph.

152
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,270
Just feel like we're being very insensitive to all of you.

153
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,160
Oh, man, we've talked about this.

154
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,090
I'm over Gypsy, okay?

155
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,200
But I appreciate the thought.

156
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,230
I'll be all right.

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,210
I'm gonna go home...

158
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,680
Because I need to think.

159
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,060
Think?

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,070
What are you guys doing?

161
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,390
Following you into the hallway.

162
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,240
'Cause something is definitely up.

163
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,790
You need to talk about it?

164
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah, Barry,

165
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,600
you haven't seemed like yourself all morning.

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm fine.

167
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,810
I just think that maybe I should go

168
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,490
and talk with someone who might better understand

169
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,900
what I'm going through.

170
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm gonna go see Oliver Queen.

171
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,860
I'll be back.

173
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,110
Dig, what are you doing here?

174
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm kicking your butt.

175
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,970
Now get up, come on.

176
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,270
You guys redecorate the Bunker?

177
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,480
Oliver, you've been to ARGUS a million times.

178
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,910
Oliver?

179
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm Oliver Queen.

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
Yeah, I'll say.

181
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,510
I'm the Green Arrow.

182
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,570
Holy crap.

184
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,090
I've been hanging with a tough crowd, huh?

185
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah, you think?

186
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,240
Look, I need to make a call, just to S.T.A.R. Labs,

187
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,630
just for some important Green Arrow business.

188
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,140
- You know how it is. - Later.

189
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,270
What's that?

190
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,900
We've got Bratvas fighting Bertinelli's

191
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,940
over in old Diaz weapons cache in the Glades.

192
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,040
I could really use some backup, Oliver.

193
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh, man, I don't know if I'm feeling up for it.

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,910
I think I just tweaked something.

195
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,450
ARGUS rapid response is on another mission.

196
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,160
We're the only ones that can make it in time.

197
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,130
- Okay, yeah, I'm in. - Good.

198
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,880
Suit up.

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,820
How do I put this...

200
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,820
I forget, do--do I need help putting this on?

201
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,810
What are you doing?

202
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,260
I thought you going to fire an incendiary arrow.

203
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,360
So did I.

204
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,990
Did you freaking see that?

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,860
Stop fooling around and get the driver.

206
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,670
Damn.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,990
Diggle!

208
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,430
No--no.

209
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,810
Oh, man. Oh, I'm glad to see you.

210
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,270
Uh-huh, yeah.

211
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,270
Nice outfit.

212
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,020
This can't be a coincidence.

213
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,740
There--there has to be a reason behind this,

214
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,140
which means that someone is responsible.

215
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,620
We need to know who--hey, can you--can you not do that?

216
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,700
Man, what a total "Freaky Friday."

217
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,590
No, wait, we didn't switch bodies.

218
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,760
It's more of a "Quantum Leap." Where's a mirror?

219
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,210
Focus, just for a second,

220
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,270
and take this seriously because the world thinks

221
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,620
that you're Oliver Queen and that I'm Barry Allen,

222
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,690
and I would really like to know why.

223
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,270
- Totally. - Is that cool?

224
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,930
- Yes. - Thank you.

225
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,690
Weird.

227
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,000
Hey, Mayor.

228
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,030
Just, if you could--just for 90 seconds of seriousness.

229
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,820
You gotta admit, this is a little cool.

230
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,850
I will find it a lot cooler when I wake up

231
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,630
in my own bed tomorrow morning.

232
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
You woke up in bed with Iris?

233
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,070
We have to fix this right now!

234
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,910
Let me get this straight.

235
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,870
You believe that you are not Barry Allen,

236
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,090
but in fact, he is?

237
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,800
Barry, did you time travel again?

238
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,570
No, I didn't.

239
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,600
- She's talking to Barry. - Sorry--

240
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,220
I am Barry.

241
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,350
- Yeah, and I'm Wild Dog. - Easy, Wild Dog.

242
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,270
Sarcasm.

243
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,180
It's not great sarcasm, Cisco.

244
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,870
- Do you mind if I... - No, of course not.

245
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,520
Oliver's brain scan is perfectly normal,

246
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,290
no signs of hypnosis or psychic interference.

247
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,040
Tachyon meters are clear.

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,450
No one's screwing with the Timeline.

250
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,070
Guys, come on, this is crazy.

251
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,190
I mean, there's no way that

252
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,880
I could be married to Oliver Queen.

253
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,570
Sorry, but, babe,

254
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,390
you know he's not my type, right?

255
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,630
Iris, you really don't believe me?

256
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
We're telling the truth.

257
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,620
Okay? We're telling the truth.

258
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,920
Something is very, very wrong with reality.

259
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,820
Yeah.

260
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,360
All right, Team Flash meeting.

261
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,560
Not you, Barry.

262
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,270
Th--uh...

263
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,400
I've only got eyes for you, you know that.

264
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,670
I sw--if you touch her...

265
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,790
I didn't touch her.

266
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,120
You thought about it.

267
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,160
All right, well, if your team's not gonna help us,

268
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,040
then we have to keep moving.

269
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,130
They'll help us, okay? They'll help us.

270
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,270
We just gotta get--we just gotta get Iris on board first.

271
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,530
Good--fine, how--how are you going to convince her?

272
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,290
I'm not, you are.

273
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,830
- She's your wife. - I know, man.

274
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,080
I know, I don't--I don't like this anymore than you do.

275
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,840
You just gotta tell her how much you care about her.

276
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,370
Tell her she's your lightning rod.

277
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,180
I'm not--I'm not saying that.

278
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,310
Just say it. Trust me.

279
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,280
It works every time.

280
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,280
Mind if I join you?

281
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,110
Yeah.

282
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
This should help.

283
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,760
I guess you forgot you can't get drunk?

284
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,540
This day could not get any worse.

285
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,510
You really think that you're Oliver?

286
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,910
Yeah.

287
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,050
You know, Felicity called me when Oliver was in prison.

288
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,370
Do you know how he ended up in Slabside?

289
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,920
She--she called you?

290
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,860
He cut a deal, Barry,

291
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,130
completely behind Felicity's back.

292
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,320
He didn't even warn her.

293
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,530
The FBI just showed up and took him away.

294
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,480
She said all that?

295
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
She's hurting.

296
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,280
Oliver's life, it's completely defined

297
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,860
by anger, vengeance.

298
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,860
That's why I am so lucky to have you in my life.

299
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,210
Are you not the least bit worried

300
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,180
that reality might be broken?

301
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,010
Don't you have to consider what we're telling you is the truth?

302
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,420
Isn't it possible?

303
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,150
Yeah, yeah, it is,

304
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,810
which is why I'm really sorry, Barry.

305
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,010
Would you--I thought I couldn't get drunk.

306
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,670
Nanites, courtesy of Ray Palmer.

307
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,220
Whoever you are, we need to get you to a safe place

308
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,130
until we can figure out what happened.

309
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,520
I hope you can understand.

310
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,100
Oh, come on.

311
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,420
Sorry, dude.

312
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh, come on.

313
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,070
Guys, come--

314
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,040
Guys, come on!

315
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,000
Let us out of here!

316
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
Come on.

317
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,850
Why are we in your secret prison?

318
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,670
It's not a prison.

319
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,700
It's a Tesla conductor tube that dampens meta-powers.

320
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,460
Okay, it's a prison.

321
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,960
We just need to convince everybody

322
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,710
that we're not crazy!

323
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,180
How?

324
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,630
How do you suggest that we do that?

325
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,240
Because everyone on Earth thinks that we're each other.

326
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,200
- That's it. - Hmm?

327
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,380
Maybe it's just Earth-1 that's been affected.

328
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,760
If we can get an extrapolator,

329
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,170
breach to Earth-38 and find Kara.

330
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,390
If she remembers us, then maybe she can help

331
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,870
fix whatever's happened.

332
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
You skipped the part where you explain how we escape.

333
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,140
Were you able to get in touch with ARGUS?

334
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,240
Well, I tried, but I kept getting interference

335
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,890
at 650 nanometers.

336
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,920
Isn't that the wavelength for red light?

337
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,610
Red light, exactly.

338
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,440
And when I checked the city's weather cams,

339
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,740
this is what I found:

340
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,460
red skies, yellow lightning.

341
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,580
So you think Barry and Oliver's shared psychosis

342
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,960
is a result of weird weather?

343
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,710
Stranger things, right?

344
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,440
Okay, I'll run their scans again.

345
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,550
Best off giving up now.

346
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,170
Who the frak is that?

347
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,280
I spent the past seven months in a maximum security prison,

348
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,390
and no matter who bad things got--and they got bad--

349
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,710
every cell had a toilet.

350
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,730
You sure you can't hold it?

351
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,390
Oh, you wanna back up the pipes.

352
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,420
And fry the dampener, yes.

353
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,700
That's a good idea.

354
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,640
Okay.

355
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,180
One problem, I'm not gonna be able to reach the valve

356
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,970
with these on.

357
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,520
You're gonna have to dislocate your thumb.

358
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,620
Are you crazy? I'm--

359
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,370
I'm not crazy. You need to dislocate your thumb.

360
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,190
Just apply pressure to the joint.

361
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,090
No, I'm gonna break my hand--

362
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,220
You're not gonna break your hand,

363
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,100
because in this reality,

364
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,290
your ligaments have been stretched and conditioned

365
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,810
in the art of escape by Anatoly Knyazev.

366
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,330
Now, man up, apply pressure to the joint,

367
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,190
and dislocate your thumb.

368
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,030
- It worked. - Yeah.

369
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,050
All right.

370
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,560
Okay, now just wait for it.

371
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,210
Dampener's down. Now what?

372
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,780
You're gonna have to phase us out of here.

373
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,770
What?

374
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,730
Phasing.

375
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,010
That's when I vibrate at the frequency of air,

376
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,920
causing all the cells in my body to get so excited

377
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,650
I can pass through solid objects.

378
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,220
Right, "Phasing."

379
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,590
Want any advice?

380
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,060
One-second cure. Barry, please.

381
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm just saying, it's not an easy move,

382
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,470
and if you screw this up

383
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,640
then you're gonna come out of the phase

384
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,970
halfway through the glass.

385
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,040
What?

386
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,800
Why are you laughing?

387
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,690
I didn't realize...

388
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,770
- Your thumb looks ridiculous. - Oh, my God.

389
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,700
I didn't realize that's how mine looked.

390
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,850
Well, look at that, you did it.

391
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,450
Great.

392
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,580
Don't leave me, man.

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,190
Figured it out.

394
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,770
All right, let's go.

395
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,730
Get the extrapolator and get out of here.

396
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,040
I can't let you do that, Barry.

397
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,110
Iris, please, I know how weird this is,

398
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,130
but somewhere inside, you know we're telling the truth,

399
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,090
that it's me, Barry.

400
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,140
Do you remember when I first moved in?

401
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,100
Joe brought me to the house after my mom was killed.

402
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,980
I looked at you and I said, "My dad didn't do it."

403
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,720
- And then you said... - "I believe you."

404
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,080
You always did.

405
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,620
And now I need you to believe me again.

406
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,260
Iris, you're my lightning rod.

407
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,920
Quick, before I change my mind.

408
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,460
We'll fix this, I promise.

411
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm writing it.

412
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,980
We've been over this, hon.

413
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,550
No, you talked, I ignored.

414
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,690
You need a new muffler.

415
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,530
I think this is a tie rod end.

416
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,500
Come on, Kara, back me up here.

417
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,440
Uh, no, thanks.

418
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,950
I know better than to get involved

419
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,880
in a debate with Lois Lane.

420
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,650
But you do know the feeling,

421
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,080
that itch, that fire in the back of your head,

422
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,760
the siren song of a story that has to be written.

423
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,390
Yeah, I do, I do.

424
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,180
The world is gonna want to know why Lois Lane

425
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,220
went to Argo City with Superman.

426
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,050
Details, I'll make up a reason.

427
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,210
Oh, so much for truth in journalism.

428
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,510
Says the reporter who writes about

429
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,910
his own exploits as Superman.

430
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,380
I was the first human to set foot on what's left of Krypton,

431
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,880
to lay eyes on the Jewel Mountains,

432
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,850
to endure the endless,

433
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,110
torturous deliberations of the High Council,

434
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,890
and I have to write about it.

435
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,160
One small step for Lois Lane,

436
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,330
one giant leap for Lois Lane's career.

437
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,910
Says the woman who is already the most famous, feared,

438
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,730
and intrepid reporter on two planets.

439
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,920
And yet someone on this farm

440
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,130
is still making 21бщ on the dollar more than me.

441
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,030
And it ain't Kara, honey.

442
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,130
You two catch up.

443
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,780
I am gonna go slam some small things really hard.

444
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,140
Okay, just be careful on that ladder.

445
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,400
It's really old.

446
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,560
You'll catch me.

447
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,400
Break time, boss?

448
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,050
I've never been challenged like that before,

449
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,240
just to my face:

450
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,080
"Tell us who you are, Supergirl."

451
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,810
Well, except for Ms. Grant.

452
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,560
Well, and I'm sure it was harder

453
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,920
when it's the president doing the threatening.

454
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,220
- Cat was scarier. - Yeah.

455
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,320
Do you think I did the right thing?

456
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,670
Our secret identities, they protect the people we love

457
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,500
from being threatened by our enemies.

458
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,640
There aren't a lot of things more important than that.

459
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,320
I'm just sad I have to leave the DEO,

460
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,840
and now Alex is there alone. I feel like I let her down.

461
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,730
Oh, and then I left you to defend Earth alone

462
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,160
so I could go to Argo.

463
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,480
- Nah-- - I'm sorry.

464
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,390
No, don't be sorry about that. It's home.

465
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,080
I'm really glad you got to see it finally,

466
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,720
connect with it.

467
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,060
It was more than just connecting with our culture, you know?

468
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm okay.

469
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,690
You know, it was Lois.

470
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,280
Everything new that I experienced on Argo,

471
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,250
she was experiencing it too.

472
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,170
You know, out there we were-- we were both strange visitors.

473
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,440
I must sound so selfish.

474
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,080
No, love is the most unselfish thing in the world...

475
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,730
On any world.

476
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,900
Well, about that.

477
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,170
There's something that I've needed to talk to you about.

478
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,190
Okay.

479
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,970
Wait, wait, wait.

480
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,190
- Who are you? - We come in peace.

481
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,890
Lois, wait, wait.

482
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,040
This is Barry and Oliver. They're friends.

483
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,730
Wait.

484
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,230
So you know that I'm Oliver and he's Barry?

485
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,910
Yeah, w--why wouldn't I?

486
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,380
Oh, man.

487
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,330
Okay.

488
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,690
Um, you guys, this is my cousin Clark.

489
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,200
I'm so glad you get to meet.

490
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,900
Your cousin. That cousin?

491
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,840
The super cousin?

492
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,850
Oh, please, call me Clark.

493
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,320
Uh, welcome to our farm.

494
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,450
Cool.

495
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,180
Are you puffing out your chest?

496
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,210
Yes.

497
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,540
Lois Lane, "Daily Planet."

498
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,770
Wait, why did you guys think I wouldn't recognize you?

499
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,670
Well...

500
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,930
Oh. Well, that's new.

501
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,820
We could use your help.

502
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,100
{\an9}All units to Waid and Augustyn.

504
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,350
Something's destroying IVO Labs.

507
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,910
He has our powers.

508
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,530
Okay, come on, man.

509
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,830
I mean, I've been shooting paint cans all afternoon.

510
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,960
Unless--unless a paint can rewrote reality

511
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,090
- and made us swap lives... - I get it.

512
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,110
Then you need actual combat training, Barry.

513
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,300
All right, fine. You know what?

514
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,560
Why don't you go over there, run at me,

515
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,620
and I'll try and hit you with an arrow.

516
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,130
Right, okay.

517
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,880
Where did you bury the remote control bows?

518
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,090
Dude.

519
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,840
Come on, I'm not you.

520
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,690
Yeah, well, okay.

521
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,290
Ready!

522
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,830
Here we go.

523
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,630
Nice try.

524
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,940
Oh, I've been waiting four years for that, man.

525
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,290
Oh, it's priceless. Hold on.

526
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,510
Need to get a photo.

527
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,350
What?

528
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,750
I got it, don't worry. Hold on a second.

529
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,590
That's great.

530
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,930
You think this is funny?

531
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,950
Do you think my skills are a joke?

532
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,670
Come on, man.

533
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,500
I was a much better sport when you shot me.

534
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,900
I shot you to teach you how to case an environment.

535
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,390
You shot me to get a laugh.

536
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,570
- All right. - You know what?

537
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,440
Fine, fine. Come at me.

538
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,050
Try to get--try to get one hit in.

539
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,460
Deck him, Barry!

540
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,820
What? He's a jerk.

541
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,750
I'm not doing this. This isn't how I train.

542
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,740
Oh, you train? Really?

543
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,320
I thought your powers just dropped out of the sky.

544
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,530
If you're trying to get a rise out of me,

545
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,440
it's not gonna work.

546
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
Need a peanut gallery?

547
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
Can you not do anything without your wife in your ear?

548
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,540
Are you serious, man?

549
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,100
Felicity invented quarterbacking.

550
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,150
I don't think that you can go more than nine hours

551
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,900
without some sappy motivational speech.

552
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,830
I'm not doing this.

553
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,970
Your team betrayed you.

554
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,800
You needed them, and they weren't there.

555
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,120
I'm not doing this.

556
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,050
You know, if you really knew how to use my speed,

557
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,960
I never could have laid a finger on you.

558
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,270
That's the guy who attacked us at Ivo Laboratories,

559
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,640
Anti-Meta-human Adaptive Zootomic Organism.

560
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,000
A-m-a-z-o, "Amazo."

561
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,640
Sometimes these things just fall into your lap.

562
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,850
It says Ivo Labs was contracted by ARGUS

563
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,370
to build a unit capable of identifying meta-powers.

564
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,540
He doesn't just scan powers.

565
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,160
He's pumping a nano-adaptive hybrid of the "Mirakuru" Serum.

566
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,680
So that's how he stole our powers.

567
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,450
He scanned our meta-human genes,

568
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,430
then used the Mirakuru hybrid to copy them.

571
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,250
is coming to klaatu barada kick-to our asses,

572
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,750
and we can't let out Flash and Green Arrow to fight it?

573
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,530
Well, we could if they were still here.

574
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,850
Why don't you tell them, Iris West-Allen, what happened.

575
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,860
Hurry.

576
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,650
You let them out?

577
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,400
Okay, look, I know what you're thinking.

578
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,280
But I spoke to Oliver, or whoever he is,

579
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,580
and I could feel something.

580
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,990
Guys, I felt like I was really talking to Barry.

581
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
I believe you.

582
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,720
It is weird out there.

583
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,770
These red skies, Barry and Oliver--that,

584
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,550
and I vibed somebody in the Speed Lab.

585
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,580
- What? - Yeah.

586
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,650
Some guy with ridges on his head,

587
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,190
these big muttonchops.

588
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,500
Do you think that the red skies, this guy,

589
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,260
these disparate events are somehow connected?

590
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,210
So Barry and Oliver were mind-swapped

591
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,860
by a guy with muttonchops?

592
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,240
Man, it's not even Tuesday.

595
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,580
It's AMAZO.

596
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,520
He just entered city limits.

599
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,350
Don't tell me you came to say sorry.

600
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,950
I try to avoid saying that word.

601
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,800
Look, man, I get it.

602
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,920
You were just trying to help in your own Oliver way,

603
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,180
trying to get a rise out of me

604
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,670
so I'd fight like you.

605
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,740
Yeah, it's more than that, Barry.

606
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,250
I've been doing this for a very long time.

607
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,350
And nearly every time that I learn a lesson,

608
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,100
it comes with a painful memory.

609
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,910
Watched friends die. I've had to kill to survive.

610
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,620
When I'm the Green Arrow,

611
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,290
I channel those painful memories.

612
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,100
I--I draw on a darkness

613
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,920
every time I draw back my bow.

614
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,200
So to see you with all of my abilities,

615
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,930
just laughing and joking around,

616
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,270
it pissed me off,

617
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,130
more than I would care to admit.

618
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,380
Whenever I run, whatever I'm feeling inside,

619
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,370
grief, guilt, I've gotta just let it go

620
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,200
and focus on whatever I'm running toward:

621
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,170
Iris, my friends, all the joy in my life.

622
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,180
When I'm happy, I run faster,

623
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,520
just like when you phased earlier.

624
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,140
You were having a good time.

625
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,320
You couldn't dislocate your thumb until you got angry.

626
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,630
If you're gonna be the Green Arrow

627
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,930
and I'm gonna be the Flash...

628
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,490
Maybe we need to start acting more like each other.

629
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,120
Yes, finally, God.

630
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Super hearing, sorry.

631
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,440
But I've been sitting in there

632
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,980
waiting for you guys to figure this out

633
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,910
because I have a lot of thoughts, okay?

634
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,880
I should smile more.

635
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,460
Yeah, maybe you should. It might help.

636
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,930
You guys have to act the parts.

637
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,040
Come on, try it.

638
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,930
What?

639
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm the Green Arrow.

640
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,580
Wear a mask.

641
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,970
Sound like that--I don't--

642
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,230
Cisco?

643
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,680
Hey, Supergirl, Barry...

644
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,380
Oliver.

645
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,450
You believe us now?

646
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,610
Yeah, we all do.

647
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,410
Sorry we locked you up.

648
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,230
But if you feel like forgiving us

649
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,360
and coming back to Earth-1,

650
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,400
we've got a little bit of a sitch back home,

651
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,190
like a please, for the love of God,

652
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,240
there's a killer robot destroying the city

653
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,400
kind of sitch.

654
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,850
We could use some help.

655
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,930
- Let's do it. - You wanna tag along?

658
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,850
Cool. Who are you?

659
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,570
A friend.

660
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,200
Where the hell is Cisco?

661
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,250
I'm right here.

662
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
And I brought the big guns.

663
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,450
What are they doing?

664
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,630
Trying to keep AMAZO off balance

665
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,840
before it has time to replicate their abilities.

666
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,000
Finish him.

667
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,120
No sign of movement.

668
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,900
Nice work.

669
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,800
We got lucky.

670
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,880
Uh, guys, you might want to get out of the way.

671
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,920
What the hell is he doing?

672
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,180
Exactly what we wanted to avoid.

673
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,930
Well, that's not great.

674
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,950
AMAZO copied all of their powers,

675
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,620
and now it's on the hunt for more.

676
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,740
Cisco, there's got to be something you can do to stop it.

679
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,010
It's a computer, right? So just turn it off.

680
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,680
- I hate it when you're right. - Well, I'm right.

681
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,040
Let's go.

682
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,620
- It can phase. - That's what that's called?

683
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,480
Well, we can't fight what we can't hit.

684
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,510
I've got an idea.

685
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,760
Bring him back here.

686
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,970
No problem.

687
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,320
Move.

688
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,690
When he comes back, knock him down.

689
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,840
He won't be able to phase and run at the same time.

690
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,070
Guys, where are we at?

691
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,130
I think we got it.

692
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,770
We reverse-engineered AMAZO's operating system

693
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,920
and whipped up a virus to wipe the CPU.

694
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,290
- Not so difficult. - Except...

695
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,750
Except it's a robot that has replicated

696
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,130
their super strengths, and, thus,

697
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,670
now it is impenetrable,

698
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,220
so you cannot put the virus inside it.

699
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,390
That's not great.

700
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,710
Okay, so what do we do?

701
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,260
Look, if AMAZO inherited all of their strengths,

702
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,780
then maybe it inherited their weaknesses too.

703
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,320
Only we're not gonna weaken it, Iris.

704
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,100
We're gonna send it straight to hell.

705
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
Oliver, you're gonna have to counteract AMAZO's phasing

706
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,510
while Supergirl and Superman hold it.

707
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,300
- Got it. - I'll only have one shot.

708
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,460
Now, bring me that virus, Cisco.

709
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,710
Come here.

710
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,870
Get ready.

711
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,950
Done.

712
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,980
Don't miss.

713
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,200
I won't.

714
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,510
Hurry up!

715
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,000
AMAZO, you have failed this city.

717
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,120
AMAZO has been dismantled

718
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,900
and every piece locked up in a S.T.A.R. Labs vault

719
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,850
except for this one. This is my souvenir.

720
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,790
A round of applause, everybody.

721
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,570
Felicitations, Flash.

722
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,900
That's quite a performance you did out there.

723
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,590
Well, I appreciate that, but still Oliver Queen.

724
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,920
And I am still Barry Allen.

725
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,140
I don't know, guys.

726
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,530
You took down AMAZO in one shot.

727
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,150
Only the Green Arrow can do that.

728
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,880
And, Oliver, you outran AMAZO, just like the Flash.

729
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,350
Maybe we should stick with this whole body swap thing

730
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,130
for a while.

731
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,290
Seems to be working okay.

732
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,370
I don't know that anybody would be too worried

733
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,930
if you two don't switch back.

734
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

735
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,840
We need to figure out who did this to Barry and Oliver

736
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,480
and why and then we're gonna reverse it, okay?

737
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,860
Caitlin, any thoughts?

738
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,110
I haven't quite figured it out yet,

739
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,640
but until I do, I am confident

740
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,340
that Central City and Star City are in good hands.

741
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaking of "In good hands,"

742
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,400
I should probably get back to Metropolis and Lois.

743
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,580
If anything were to happen,

744
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,150
her entire world's unprotected.

745
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,430
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

746
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,330
Thank you for helping us, Clark.

747
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,180
We couldn't have stopped AMAZO without you.

748
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,330
Oh, not so sure about that.

749
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,070
Hello, uh, Clark.

750
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,340
Help a genius out, would you?

751
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,540
Look, I want to give you this check...

752
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,840
I do this for free, the whole helping humanity thing.

753
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,480
Oh, you think that I'm giving...

754
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,560
no, no, not for that.

755
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,770
This is a alimony check for my third wife.

756
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,180
She also live on Earth-38,

757
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,390
and I might be a little bit behind in the payment.

758
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,180
If you could just do me the favor...

759
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,630
You want me to deliver this to your ex-wife?

760
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,620
To my ex-wife, my third ex-wife.

761
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,160
You're welcome.

762
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,720
You're welcome too.

763
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,940
It's super.

764
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,890
Man, I can trust him, right?

765
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,220
Are you okay?

766
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,980
No.

767
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,570
You did a great job with AMAZO,

768
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,960
but at what cost, Barry?

769
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,400
What do you mean?

770
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,570
Do you know why I let you and Oliver go?

771
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,360
It was because of something that I felt.

772
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,020
When I stopped looking with my eyes

773
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,160
and I started listening with my heart,

774
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,630
I realized that you,

775
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,950
Barry Allen, have always been

776
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,850
and will always be the man that I love.

777
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,140
No matter what mask I wear,

778
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,500
I'll always show you my true face.

779
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,440
I need you to promise me something, Barry.

780
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,240
Promise me that when we figure out who did this to you

781
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,820
and when you get your speed back

782
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,140
and you're finally back in my arms...

783
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,500
That'll you'll come back to me.

784
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,450
Of course I'll come back.

785
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Barry, I heard what you said right before you took that shot.

786
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,680
You're the Green Arrow now.

787
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,150
But please don't become Oliver Queen.

788
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,900
I won't.

789
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,120
I promise.

790
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,850
Barry, we need you in the workshop.

791
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,150
So you think this person you saw has something to do

792
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,940
with what's happened to Barry and Oliver?

793
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,330
I mean, I saw him right after

794
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,790
these two swapped capes.

795
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,830
You've been having trouble with your vibes lately, right?

796
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,420
- Maybe it's that? - No.

797
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,230
This was beyond me.

798
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,670
It felt like something important.

799
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,750
We need to see it.

800
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,760
Okay, hang on.

801
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,880
My God, I can see everything.

802
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,180
Fascinating.

803
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,390
I wouldn't have thought the men of this Earth

804
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,010
had this capacity.

805
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,630
But it won't avail you.

806
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,100
None of you can stop what's been set into motion.

807
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,670
You're best off giving up now,

808
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,000
because nothing you can do can alter

809
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,370
what's about to happen.

810
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,910
Are you okay?

811
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,200
No, not even close.

812
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,120
What did you see?

813
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,210
This.

814
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,810
I don't recognize him.

815
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,920
Doesn't matter.

816
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,750
I know where to find him.

817
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,760
So what's our next move?

818
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,030
We go to Gotham city.
