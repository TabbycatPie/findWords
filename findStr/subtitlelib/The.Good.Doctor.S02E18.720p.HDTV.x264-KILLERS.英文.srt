20
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,610
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,320
I tried to help you, and you pushed me away.

22
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,470
It can't just be about having fun together.

23
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,820
If I have to call security,

24
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,840
you understand that I'm also gonna have to fire you.

25
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,540
I am a surgeon!

26
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,490
I am -- I am a surgeon!

27
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,250
I am a surgeon, Dr. Han!

28
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,940
Why are you sad?

29
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,100
I'm not sad.

30
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,590
Is there another reason to get drunk at 10 in the morning?

31
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,460
Shut up.

32
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,470
It's fun to drink with someone who is fun.

33
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,460
Lea is fun. You're not fun.

34
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,870
Shut up.

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,570
No.

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,050
If I have something to say,

37
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,290
I will say it.

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,270
Well, if I have someone to shut up,

39
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,570
then I'll shut them up.

40
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,140
If I have something to s--

41
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,940
Okay, I do not like to be touched.

42
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,120
Just shut up.

43
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,820
I am a surgeon.

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,400
You've had sex with each other.

45
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,480
Yes.

46
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,770
And you're planning on doing so again?

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,430
- Yes. - Good news.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,760
Because neither of you are in a subservient position to the other.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Well, sometimes.

50
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,590
You work together and you are sleeping together.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,230
You don't see any way that can go wrong?

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,910
Nothing for your employer to worry about?

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm going to interview each of you separately

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,640
to ensure that the relationship is consensual.

55
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,500
Zack Cordell, 31, loss of consciousness,

56
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,630
laceration with closed head injury,

57
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,210
possible brain contusion.

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,380
- GCS score? - Nine.

59
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,850
Dr. Murphy thinks it might be an epidural hematoma.

60
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,850
- Dr. Murphy? - Yeah, he's...

61
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,890
Where'd he go?

62
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,010
Shaun?

63
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,130
Come in.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,220
Tell us what you saw, what you did.

65
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,070
I can't.

66
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,770
I'm not a doctor here.

67
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,590
You're still a doctor, Shaun.

68
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,150
We need to know what happened.

69
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,670
I found him like that.

70
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,970
I want a STAT head CT.

71
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,350
Get me a CBC and a tox screen.

72
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,950
It might be an epidural hematoma.

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,040
We heard.

74
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,630
Let's get a bolt ICP monitor ready.

75
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,110
- I'm on it. - Dr. Lim...

76
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,370
How was your meeting?

77
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,960
I confirmed the lack of inducement or pressure.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,490
I assume you did likewise.

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,330
We are approved.

80
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,690
For what?

81
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,000

I farted, I peed, I pooped,

everything is working as well as I can possibly hope.

88
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,440
We just need to know there are no post-surgical complications.

89
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,500
You're not wearing a wedding ring.

90
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm not married.

91
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,390
Well, gays can get married --

92
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,680
they have children -- you need to have children.

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,980
I'll tell you what's more interesting

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,950
than a non-married woman not wearing a ring.

95
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,790
Dr. Park here wears a wedding ring

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,510
even though he's not married.

97
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,980
I'm divorced,

98
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,440
but we're trying to reconcile.

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,340
Well, good for you.

100
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,380
- Kids? - A son.

101
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,190
BP looks good.

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,980
How often do you see them?

103
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,330
Dinners, I hope.

104
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,690
I mean, dinners are really important.

105
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,940
- They live in Phoenix. - Oh, no.

106
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,300
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,750
JP drain site looks good with no bilious output.

108
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,740
Do you have any other symptoms?

109
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,060
I-I've got a bit of a stomachache,

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,400
because of those nasty veggie slushies

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,540
Dr. Mitzger has me on.

112
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,510
Does this look inflamed?

113
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,570
I don't think she's ready to go.

114
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,320
What? Why not?

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,150
We need to order an abdominal ultrasound --

116
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,850
make sure you don't have a deep post-surgical abscess.

117
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,740
Hopefully just one more day with us, Ida.

118
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,940
I am concerned about how you dealt with Dr. Murphy.

119
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,710
Have you known anyone else with ASD?

120
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,690
Not well. Have you?

121
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,840
When you give people responsibility they can't handle,

122
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
the results can be devastating.

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,220
Well, every time Dr. Murphy's been given responsibility,

124
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,880
he's risen to the occa--

125
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,330
He's never been given responsibility.

126
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,450
He's been given things to do,

127
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,700
but always with someone right behind him.

128
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,650
I'm the first one to really challenge him.

129
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,070
And he failed.

130
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,390
Are you okay?

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes.

132
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,830
When something bad happens, we have to remember

133
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,230
we're not defined by any one thing.

134
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,150
You're not just a doctor, Shaun.

135
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,990
You're a good friend,

136
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,330
a good person.

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,390
There are so many things you can do.

138
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,500
What do you want?

139
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,210
I want...

140
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,500
to be a surgeon.

141
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,000
What else?

142
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,000
What else do you want?

143
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,980
I want what everybody wants.

144
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,370
I want...

145
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,890
I want my life to matter.

146
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,410
I want to have fun. I...

147
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to fall in love.

148
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,760
I think I'd be a good father.

149
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,460
I think you will be, too.

150
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,500
But I don't know how to fall in love.

151
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,600
Good morning, Claire.

152
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,660
Good morning.

153
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,980
Here are some chocolates.

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,330
They're not really chocolates.

155
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,200
Here's a stapler,

156
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,730
which represents flowers.

157
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,540
Thank you.

158
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,540
These flowers are beautiful.

159
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,530
You have nice hair.

160
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,640
Thank you, Shaun.

161
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,690
I like your shirt.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,840
It's old.

163
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,400
I was wondering if you would like...

164
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,640
to...

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,370
Say the words.

166
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,950
There could be other people there that would be distracting.

167
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,890
There could be noises that would be distracting.

168
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,940
She could misunderstand my question.

169
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,530
- You can't let that... - She could say no.

170
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,250
Shaun.

171
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,330
She will.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,710
Y-you don't know.

173
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,110
Someone will.

174
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,050
Shaun, you're gonna fall in love,

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,540
and you're gonna have your heart broken.

176
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,790
And you're gonna fall in love again.

177
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,430
And you're gonna lose your job again.

178
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,490
- No. ? - Yeah.

179
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,900
This is life. You know that.

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,840
You've been hurt. And you've survived.

181
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,640
You've gotten stronger, better.

182
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,570
Not better.

183
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,480
It's not better.

184
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,920
Zack's tests are ready.

185
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,330
Large iced, extra shot.

186
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,830
Oh, no. No extra shot for me today.

187
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm already kinda up.

188
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,570
Having a good day? ?

189
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,370
yeah, a real doozy.

190
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,350
As of today, I'm officially cancer free.

191
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,470
- That's fantastic. - Thank you.

192
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm so happy for you.

193
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,890
You just got yourself

194
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,670
a free coffee.

195
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,680
Thank you. I got you something, too.

196
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,970
A Model J.

197
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,210
Just like the one that we never got to see

198
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,760
at the car show we never made it to.

199
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,460
Open up the hood. Check out the engine.

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,220
Oh, okay.

201
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,480
You're right.

202
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,260
We're too old to just have fun. ?

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,940
I-I want to commit.

204
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,580
Commit?

205
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,640
I meant commit to a relationship.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,850
Not to, like, pledging our...

207
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,740
never-ending love before God.

208
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,820
In sickness and in health. That's what you wanted.

209
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,250
I have just been through the seven levels of Hell.

210
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,300
I am ready to embrace life, to be bold.

211
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,300
This is definitely bold.

212
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,890
It's -- it's also...

213
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,520
It's also stupid.

214
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,180
I made it a part of our wedding vows.

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,220
Marty and I pledged we would never be apart

216
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,800
for more than five days at a time,

217
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,390
and we never were.

218
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,220
Until he died two years ago.

219
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,420
I made my daughter put it in her vows.

220
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,500
Junie lives in Napa.

221
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,700
Three children -- two boys and a girl.

222
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,630
You're still young.

223
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,430
You should give your son a brother and sister.

224
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,570
Everything looks great.

225
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,080
I think we can send you home.

226
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
Good.

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,580
Junie's driving in with her youngest.

228
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,760
I-I can't feel my fingers.

229
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,610
Other than the contusions, no hematoma.

230
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,010
I wish you were back in Path.

231
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,920
I don't wish I was back in Path.

232
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,420
CBC is normal.

233
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,700
Tox screen is basically clear.

234
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,330
No drugs, trace amounts of alcohol.

235
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,030
Maybe he tripped and hit his head.

236
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,970
No. His gait was erratic,

237
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,190
and so was his behavior --

238
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,340
both highly suggestive of intoxication.

239
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,330
I thought you found him unconscious.

240
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,550
What happened?

241
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,060
Did he do something to you?

242
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,130
Say something to you?

243
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,550
Shaun?

244
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,370
You never lie.

245
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,120
Why would you lie about this?

246
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,030
If Zack wasn't intoxicated, 

247
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,740
then he has a neurological issue --

248
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,470
you need to run an EEG and a CT angiogram.

249
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,560
I have to go.

250
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
Could be Guillain-Barré, maybe peripheral neuropathy.

251
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,450
I think we should perform an EMG

252
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,890
and a nerve conduction study.

253
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,930
- What do you want to do? - Send her home.

254
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,700
I think she's making it up.

255
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,030
Her symptoms are very mild,

256
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,700
very typical post-op reactions --

257
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,010
except the one that suddenly appeared

258
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,860
as soon as we told her she could go home.

259
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,810
She's just lonely, looking for attention.

260
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,520
She can be lonely and sick.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,600
According to the MRI, she's just lonely.

262
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,740
It's no fun releasing a patient

263
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,020
only to find them in the morgue 24 hours later.

264
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,150
Recheck her history, run whatever tests you need,

265
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,020
- rule out everything you can. - Thank you.

266
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,360
And congratulations.

267
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,450
You and Dr. Lim.

268
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,060
It's an excellent match.

269
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,220
I have a sample I'd like you to test.

270
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,360
Shaun, you don't work here anymore.

271
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,930
How do you have a patient?

272
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,850
It's Claire's patient.

273
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,830
There's no patient name on it.

274
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,520
What are... this patient's symptoms?

275
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,940
He's coughing blood.

276
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll expedite the test.

277
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,580
We'll get the data analyzed by a neurologist as soon as possible.

278
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,540
And when it comes back okay,

279
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,980
we could have you discharged by the end of the day.

280
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,610
You said "When"...

281
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,480
You think I'm making this up?

282
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,750
Wasting your time?

283
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,110
- No, I -- - Yes.

284
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,620
I do.

285
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,210
- You're right. - You're faking?

286
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,570
No.

287
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,750
Not entirely.

288
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,290
I can feel my fingers.

289
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,340
- But they're tingling. - Because you're 87, Ida.

290
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,500
These are just symptoms of old age.

291
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,260
Junie had leukemia.

292
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,190
Months of chemo, and she just got sicker and weaker.

293
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,760
Three days before her 9th birthday,

294
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,520
two oncologists said there was nothing more they could do.

295
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,100
Told us that she would never make it through the night.

296
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,260
They said it was pointless, "Oh, it-- it's so cruel."

297
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,530
But it wasn't their little girl who was dying.

298
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,670
The next morning

299
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,060
Junie was still alive.

300
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,040
And the morning after that, she opened her eyes, and...

301
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,960
all the people said, "Oh, it's a miracle."

302
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,790
But it wasn't a miracle.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,620
Junie is alive with three beautiful children

304
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,220
only because I refused to let those doctors

305
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,760
tell me what to do.

306
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,040
And now that I'm old,

307
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,810
they give me even less credit.

308
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,830
We'll let you know the test results.

309
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,030
WBC and PT are elevated,

310
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,100
and hemoglobins are a little low.

311
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,810
It could be pneumonia, DIC --

312
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,760
It's trauma-induced,

313
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,620
- or more like - Trauma?

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,680
Then coagulopathy is possible,

315
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,230
making bleeding worse.

316
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,670
You need to get the patient

317
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,380
on phytonadione as soon as possible.

318
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm writing a script.

319
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,480
You'll tell your patient how important this is, right?

320
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,250
Good news, Ida.

321
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,230
Normal electrical activity at rest,

322
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,350
normal action potentials with contraction.

323
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,530
Thank you.

324
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,070
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

325
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,700
You don't have to listen to your doctors.

326
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,550
But you do have to be honest with them.

327
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,560
Park.

328
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,500
Bile.

329
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,820
They're treating you for rhabdomyolysis.

330
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,590
That makes sense.

331
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,520
- Why are you here? - I am a doctor.

332
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are you sad?

333
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,290
I'm sad and angry and...

334
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,790
confused and I don't know.

335
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,540
I wasn't supposed to be at the bar.

336
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,060
I was supposed to be at a job interview.

337
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,620
Dr. Glassman got me a job interview,

338
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,690
but I don't want a new job,

339
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,600
and people tell me that I have to move on,

340
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,720
but why can't I just be sad

341
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,620
and angry and...

342
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,100
It's not rhabdo.

343
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,860
You need immediate treatment.

344
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:12,940
What?

345
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,530
Wh-- For what?

346
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,860
For what? For what?!

347
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,290
Dr. Murphy?

348
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,050
I need help in here!

349
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,650
Left hemothorax and grade 2 splenic laceration

350
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,350
resulting from a rib fracture.

351
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,990
Inserted a chest tube to reduce the blood pooling

352
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,350
in the pleural cavity.

353
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,520
Any idea what caused the trauma?

354
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Zack Cordell beat him up.

355
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
The patient he brought in?

356
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,230
Shaun told you?

357
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,790
Not explicitly.

358
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,240
But...he was acting strange from the minute they came in.

359
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,620
Shaun acting strange isn't strange.

360
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,790
Excuse me.

361
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
Dr. Murphy saved another person today.

362
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,180
Encountering an emergency is not a job qualification.

363
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,110
And how can you trust a doctor

364
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,570
who doesn't have the sense to tell someone

365
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,410
he was injured before passing out?

366
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,520
It's no longer a request, Jackson.

367
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,850
Am I only allowed to do my job when you agree with me?

368
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,450
You knew someone on the spectrum.

369
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,650
What happened to them?

370
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
They died.

371
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,840
But if either of us are making decisions

372
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,170
based on our personal experiences,

373
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,860
we're making the wrong decisions.

374
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,280
You paid a lot of money for my judgment.

375
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,680
Too much, I'm starting to think.

376
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,910
Well, that was the point.

377
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,140
I didn't need the money.

378
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,830
I needed the commitment.

379
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,880
You went out on a limb for me.

380
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,480
You fire me now,

381
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,380
you look like a fool in front of the board.

382
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,640
It's not the clips;

383
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,980
Ida needs to be opened up again.

384
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,730
That's too bad.

385
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,520
There's one other test I'd like to try.

386
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,250
I'm starting to feel some pain on my left side.

387
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,870
It's important for a doctor

388
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,410
to use all their senses.

389
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,270
Tastes like... a bit of kale,

390
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,420
seven delicious vegetables...

391
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,940
Good news is you don't have a potentially fatal bile duct issue.

392
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,530
The bad news is

393
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,240
we know you've been dumping your veggie slushie

394
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,390
into your drain to make us think you were sick.

395
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,570
You'll be discharged this afternoon.

396
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,060
You asked to see me?

397
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,750
Yeah, for the last two hours.

398
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm sorry. I've been dealing with Dr. Murphy.

399
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,900
It seems someone beat him up.

400
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,680
Quite severely.

401
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,280
Yeah, that shouldn't have happened,

402
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
but before he passed out,

403
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,030
he said he knew what was wrong with me.

404
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,610
Well, we all know what's wrong with you.

405
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,450
You're an ass with a head trauma and rhabdo.

406
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,890
He said you're wrong.

407
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,370
He kind of spaced out all distracted,

408
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,440
then he said that I don't have that and that I need treatment.

409
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,570
Distracted how?

410
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,960
Like, he was looking around

411
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,070
trying to find something in the air, I don't know.

412
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,120
And then it looked like he found it.

413
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,910
What exactly did he say?

414
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,710
Trampoline?

415
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,670
And? ?That's it.

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,810
You know Shaun. It could be a reference

417
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,290
to something he read somewhere.

418
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,550
It could be a metaphor.

419
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,020
It could be the guy misheard.

420
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,380
It could be delirium.

421
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,610
Shaun had a systolic pressure of 70;

422
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,070
he may have been hallucinating;

423
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,760
he may have just been wrong.

424
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,080
He's hypotensive, O2 SATs are dropping.

425
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,560
- He's crashing! - Bag him.

426
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,940
Bolus five units of vasopressin and start a drip.

427
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,270
"Trampoline,"

428
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,340
from the Spanish word trampolino,

429
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,350
meaning "springboard,"

430
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,180
from the Italian root trampoli,

431
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,720
meaning "stilts."

432
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,060
Maybe Shaun was talking about

433
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,480
an excessive growth disorder like acromegaly.

434
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,230
But instead of just saying the name of the disorder,

435
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,480
he used the English translation

436
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,630
of the Spanish derivative of the Italian?

437
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,820
Maybe we should just wake him up.

438
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
His respiratory status is too fragile.

439
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,780
We have a very sick patient. If Shaun can save his life --

440
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,620
We have two very sick patients,

441
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
and if there's a 1% chance that waking Shaun

442
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,030
will risk his life I say we don't do it.

443
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,320
We shouldn't need Shaun.

444
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,960
We can figure this out ourselves.

445
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,070
What do we know?

446
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,680
Low BP, nausea, and dizziness,

447
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,290
erratic gait and behavior.

448
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,640
Adrenal insufficiency could explain his gait and BP.

449
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,340
We'd be seeing hyperpigmentation.

450
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,440
- Botulism? ? - There'd be descending paralysis;

451
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,470
if anything he has ascending.

452
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,260
Lyme disease?

453
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,180
Explains fatigue and dizziness and, if advanced,

454
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,530
impaired muscle movement.

455
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,850
And an arrhythmia could be lowering his BP.

456
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,310
None of this sounds like...

457
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,270
"trampoline."

458
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,910
Let's get him started on 100 milligrams of doxycycline.

459
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,760
Do you need --

460
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,550
Sorry, sorry.

461
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,180
You were on duty when Dr. Murphy passed out, right?

462
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,490
I was first one in.

463
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,060
Is this where he was standing?

464
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,940
I think he was closer to the patient.

465
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,070
W-what about the blinds? Were they like that?

466
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Please, I need to know what Shaun's experience was

467
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,290
when he was standing here.

468
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,880
Also, could I get a step stool?

469
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,470
Sure.

470
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,390
Thanks.

471
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Why can't you get him his job back?

472
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
You were the president for, like, a hundred years.

473
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,190
I'm gonna fight for him, but I'm only one vote.

474
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,280
We all get smacked around.

475
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,910
We got to learn to take the hits,

476
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,790
lick our wounds, and move on.

477
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,330
He likes you, you know?

478
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,840
Yeah, I like him, too.

479
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,130
He likes you more.

480
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,320
When he gets rejected,

481
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,840
I'm glad it's coming from somebody who cares about him.

483
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,110
We need an OR stat!

484
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,330
Hey, Shaun.

486
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,670
It's me, Auntie Em.

487
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,520
What are you doing in my room?

488
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,340
No, Shaun, we're in the hospital.

489
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,440
You were pretty bad earlier,

490
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,930
- but now you -- - Zack -- Zack --

491
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,360
Zack has the wrong diagnosis.

492
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,410
- No, no, no, Shaun. I know. - No, no, he'll --

493
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,220
- It's fine. It's actually fine. - He'll die

494
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,080
unless he's treated immediately.

495
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,040
- Shaun, it's fine. - No, he needs --

496
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,230
"Trampoline."

497
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,580
Zack had an aortic arch aneurysm

498
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,460
with signs of impending rupture,

499
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,590
the evidence of which was a pulsatile mass in his neck.

500
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,840
That and his erratic gait and behavior

501
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,790
are explained by the fact that he had tertiary syphilis.

502
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,460
Also known as...

503
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,310
Treponema.

504
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,500
Zack misheard you,

505
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,270
but we were able to repair the aneurysm,

506
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,630
and he is stable now.

507
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,670
Okay.

508
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,300
Okay.

509
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,930
All right.

510
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,310
Lie down, Dorothy. Get some rest, all right?

511
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,440
We finally got her history.

512
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,360
Those doctors who said Junie wouldn't survive the night,

513
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,400
they were right.

514
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,280
Three days before her 9th birthday, Junie died.

515
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,450
Ida never had any grandchildren.

516
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,910
What about her husband?

517
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,390
He did pass away two years ago,

518
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,920
but he and Ida separated after their daughter's death.

519
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,880
It doesn't change anything medically.

520
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,570
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,960
You know what $300,000 can get you in Tempe?

522
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,600
How are you doing?

523
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,620
I have an O2 SAT of 97%

524
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,450
and urine output of 200cc an hour,

525
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,600
so I'm doing well.

526
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,670
I just got off the phone

527
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,990
with Dr. Turner at San Jose General.

528
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,030
You missed a job interview?

529
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,370
I like being a surgeon here.

530
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,170
But you're not anymore.

531
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,880
And we can't change that.

532
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,850
Shaun.

533
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,100
Both of us --

534
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,230
we need to face reality.

535
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,960
My brother Steve said

536
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,510
that whenever people want you to do something

537
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,030
they think is wrong,

538
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,160
they say it's "reality."

539
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,730
Yesterday Dr. Shaun Murphy

540
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,420
did something that was different.

541
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,070
And it wasn't because he showed mercy

542
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,740
to someone who had been cruel and violent to him,

543
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,270
although that's extraordinary.

544
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,370
What was different is that yesterday, Dr. Shaun Murphy

545
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,910
made Dr. Claire Browne a better doctor.

546
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,130
Why? Because Dr. Claire Browne

547
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,420
looked at a problem through Dr. Murphy's eyes

548
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,990
and she saved a life.

549
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,990
And that's extraordinary.

550
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,040
Dr. Han,

551
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,850
Dr. Murphy may not communicate like you do.

552
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,480
He may not communicate like I do, but make no mistake.

553
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,800
He does communicate.

554
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,090
And he inspires.

555
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,470
Well, welcome back to the Board, Dr. Glassman.

556
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,030
I've heard of your insights and passion,

557
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,730
and I'm grateful to witness it.

558
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,060
Thank you.

559
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,480
But I didn't fire Dr. Murphy because he doesn't inspire.

560
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,190
I fired him because he was irrational,

561
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,030
unprofessional.

562
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,880
He couldn't calm down.

563
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,740
He couldn't control himself.

564
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,370
I stand by that decision.

565
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,720
And if Dr. Glassman insists on putting this to a vote,

566
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,540
the issue isn't whether Dr. Murphy should be working here.

567
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,460
The issue is whether I should.

568
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,010
Whether I control my staff.

569
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,800
Because I can't work here if I don't.

570
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,020
Okay.

571
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,170
I don't think there's anything else on the agenda, so...

572
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,320
Steve was right.

573
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,410
And Dr. Glassman is right.

574
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,640
You're gonna propose his motion?

575
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,390
Dr. Andrews, I don't think you have the votes to carry it.

576
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,410
I agree.

577
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,040
But I don't need the votes.

578
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,060
Just as you have the power to fire someone

579
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,970
under your supervision, so do I.

580
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,050
You're gonna fire me to save Dr. Murphy.

581
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,640
He's not ready to move on.

582
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,600
Neither am I.

583
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,420
Did you hear about Han?

584
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,970
Can't imagine Andrews will survive the fallout.

585
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,210
They're gonna need a new Chief of Surgery;

586
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,270
what if either of us is offered the job?

587
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,130
One of us bossing the other around?

588
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,540
I don't think that would fly with HR.

589
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,420
Someone would have to resign.

590
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,050
Or we'd have to break up.

591
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,470
Or...

592
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
we could turn it down...

593
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,020
I think... things are great.

594
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,810
And they've been great for, what, four weeks now?

595
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,150
Just over a month.

596
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,710
It'd be crazy to pass on a chance

597
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,110
at being a department head.

598
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,950
Are you that crazy?

599
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,290
No.

600
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,580
Are you?

601
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,750
No.

602
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,710
Good.

603
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,130
I talked to Andrews' assistant.

604
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,300
Aoki should be calling you with the offer any minute.

605
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,990
You'd better answer.

606
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,110
Hello.

607
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,660
Ms. Aoki, it's good to hear from you.

608
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,050
Hi...Shaun.

609
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,180
I got my job back.

610
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,930
That's great.

611
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,400
I have a question for you.

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,150
Yes.

613
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,040
I don-- I don't mean yes.

614
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,650
I also don't mean no. Just what is the question?

615
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,580
Do I look nice?

616
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,550
Yes, Shaun.

617
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,960
You look very nice.

618
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,990
I know myself.

619
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,490
I know what I want,

620
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,990
and I know what I love.

621
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,160
You don't love me.

622
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,640
You barely know me.

623
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,750
I think I do.

624
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,670
I think I know you.

625
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,520
And, sure, we could go out on another date

626
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,850
and another date after that

627
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,460
and more dates after that, but life is short and getting shorter,

628
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,890
and I want to spend whatever time I have left with you.

629
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,310
When we're together,

630
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,750
it feels like we're speeding down the PCH in a Duesenberg,

631
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,040
12 cylinders with 400cc and turbo boosts

632
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,170
and picnic basket in the back with baguettes and Gruyère

633
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,170
and prosciutto and Chateauneuf du Pape,

634
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,720
and you're sitting next to me, wind in your hair,

635
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,540
and you're laughing that laugh,

636
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,080
and the sun, and the ocean.

637
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,210
And it just feels like we can go forever.

638
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,010
Debbie Wexler,

639
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,020
will you marry me?

640
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,770
Yes.

641
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,520
You have nice hair.

642
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,710
I know, fabulous. I was ju--

643
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,280
Here are flowers and chocolates.

644
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,450
Real ones.

645
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,620
I was wondering if...

646
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,130
you would like to...

647
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,270
eat dinner?

648
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,100
Are you asking me out?

649
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,360
Yes.

650
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,400
On a date?

651
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,200
Yes.

652
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,620
I would love to.
