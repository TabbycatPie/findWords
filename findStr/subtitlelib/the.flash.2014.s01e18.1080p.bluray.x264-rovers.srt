1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,767
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
My father went to
prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,522
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,208
And one day, I'll find who killed my
mother and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,930
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,243
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,880
Same. Well, as
fast as I can run.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,203
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism, A.T.O.M.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,931
- What are you gonna use that for?
- To protect people.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,082
You think Dr. Wells
killed Barry's mom?

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,090
I don't know yet, but I do
know that Wells keeps secrets.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,527
The way that he
described running...

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,286
feeling the wind
and the power...

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,681
it's like he was
talking from experience.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,290
Harrison Wells is
the Reverse-Flash.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,689
Eddie, we need your help.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,045
Pedal to the metal.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,843
We got a 10-31 in progress.
Shiny Diamond, 18th and Olive.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,482
- That's a few blocks from here. - Has
every crook in Central City gone crazy?

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,406
This is the third attempted robbery
tonight. Barry, we got another one.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,046
Hello.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,811
- Eighteenth and Olive.
- Got it.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,642
- Who's this?
- Oh.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,565
Indecent exposure. Powell Park.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,167
That ain't something
you should be showing people.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,171
They're getting away, guys.

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,170
- They're not getting away.
- Get these bozos up ahead first.

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,891
Then we'll worry about the
idiots at the Shiny Diamond.

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,168
- All right.
- Gonna run out of room, though.

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,964
I'll take care of that.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,327
What do you think
he meant by that?

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,522
Oh, that's what he meant.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,166
- I think we lost them.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,529
And by the way,
you're under arrest.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,401
We need to go. Now. Come on.

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,608
Uh-uh. Freeze.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,120
You guys missing these?

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,282
On the ground. On the ground.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,047
So, uh, I'm just curious...

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,771
but, um, have you guys
have not heard of me, or what?

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,729
Nice work, detective.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,323
- Good night, Dr. Kang.
- Good night.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,891
No. What...? Aah!

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,050
No!

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,324
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,251
Engineering professor at
Hudson University.

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Just got tenure.

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,764
Hey, so her whole body is covered
in these puncture wounds...

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
you see on her face.

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
Bites marks, maybe.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,841
Whatever it was, she must
have gone into anaphylaxis.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,445
- Damn.
- Yeah.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,241
The blood sample should tell us
everything. I'll run tests back at my lab.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,448
They can do it faster
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,524
Well, yeah, but I
mean, it's just...

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,762
It's just what?

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,921
It's kind of weird
being there right now.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,651
Barry, you know we have to
play it cool with Wells.

63
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,241
- If he finds out we suspect him...
- I know. I get it.

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,767
I just think that we should
tell Cisco and Caitlin.

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,090
They could help us.

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,920
The more people who know, the more chance
Wells is gonna find out we're onto him.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,128
What if one of them
slips up or panics?

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,649
- Or what if...?
- What?

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,723
What if they're not on our side?

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,488
No, absolutely not. They're not
involved in whatever he's planning.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,440
I mean, Wells is their boss, their mentor.
They've been with him for a long time.

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,491
I've seen plenty of people make
the wrong choice for loyalty.

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,611
Please, do not include them
until we can be sure.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,970
All right.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,685
- Death by apitoxin.
- Honeybee venom.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,003
Bees. Why did it
have to be bees?

77
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,642
Y'all, I don't do bees.
Ain't nobody got time for bees.

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
When a honeybee stings...

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,851
the stingers are torn from
their abdomen and they die.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,970
There were no stingers in the
body and no dead bees in the car.

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,648
A honeybee can only deposit 0.1 milligrams
of apitoxin when it releases its stinger.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,010
Yet Ms. Kang was found with enough venom
in her system to kill a herd of elephants.

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,010
It appears not only is a metahuman
controlling these bees...

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,960
but also increasing their toxicity. Bees
communicate by releasing pheromones.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,600
Maybe this meta is controlling
them through secretion?

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,047
Anyone wanna join me
in getting a beekeeper suit?

87
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,761
- I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bee.
- Just don't run into a lake.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,163
The bees will wait for you to come
up for air. Then they'll sting you.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,881
Discovery Channel. Turns out
there's a lot to discover.

90
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,568
Felicity, what are
you doing here?

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,530
Can you guys come
outside for a sec?

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,006
What exactly are we waiting for,
Ms. Smoak?

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,725
Up there.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,203
Is that a bird?

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,205
It's a plane.

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,003
It's my boyfriend.

97
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,927
Hi. I'm Ray.

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,366
So he seems a
little tall for you.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,602
Barry Allen, are you jealous?

100
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,805
No, no. I'm not jealous.

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,681
I just... I really wish you would
have called before flying in.

102
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,446
- Oh, no. He flew. I drove.
- I'm serious.

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,967
All right? Now is
not the best time.

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,322
Why? What's going on?

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,003
- Ah. My ears popped, so that's something.
- You're lucky you didn't break your neck.

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,766
What is it with billionaires
being superheroes?

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,526
So have you picked a name yet?

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,602
I'm kind of partial
to the Atom. Shhew.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,849
Are you married to that, or...?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,765
Your A.T.O.M. suit.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,727
Quite the technological
achievement, Mr. Palmer.

112
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,009
- I'm impressed.
- And he is never impressed.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,801
Well, thank you. But I can't
quite seem to keep it up.

114
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,167
He means the suit.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,970
Yeah, I mean the suit.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,721
I can attest that everything else works fine.
There's nothing we need to fix in that area.

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,451
- The sex is great.
- God, there's two of them.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,525
I know from Felicity that you have been
very helpful with Barry and the Flash suit.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,843
And I was hoping to get
another set of eyes on my...

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
- Problem?
- ...problem.

121
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,685
- Any friend of the Arrow's is
the friend of... - Hell, yes.

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,004
Uh, guys, we kind of have a lot
going on already.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,363
There's a metahuman killer that
can control a whole swarm of bees.

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,766
Cool.

125
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,766
I mean awful.

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,571
I'm sure Caitlin and I will
provide ample support, Barry.

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,564
And I will be happy
to sit this one out.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,530
You...?

129
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,406
Ray, why don't you stay here
and work on your suit...

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,847
while Barry and I run
to Jitters for some java?

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,651
Sounds like a plan.

132
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,206
- Coffee?
- Sure.

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,006
- Hey, detective.
- Iris.

134
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,285
What are you doing here?

135
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,410
I am following up on my story
about crime in Central City.

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,284
Or lack thereof.

137
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,881
Could someone be working
with the Flash?

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,445
No, of course not.

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,126
You caught a flasher, armed
robbers in a getaway car...

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,687
and two jewelry
thieves last night.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,604
I'm just that good.

142
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,411
What is going on
with you lately?

143
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,530
You've been acting really weird
and withdrawn.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,843
If I didn't know any better, I'd
think you were hiding something.

145
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,408
Iris, I'm not hiding
anything from you.

146
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,600
- Do you ever go to work?
- Oh, you're funny.

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,884
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris
about the Flash.

148
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,443
- You have to. - It's really
starting to affect our relationship.

149
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,684
We haven't had sex in two weeks.

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,971
- Which you didn't wanna know about.
- Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I don't agree.

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,482
- Well, I'm her father.
- And I'm her boyfriend.

153
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,961
When does my vote
outweigh yours?

154
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,168
When you become her husband.

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,647
You know I left Starling City to
get away from the mood and brood.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,930
- But it looks like it followed me here.
- I know. I'm sorry.

157
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,210
It's like I said before,
now is not the best time.

158
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,846
Barry, I have been through
enough with you...

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,889
to know when you're
holding something back.

160
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,442
Is this because I told Ray your secret?
Because he is trustworthy, Barry.

161
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,887
- He wants to help people, like you.
- Yeah, I know.

162
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,520
That's not what I'm
worried about. It's just...

163
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,401
I really don't wanna put
anyone else in danger.

164
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,484
In danger of what?

165
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,887
- Barry, hey.
- Eddie, hey. Uh, you remember Felicity.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,210
- Of course.
- Hey.

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,208
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,522
What is wrong with you? Is everyone
in Central City in a bad mood?

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,405
I thought Central City
was supposed to be the fun one.

170
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,329
It's just, um...

171
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,968
- it's not...
- Felicity knows.

172
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,290
- Wow.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,731
So everyone but Iris.

174
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,450
It feels that way.

175
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,969
- How do you lie to everyone you care about?
- For starters, don't think of it as lying.

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,090
Think of it as protecting her
from getting hurt.

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,841
- With a fib. - But Iris can
tell I'm hiding something.

178
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,486
And it's putting this
distance between us.

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,087
I have an idea. Why don't
we all go to dinner tonight?

180
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,403
A little wine and dine
is sure to bridge the gap.

181
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,406
- Come on, we all had fun last time.
- Sure. Why not?

182
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,689
Barry Allen, fifth wheel.

183
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,323
I can't make my 3:00 meeting. Also,
confirm my reservation for tonight.

184
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,570
Last time, they couldn't find it,
and that was unacceptable. Thanks.

185
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,122
You see that bad man over there?

186
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,966
Tell your sisters it's time.

187
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,761
So you put solid oxide
fuel cells into the belt?

188
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,082
Yeah, that's the only place
to hide the hardware.

189
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,802
Hmm. Well, they should be generating
enough energy to power the suit.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,447
It could be the operating temperature.
I mean, you're essentially...

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,284
Overheating the
system. I figured.

192
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,924
But if we insulate them
with a ceramic compound...

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,243
We may improve the
operating efficiency.

194
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,926
You really are
quite clever, Cisco.

195
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,762
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

196
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,888
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

197
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,969
How do you turn this thing on?

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,409
- Cisco? You okay?
- Yeah.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,803
I haven't been getting
enough sleep, so...

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,446
Cisco, we need you up here.

201
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,761
- Killer bees are at it again.
- Get ahold of Barry.

202
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,891
- Another bee attack. Folston Tech.
- I'll see where Joe is.

203
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
"Bee" careful.

204
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,250
- For real?
- Bad pun, sorry. Just don't die.

205
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,967
- I'm too late.
- Where are the bees?

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,603
I don't know. There's
no sign of them.

207
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,044
I found them.

208
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,524
Uh, how do I get out of here?

209
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,889
Take the northeast crossways. The
quickest way out of the building.

210
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,841
Guys, they're everywhere.
I'm surrounded.

211
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,289
Barry!

212
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,640
Barf)'-

213
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,044
He's going into cardiac arrest.

214
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,682
Barry, stay with me.

215
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,208
Cisco, Barry doesn't
have a pulse.

216
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,050
- Step away from him.
- What? Why?

217
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,841
We need to jump-start his heart.
There's a defibrillator in the suit.

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,648
- Charge it to 360 joules.
- Charging in three, two, one.

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,685
Hit him again, 400 joules.

220
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,210
Charging in three, two, one.

221
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,083
Barry.

222
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,124
Joe.

223
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,124
Oh, thank God.

224
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,570
That is it for the defibrillator.
It is completely fried.

225
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,282
- You're lucky to be alive, Mr. Allen.
- I was very specific that you not die.

226
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,445
- Yeah, it's a pretty big thing for her.
- Cisco, what happened out there?

227
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,409
I followed your
directions exactly.

228
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,450
I'm sorry. I led
you the wrong way.

229
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,530
The schematics that we had,
they, um, weren't up to date.

230
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,048
They weren't up to date? What do you
mean? That's never happened before.

231
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,726
And what? You think Cisco
was trying to get you killed?

232
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,810
No. Why would he do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

233
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,566
I know. That's why I was joking.

234
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,366
Barry, it's ourjob to protect
you, and today we failed.

235
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,605
But that will just serve as a warning for
all of us to be more vigilant in the future.

236
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,287
Good news. The apitoxin is out of your
body. Your levels are back to normal.

237
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
Terrific.

238
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,121
Ray, Felicity,
we're gonna be late for dinner.

239
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,449
- Are you sure that's wise, Barry?
- You just died.

240
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,763
- Maybe you should order in tonight.
- Yeah. We could totally cancel.

241
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,811
I'm fine. Alive.
Hungry. All right?

242
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,160
Let's go.

243
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,686
- That was weird. - Yeah,
why didn't we get invited to dinner?

244
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,604
Oh. Thank you.

245
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,330
Hey, guys.

246
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,322
- Wow, Iris, check you out.
- Hi, Felicity.

247
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,010
Hello.

248
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,527
- Oh, hey.
- Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

249
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,682
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

250
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,729
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,203
Mr. Palmer, your table is ready.

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,125
- Great. Shall we?
- Yes.

253
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,367
Hey, how did he get a reservation
here? We've been trying for months.

254
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,363
I don't know.

255
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,202
Here's your table, sir.

256
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,170
I thought it'd be nice if it was quiet,
so I bought out the entire restaurant.

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,051
- Too much?
- Just a tad, sweetie.

258
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,125
Joe.

259
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,962
Oh, Cisco. Hey.

260
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,049
You just saved me a trip to S.T.A.R Labs.
I got some info on our second victim.

261
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
Name is Bill Carlisle.

262
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,007
He was recently hired at Folston Tech
to beef up their robotics division.

263
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,089
Robotics?

264
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,561
That's just like
the first victim.

265
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,008
Wow. That is weird.

266
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,244
That's not why you stopped by.

267
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,927
No, I wanted to talk
to you about Barry.

268
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,570
Okay.

269
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,160
Is there something
going on with him?

270
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,160
- Something he's not telling us?
- What do you mean?

271
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,085
He hasn't really
been himself lately.

272
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
Not that I'm aware of.

273
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,730
It's like something
is just really bothering him.

274
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,050
I think he's got his mind trained
on catching the bad guys, Cisco.

275
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,371
And he's probably worried
about when the Reverse-Flash...

276
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,090
is gonna show his face again.

277
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,531
Oh, I'm not like
the Flash at all.

278
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,123
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

279
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,930
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,650
Yeah. No, I'm fine. It's just
I got this crazy headache.

281
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,446
Thank you for the
file and the talk.

282
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,242
- So how did you two meet?
- Work.

283
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,880
I bought the company
where Felicity was employed...

284
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,242
so she was forced to join me
at Palmer Tech.

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,129
It's not as creepy as it sounds.

286
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,648
So you two work
closely together.

287
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,166
Interesting.

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,008
I guess you guys share all your
thoughts and feelings and...

289
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,891
Yeah, I share everything
with Felicity.

290
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,411
It's nice that you guys have
that level of communication.

291
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,523
Oh, well, no, not
"every" everything.

292
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,163
I mean, sometimes it's
good to just shut up, heh.

293
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,684
I get that. Some things
are better left unspoken.

294
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,040
Really?

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,448
I don't find that to be true.

296
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,444
Oh, thank God. It's
the food. Food's here.

297
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,966
Our first course on
the tasting menu...

298
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,249
is a quail-egg
frittata. Bon appétit.

299
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,450
Barry, I gotta admit, I envy you
spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

300
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,046
Harrison Wells is like
a personal hero of mine.

301
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,170
It's amazing just actually being
in the same room with him.

302
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,565
Yeah.

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,891
- I'll be right back. Just excuse me.
- Okay.

304
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,245
Well, I...

305
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,522
um, heh...

306
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,728
have to pee.

307
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,569
You've been acting strange ever
since Ray and I got to Central City.

308
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,920
What is going on?

309
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,043
Don't say it's a bad time. Oliver
might join the League of Assassins...

310
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,285
Laurel is Black Canary, and Thea is training
with Malcolm, so I know about bad times.

311
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
Okay.

312
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,524
Joe and I found out...

313
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,446
that Wells isn't
who he says he is.

314
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,530
He...

315
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,085
He is the man that
killed my mother.

316
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,762
- Oh, my God. But he's been helping you.
- Get faster, stronger. I know.

317
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,206
- Why?
- I don't know.

318
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,081
I don't know anything anymore,
especially who I can and can't trust.

319
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,402
So you think Cisco and Caitlin
are helping him?

320
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,244
That's impossible.

321
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,448
- Is it?
- They were trying to save you today.

322
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,763
- They did save you.
- Wells has also saved me many times.

323
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,810
I thought that Wells
was a great man.

324
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,129
And I was so wrong about him.

325
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,045
What if I'm wrong
about everything else too?

326
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,645
Hey, guys.

327
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,931
Uh, things are getting a little
intense in here.

328
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,961
Please, can't we just have
a nice evening?

329
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,490
Okay, so it's my fault that
we're not having a nice evening?

330
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,800
I am your girlfriend.

331
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,169
Who you live with. I shouldn't
have to beg you to talk to me.

332
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,403
If I could talk to you about
this, I would, believe me.

333
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,562
But I can't.

334
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,489
- You know what? I am not
hungry anymore. - Iris.

335
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,486
When you are ready to act like we are
two people who love each other, call me.

336
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,966
I'll be at my dad's.

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,764
Thank you for
dinner. I gotta go.

338
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,967
Uh, emergency at S.T.A.R. Labs.

339
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,441
- Go.
- Sorry.

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,641
Well, only 17 more
courses to go.

341
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,845
Containment breach,
foreign object detected.

342
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,050
Did I get it?

343
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,690
I think I got it.

344
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,484
Where is he?

345
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Thank you.

346
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,050
Let's see what makes this bee
so poisonous. Ugh.

347
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,680
You saved my life.

348
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,520
That is one odd-looking bee.

349
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,203
That's because it
isn't a bee at all.

350
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,890
It's a robot.

351
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,849
No way.

352
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,606
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,367
This bot's got a 360-degree
vision system.

354
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,205
I mean, we're talking
multiple microcameras...

355
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,409
all coming from various
angles at the same time.

356
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,370
- Which means... - It can see
all around the room at once.

357
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,568
- That is amazing.
- Amazing.

358
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,920
Disturbing.

359
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,566
It's next-gen hardware
that's nowhere near the market.

360
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,963
- So we're not dealing with a metahuman.
- It's just a mad scientist.

361
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,289
Cisco, you said Bill Carlisle
was a robotics engineer.

362
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,091
Let's cross-reference his
previous employers with Kang's.

363
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,449
Allow me. Mama's been away from
the keyboard for far too long.

364
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,725
Okay.

365
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,882
They both worked
at Mercury Labs.

366
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,408
Let's call Joe. I think it's time
we paid a visit to an old friend.

367
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,168
Twice in one year, Harrison.

368
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,449
You really are vying for
comeback scientist of the year.

369
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,809
- Always a pleasure, Christina.
- To what do I owe this visit?

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,925
Did you find my tachyon prototype, or are
you here to blackmail me for another one?

371
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,811
- Do you have another one?
- We came here for information.

372
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,088
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

373
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,130
Former employees
who were recently murdered.

374
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,122
My God. I wasn't aware.

375
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,762
Stung to death by robotic bees.

376
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,605
- You're looking for Brie Larvan.
- Brie Larvan?

377
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,364
A quite brilliant roboticist...

378
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,967
who once developed miniature
mechanical bees for agricultural use.

379
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,920
Kang and Carlisle warned me that Brie was
weaponizing the bees for military use...

380
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,366
so I terminated her.

381
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,127
Well, it seems that you would be
on her hit list too, doctor.

382
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,123
You've got to let
us keep you safe.

383
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,686
I'm all too familiar with your
inability to protect things, Harrison.

384
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,201
I can take care of myself.

385
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,010
Good day, gentlemen.

386
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,964
Thank you.

387
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,571
Hey.

388
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,890
Okay, so we found our queen bee.
Brie Larvan. She's a roboticist.

389
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,725
Joe is running a trace on her
location. So far, nothing.

390
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,531
- Good.
- Where is Ray?

391
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,409
He's working on his
suit with Cisco.

392
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,848
I like Ray. He seems like
he's a really good guy.

393
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,168
He is a good guy.

394
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,405
Just like Cisco
and Caitlin. Girl.

395
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,047
Is that why you called me here?

396
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,730
You're in a tricky situation, but that's
when you need your friends to have your back.

397
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,362
- And how can they if you won't
let them? - It's not that simple.

398
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,928
What if Joe is right and I
tell them and it backfires?

399
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,086
Wells isn't just their boss, Felicity.
He is their mentor, their hero.

400
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,169
My hero.

401
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,324
Look, it...

402
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,727
I don't know what to do.

403
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,881
When I first met Oliver...

404
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,208
before I knew he was
the Arrow, he would...

405
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,442
He would ask me
to do weird things for him.

406
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,083
Like decrypt a bullet-ridden
computer or hack some company.

407
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,730
And when I would ask him why...

408
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,804
he would come up
with these ridiculous excuses.

409
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,089
And I always knew he was lying,
but I would help him anyway.

410
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,810
- You know why?
- Mm.

411
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,284
Because I knew Oliver was a
good person with a good heart.

412
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,448
Cisco and Caitlin...

413
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,722
they're no different.

414
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
H9)'-

415
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,605
H9)'-

416
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,283
So you're really
staying here tonight?

417
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,001
Tonight, tomorrow night,
the night after that.

418
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,128
Do you think that Eddie's
cheating on me?

419
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,082
No. Eddie's not
that kind of guy.

420
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,483
Well, I don't know what else
he could be hiding from me.

421
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,888
Iris...

422
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,200
Remember when we were kids...

423
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,687
and Joe would come
home from work...

424
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,322
with that blank
expression on his face?

425
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,008
Hmm. Yeah. The Earth-to-Joe
look. How could I forget?

426
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,530
I never understood that look until
I started working for the C.C.P.D.

427
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,884
Showing up at crime scenes
and seeing someone murdered...

428
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,328
it can be ugly work.

429
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,726
And I'm lucky.

430
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,487
I get to hide behind the science
of it and just stay in my lab.

431
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,201
But Eddie, he's out there...

432
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,006
every day, in the darkness.

433
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,803
And I just... I think that maybe
if he doesn't wanna talk to you...

434
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,648
about his work, it's probably because
he wants to keep you in the light.

435
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,240
What?

436
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,767
Just surprised.

437
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,760
You going out of your way like this
to help me see Eddie's point of view.

438
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,844
I mean...

439
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,324
Eddie makes you happy.

440
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,320
And all I ever want
is for you to be happy, Iris.

441
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
Welcome home.

442
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,524
Ha, ha. It's so fun to watch
grown men play with their toys.

443
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,288
You're so lucky. Ray is
so nice and smart and hot.

444
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,002
Yeah, it's kind of like I'm
dating Barry but in Oliver's body.

445
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,088
- A sentence you will never repeat to
anyone. - Your secret's safe with me.

446
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,805
It must have reactivated.
If it's controlled wirelessly...

447
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,890
I can trace its signal and figure
out where it's trying to go.

448
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,450
- Oh, no.
- Oh, boy.

449
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,127
- What?
- The swarm is headed for Mercury Labs.

450
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,405
Brie Larvan's going after Tina.

451
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,483
Hello, Dr. McGee.

452
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,962
You gonna open the window,
or should I buzz myself in?

453
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,326
How do we stop them?

454
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,205
She's gotta be remotely piloting
those bees from somewhere.

455
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,727
We need to stop
this bug-eyed glasses woman.

456
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,882
And her mini bandits.

457
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,485
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

458
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,404
She's in an
abandoned greenhouse.

459
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,086
Barry, take out Brie.
It's the only way to stop these.

460
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,329
- What about Dr. McGee? - The
defibrillator in your suit is broken.

461
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,529
You cannot risk going
near Mercury Labs.

462
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,521
The bees can't
penetrate my suit.

463
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,240
I'll go.

464
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,086
Whoa. We haven't tested out
the new power system yet.

465
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,529
We'll do it now.

466
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,921
- I'm following you.
- I'm driving.

467
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,003
And I'm kissing you.

468
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,762
- Dr. Wells...
- Mr. Palmer will protect Tina.

469
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,365
Go.

470
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,284
You fired me,
destroyed years of my research.

471
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,568
You took everything from me.

472
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,643
What you were doing was wrong.

473
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,929
You wanted to harm people,
not help them.

474
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,764
I did what I had to do.

475
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,043
You mean ruin my life? Sure.

476
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,362
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

477
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,969
- Found her.
- Felicity, can you jam their frequency?

478
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,488
I already tried, but I might be able
to redirect them onto a new target.

479
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,928
- Ray, get ready for incoming.
- We have the technology.

480
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,210
It's over, Brie.

481
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,285
I know you're trying to kill Dr.
McGee. You think that she betrayed you.

482
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,165
I can imagine how that feels.

483
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,489
You think you understand
the sting of betrayal?

484
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,610
I'll show you what
it means to be stung.

485
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,805
Barf)'-

486
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,444
Barry, I hacked into the bees'
frequency. I'm controlling them.

487
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,763
I'm the queen of this hive.

488
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,685
Oh, she's good. She's
like my nemesis.

489
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,527
I've never had a nemesis before.
I kind of like it.

490
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,648
- Okay, Cisco. Now what?
- Ray, get to the ocean.

491
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,770
If the bots follow you into
water, their electronics will fry.

492
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,206
Got it.

493
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,044
Wait, but so will my suit.

494
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,401
Cisco, I'm fried.
I'm losing propulsion control.

495
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,280
Can you see the van?

496
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,606
- Yeah.
- We'll catch you.

497
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,081
- You Will?
- We Will?

498
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,765
We Will.

499
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,880
All right.

500
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,251
Keep it steady.

501
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,889
Unh. Whew.

502
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,286
The Atom lives.

503
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,369
- Argh.
- Oh.

504
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,650
Let's work on some softer gloves
for next time, okay?

505
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,406
Sorry.

506
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,881
Oh, you wanna bring it?

507
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
It's been brought.

508
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Rude.

509
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,084
Felicity, right now would be
a good time to do something.

510
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,087
Stay away from Barry Allen.

511
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,768
- Felicity!
- Got it.

512
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,286
Boom. Drop the mike.

513
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,691
It's metaphorical, of course,
because I don't have a real mike.

514
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,684
Brie's restrained. Call C.C.P.D.

515
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,810
- Some kind of team you have here.
- It helps to have friends in your corner.

516
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,486
- That was like...
- This guy's a stunt driver.

517
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,169
Are you okay?

518
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,685
Cisco!

519
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,731
Come on, please.

520
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,966
Wake up.

521
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,122
Cisco has been stung.
He's going into shock.

522
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm on my way.

523
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,204
Come on, stay with me.

524
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,163
Hold on, back up.

525
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,683
I'm gonna try something.

526
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
Cisco.

527
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,527
Either my fear of bees is over,
or it just got a lot worse.

528
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,567
Thank God you're okay.

529
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,968
I've never had anybody
take a bee for me.

530
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,646
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, bro.

531
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,490
Cisco...

532
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,085
you're a hero, man.

533
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,850
- Dr. McGee.
- May I come in?

534
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,571
Yeah, of course. What
can I do for you?

535
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,404
I wanted to apologize.

536
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,605
I should have listened to you
when you warned me about Brie.

537
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,048
Perhaps next time I will take the
C.C.P.D.'s offer of protection.

538
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,561
After we lost your
tachyon prototype...

539
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,042
I can understand why you
were hesitant to trust us.

540
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,045
Thank you.

541
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,565
Can I ask you something?

542
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,401
I couldn't help but
notice some tension...

543
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,881
between you and Dr. Wells.

544
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,211
That's all in the past.

545
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,606
Do you mind if I ask what
happened between you two?

546
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,088
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

547
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,605
Fifteen years ago, Harrison
and I were thick as thieves.

548
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,843
We were promising young
scientists in Starling City.

549
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,361
He was such a kind man.

550
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,682
Then everything changed
after Tess died.

551
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,451
They were gonna get married.

552
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,922
I understand how grief can affect
someone, but this was more than that.

553
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,124
It was like after that day...

554
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,887
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

555
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
Good day.

556
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,083
Bye.

557
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,530
Doctor.

558
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,126
How's Cisco?

559
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,090
Happy to be alive.

560
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,131
And sad that Ray is leaving.

561
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,729
It was a really brave thing
he did, risking his life.

562
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,805
- Selfless.
- Yeah, definitely was.

563
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,407
And another end to another
exciting adventure in Central City.

564
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,645
- Ah. Yes. Thank you.
- Ray, thank you for all your help.

565
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,606
And I hope you figure out
the problem with your suit.

566
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,245
- I have.
- Oh.

567
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,165
All this time, I've been looking
at the power source the wrong way.

568
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,970
I kept thinking we
needed to go bigger.

569
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,569
But the solution, as always,
is simply to go smaller.

570
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,288
Oh. Great.

571
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,924
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

572
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,004
I'm gonna be. Thank
you for your advice.

573
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,128
Oh, I won't even
charge you the 5 cents.

574
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Bye, Felicity.

575
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,205
Bye, Barry.

576
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,650
H9)'-

577
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,605
What's up?

578
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,329
I, um...

579
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,528
I spoke to Barry last night.

580
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
Oh, yeah?

581
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,206
He was trying to help me understand
why you've been so off lately.

582
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,008
Why you might be having trouble
connecting with me.

583
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,003
Really?

584
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,891
What did he say?

585
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,401
It was a good explanation.

586
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,250
Valid.

587
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,960
But the truth is,
it doesn't matter.

588
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,482
Because when you love someone,
you tell them everything.

589
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,564
So if you love me, Eddie, you'll
tell me what is going on with you.

590
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,927
_Or__ Or what?

591
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,565
You know what.

592
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,602
All right, all right.
Who's ready for some...

593
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,286
karaoke?

594
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,967
We are not going
to karaoke, are we?

595
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,485
No. Um...

596
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,651
This is everything we know
about my mother's murder...

597
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,643
and the Reverse-Flash.

598
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,126
I've been gathering information
on him for a long time.

599
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,168
And this is everything we know
about Dr. Wells.

600
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,969
I don't understand.

601
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,563
What do Dr. Wells and the Reverse-Flash
have to do with each other?

602
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,486
Um...

603
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,402
They're the same person.

604
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,810
That's impossible.

605
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,606
Look, Caitlin, it took me a
long time to believe it too...

606
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,001
but it's him.

607
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,851
Dr. Wells is a speedster?

608
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,970
- He's paralyzed.
- Is he, though?

609
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,447
And why would he
kill Barry's mother?

610
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,001
It doesn't make any sense.

611
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,285
Cisco? Say something.

612
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,601
I've been having these dreams.

613
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,287
Mostly at night
but sometimes during the day.

614
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,524
But they don't really feel
like dreams. They...

615
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,448
They feel real.

616
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,569
What happens in the dream?

617
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,484
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

618
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,960
And he kills me.
