18
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,450
You should be getting a raise.

19
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,950
You don't get a raise every time you do something well.

20
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,080
You did something very well and saved $1.75 million.

21
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,960
- I'll talk to Dr. Glassman about it. - No, you won't.

22
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,290
If any talking or anything else needs to be done,

23
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,630
I'm fully capable of handling that my --

24
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,090
That's my car.

26
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,640
You can pick it up at Tricky's Towing.

27
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm picking it up right now because this is my car,

28
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,270
I'm allowed to park here, and you're a trespasser.

29
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,390
Any time after 1:00.

30
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,940
Shaun, tell him.

31
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,610
This is not your spot.

32
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,240
Someone told a lie.

33
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,740
I just got a spot last week, so it's kind of new to everyone.

34
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,780
So, yes, it is not my spot,

35
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,910
but that doesn't make it the wrong spot.

36
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,210
It'll be $250, cash or credit.

37
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm not paying $250. I don't have $250 to waste on th--

38
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,330
If you get that raise --

39
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,210
Shaun. ‭

40
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,050
Would you just stop for a minute?

41
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,550
- Not once I start. - That's not a law.

42
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,680
That's just some bull you bastards made up so you can do this.

43
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,930
$350.

44
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,430
Hostile work environment fee.

45
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,070
Jeffrey Williams. 21 years old.

46
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,740
When he was 5, he fell in love with baseball,

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,570
dreamt of playing with the Tigers.

48
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,070
By the time he was 8,

49
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,240
he was the best hitter in Little League.

50
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Right, Jeff?

51
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,040
At 9, he led his team all the way to the Divisionals.

54
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,260
Pura vida, Dannie.

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,950
Retropulsion.

56
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,740
What?

57
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,660
Her thumb moved.

58
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,620
- What does that mean? - Nothing.

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,710
If it happened, it's a normal response in dying muscles.

60
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,670
Or it could just be the result of hypoxia

61
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,460
or an electrolyte imbalance.

62
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,670
Or brain activity.

63
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,180
The E.E.G. showed no purposeful brain activity.

64
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,010
Hook her back up.

65
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,310
Elias, over the last 10 years, Dannie's had thousands of tests.

66
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,310
If there was any chance --

67
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,930
Dr. Reznick, please. Now.

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
Ankylosing spondylitis.

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,660
Nasty little disease.

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,000
When Jeff was 10, the inflammation was so bad

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,830
the bones in his back started to fuse together

72
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,670
into one big, gnarly bone.

73
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,090
If you can't extend your back, you can't use your legs.

74
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,170
If you can't unwind your back, you can't use your arms.

75
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,220
Useless legs, useless arms.

76
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,100
Can't even fit into a standard wheelchair.

77
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,390
I've had breakfast in bed since I was 10.

78
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,890
And lunch.

79
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,180
And dinner.

80
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,690
Are you in a lot of pain?

81
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,610
Not compared to what it was.

82
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,980
I wish I'd met that rheumatologist

83
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,440
at the Baltimore Spine Clinic seven years earlier.

84
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,570
They didn't offer you surgery?

85
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, I've -- I've been to nine neurosurgeons,

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,870
and they all said that they couldn't fix me, so...

87
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,740
But thanks to Dr. Glassman,

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,830
my post-pretzel future's looking bright.

89
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,790
I wanna move out of long-term care,

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,210
study engineering,

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,220
go to Europe,

92
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,720
hell, go to a ballpark and see the game,

93
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,220
maybe with a girl.

94
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,890
I'd just love to be able to hug someone again.

95
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,110
I'm gonna need two residents to assist me with --

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
with the surgery.

97
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
What were you doing 10 years ago?

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,210
That's how long it's been

99
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,330
since the aneurysm in her brain ruptured

100
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,630
and how long Elias has been visiting,

101
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,960
bringing her Peppermint Patties and hoping for that special day

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,130
she opens her eyes and says, "Hi, honey. Did I sleep in?"

103
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,510
And I had finally gotten him to give that up.

104
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,640
Give up hope?

105
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,930
Give up an impossible fantasy that has paralyzed his life.

106
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,980
He used to have a career, goals, a wife,

107
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,310
things he can have again if we let him move on.

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,770
And by "we," I mean you.

109
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,110
So you are gonna tell him that the twitch meant nothing.

110
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,360
But she has elevated levels of dopamine.

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,490
Which is a stress hormone, likely produced by the adrenal

112
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,070
when it was temporarily shut down.

113
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,700
But it's also a neurotransmitter in the brain

114
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,040
and may be associated with increased brain activity.

115
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,620
We need to do a SPECT C.T. of her brain and full body

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,380
with radiotracers to find the source of the dopamine.

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,840
You know about Elias, right?

118
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,500
The patient's husband who can't move on

119
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,960
and it's making everything worse?

120
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,590
Do you see an analogy here?

121
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,180
No.

122
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,800
No more tests, Shaun.

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,060
I'll ask Dr. Lim.

124
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,180
- I'm calling your bluff. - I don't know how to bluff.

125
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,570
Joint cuts are nearly perfect.

126
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,450
Nearly perfect leaves him with no feeling in his legs.

127
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,370
I kind of cracked the vertebral body.

128
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,000
But I got the rest right.

129
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,100
That is perfect.

130
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,390
Welcome to my team.

131
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,020
Textbook.

132
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,860
You followed the video demonstration exactly.

133
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,740
You didn't.

134
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,160
The third bone is the problem,

135
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,500
and you messed around with the first one.

136
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,290
Why?

137
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,750
My model was a bit more severe than the one in the demo,

138
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,170
so I thought a three-column reconstruction might be better.

139
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,840
Nice. Nice improv.

140
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,470
You're on my team.

141
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,610
I mapped out every screw placement,

142
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,780
osteotomy cut, rod contouring.

143
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,410
You know, I've been trying to figure out

144
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,710
why you're doing this.

145
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't know. Change a kid's life?

146
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,210
Something like that.

147
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,130
I'm thinking you must be afraid.

148
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,010
- What? - ‭Come on.

149
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,180
You've been impulsive ever since you recovered from cancer.

150
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,470
You quit surgery to start a clinic,

151
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,720
married my favorite barista after a few dates,

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,890
and I'm guessing none of it made you happy.

153
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,690
We barely talk to each other outside of the board meetings,

155
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,230
and now, all of a sudden, you can see into my soul?

156
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,940
I love my wife. I love my work.

157
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,820
Great.

158
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,530
And you still feel empty, don't you?

159
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,950
I'm thinking you're scared

160
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,070
something's missing from your life,

161
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,160
so you keep reaching.

162
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,870
You take on a case no other surgeon will touch.

163
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,830
As fascinating as all this is,

164
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,170
I don't think Jeffrey really cares all that much

165
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,750
- why we're doing the surgery. - He should.

166
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Because your motives are affecting your ability

167
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,300
to properly assess whether that surgery is worth the risk.

168
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,400
Thank you for the input.

169
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,700
You were supposed to meet me for lunch at 12:15.

170
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,990
It's 12:23.

171
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,910
I'm not the first person Tricky has shafted.

172
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,410
He's earned his name.

173
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,210
I'm gathering every complaint I can find,

174
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,330
which I wouldn't be doing if you'd backed me up.

175
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,210
So no lunch.

176
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,460
Mm, are you mad at me?

177
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,420
When you're mad at me, you don't look at me.

178
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,300
Although, you are now, so maybe you're not.

179
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,680
I turned to my boyfriend for support,

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,140
and he hung me out to dry,

181
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,020
so let's just say I am disappointed.

182
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,680
I told the truth.

183
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,560
This isn't about honesty. This is about having my back.

184
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,150
We're a team now, Shaun, working together for a common goal.

185
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,360
And right now, our goal is to get my car back.

186
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,910
Then you need to pay $350.

187
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm paying nothing.

188
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,700
He is a pirate,

189
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,450
and I'm going to expose him to the world.

190
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,880
No increased dopamine-specific uptake.

191
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,010
It's not coming from the brain.

192
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,260
Which means it must've come from the adrenal glands

193
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,220
when we shut down their oxygen supply.

194
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,760
Move down to adrenals.

195
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,430
Impressive -- to mourn his wife for 10 years.

196
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,730
He's not mourning her.

197
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,650
He can't as long as she's alive.

198
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,570
Dannie is stuck in limbo,

199
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,400
somewhere between life and death.

200
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,440
So is he.

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,740
If there are time limits to being a good partner,

202
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,280
are there also ethical limits?

203
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,910
Should you support them even if they've done something wrong?

204
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,370
You think maybe the coma patient robbed a bank?

205
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,620
Good alibi.

206
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,830
What did Lea do?

207
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Doesn't matter.

208
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,090
Support her.

209
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,050
Whether you agree with them or not,

210
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,630
the job of a good partner is to be supportive.

211
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,490
As opposed to, say,

212
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,310
resolving disputes by running to the Chief of Surgery.

213
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,810
It's not coming from the adrenals either.

214
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,560
There it is,

215
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,900
but it's not coming from an organ.

216
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,360
It's coming from a tumor.

217
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,370
Dannie has cancer.

219
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,580
You could say we're doing a kind of Humpty Dumpty,

220
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,310
only this time,

221
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,290
we're actually going to put you back together again.

222
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,880
Don't get too excited, though.

223
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,670
Dr. Andrews wants to give us a little reality check.

224
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,450
If all goes well,

225
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,800
you'll have a restricted range of motion

226
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,260
and be dependent on a walker.

227
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,850
If all doesn't go well, there is a risk of paralysis

228
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,020
and, given the potential for massive blood loss,

229
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,150
there's a small chance you might not survive the surgery.

230
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,440
But you have a great team

231
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,030
and one of the top neurosurgeons in the world.

232
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,280
So, what do you say?

233
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,700
This is really happening.

234
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,870
Yes, sir. Tomorrow morning. First thing.

235
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm sorry, Dr. Glassman.

236
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,680
I can't -- I can't do it.

237
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,020
She has a paraganglioma abutting her vertebrae.

238
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,730
Her twitch wasn't a sign of increased brain activity.

239
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,610
It was just a reaction to the tumor irritating her nerves.

240
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,280
We can take her off life support.

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,620
What about this cancer? Is it treatable?

242
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,500
The only treatment would be surgery,

243
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,960
and it's in a difficult location.

244
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,460
Well, what happens if you don't remove it?

245
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,880
It's malignant.

246
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,130
Dannie would die within a couple of months.

247
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,380
Then you have to operate.

248
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,920
She could die in the O.R.

249
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,720
rather than here with you holding her hand.

250
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,720
We rechecked her E.E.G. There's no change.

251
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,890
There was a change.

252
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,510
Uh, the thumb movement was a change.

253
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,930
And the cancer and the dopamine were changes.

254
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,230
Something else could change,

255
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,400
and maybe that's the change that'll wake her up.

256
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,650
Elias, her body is dying.

257
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,820
Only if we let it.

258
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,240
I gave up on her once. I'm not doing that again.

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,000
I've got your discharge paperwork.

260
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

261
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,890
I thought I was ready for this, and I knew it was dangerous.

262
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,270
Hey, look, my life isn't perfect,

263
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,230
but it's not so bad that I want to risk throwing it all away.

264
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
You ever hear of Gates Brown?

265
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,540
Left field for the '68 Tigers?

266
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,410
Yes.

267
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,290
My dad had his baseball card.

268
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,830
Your dad ever tell you about his story?

269
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,550
First person to recognize his talent was a prison guard.

270
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,800
He helped him get out of prison a year early on parole

271
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,840
so he could play professional baseball.

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,890
I think about Gates Brown a lot.

273
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,190
Whenever I have to make a-a tough,

274
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,150
really tough decision,

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,280
I think about how scared he must've been.

276
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,570
Playing for the Tigers?

277
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,450
It's a dream come true.

278
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,070
Real scary.

279
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,990
Getting out of jail early,

280
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,620
facing a world he hadn't been in in a while.

281
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,420
What if he didn't live up to expectations?

282
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,330
What if he wasn't good enough for the bigs?

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,710
But he kept fighting. He kept pushing.

284
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,470
You wanted to have this surgery,

285
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,010
and you kept fighting and you kept pushing

286
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,180
and doctor after doctor said no,

287
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,310
then finally you found a doctor who said yes,

288
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,600
and now you stop?

289
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,980
That doesn't make any sense.

290
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,310
I don't think that you are afraid

291
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,860
that this surgery is gonna fail.

292
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,730
I think you're afraid it's gonna succeed.

293
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,820
For the last several years,

294
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,450
you could've taken classes online,

295
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,660
worked toward your degree.

296
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,570
You could've gone traveling.

297
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,780
You don't think I've tried?

298
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,200
Oh, you tried, okay, and you failed,

299
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
but, man, did you have a good excuse.

300
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,210
And now you have the surgery and it's successful,

301
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,750
but you still fail?

302
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,880
That's scary.

303
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,380
Because now you got to look at yourself in the mirror

304
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,920
and you have to ask,

305
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,180
"Was it my condition, or was it me?"

306
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,850
You know where I celebrated my 10th birthday?

307
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,230
Children's Hospital,

308
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,070
getting 13 steroid shots into my spine.

309
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,570
By the time I was 11,

310
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,700
my entire social network was R.N.s and M.D.s.

311
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,040
I've never had a job.

312
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,210
I've never danced with a girl.

313
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,920
I've never even had a best friend.

314
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,140
I have no idea how to live like a regular person.

315
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,770
So what?

316
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,940
So you'll suck at it.

317
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
Join the club.

318
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,410
Say no to the surgery if that's the right decision.

319
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,030
But do yourself a favor.

320
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,490
Don't say no because you're afraid to live your life.

321
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm going to support you.

322
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,470
Thank you.

323
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm looking right at ya. See?

324
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
I noticed.

325
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,600
Let me have your phone.

326
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,940
W-Why?

327
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,690
I've created a couple hundred Yelp accounts to trash Tricky

328
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,320
and maxed out on my I.P. address,

329
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,820
so I need another one.

330
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,990
You're not allowed to do that.

331
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,990
He's not allowed to extort people,

332
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,790
so I'm just extorting him back.

333
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,120
Once I threaten to unleash my arsenal,

334
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,540
he'll hand over my car.

335
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,460
He might even detail it for me.

336
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,380
I won't have to actually post anything.

337
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,100
Thank you.

338
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,020
This last segment of tumor is holding on to her spinal dura

339
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,150
for dear life.

340
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,690
Fine dissecting scissors.

341
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I may be participating in fraud.

342
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,740
But I want to support my partner.

343
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
If your partner wants you to do something

344
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,540
that makes you feel uncomfortable, shut it down.

345
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,920
Do not enable crazy.

346
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Lea isn't crazy.

347
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,010
We're all crazy sometimes.

348
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,760
Just takes the right motivation.

349
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,640
There is an obvious middle ground.

350
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,680
If you think your partner's doing something wrong,

351
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,100
help them see what's right.

352
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,520
Damn it. The capsule ruptured, and it tore the dura.

353
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,900
We have a C.S.F. leak.

354
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,150
We should try a graft.

355
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,230
Harvest some fascia to reinforce the dura.

356
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,860
Dr. Lim?

357
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,060
Tastes like my birthday.

358
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,730
Lab confirms the tumor wasn't metastatic.

359
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,110
You're cancer-free.

360
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,030
And brain function is apparently fine.

361
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,660
All in all, it's been a pretty good day.

362
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,710
10 years.

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,460
I miss anything good?

364
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,260
No.

365
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,720
So why'd I wake up?

366
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,640
We're running tests.

367
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,890
There have been cases of anesthesia

368
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,480
rebooting the dormant brain.

369
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,730
Yours was light, but it still might have --

370
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,440
Let's just call it a miracle.

371
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,490
Okay, last bone wedge.

372
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,750
Alright, let's start straightening him out.

373
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,600
You know, if you can talk this kid into risking his life,

374
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,310
I'm thinking maybe you can talk anyone out of any fear.

375
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,850
I've been trying to talk you out of those caps for years.

376
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,730
These caps save lives. No fear in that.

377
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,410
I'm afraid to eat a cheeseburger.

378
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,910
My mother, she was very proud of her cooking.

379
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,060
She told us we didn't need to sacrifice taste to keep kosher.

381
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,860
At least not with her in the kitchen.

382
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,000
And it's crazy considering

383
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,740
all the other ways I've rejected her faith,

384
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,910
but if I do eat one,

385
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,650
it feels like I'm cutting my last lifeline to my mother.

386
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,040
My mom taught me how to play a guitar.

387
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,360
We had our problems, a lot of them,

388
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,940
but everything seemed to be okay when we were singing.

389
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,860
Since she died, um,

390
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,030
I'm afraid to even open the case.

391
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,150
It's the middle of your shift. You miss me?

392
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,350
I had a bad morning.

393
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,160
My patient lived.

394
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,480
That is surprising.

395
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,710
You keep being competent, you'll get used to it.

396
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,680
I need an ice-cream infusion.

397
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,390
The cafeteria has ice cream.

398
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,750
Not Cherry Garcia.

399
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,010
Heard you lost out to a Firsty.

400
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,140
One bright spot in my day.

401
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,180
I did everything perfectly, but it's still not symmetrical.

402
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,970
Nose job.

403
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,990
It's changing as you fix it. You got to change with it.

404
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,200
Andrews always said the first thing you do with your plan

405
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,690
is toss it out.

406
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,080
That's exactly why I didn't do a plastics elective.

407
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,530
Or you're a blue-collar ex-cop

408
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,460
who's afraid to color outside the lines.

409
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,470
Your L3 vertebrae is perfect,

410
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,770
which means you're not entirely without talent.

411
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,220
But look at the bones you're not supposed to fix.

412
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,590
What are your instincts telling you

413
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,510
that this procedure manual isn't?

414
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,880
Congratulations.

415
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,300
You're now as good as a Firsty.

416
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,650
I almost feel bad about eating your ice cream.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,150
B.P.'s 82/50. Spinal shock?

418
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,510
S.S.E.P. and M.E.P. Waves are normal.

419
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,270
Check for buckling.

420
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,010
No cord compression.

421
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,570
Pressure's still dropping.

422
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,270
Did we poke a hole in the canal?

423
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,310
Let's back out these screws.

424
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,670
Spine's not the problem. It's his heart.

425
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,610
It's in failure. Crash cart!

426
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,060
Sponges

427
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,470
I know why Dannie woke up.

428
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,780
The paraganglioma was filled with dopamine.

429
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,250
And leaking it in trace amounts. That's how we found it.

430
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,670
But when the capsule ruptured,

431
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,460
the tumor released the dopamine in very large amounts.

432
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,070
Her spinal tap showed over 1,200 nanograms per liter.

433
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,510
Which bathed her brain in dopamine,

434
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,430
which energized it and woke her up.

435
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,190
It was just a freak event.

436
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,830
A temporary freak event.

437
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,990
The dopamine's gonna wear off,

438
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,380
and her brain will shut down again.

439
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,700
Yes. And the dose she'd need to stay awake would be toxic.

440
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,540
If we don't replicate the surge, she'll relapse into a coma.

441
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,900
And if we do, she'll die.

442
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,510
Your dopamine levels are dropping quickly,

443
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,520
and when they return to normal,

444
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,370
you'll return to your comatose state.

445
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,580
- What? - ‭No.

446
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,800
Sh-- Look at her. She's lucid.

447
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,540
She's talking and laughing. She's fine.

448
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,110
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,480
Th-That's it?

450
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,110
There's no treatment, no surgery, no medication?

451
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,020
- Elias, I wish we -- - ‭No!

452
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,770
H-How long do I have?

453
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,630
Less than 24 hours.

454
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,490
But she could wake up again, right?

455
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,210
I mean, you didn't think she would this time.

456
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,520
You said she shouldn't have.

457
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,830
The series of events that coincided to make this happen

458
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,020
was so unlikely,

459
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,840
it is safe to say it will never happen again.

460
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
I want to see another doctor.

461
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,570
- Elias. - ‭There -- There must be some way --

462
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,810
We have to face this.

463
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,930
Why? Because they say so?

464
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,770
Listen to me.

465
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,090
You're right here,

466
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,300
looking into my eyes and holding my hand.

467
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,010
You're not going anywhere, Dannie.

468
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,910
I promise.

469
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,650
Troponin's normal. It's not a heart attack.

470
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,760
Yeah, no signs of P.E.

471
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,060
No clots in the heart either.

472
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,870
Normal valves, no wall motion abnormalities.

473
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,620
But he has S/D wave fusion on RV inflow.

474
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,480
His heart's not filling properly.

475
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
His legs are swollen.

476
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,720
His fluid's not returning from his lower body.

477
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,480
His anatomy adapted to his contortions.

478
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,650
Nothing is where it started.

479
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,470
And now, moving to this new position

480
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,200
could be trapping his vena cava.

481
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,670
His spine and breastbone

482
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,460
are squeezing off blood flow to his heart.

483
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,370
The vein's compressed.

484
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,690
Can we prop it open with a stent?

485
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,630
There's too much chest-cavity restriction.

486
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,130
Jeff's body is not letting us straighten him out.

487
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,610
We need to reverse the surgery.

488
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,270
All the king's horses.

489
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,880
About time Elias took a bathroom break.

490
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,650
He never shuts up about you.

491
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,200
I know you love skiing, both water and downhill,

492
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,590
and how you actually did both the same day in Tahoe

493
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,720
despite a water temperature of 48 degrees.

494
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,670
I know your favorite movie is "Battlefield Earth."

495
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,540
So bad it's good. I get it.

496
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,080
And your favorite candy, well, that I got all on my own.

497
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,370
I also heard about the puppies,

498
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,000
how he couldn't decide between three of them, and so he --

499
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,440
Brought them all home.

500
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Yeah.

501
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,880
Are you trying to tell me that I'm a lucky girl?

502
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,760
It's okay.

503
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,780
I know that I am.

504
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,050
I found my soul mate.

505
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,700
Do people still use that lame word?

506
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,540
He's a wonderful man...

507
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,990
who has trouble making tough decisions,

508
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,890
and he's gonna spend the rest of his life

509
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
sitting at your bedside,

510
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,320
listening to a ventilator keeping you alive.

511
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,890
Which puts it all on you.

512
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,660
Screw's stuck.

513
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,260
I'll try a lamina spreader.

514
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,050
If we do a bone graft here,

515
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,680
we can re-fuse the T3 vertebrae the way it was before.

516
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,980
It'll never be the way it was before.

517
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,070
We cracked his spine at 15 different levels.

518
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,820
He will be more contorted. He'll be more in pain.

519
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,210
T-handle.

520
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,770
Pectus excavatum.

521
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,450
Pectus excavatum.

522
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,100
If you never heard of it,

523
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,520
don't feel bad -- it's very rare.

524
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
The person is born with a big dent in the middle of his chest.

525
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,050
Sometimes it's so bad that the breastbone

526
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,380
presses against the heart,

527
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,070
and you got to break away the sternum,

528
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,130
you got to crack open the ribs, prop it open with metal bars.

529
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,290
If we can do that for Jeff,

530
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,840
then we can create enough space in his chest.

531
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,020
Close him up. Let's turn him around.

532
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,620
It's, uh, a DNR.

533
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,440
I don't want to be put back on life support.

534
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,160
That's not life.

535
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,230
You gave her this?

536
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,700
But I signed it.

537
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,180
You remember our first Valentine's Day together?

538
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,410
You gave me that -- that silver pendant with the two little hearts.

539
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,580
I told you I was considering that job in Boston.

540
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,920
And you let me go.

541
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,710
- You didn't need my permission. - I know.

542
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,300
I know.

543
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,990
But you knew that it was something that I needed to do.

544
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,590
And you also knew...

545
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,690
that I was scared.

546
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,070
Dannie, this isn't Boston.

547
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,720
I can't.

548
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,490
I can't let you go.

549
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,620
I know.

550
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,500
I think that's why I woke up.

551
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,530
Something that I have always felt guilty about.

552
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,910
Costa Rica.

553
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,190
That was your dream trip.

554
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,530
Your mother was sick.

555
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,890
Not very.

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,050
But you never complained.

557
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,320
Canceled everything.

558
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,460
Did you ever go?

559
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,070
How could I go without you?

560
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,850
Because you have to.

561
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,920
For both of us.

562
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,220
Let me have that thought.

563
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,380
Pura vida.

565
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,450
Dannie?

566
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,400
Pura vida.

567
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,590
Wanna try and stand up?

568
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,650
You got this.

569
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,490
No, no.

570
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,020
Okay, I'm afraid I'm gonna fall.

571
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,860
That's why you got to try.

572
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,200
Dr. Glassman.

573
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,110
It's after 6:00.

574
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,700
You're open 24 hours.

575
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,100
I'm not saying I'm closed.

576
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,420
I'm saying it's after regular business hours.

577
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,430
There's a $50 fee for that.

578
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,880
I've created 336 of the most scathing critiques

579
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,900
of you and your sleazy operation.

580
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,750
So give me my car back,

581
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,990
or I'll post them and shut your ass down.

582
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,670
I'm not buying it, Cupcake.

583
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,790
You're no outlaw, and I'm gonna have to add

584
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,500
a $200 "unfair business practice" fee.

585
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,180
I push this button, 

586
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,680
and you can kiss Tricky's Towing goodbye.

587
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,610
Cash or credit?

588
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,370
This time, I'm not lying.

589
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,830
Shaun, tell him.

590
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,670
Cash.

591
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,740
This way.

592
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:18,000
{\an7}BGM: Italian Stallion by Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra

593
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,860
Shaun.

594
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,590
Drive away! Drive away!

595
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,890
Get back here!

596
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,790
Okay, drive fast.

597
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,920
Oh, my God, Shaun.

598
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,610
Kick its butt.

599
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,260
So?

600
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,380
It's...

601
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,060
really...

602
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,170
really good.

603
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,790
That was tight. Everyone give it up for Travers!

604
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,530
Next up is...

605
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,290
Claire.

606
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,050
you got this.

607
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,820
Okay.

608
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,740
this is a song my -- my mother taught me.

609
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
So if you don't like it,

610
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,190
shame on you.

Three patients I turned down.

627
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,200

628
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,040

Delivery charge.

His face was awesome.

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,470
Mostly blind rage with a sprinkle of bewilderment.

643
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,680
And how about you leaping into the car like the Man of Steel?

644
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,910
I hurt my knee.

645
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,410

I can't believe you stiffed the guy like that.

647
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,580
I didn't.

648
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,660
I paid him $250, which is what he was entitled to,

649
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,170
leaving him with no reason to retaliate.

650

...crazy the last two days,

654
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,740
and I needed to help you see what was right.

655
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,170
I have been a bit crazy.

656
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,560
