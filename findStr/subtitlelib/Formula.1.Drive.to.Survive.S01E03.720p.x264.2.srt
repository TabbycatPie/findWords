1
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:09,485
Let's just touch on Azerbaijan.

2
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,245
How pissed off were you that day?

3
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:14,925
Very.

4
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:24,805
<i>The two Red Bulls go through.</i>
<i>Ricciardo fends off Max Verstappen.</i>

5
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,565
<i>We talked about it</i>
<i>before the race.</i>

6
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:28,485
<i>Both drivers had nodded in agreement</i>

7
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,925
that they'd give each other space.

8
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:39,125
<i>If you're Christian Horner,</i>
<i>you are not enjoying this for one second.</i>

9
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:44,725
<i>Verstappen is in no mood whatsoever</i>
<i>to yield to his teammate.</i>

10
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,045
<i>They have crashed!</i>
<i>They've gone into each other!</i>

11
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:03,605
It was a low point, and I made my feelings
very clear to both drivers.

12
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:04,885
Fuck!

13
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,005
That's 25, 30 points
we've just fucked away there.

14
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,325
<i>We were fighting for positions, but,</i>

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,725
<i>yeah, of course, you never want to crash</i>
<i>with your teammate.</i>

16
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:17,565
<i> I was sure of what happened.</i>

17
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,325
<i>You know, I was sure</i>
<i>that I wasn't the cause of it.</i>

18
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:23,205
<i>I was kind of made to feel guilty.</i>

19
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,685
<i>This year, I'm gonna be out of contract,</i>

20
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:32,885
<i>and I think, "What am I gonna achieve</i>
<i>doing one more year with Red Bull?"</i>

21
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:35,565
<i>You know, I could be happier...</i>

22
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:37,485
<i>having a fresh start.</i>

23
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,965
- Bernie, Flavvy. Come here.
- Come on.

24
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:58,525
- Bernie, come  here.
- Bernie.

25
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,245
-Go on, back you go.
-He got kicked by a donkey yesterday.

26
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:03,205
Come on.

27
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,405
Look what we've got.

28
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,485
Look who's here.

29
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:12,445
- Max and Daniel.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,445
They are very similar to a couple
of donkeys on occasion.

31
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,925
Sometimes they love each other,
and sometimes they butt each other.

32
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,685
In fact, managing donkeys
is sometimes easier than...

33
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,325
managing drivers.

34
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:27,885
<i>All these drivers,</i>
<i>they all have slight insecurities,</i>

35
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,485
<i>like any great sportsman.</i>

36
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,285
<i>Life has been made difficult at the moment</i>
<i>because we've got</i>

37
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:38,085
<i>this exciting emerging talent</i>
<i>in Max Verstappen.</i>

38
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,045
Max isn't yet 21,

39
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:45,685
so, I think that they're just drivers
at different stages in their career.

40
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,445
By the time we get to the August break,
I'm going to be ready for some time off.

41
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:52,365
Yeah.

42
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:55,445
It's gonna be an important year
for Daniel in his career

43
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,365
because he's very much at a crossroads.

44
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:01,925
<i>We'd love to extend the agreement</i>
<i>with him, but, do you know what?</i>

45
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,685
<i>If he doesn't want to be here,</i>
<i>that's Formula One.</i>

46
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,565
<i>It's-- It's a big boy sport.</i>

47
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:10,165
So, what's coming up
in the next few races?

48
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:14,125
- Um, Monaco, next race.
- Is this one of your favorites?

49
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,685
Yeah. Be good to see Max
get a result.

50
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:17,605
Yeah.

51
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,605
So, they want an answer
from us as early as possible.

52
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,005
Who's out of contract then?

53
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,285
-Uh...
-Well, Lewis is going...

54
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,405
Lewis, Kimi, and Valtteri.

55
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,005
If Valtteri has a bad year,

56
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,925
how long are they gonna give him
before they make a decision about

57
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,565
-whether they want to keep him?
-Yeah, exactly.

58
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:53,965
<i>Since joining Red Bull,</i>
<i>it's the first time I've ever had</i>

59
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:58,045
to look for another contract or kind
of been in a position to negotiate,

60
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,325
to have discussions with other teams.

61
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,125
<i>What's being weighed up by us now</i>

62
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,525
is whether or not we make one
of those tactical moves somewhere else,

63
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,565
and the question is obviously, "Where?"

64
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,285
<i>I guess the only thing</i>
<i>on my mind is get results now,</i>

65
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:16,365
<i>because the better I do, the better offers</i>
<i>I'm gonna have probably from other teams.</i>

66
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,645
<i>I obviously want to be fighting</i>
<i>for the World Championship.</i>

67
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:29,725
Based on things as they are right now,
Merc and Ferrari would be there.

68
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,605
They're two obvious candidates,
but, you know...

69
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:34,685
anything can happen.

70
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:36,805
Yeah.

71
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:39,125
<i>I don't really want to rush right now.</i>

72
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:44,205
While Red Bull Racing are nowhere near
the competitive force that they were

73
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,565
when they won four
 world championships in a row,

74
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,605
I think that pales into insignificance
when you see where Williams are

75
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:53,725
compared to where they were
at that same point in time.

76
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,205
Birdie.

77
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,725
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

78
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,125
Goes faster than our car.

79
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:16,045
You didn't hear that, Nate.

80
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,325
So, I am Claire Williams,
and I am the deputy team principal

81
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,245
of the Williams Martini Racing team.

82
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,325
Arms up. Ah, good boy.

83
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,725
Aw.

84
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,085
<i>Williams is everything to me.</i>

85
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:33,205
<i>It's been in my family throughout</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

86
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:37,165
Started by my dad, Frank Williams,
back in 1977.

87
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,045
<i>So, we've been racing for 41 years now.</i>

88
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,765
<i>It became an enormous success story</i>
<i>of the eighties and nineties...</i>

89
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,245
<i>winning 16 world championships,</i>

90
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,005
<i>114 races,</i>

91
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,885
<i>and all as a small, independent team</i>

92
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:57,805
<i>started by a boy with a dream</i>
<i>when he was very, very young.</i>

93
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:03,325
<i>My youth was spent</i>
<i>helping out around the team.</i>

94
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:06,885
So, it really is everything.
It's a big part of what defines me.

95
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:11,845
<i>But I do believe</i>
<i>since I took on my job back in 2013,</i>

96
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,725
<i>the world in which we operate</i>
<i>is a very different place</i>

97
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:15,885
<i>to when Williams first started.</i>

98
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:20,165
They were up in third in 2014 and 2015,
but they've slowly been slipping back

99
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:22,325
<i>and that's a hard thing to turn around.</i>

100
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,765
<i>We face</i>
<i>much greater competition.</i>

101
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,565
<i>We face much more</i>
<i>challenging circumstances</i>

102
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:35,005
<i>in which we have to race</i>
<i>and operate our team.</i>

103
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,525
But sport's not supposed to be easy.

104
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:41,045
Winning isn't easy, and that's why
it's so amazing when you do,

105
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,245
because you deserve it,

106
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,045
and at the moment,
we don't deserve to win.

107
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,805
<i>We've got to put the work in</i>
<i>if we're going to change that.</i>

108
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:52,605
In just five years, they've gone from
fighting for pole positions and podiums

109
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,565
to scraping to get off the last row
of the grid.

110
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,525
<i>You know, there's always a lot</i>
<i>of criticism, but you can't listen to it.</i>

111
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,365
<i>You just have to keep</i> <i>going</i>

112
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,805
<i>and believe that what you are doing</i>
<i>will make changes.</i>

113
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:06,045
Now Williams are going to be getting to
the stage where they're trying to work out

114
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,245
if there's an ingrained problem
they need to change

115
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,245
<i>Do they need to change</i>
<i>their whole outlook?</i>

116
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,685
Um, this car
has not been performing as we'd expect.

117
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:23,525
The first few races, we were literally
 the slowest team on the track.

118
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,805
<i>I've been given</i>
<i>a wonderful opportunity,</i>

119
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:30,965
<i>and I only agreed to do it</i>
<i>because I thought at the time</i>

120
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,285
<i>that I could help</i>
<i>turn the business around.</i>

121
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:39,325
To be very clear, we aren't going down
that road of a B-team.

122
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,965
Any of you that know me well would know
that it would be over my dead body.

123
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,005
You will never read in the press
that Williams has

124
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:50,125
turned itself
into a junior team or a B-team.

125
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,605
<i>I've got this whole history</i>
<i>that I need to protect.</i>

126
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,245
<i>If, under my watch, that were all</i>
<i>to go horribly, horribly wrong,</i>

127
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,845
<i>it would be my fault.</i>

128
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,885
<i>Monaco looks like</i>
<i>it could be a painful weekend.</i>

129
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:06,125
<i>The car is clearly</i>
<i>the slowest in the field,</i>

130
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,045
and more than just Formula One fans
watch Monaco,

131
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,005
because it's bonkers.

132
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:25,725
<i>Monaco is</i>
<i>my favorite race on the calendar.</i>

133
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,925
It's the most...

134
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:31,565
Monaco's the big one.

135
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,165
It's where all the glitterati are.

136
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:41,405
You've got the boats...

137
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,565
the harbor...

138
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,605
<i>the celebrities.</i>

139
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:52,685
<i>It just exudes money,</i>

140
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,165
<i>glamour.</i>

141
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:58,045
It's just a lot of cool shit
in a small space.

142
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:09,325
Monaco is Monaco.
It's the oldest race on the calendar.

143
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,845
<i>It's the prestigious one.</i>

144
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,885
<i>So much heritage. So much history.</i>

145
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:18,525
<i>It's an absolutely incredible sight.</i>

146
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,485
<i>The cars roaring</i>
<i>round the circuit at fantastic speed.</i>

147
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,525
<i> The track</i>
<i>is the same that it has been</i>

148
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:27,965
<i>for pretty much all 76 Grand Prix.</i>

149
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,885
<i>All the greats have raced</i>
<i>and won in Monaco.</i>

150
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:35,885
<i>Fangio,</i>

151
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,325
<i>Graham Hill,</i>

152
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,165
<i>Ayrton Senna.</i>

153
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,565
<i>The pressure and the prestige</i>
<i>that goes with that race,</i>

154
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:48,725
<i>if you come out on top,</i>
<i>winning that Grand Prix,</i>

155
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,485
<i>it's bigger than anything else.</i>

156
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,165
<i>From a Red Bull perspective,</i>

157
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:05,605
<i>they'll have targeted this</i>
<i>from the very start the season.</i>

158
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:09,165
Their car will be suited
to the Monaco Grand Prix circuit,

159
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,365
but Daniel will want to stand out,

160
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,605
because they've seemed to be putting
more and more weight

161
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,605
behind Max Verstappen for its future.

162
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,645
Well, Max has got
that sort of magic dust around him.

163
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,365
<i>He's the next generation coming through.</i>

164
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,485
I like that one.

165
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,725
That is ridiculous.

166
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,965
Yeah. How much do you think
that boat costs?

167
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:38,685
One point eight.

168
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:39,605
One point eight?

169
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:42,765
'Cause I've been
on that one in, uh, Ibiza.

170
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:43,685
Oh, yeah?

171
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:45,965
Honestly, you lose yourself on the boat
 like compared to like...

172
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,485
You have to call other people like,
"Where are you  on the boat?"

173
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,965
Well, it's like a cruise ship.

174
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,205
<i>My name is Max Verstappen,</i>

175
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,325
driving for Aston Martin Red Bull Racing
in Formula One,

176
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,685
and I'm also
the youngest Formula One winner.

177
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,365
<i>So, I live in Monaco. For me, it's just...</i>

178
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,165
like I'm at home really.

179
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,485
Just a bit busier.

180
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:11,845
We are used to, like,
a hotel during a race weekend, so...

181
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,205
You have to do your own
clothes washing?

182
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,365
No. Luckily, my mom is here, so...

183
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:32,045
What would it mean for a driver
in Daniel's position

184
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,085
to know that this kid
who's come in as the young buck

185
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,685
is promised more than he's on?

186
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,725
That's gonna hurt.

187
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,285
<i>I mean, look,</i>
<i>they've invested a lot in Max.</i>

188
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:51,365
<i>One thing that Red Bull love to do</i>
<i>is create headlines, break records.</i>

189
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,405
<i>If he could be the youngest ever</i>
<i>world champion,</i>

190
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,765
<i>that's-- that's a dream scenario for them.</i>

191
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,645
<i>There's clearly gonna be</i>
<i>tension</i> <i>within the team.</i>

192
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,285
<i>They're both fighting, in a sense,</i>
<i> for number one status.</i>

193
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,245
Verstappen has the contract in place.
Daniel's looking for a new one...

194
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:11,085
<i>and that will be playing on Daniel's mind.</i>

195
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,565
Max is clearly one of the big names
of Formula One for the next ten years,

196
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:17,965
<i>but Daniel is still</i>
<i>hugely important to Red Bull.</i>

197
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:28,485
I just want you to know that
there are no number one drivers here.

198
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:32,045
You know, nothing would give us
greater pleasure than to see him...

199
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,085
achieve the world championship
 in one of our cars.

200
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,645
<i>Whatever he says,</i>
<i>I don't believe that's the relationship,</i>

201
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,605
and I think Max is
their chosen star for the future.

202
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,965
And I hope he feels he's got...

203
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,605
you know, he's got
a huge amount of support in the team.

204
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:55,325
You know, there's no pressure
to have the youngest world champion

205
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:57,685
or anything like that.

206
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,325
<i>If they really want me,</i>

207
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:07,325
<i>they need</i> <i>to put something awesome</i>
<i>in front of me and snap me up.</i>

208
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,725
Thanks!

209
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,925
- Super.
- Thank you. See you on Friday.

210
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,525
- Thanks very much. See you later.
- Thank you so much. See you on Friday.

211
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,165
I think Monaco's going to be
a very tough race for us.

212
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:34,845
I hope that our little cars
get through it in one piece...

213
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,165
-and we get some points.
-Yes.

214
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,965
<i> If we don't start scoring points,</i>

215
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:44,245
<i>that gap's just going to widen to a point</i>
<i>where we're not in the mix anymore.</i>

216
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,765
<i>We'll finish tenth.</i>

217
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:51,045
No one wants to come last in any sport,
but particularly so in Formula One.

218
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,045
And it's all to do with money.
There's a sliding scale of payments,

219
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,685
and being bottom means
they get the smallest slice of pie.

220
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,245
<i>The Ferraris, Mercedes,</i>
<i>they're all spending, you know...</i>

221
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,325
north
of three, four hundred million dollars.

222
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,805
<i>But our budget at Williams</i>
<i>is somewhat smaller than that</i>

223
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:10,165
<i>at about 125 sterling a year.</i>

224
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,125
To win in Formula One, you need...

225
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,165
you need money.

226
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:42,005
<i>This sport requires</i>
<i>financial help,</i>

227
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,165
<i>and that financial help</i>
<i>has to come from somewhere.</i>

228
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:48,525
I'm Lance Stroll. I'm 19 years old,

229
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,325
and this is my second season
with Williams Martini Racing.

230
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:55,805
<i> Yeah, I think</i>
<i>it's no great secret</i>

231
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:59,325
that Lawrence has made an investment
based on his son having a seat.

232
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:04,805
And I don't think it can be underestimated
the impact that that can have.

233
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:07,805
Wait. Oh, yeah. All right.

234
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:13,645
But I also have to believe that he has
the best interests of the team at heart.

235
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:19,285
<i>I know I'm born</i>
<i>with a silver spoon in my mouth,</i>

236
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:22,605
<i>but I've seen</i>
<i>paid drivers in the past not deliver.</i>

237
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,165
<i>But when I look at my rookie season,</i>
<i> I've proved a lot of people wrong.</i>

238
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:28,805
<i>Finishing on a podium,</i>
<i>starting on a front row.</i>

239
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,605
<i>Those are all big achievements,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

240
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,965
<i>I strive to be the best I can be.</i>

241
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,125
This is all the same, right?
This hasn't been resurfaced.

242
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:45,285
Well, supposedly, it's from seven
all the way around to 15.

243
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,805
Yeah, this one...

244
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,565
- has caught out a couple of people.
- Yeah.

245
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,445
<i>Lawrence is a businessman,</i>

246
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:57,805
and you don't keep throwing your money
at something that's not working for you.

247
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,965
<i>So, for as long as the team provides</i>

248
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,845
<i>the basis for his boy to be able</i>
<i>to show what he can do,</i>

249
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,525
then you can see him
still being a part of it.

250
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,485
But the second that doesn't happen,

251
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,845
you can be sure he's going to take
his money somewhere else.

252
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,685
<i>This year with Williams,</i>
<i>on and off the track,</i>

253
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,045
has been a frustrating experience.
I'm not gonna lie.

254
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,085
Yeah, there's, uh...
hopefully better times ahead.

255
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:38,085
<i>It's the team's last</i> <i>chance</i>
<i>to get their cars set up right</i>

256
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,405
<i>ahead of qualifying this afternoon.</i>

257
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:44,765
You know, we've got a good package here.
The drivers are in great shape.

258
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,645
You know, they both enjoy this track.
The car looks super...

259
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:48,925
Daniel, how does it feel...

260
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:51,045
...to work yourselves
back into this championship?

261
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,765
- Still some unfinished business.
- And you've come here to win?

262
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,125
To make the difference,
you have to risk it a bit more.

263
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:58,205
- Red Bull are the favorites.
- The favorites, do you feel as such?

264
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,405
I'm just looking forward to get started.

265
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,165
<i>Our car works well in Monaco,</i>

266
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:13,765
<i>because Monaco has</i>
<i>the least straights of the year,</i>

267
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,885
<i>which means horsepower isn't everything,</i>

268
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,725
<i>so therefore, we're able to compensate</i>
<i>with a great chassis</i>

269
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,925
<i>and give the drivers confidence</i>
<i>they can run up close to the barriers.</i>

270
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:24,765
<i>They can extract that lap time</i>
<i>from the cars.</i>

271
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:28,645
<i>If you're Red Bull right now,</i>

272
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,805
you really want to see
Max Verstappen win this race,

273
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,445
because you've invested in him.

274
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:33,965
You've put your faith in him
for the future,

275
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,685
but it's so hard to overtake.

276
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,125
You've got to do it in qualifying,

277
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,085
and that means pushing
to the absolute limit,

278
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:41,845
and that's why Saturday
is spectacular here.

279
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,885
<i>I've always come</i>
<i> into Monaco</i> <i>fired up.</i>

280
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,885
<i>It's the most difficult circuit</i>
<i>on the calendar.</i>

281
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,485
<i>It's the circuit with</i>
<i>the most smallest margin for error.</i>

282
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,605
<i>I think a race win</i>
<i>is definitely possible here in Monaco.</i>

283
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:57,925
<i>I've been...</i>

284
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:00,405
I think, driving a lot better.

285
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:04,205
I've been in qualifying
really strong compared to Daniel as well.

286
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,245
<i>I'm feeling good.</i>

287
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:21,685
<i> Finally a chance to see</i>
<i>if Red Bull really are in fighting form</i>

288
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,125
<i>as Max Verstappen heads out for practice.</i>

289
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,765
<i>Max Verstappen makes his way</i>
<i>onto the track.</i>

290
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,885
<i>This will be a good indication</i>
<i>of what he'll be able to do </i>

291
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,885
<i>come qualifying this afternoon.</i>

292
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:44,445
Well, Max has got that sort of
magic, beautiful driving style.

293
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:48,765
<i>It is a tough track.</i>

294
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:51,045
<i>It's always, you know, bumpy, low grip.</i>

295
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,565
<i>If you have a little slide,</i>
<i>you can end up in the wall.</i>

296
00:18:56,605 --> 00:19:00,445
<i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>on the fastest lap of the session so far.</i>

297
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:04,765
<i>You won't meet any driver</i>
<i>hungrier than Max Verstappen.</i>

298
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:09,405
<i>He wants to be fastest on every session,</i>
<i>every race. It's fantastic.</i>

299
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,725
<i> Oh, someone's hit a barrier.</i>
<i>It's Max Verstappen.</i>

300
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:24,245
<i>One of the favorites for pole position</i>
<i>later on this afternoon</i>

301
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,845
<i>has absolutely clobbered the barriers.</i>

302
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,045
<i>You just think, "Fuck it."</i>

303
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:38,045
<i>He was just pushing too hard, too soon.</i>
<i>He made a silly mistake.</i>

304
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,165
<i>Red flag for a Red Bull.</i>

305
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,845
<i>It's a red flag.</i>
<i>Stay to the left-hand side.</i>

306
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:44,605
<i>It's parked to the right.</i>

307
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:49,245
<i>He's given his team a massive</i>
<i>repair job to get that car ready</i>

308
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:51,285
<i>for the qualifying session.</i>

309
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:55,805
<i>It is painful,</i>
<i>because if it has a bad</i> <i>outcome...</i>

310
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,965
<i>you are even more angry.</i>

311
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,005
<i> You've got a pretty small window</i>
<i>of time of about two hours</i>

312
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,325
<i>to get the car turned</i> <i>around</i>
<i>and into qualifying.</i>

313
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,645
<i>I've got confidence in the mechanics,</i>

314
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,765
<i>but there's nothing guaranteed.</i>

315
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,045
<i>Max Verstappen's chips</i>
<i>scattered right now.</i>

316
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,085
<i>What are the odds of his car</i>
<i>making qualifying after his earlier crash?</i>

317
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:36,085
<i> Arguably, the most exciting</i>
<i>qualifying session of the season</i>

318
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,125
<i>is here in Monte Carlo.</i>

319
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:41,885
<i>Qualifying today, very, very important.</i>

320
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:53,085
<i>Lance Stroll in the Williams</i>
<i>heading out for his session.</i>

321
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:55,565
<i> Loud and clear.</i>

322
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,365
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Showing Luca on the radio.</i>

323
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,965
- <i> Loud and clear.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

324
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,325
<i>See how he goes this afternoon.</i>

325
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,205
Lance struggled moving around a lot
in the seat in the first session.

326
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,045
He was moving around too much.
So, anyway, they've tried to fix it.

327
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,925
-Tell me that was fixed.
-It hasn't happened before.

328
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:13,325
-No, it's the first time all season.
-Okay, well, let's hope it's a one-off.

329
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,045
They think the belts
were just getting loose all session.

330
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,245
Okay. All right.

331
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,925
Let's hope it's a one-off then, Lawrence.

332
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:34,325
Target for now, plus 30 seconds.
Taking temp out of the rear.

333
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,685
<i> It's quite busy into the corner now.</i>
<i>Everybody on slow laps.</i>

334
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,445
<i>The fricking headrest is loose.</i>

335
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,525
-<i>Fucking hell.</i>
-It's okay.

336
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:57,245
<i> Just fix it.</i>

337
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,485
<i> Okay, we'll do it next time around.</i>

338
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,325
Okay, Lance. We need four tenths,

339
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,485
and we need a twelve nine
to get through, okay?

340
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,405
<i> I'm really suffering</i> <i>with traction</i>
<i>and all those kind of things.</i>

341
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,525
<i>Oh, this is on the edge now.</i>

342
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,245
<i>Too much understeer, guys.</i>

343
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:22,565
<i>It can't go quicker like this.</i>

344
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:28,205
<i>And that's a 1:13.3</i>
<i>for Lance Stroll.</i>

345
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:31,125
<i>Another disappointing performance</i>
<i>for Williams.</i>

346
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:34,445
<i>They'll be starting towards</i>
<i>the back of the grid on race day.</i>

347
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,165
<i>Breaking news from Red Bull.</i>

348
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:41,525
<i>Max Verstappen, one of the favorites</i>
<i>to take poll this afternoon</i>

349
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,285
<i>out of qualifying</i>
<i>before he even gets going.</i>

350
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,805
<i>We managed to get the car turned around,</i>

351
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,245
<i>but, unfortunately,</i>
<i>when firing up the engine,</i>

352
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,925
<i>suddenly we saw a big oil</i> <i>leak</i>
<i>from the gear box.</i>

353
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:58,885
<i>There was no chance then</i>
<i>to make the qualifying.</i>

354
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,045
He's a very, very fast driver.
We know that. That's not within any doubt.

355
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,605
<i>This place bites hard if you abuse it,</i>

356
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,805
and unfortunately, there's no more
brutal lesson than what he's just had,

357
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:14,725
so, uh, you know, I'm sure that he's
smart enough to hopefully learn from that.

358
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:21,965
<i>All Red Bull's hopes now rest</i>
<i>with Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

359
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:26,965
<i>Can he beat Ferrari and Mercedes</i>
<i> to start in pole position on race day?</i>

360
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,285
<i>Lewis Hamilton is flying.</i>

361
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:44,245
<i>Here comes Vettel.</i>

362
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,045
<i>Okay, mate. Currently P1...</i>

363
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,325
<i>Six tenths quicker</i>
<i>than everyone else at the moment.</i>

364
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:54,365
- <i>So everyone's slow behind?</i>
<i>- Yeah, everyone's slow behind.</i>

365
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:56,925
Hülkenberg behind is slow.

366
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:59,285
Räikkönen also slow behind him.

367
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,605
<i> Grid position is everything.</i>

368
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,925
<i>If you drive in the middle of the road</i>
<i>in a race,</i>

369
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:11,405
<i>it's almost impossible for the car behind</i>
<i>to be able to overtake.</i>

370
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:16,445
<i>So, the intensity of qualifying</i>
<i> becomes even more important.</i>

371
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,605
<i>The streets of Monaco</i>
<i>are so tight.</i>

372
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:23,085
<i>Everything's coming at you so fast.</i>

373
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:35,485
<i>Max Verstappen watches on.</i>
<i>He can do nothing.</i>

374
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,565
<i>You are now quickest by two tenths. </i>

375
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,285
<i> Okay.</i>

376
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,725
<i> Sebastian Vettel</i> <i>has taken</i>
<i>front row at the moment as we go on.</i>

377
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,045
<i> This is gonna be so close.</i>

378
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:52,245
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, he was on pole,</i>
<i>of course, here in 2016,</i>

379
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,245
<i>crosses the line</i>

380
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,245
<i>now you're going to the one-tens.</i>
<i>What a lap!</i>

381
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:58,845
<i>Pole by a country mile.</i>

382
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,365
Whoo hoo!

383
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,405
<i>And that is pole position.</i>
<i>Nice job, mate.</i>

384
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,805
<i>Fuck, yes!</i>

385
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,045
Delighted for the pole,
but we should've had two cars up there,

386
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,365
and, uh... it's frustrating to not have
both cars on the front row of the grid.

387
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,925
<i>All right, that's 50% done.</i>
<i>Let's finish this shit tomorrow.</i>

388
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,085
Until I lift that trophy
and feel that weight,

389
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:26,245
um, I won't be completely satisfied.

390
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,445
I don't think Daniel's putting
a foot wrong at the moment.

391
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,525
If the team have got
question marks in anybody,

392
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,645
it's why they've spent
so much money on Max.

393
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:44,165
Max put it in the wall

394
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,605
trying to prove to the world
that he was quicker than Daniel.

395
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:50,725
<i>And he sacrificed his entire weekend</i>
<i>for what? For nothing.</i>

396
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,925
Daniel is starting to stand out
as the more consistent

397
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,245
and the more stable option
that Red Bull have got.

398
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,965
So if Daniel then delivers again here

399
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:02,045
and Max misses
another opportunity to win,

400
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,525
you wonder if doubts will creep in
at Red Bull about whether

401
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,165
they've put their money
behind the right driver at this stage.

402
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:10,285
In percentage terms,
how confident are you of keeping him?

403
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:15,245
Um, it's always difficult
to put a number on these things,

404
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,365
but we're very, very happy with Daniel.

405
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:20,405
He does a great job in the team.
He's a popular member in the team,

406
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:23,845
and there's a desire for us
to retain him for next year.

407
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:35,285
<i>This is what it's all about</i>
<i>when it comes to motor</i> <i>racing.</i>

408
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:40,365
<i>There is one place</i> <i>to be today,</i>
<i>and that is here in Monte Carlo.</i>

409
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:43,565
<i>Daniel Ricciardo in pole position.</i>

410
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,845
<i>Sebastian Vettel in second.</i>

411
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,485
<i>And because of his disaster in qualifying,</i>

412
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:54,285
<i>Max Verstappen will start</i>
<i>right at the back in last place.</i>

413
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,645
Max, how are you doing this morning?

414
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,285
Not so good.

415
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:11,685
<i> If we could get</i> <i>points</i>
<i>on one car,</i>

416
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,645
<i>that would be a great achievement,</i>

417
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:16,245
<i>but if we could get both cars,</i>
<i>even better.</i>

418
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:19,165
<i>If there was a huge great pileup</i>
<i>at the start of the race</i>

419
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:22,725
<i>and our cars just went through,</i>
<i>one can only dream, can't you?</i>

420
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,685
Ten less than P3.

421
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,045
<i>The waiting sucks.</i>

422
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,445
<i>I just want this race to start already.</i>

423
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:35,245
<i>I feel, this year, with the car we've got,</i>

424
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:38,205
<i>you know, since 2016,</i>
<i>it's my best chance to win.</i>

425
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:42,085
<i>Basically the win was taken from me</i>
<i>through no fault of my own.</i>

426
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:51,525
<i>Got the first pole position of my career.</i>
<i>I had a comfortable lead.</i>

427
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:55,925
<i> Daniel Ricciardo is looking</i>
<i>set to win the Monaco Grand Prix.</i>

428
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,525
<i>Okay, Dan, now box this lap,</i>
<i>please. Box this lap.</i>

429
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:00,445
<i> The team called me in,</i>

430
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:02,645
<i>and I come in the pits,</i>

431
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:05,645
<i>and there's no tires there.</i>

432
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,125
<i>And it's like a shit show.</i>

433
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,925
<i>They haven't got</i>
<i>the tires ready. The tires aren't ready.</i>

434
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:15,445
<i>The pit stop, instead of being</i>
<i>three seconds, it was more than ten.</i>

435
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:17,965
<i> Ricciardo is sat there, waiting.</i>

436
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:22,805
<i>I come out the pits,</i>

437
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:26,725
<i>and literally see Lewis just come past me.</i>

438
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,205
<i>Hamilton now leads</i>
<i>after a pit-stop that saw</i>

439
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,245
<i>Daniel Ricciardo sat stranded</i>
<i>waiting for his tires.</i>

440
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:36,165
<i> So, I lost the race.</i>

441
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:41,205
Right now, I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear anything. I, uh...

442
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,125
I want to get out of here, to be honest.

443
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,365
This one hurts a lot.

444
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:51,445
<i> 2018. This is my time.</i>
<i>It's my fucking time.</i>

445
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:56,045
If he can go and win this race
and beat Max,

446
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,685
that tells Red Bull that they need
to put their faith in him,

447
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:00,205
but that might not be his main priority.

448
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:04,045
He might think, "I need to show myself
as a great opportunity for another team,

449
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,405
a Mercedes or a Ferrari."

450
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:08,645
<i> The 2018 Monaco Grand Prix.</i>

451
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,885
<i>It is time to get</i> <i>down</i>
<i>to the serious business.</i>

452
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:15,125
<i>As we count down</i>
<i>towards the start of this race...</i>

453
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,965
<i>The driver can make</i>
<i>the difference around this track.</i>

454
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:20,005
<i>The story so far, Daniel Ricciardo</i>

455
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,285
<i>in the Red Bull,</i>
<i>has dominated the whole weekend.</i>

456
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:25,285
<i>Every single practice session,</i>
<i>every single qualifying.</i>

457
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:29,845
<i>Verstappen had the chance for pole,</i>
<i>but it's 20th and last for the Dutchman.</i>

458
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,485
<i>What can Ricciardo do</i>
<i>from the front of the grid?</i>

459
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,765
<i>Will good fortune shine</i>
<i>on Williams</i>

460
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:39,405
<i>with Lance Stroll in 17th place?</i>

461
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:44,325
<i>The grid is cleared in Monaco</i>
<i>with Daniel Ricciardo on pole position.</i>

462
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:46,965
<i>It's a tense moment</i>
<i>as the lights go on.</i>

463
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,125
<i> Vettel is trying to attack</i>
<i> into turn one!</i>

464
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,245
<i>But he's not quite close enough.</i>

465
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:06,485
<i>Ricciardo leading, but Vettel is</i>
<i>very, very</i> <i>close to the back of him.</i>

466
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,685
<i>The gap behind to Vettel, one point one.</i>

467
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,685
<i>So far everything feels all right.</i>

468
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,805
<i>Max Verstappen's already gone past</i>
<i>Grosjean and Magnussen.</i>

469
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,725
<i>Is he gonna try and launch one?</i>
<i>He is, down</i> <i>the inside. On Lance Stroll.</i>

470
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,805
- <i>Nice move, Max. Well done.</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

471
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:31,445
<i>With this pace, he can just</i>
<i>keep picking these off one</i> <i>by one.</i>

472
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,525
<i>Lance Stroll</i>
<i>fighting with Leclerc.</i>

473
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:40,125
<i>Oh, a bit of contact.</i>

474
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,205
<i> What's the problem with the car?</i>

475
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:45,405
<i>Something happened.</i>

476
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:47,285
<i>I think the front wing is damaged.</i>

477
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,445
<i>And so it's a front wing change</i>
<i>and the tires.</i>

478
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:05,085
<i>Daniel, you're doing</i>
<i>a really good job, mate.</i>

479
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,605
<i>That's really good stuff.</i>
<i>You just need to keep it smooth.</i>

480
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:08,845
<i>I got it, buddy.</i>

481
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:13,165
<i> Ricciardo still leading</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel.</i>

482
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:22,165
And box, Daniel, Box. Box.

483
00:31:22,245 --> 00:31:23,365
Box this lap.

484
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:30,405
<i>Remember the pit-stop</i>
<i>that cost him victory here in 2016.</i>

485
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:43,925
<i>Yes, boys.</i>

486
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,685
<i>Ricciardo relieved</i>
<i>that that pit-stop went okay.</i>

487
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:49,485
<i>Yeah, no problems</i>
<i>this time around for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

488
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,165
<i>He's still smiling this afternoon.</i>

489
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:54,925
<i>Let's keep it focused, mate.</i>
<i>Keep it focused.</i>

490
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:59,445
<i>Verstappen gets</i>
<i>a really good exit. He's gonna go for it.</i>

491
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:01,365
<i>Of course he is. He's Max Verstappen.</i>

492
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,765
<i>Yes! Whoo!</i>

493
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:10,365
<i>Verstappen moves up</i>
<i>into ninth</i> <i>place.</i>

494
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:18,925
<i> Ricciardo seems</i>
<i>to have a problem.</i>

495
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,285
<i>And you can see it,</i>
<i>slowing down dramatically.</i>

496
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:24,725
<i>I see trouble brewing.</i>

497
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,445
<i> I'm losing power.</i>

498
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,485
<i>Let me know if I can do something.</i>

499
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,245
<i>Fail one fail. Fail one fail.</i>

500
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,565
<i>This could totally change the race.</i>

501
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,405
<i> Will it get better?</i>

502
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,485
<i> Negative, Daniel. Negative.</i>

503
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:43,285
<i> The MGU-K failed.</i>

504
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,685
<i>That usually means the engine is screwed</i>

505
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,925
<i>and it's 99% you have to retire the car.</i>

506
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,565
<i>The minute Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>makes a mistake,</i>

507
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:54,645
<i>Sebastian Vettel is all over him.</i>

508
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:02,365
<i>This is like a moment of defeat.</i>
<i>A moment of helplessness.</i>

509
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:05,685
<i>Part of you just wants to rip</i>
<i>the steering wheel off and just throw it.</i>

510
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:07,165
<i>How is this happening?</i>

511
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:11,965
<i>How long can Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>keep Sebastian Vettel behind</i> <i>him?</i>

512
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,485
<i>Can he keep him behind him?</i>

513
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:18,645
<i>I know it's hard,</i>
<i>but keep it focused.</i>

514
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,645
<i>Yeah, I got no power though.</i>

515
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:23,925
<i>To finish first,</i>
<i>first you have to finish.</i>

516
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:38,485
<i>Lance Stroll is two laps</i>
<i>behind the race leader now.</i>

517
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:41,085
<i>The brake pedal's</i>
<i>going really, really long.</i>

518
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:43,085
<i>Concentrate on turn 19.</i>

519
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:45,045
<i> I don't understand.</i>
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

520
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,285
<i>What's the point in even racing now?</i>

521
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,925
<i> Stroll's just struggled</i>
<i>with the car all weekend long.</i>

522
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:51,765
<i>I tell you what,</i>
<i>it never rains, but it pours.</i>

523
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:53,645
<i>For Williams at the moment,</i>
<i>it is pouring.</i>

524
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,805
<i>Vettel now pushing harder.</i>

525
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:00,885
<i>Ten laps of focus. Ten laps to go.</i>

526
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:05,325
<i>This problem that</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo's had for so, so long</i>

527
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:07,205
<i>is still being managed.</i>

528
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:11,365
<i> It was just totally intense,</i>
<i>because he couldn't get beyond sixth gear,</i>

529
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:12,765
<i>'cause there just wasn't the power.</i>

530
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,005
<i>You gotta feel for him</i>
<i>in that cockpit at the moment.</i>

531
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:19,005
<i>His nerves are gonna be</i>
<i>shredded to pieces.</i>

532
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,285
<i>Keep putting pressure. You're doing well.</i>

533
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,685
<i>Head down till the end.</i>
<i>He will make a mistake.</i>

534
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,205
<i> It's out of your control.</i>

535
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:32,485
<i>But then you think, if I start playing</i>
<i>the sad story, then it's not gonna help.</i>

536
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:34,605
<i>There are three laps to go.</i>

537
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,325
<i>Daniel, you're doing</i>
<i>a really good job, mate.</i>

538
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:38,645
<i>Very impressive.</i>

539
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,165
<i> I'm thinking, "We're leading</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix.</i>

540
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,125
<i>I don't care if this engine goes bang."</i>

541
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,725
<i> Yeah, we can win it.</i>
<i>So, let's</i> <i>fucking win it.</i>

542
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,205
<i>It's a big lockup for Vettel.</i>
<i>Can he get it stopped?</i>

543
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:00,365
<i>Just about.</i>

544
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:03,525
<i>Stoffel Vandoorne isn't</i>
<i>in the battle for the lead,</i>

545
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:06,485
<i>but he's come out between</i>
<i>the two leaders after his pit-stop.</i>

546
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,005
<i> Is this believable</i>
<i>what this guy is doing?</i>

547
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:12,445
<i>I would imagine Ricciardo</i>
<i>is starting to smile</i>

548
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,005
<i>just that little bit more.</i>

549
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,005
<i>Ricciardo starts his final lap.</i>

550
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,805
<i>You can't deny,</i>
<i>he really does deserve it this weekend.</i>

551
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:34,885
<i> Today at Monte Carlo,</i>
<i>it's redemption day for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

552
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:40,525
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, you</i> <i>are our hero.</i>

553
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,245
<i>Un-fucking-believable.</i>

554
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:44,805
Yes!

555
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:56,565
<i>To see your car and driver</i>
<i>cross the line first</i>

556
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:59,005
<i>is like no other feeling in the world.</i>

557
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:16,725
<i>It's very difficult to come</i>
<i>to terms with when you're not winning.</i>

558
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:21,605
<i>We haven't won a race now</i>
<i>for nearly six years.</i>

559
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:22,805
<i>That's a long time.</i>

560
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,605
<i>When should I go,</i>
<i>"Actually, do you know what?</i>

561
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:31,245
<i>Maybe I'm not the right person to do this.</i>

562
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,805
<i>Am I good enough to do it?</i>
<i> Do I have the capability?"</i>

563
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:00,685
There they are. Wanna hold it?

564
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:04,525
Oh, here you go.

565
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:05,485
Wow.

566
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,805
It's the most
proudest parents in town.

567
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,125
Oh!

568
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,365
-Oh, well done, you.
-Thanks, mate.

569
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:13,405
- Oh, you did. He did. He did.
- That was class.

570
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:15,365
I'm not sure whether the price
has gone down or up.

571
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:19,285
-Amazing. Amazing.
-Unbelievable.

572
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,365
<i>He did</i>
<i>an unbelievable job today, eh?</i>

573
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:27,685
Well, you know, it's just really painful.

574
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:29,565
It'll come.

575
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,565
You know. So, be happy
for your teammate today.

576
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,645
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Celebrate with him.

577
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,125
You know how this business is.

578
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,965
-It's up and down.
-Yeah.

579
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,685
<i>I should have won that race,</i>

580
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:51,365
<i>and seeing the whole team happy,</i>
<i>it's hard.</i>

581
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:54,205
<i>Because you're standing there,</i>
<i>you have to try and smile and be happy,</i>

582
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,845
<i>'cause the whole team's happy, but--</i>

583
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:58,085
Yeah, for me, it was definitely
the worst moment

584
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:00,645
and I was really not happy.
I could literally...

585
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:03,685
break down
the whole Energy Station by myself.

586
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,685
<i> I was so thrilled,</i>
<i>because I knew what it meant to him.</i>

587
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,045
<i>Yeah.</i>

588
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,525
<i>It was the best.</i>

589
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,165
Yeah!

590
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:20,085
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>the best in the world,</i>

591
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,085
<i>and I believe I've got the talent</i>
<i>and I've put in the work.</i>

592
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:27,725
<i>Without getting arrogant,</i>
<i>certainly gonna have some--</i>

593
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,685
<i>some serious offers on the table.</i>

594
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,685
Yeah!

595
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,925
<i> Comments from Red Bull</i>
<i>involving the engine</i>

596
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,325
<i>has been a step too far.</i>

597
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:51,165
<i>The red line crossed.</i>

598
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,205
<i>That is a big, big issue.</i>

599
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,965
<i>We've been paying to fly in first class,</i>
<i>but ended up with an economy ticket.</i>

600
00:38:57,645 --> 00:38:59,445
<i>We need to see that people respect us.</i>

601
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,965
<i> The relationship</i>
<i>with Cyril's been difficult.</i>

602
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:06,085
<i> Every single race win</i>
<i>that Red Bull had was with Renault.</i>

603
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:08,765
<i>He's an emotional guy.</i>
<i>You never know what you're gonna get.</i>

604
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:11,005
<i>Crunch time. </i>

605
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:13,245
<i>And it means a lot</i>
<i>to be racing against Red Bull.</i>

606
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,645
<i>We need to make a decision.</i>
