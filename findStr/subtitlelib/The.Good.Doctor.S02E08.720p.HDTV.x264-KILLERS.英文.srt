20
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,000
Murphy, single-vehicle car crash incoming.

21
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,670
Two victims, husband and wife. You want in?

22
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,290
Yes, I would like that very much.

23
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,530
Motor-vehicle accident. The other victim's behind us.

24
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,430
41-year-old female, lacerations to her face,

25
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,110
contusions on her chest and abdomen.

26
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,470
She was behind the wheel when she lost consciousness.

27
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,350
She has 3 centimeters full-thickness scalp lac

28
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,950
extending to her hairline.

29
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,630
Heart rate's normal.

30
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,040
Possible internal bleeding. What are we doing, Dr. Browne?

31
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,220
- FAST ultrasound? - Get on it.

32
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,170
45-year-old male. Superficial abrasions to the neck.

33
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,140
Appears that he's dislocated his hip.

34
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,700
The affected limb is in position of flexion

35
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,550
and internally rotated.

36
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
We need to relocate the hip.

37
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,800
Do a Captain Morgan.

38
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,830
How are we doing?

39
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,650
There is a lot of free fluid in the recto-uterine space

40
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,890
and Morison's pouch from internal bleeding.

41
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,730
Let's get her into O.R. One.

42
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,920
When you're done, join us, Dr. Murphy.

43
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,020
Okay.

44
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,800
Where are they taking my wife?

45
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,640
She has internal bleeding,

46
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,720
so they are taking her to surgery.

47
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,300
Today is our 10-year anniversary.

48
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,940
Tell them not to let her die.

49
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,710
That woman is my everything. She's all I have.

50
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,100
We use a small tool called a laparoscope,

51
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,360
kind of like a metal straw.

52
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,810
We go in through here, here, and here,

53
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,320
everything gets tucked back inside, and we're done.

54
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,310
It only leaves a few small scars.

55
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,750
How long have you had a stiff neck?

56
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,100
Uh, a couple days.

57
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,860
Been feeling tired or have back pain?

58
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,710
A little bit of both, I guess.

59
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,780
Going to test your reflexes.

60
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,810
Left patellar reflex is minimally responsive.

61
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,950
What's that mean?

62
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,690
We might have to postpone the surgery.

63
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,900
We're gonna run some tests.

64
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,490
If everything checks out and we figure out

65
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,600
why you have pain and fatigue, we'll operate.

66
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,910
Come here, bud.

67
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,970
Spleen and liver are fully packed.

68
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,380
Where's all this blood coming from? Suction.

69
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,320
- How's the hubby? - His hip has been relocated.

70
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,360
He asked me to tell you not to let her die.

71
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,550
She's his everything.

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
Duly noted.

73
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,110
Retract the stomach.

74
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,480
Can't find the bleed.

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Hold on. The left Fallopian tube is swollen,

76
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,730
and there's a large defect in it. It's ruptured.

77
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,090
Our labs came back negative,

78
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,010
but Finn's fatigue and left-leg weakness

79
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,130
suggests a viral or bacterial infection.

80
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,570
Well, he hasn't had a fever.

81
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Other than the stiff neck, he's been fine.

82
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,200
Are his vaccines up to date?

83
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,270
Your pediatrician didn't send us anything.

84
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,340
He's never been vaccinated.

85
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,580
But my niece came down with long-term intestinal problems

86
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,840
after getting a shot.

87
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,650
We did a lot of research.

88
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,070
Things have only gotten scarier since.

89
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,600
Not really.

90
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,730
Weakness and fever might mean polio.

91
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,770
If you guys traveled outside the U.S.

92
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,870
We don't travel.

93
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,510
And we reduce his exposure to infectious disease

94
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,850
by putting him in a public school,

95
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,660
where he's surrounded by vaccinated kids.

96
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,970
That's herd immunity.

97
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,400
By surrounding him with vaccinated kids,

98
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,520
you're tacitly admitting that vaccines work.

99
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,810
Oh, we're not saying they don't work.

100
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,950
It's just not worth the risk.

101
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,350
They save millions of lives. You're endangering your --

102
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,690
I get it. I've worked with other families

103
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,200
who feel the same way as you.

104
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,010
It comes down to personal choice.

105
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,140
Dr. Park, may I consult with you outside?

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,450
Excuse us.

107
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,510
They're gonna be here for a while.

108
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
If I gain their trust,

109
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I can work to change their views from the inside.

110
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,700
They're part of a movement with social-media support

111
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,960
and bogus research to feed their beliefs.

112
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,350
You want to help? Send them away.

113
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,970
"Do no harm."

114
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm not sending them home with a sick kid.

115
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,270
One of my best friends refused to vaccinate her 1-year-old boy.

116
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,940
I told her she was crazy.

117
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,470
Three pediatricians refused to take her on.

118
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,610
She was rejected so often

119
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,260
that she was finally considering vaccinations.

120
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,430
And then some idiot decided to "Do no harm,"

121
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,950
that it was better that Carol's kid had a doctor than a vaccine.

122
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,480
A year later,

123
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,920
the kid contracted whooping cough.

124
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,220
A month after that, she was planning his funeral.

125
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,460
I'm sorry for your friend.

126
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,180
But we don't have a choice. He's already a patient.

127
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
Let's test him for polio.

128
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,960
Your wife is gonna be fine.

129
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,320
She had a ruptured Fallopian tube.

130
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,840
Mr. Williams, unfortunately,

131
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,660
we couldn't save the pregnancy.

132
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,120
The fertilized egg

133
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,720
implanted outside the uterus.

134
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,480
Pregnancy?

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,880
It was fairly early. She may not have told you,

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,240
may not have even known herself.

137
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,270
That can't be.

138
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,400
I had a vasectomy 10 years ago,

139
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,820
right before we got married.

140
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,890
I need to see my wife.

141
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,230
Mr. Williams, that's not possible.

142
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,240
She's, uh -- she's sleeping. She needs to rest.

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
There's no way she was pregnant.

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,590
- You guys made a mistake. - No.

145
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,680
We didn't make a mistake.

146
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,590
She's not like that.

147
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,690
If she gets the wrong change for coffee,

148
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,800
she's driving back 20 minutes to make it right.

149
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,330
And the sex?

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,630
We haven't been this active since our honeymoon.

151
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,240
Maybe the vasectomy failed.

152
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm sorry, but...

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,060
a vasectomy doesn't just fail after 10 years.

154
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,330
It is more likely she got pregnant

155
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,300
from someone who is not you.

156
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,280
Dr. Claire Browne is being courted

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,850
by other residency programs.

158
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,180
Heard it from the President of Kaiser San Jose.

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,110
He was surprised to hear that she was leaving. So was I.

160
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,950
Just 'cause she's taking meetings

161
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,370
doesn't mean she's leaving.

162
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,710
When I was a resident,

163
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,470
if someone was willing to buy me food,

164
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,510
I would meet with them almost anywhere.

165
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,350
She's approaching them.

166
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,420
I don't like being blindsided, Marcus.

167
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,340
Well, this is news to me.

168
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,880
But I also didn't know I had to report human-resources issues

169
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
to the vice president of the foundation.

170
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Why isn't she happy?

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,910
She went over Melendez's head,

172
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,440
and now he's freezing her out.

173
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,680
And I have no interest in getting in the middle of that.

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,700
You're the president. It's your call.

175
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,600
But I wonder how it would look

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,440
if St. Bonaventure lost two of its surgical residents

177
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,210
with diverse backgrounds in less than a year.

178
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,470
Is it polio?

179
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,760
Uh, we're still waiting on the results.

180
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,690
Yeah, I was talking to my colleague,

181
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,870
and I realized I owe you an apology.

182
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,140
I lied to you.

183
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,940
I had this good friend I grew up with.

184
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,260
She had a 1-year-old boy she didn't want to vaccinate.

185
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,450
She couldn't find a pediatrician.

186
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,660
Do you guys use alternative medicine --

187
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,640
homeopathic, herbs?

188
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,580
Homeopathic.

189
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,840
Oh, that's what Carol, my friend, did, too.

190
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,690
Unfortunately, I...

191
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,130
guess they didn't work.

192
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,880
The boy came down with whooping cough.

193
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,300
The coughing got worse.

194
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,750
One night...

195
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,880
the boy just stopped breathing.

196
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,430
I know you know this stuff.

197
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,740
You know how dangerous these diseases are.

198
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,330
But it's different for me.

199
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,430
It's...different when you see

200
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,240
a friend go through this.

201
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,600
Please reconsider.

202
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,920
Dr. Reznick?

203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,530
Do you have the test results?

204
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,850
Finn is negative for polio.

205
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,900
But given the leg weakness and how the spine controls movement,

206
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,450
we'd like to do an MRI.

207
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,220
Thank you... for your advice,

208
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,040
and we are sorry for your friend,

209
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,910
but our opinion hasn't changed.

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,150
Any fatigue, skin problems?

211
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,690
No and no.

212
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,220
Difficulty swallowing?

213
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,060
No, and no dry mouth, no soreness of the jaw,

214
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,820
no lymphedema, no seizures.

215
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,020
Do you want to sit here and do my job?

216
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,000
I could.

217
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,360
Radiation's going fine.

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,350
Just a little nausea.

219
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
Is that why you forgot where you left your wallet?

220
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,480
Oh, stop!

221
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,990
People forget where they put their wallets.

222
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,350
People do that. It was just a little...

223
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,690
memory lapse, a slip, nothing more.

224
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,130
Have you had any other memory slips recently?

225
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,720
Not that I remember.

226
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,530
No!

227
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,630
You're lying.

228
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,280
And you know that I know you are lying.

229
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,740
What do you think is gained by that?

230
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,030
I think I avoid you blowing out of proportion the fact

231
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,480
that I forgot where I parked my car the other day once,

232
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,340
and again, not unique to radiation.

233
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,780
I want to do mini-mental-status exam.

234
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,130
Not gonna happen.

235
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,280
Would you let your patients treat you this way?

236
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,540
- Yeah. - No.

237
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,480
- Yeah. - No!

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,850
Well, then again, you're not me.

239
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,010
Thank God!

240
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,150
If this is memory loss, it would impact your coordination,

241
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,530
also your ability to juggle multiple tasks.

242
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,130
You would need more in-home care,

243
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,950
and your driving would -

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,690
I'm not gonna give up my car

245
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,690
because I might have misplaced my remote.

246
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,550
And I didn't misplace my remote.

247
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,570
I know where it is. It's on the coffee table

248
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,640
next to the National Geographic from June of last year.

249
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,660
Page 74, two-thirds of the way through an article on medicine

250
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,350
in Hawaii -- Haiti.

251
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,510
Medicine in Haiti.

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,410
If anything changes, don't forget to tell me.

253
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,660
- Thank you. - Thank you.

254
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,050
You stole my story.

255
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,610
It's a good story.

256
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,770
Stories don't change minds.

257
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,390
Stories are the only things that change minds.

258
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,940
We're compelled by fear more than reason.

259
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,930
What these people fear

260
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,230
is doing something that will hurt their child.

261
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,470
So they do nothing,

262
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,700
thinking that inoculates them.

263
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,290
They won't change.

264
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,110
Care to wager on that?

265
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll take your money.

266
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,800
Not money. Liquor. I like me some whiskey.

267
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
St. Elison 23 Year Bourbon.

268
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,300
Fine. You will owe me a 2002 Chateau Montpouillan

269
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,130
the blue bottle, not the black.

270
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,010
Never seen that before.

271
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,300
Our boy has two spinal cords.

272
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,450
It's called diastematomyelia.

273
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,410
It's a congenital disorder in which

274
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,770
part of the spinal cord is split in two.

275
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,620
Congenital? So he's had it since birth?

276
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,670
Why didn't anyone see it?

277
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,370
It's rare, and with no obvious symptoms,

278
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,600
doctors generally have no reason to look.

279
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,780
The problem is, when Finn hit puberty,

280
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,090
the split spinal cords rapidly stretched.

281
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,430
The two strands got tethered to his spinal canal,

282
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,150
which led to the weakness in his leg.

283
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,870
As he grows, he's put at risk for paraplegia.

284
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,490
And we can go in and untangle it.

285
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,450
But anytime you're dealing with the spinal cord,

286
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,810
things can get complicated.

287
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,160
What are the dangers?

288
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,780
He could become quadriplegic,

289
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,900
but the fact that he's presenting with weakness right now

290
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,180
makes me think that this is progressing rapidly.

291
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,190
I don't think we have a choice here.

292
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,820
Okay.

293
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,660
It's not possible.

294
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,060
Did you step out on me?

295
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,660
That's absurd. You're my everything.

296
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,100
What could I get from anyone else?

297
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,520
You could get pregnant.

298
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,630
I didn't have an affair.

299
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,040
Maybe one of Todd's swimmers got through.

300
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,940
I've heard it happens. It must have happened.

301
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,050
It's unlikely, but I suppose not impossible.

302
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,420
We...can test Todd's sperm count.

303
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,870
Uh, Dr. Park?

304
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,970
I had a long talk with my husband.

305
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,130
We want to vaccinate Finn.

306
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,870
That's great, Bethany. Your son will thank you.

307
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,130
We want you to do it as soon as possible.

308
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,280
U-unless you can't because of the surgery.

309
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh, it shouldn't be a problem.

310
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,130
We can start with - the first round right away.

311
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,570
How much is a bottle of St. Elison 23 Year Bourbon?

312
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,980
$500 a bottle.

313
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,840
$500?

314
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,370
$500.

315
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,560
Park...

316
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,270
Mind if I join you?

317
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,350
Of course.

318
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,430
I know you haven't been pleased

319
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,940
with the way things have progressed with Dr. Melendez.

320
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,450
You pushed me to be more assertive,

321
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,850
and I'm not gonna apologize

322
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,610
for doing what I thought and still believe was right.

323
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,490
Enjoy your meal.

324
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,400
St. Bonaventure will soon be a surgical center of excellence.

325
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,720
We'll be able to select every unique and amazing surgery

326
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,770
to come through San Jose. It could open you up to a

327
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,490
whole new range of experiences.

328
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,480
I'd hate for you to miss out.

329
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,520
I would hate to miss out, too,

330
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,730
but when Melendez cut me from his service,

331
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,760
he cut my education in half.

332
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,740
He will take you back.

333
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,230
If I grovel.

334
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,960
I have no doubt that --

335
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
You haven't spoken to him, have you?

336
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,120
Why come to me first?

337
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,650
What, you figure I'm the path of least resistance?

338
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,660
I came to you first because you're a resident.

339
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,300
Even though you are valued,

340
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,540
you're still earning your place at this hospital.

341
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,070
If you care about your job,

342
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,840
you will speak to Melendez.

343
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,220
I have nothing to say.

344
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,080
Yeah, but chicken pox feels even worse.

345
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,960
That's it.

346
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,620
- I need to pee. - Wait, you should let me help you.

347
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,670
Don't get up. Stay where you are.

348
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,610
I need a lift team! And have them bring a backboard!

349
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,810
I-I can't feel my leg, the left one.

350
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,660
- How about that? - No.

351
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,050
Can you wiggle your toes?

352
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:58,870
I-I'm trying.

353
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,370
Page Dr. Melendez! We need an O.R. now!

354
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,490
Hello.

355
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,450
Where's Todd?

356
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,070
He's in the cafeteria.

357
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,420
He's waiting for his sperm-count results.

358
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,700
I do love him.

359
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,010
You look very young for a doctor.

360
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,040
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

361
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,360
I didn't -- I didn't mean to -- W-wait.

362
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,350
I was just thanking you for saving my life.

363
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,000
Todd's sperm count is zero.

364
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,030
Do I have to tell him

365
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,760
that his wife kissed me on the lips?

366
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,630
She was thanking me for saving her life.

367
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,690
Well, I helped save her life, too.

368
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
- Where's my kiss? - This isn't funny.

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,090
That kiss could be considered assault.

370
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,110
- Oh, come on. - If the genders were reversed,

371
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,110
we'd be having a serious conversation right now.

372
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,750
What about it, Murphy? You want to file a report?

373
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,150
I'll have to think about that.

374
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,090
Until then, tell Todd about the test results.

375
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,340
You can keep the kiss to yourself.

376
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,430
Dr. Park, nice drilling off the laminae.

377
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,930
Dr. Reznick, carefully open the dura

378
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,670
in the midline overlying the cords.

379
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,660
We need to separate the cords from the midline dural sacs.

380
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,080
A $500 bottle of whiskey?

381
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,870
You should have checked before we agreed to --

382
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,910
He's losing his motor and sensory evoked potentials.

383
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,940
Stop.

384
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,510
We need to figure out a way to dissect the cleft

385
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,210
free from the split and remove it

386
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,350
without putting pressure on the spinal cords.

387
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,710
Suggestions?

388
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,650
We should use the laser to cut any tethering adhesions

389
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,760
- before removing the septum. - Very good.

390
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,600
Excuse me. I have your test results.

391
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,040
Okay.

392
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,160
Were you gonna leave me, too?

393
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,940
Not that I really care at this point --

394
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,570
W-what are you talking about? The doctors screwed up.

395
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,970
- W-we didn't. - Then the lab must have screwed up.

396
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,240
The bank? The bank, too?

397
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,250
It's all just a big conspiracy?

398
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,700
Our medical insurance was canceled,

399
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,280
so I started making some calls.

400
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,580
We have $400 left in savings.

401
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,080
Checking's empty.

402
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,150
The retirement account's drained.

403
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,030
I don't know. It must be identity theft.

404
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,040
Dawn, stop lying to me.

405
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,430
I lost my debit card a few months ago.

406
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,470
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't cheat,

407
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,300
t-that you didn't take the money.

408
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,410
Oh, my God.

409
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm so, so sorry.

410
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,140
H-how? W-why?

411
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,690
I tried to stop,

412
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,490
but I just couldn't help myself.

413
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,920
Todd.

414
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,900
Toddy!

415
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,670
Why did you marry Todd?

416
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,090
Because...

417
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,420
I love him.

418
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,810
He's the best thing to come into my life.

419
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,730
He's...

420
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,190
I couldn't imagine living without him.

421
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,660
Why did you kiss me?

422
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,750
I don't know.

423
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,340
It was a mistake.

424
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,020
I know why you kissed me.

425
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,620
I'm not excusing her actions,

426
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,860
but the Deep Brain Stimulation surgery was a bold move.

427
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,420
Would you have gotten to where you are without a few bold moves?

428
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,530
I never broke protocol.

429
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,880
I looked for opportunities, and I took advantage of them.

430
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,220
And now you have another opportunity --

431
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,330
an opportunity to show leadership through forgiveness.

432
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,100
And more importantly, an opportunity to show leadership

433
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,170
through not looking like an ass.

434
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,220
Come on, Neil. This is like David and Goliath,

435
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,900
except David forgot his slingshot

436
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,430
and Goliath is beating the crap out of her.

437
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,830
Unless this is resolved,

438
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,370
you'll make it harder for me to make you Chief of Surgery.

439
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,490
Hell, it'll make it harder for me to go to bat for you

440
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,150
when even bigger issues come up.

441
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,210
I decided not to press legal charges

442
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:30,850
against our patient for kissing me.

443
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,150
She has a legal defense.

444
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,400
Her actions were caused by a medical condition.

445
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,220
Just now, she had an involuntary muscle movement in her hand.

446
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,780
- A spasm? That's all? - Yes.

447
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,120
That means the kissing and cheating

448
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,580
were caused by a neurological problem,

449
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,120
possibly a tumor.

450
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,000
It's also medically possible

451
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,040
that she's just a jerk that has a tic.

452
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,820
Yes, but Todd is the best thing to come into her life.

453
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,620
Okay?

454
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,330
Go test your theory.

455
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,330
Thank you.

456
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,000
Can you feel this?

457
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,760
- Yeah. - Good.

458
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,510
Now we have to do a very complicated, scientific test.

459
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,680
Can you wiggle your toes?

460
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,520
Good job.

461
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,650
Finn, your temperature's rising. How are you feeling?

462
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,980
I've got the chills.

463
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,290
Is this from the surgery? Or is it something else?

464
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,940
Hey, your heart rate's jumping, too.

465
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,710
His pressure's dropping fast.

466
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,820
What's -- what's wrong?

467
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,000
Sorry, Shaun. I'm with Lim on this one.

468
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,620
We are not gonna find anything.

469
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,920
She was happy with Todd.

470
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,300
Todd says they had a good sex life.

471
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,010
But cheating is about more than sex.

472
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,070
Maybe her emotional needs weren't being met.

473
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,690
Maybe she was going through a personal crisis.

474
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,600
I left home with Steve when I wasn't happy.

475
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,660
Why doesn't she leave?

476
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,620
Money, fear, shame.

477
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,370
There are plenty of reasons why she'd rather stay.

478
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,860
She said kissing me was a mistake.

479
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
She had no reason to lie to me, Claire.

480
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,290
Shaun, I know you want to believe

481
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,420
there's another explanation,

482
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,760
but sometimes people,

483
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
even the people you love and trust, betray you.

484
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,040
Look. No tumors. The brain is clean.

485
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,060
It's sad.

486
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,400
The world is sad and very complicated.

487
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,570
I wish it wasn't.

488
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,710
The MRI scan shows there is nothing wrong with your brain.

489
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,590
You are just a liar.

490
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,560
Everything was good.

491
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,360
These last few months with Todd,

492
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,730
it was like our honeymoon.

493
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,200
Then some client flirts with me.

494
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
Now here I am.

495
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,800
Shaun.

496
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,970
I'd like you to draw the face of a clock.

497
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,730
Please.

498
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,500
You do have a tumor.

499
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,840
There is definitely something.

500
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,090
I think we were just looking in the wrong place.

501
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,440
- Hey, Shaun. - Hello.

502
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Can I buy you lunch?

503
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,210
No, I'm not hungry, and it's not my lunchtime,

504
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,220
and I have to get ready for an important MRI.

505
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,240
- Goodbye. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

506
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,160
Can I...

507
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,530
Can I talk to you for a second?

508
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,250
All right.

509
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,550
I had a little incident yesterday.

510
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,850
I may be experiencing some memory loss

511
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,790
- due to the radiation. - Yes, memory loss

512
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,700
is very common with radiation.

513
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,530
I can book you an MRI after I'm finished with my patient.

514
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,950
No, no, no, no.

515
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,080
No cognitive tests, not here.

516
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,080
There are plenty of other hospitals in San Jose

517
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,580
- that can test you. - No hospitals, Shaun.

518
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,240
No hospitals.

519
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,780
I...

520
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,880
I can administer these tests by myself, okay?

521
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,790
I just -- I just need your help.

522
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,650
Come to my apartment tonight.

523
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,060
We will find out if you're losing your memory.

524
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,010
Goodbye.

525
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,860
Finn has a staph infection at the surgical site,

526
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,540
but we gave him oxygen and fluids.

527
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,700
He's stable and resting.

528
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,430
He will have to go back into surgery to wash out the wound.

529
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,040
I want to assure you this has nothing to do

530
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,570
with any side effects due to Finn's vaccination.

531
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,530
- His what? - His first round of vaccinations.

532
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,030
You vaccinated my son?

533
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,950
I asked Dr. Park to do it.

534
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,210
W-without telling me?

535
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,920
I was scared.

536
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,590
I-if Finn got sick,

537
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,930
i-if he brought something home to the baby...

538
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,140
We talked about this. You promised.

539
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,640
Bethany.

540
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,210
The second MRI confirmed the tumor's in your chest,

541
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,380
not in your brain,

542
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,220
but it produces a protein that travels to the brain,

543
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,580
causing mental disorders, including loss of inhibitions.

544
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,390
The betrayal was medical, not personal.

545
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,960
Reason and intent matter.

546
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,890
You should hug her, kiss her.

547
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,990
She's going to have surgery,

548
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,060
which will be dangerous.

549
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,610
All that missing money,

550
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,530
it didn't go to hotels or -- or weekend getaways.

551
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,200
I've been donating it --

552
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,370
animal shelters, Feed the Children.

553
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,660
Every time I saw an ad, I pulled out my wallet.

554
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,630
I couldn't help it.

555
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,090
You couldn't say no to...anything?

556
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,800
How many?

557
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,910
When we take the tumor out, there is a very good chance

558
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,830
her inhibitions will return to normal.

559
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,230
How many affairs?

560
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,530
Four.

561
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,120
Did, um...

562
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,620
did you enjoy it?

563
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,250
In the moment.

564
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,510
But the minute it was over...

565
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,950
Mom and Dad haven't visited me together since yesterday.

566
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,870
Have they told you anything?

567
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,040
This has nothing to do with you, if that's what you're thinking.

568
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,630
It's about the vaccination.

569
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,050
Dad didn't know?

570
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,650
So I'm not gonna get measles,

571
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,720
but my parents are gonna get divorced.

572
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm sure once they start talking things --

573
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,850
Are you gonna talk to them?

574
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,540
I'm sorry. This is between them.

575
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,370
The vax thing you wouldn't let drop,

576
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,820
but this doesn't matter?

577
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,940
My mom's pregnant, and my dad's not talking to her,

578
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,990
and it's your fault.

579
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,090
Dr. Browne, I've been asked to speak to you.

580
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,900
You're an excellent doctor, and I respect your skills --

581
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,590
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,850
I should never have undermined your authority the way I did.

583
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,510
I was wrong.

584
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,060
I appreciate that.

585
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,480
But I don't mean it.

586
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,210
You've been sent here on an impossible mission.

587
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,360
Senior staff have basically ordered you to take me back.

588
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,700
So...if you don't take me back, you're screwed.

589
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,870
If you do take me back, you look weak.

590
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,390
I don't know what decision you made

591
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,850
or what you're about to say,

592
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,880
but if I tell you I am sorry, it gives you cover.

593
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,010
So, this is me giving you cover.

594
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,270
I'll see you tomorrow.

595
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,210
We got the tumor out. She's fine.

596
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,130
I'm glad you didn't leave.

597
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,090
I was afraid she would die.

598
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,600
B-but I don't think I can forgive her.

599
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm not sure if "forgive" is even the right word.

600
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,740
You've never been attracted to other women?

601
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,960
Of course not.

602
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,300
You don't check anyone out at the beach,

603
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,340
see a girl in the street in tight jeans?

604
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,500
I check them out.

605
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,250
I don't jump them.

606
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,420
I don't even want to jump them.

607
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,850
Your wife acted on

608
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,240
every single temptation she had,

609
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,270
every single ugly, stupid temptation...

610
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,730
but she never left you.

611
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,820
The one thing you know for sure through all of that,

612
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,740
she was never even tempted to walk away from you.

613
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,000
She never stopped loving you.

614
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,860
You know, I knew this...couple.

615
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,950
They had a child.

616
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,540
They were happy and...

617
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,370
building a life.

618
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,180
One day, the...husband found out

619
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,260
that the wife hadn't been... honest.

620
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,300
It broke their trust.

621
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,060
And instead of... working it out,

622
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,060
they let the deception fester.

623
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,030
Eventually the husband moved out, moved away...

624
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,900
barely sees his kid.

625
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,910
I don't need any more of your parables.

626
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,370
You and your stories are the reason I'm here.

627
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,880
You're here because you choose to be here.

628
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,810
Is that even true? That story?

629
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,150
No.

630
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,700
It's done?

631
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,330
Yes. The tumor has been resected.

632
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,920
Would you like to kiss me?

633
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,260
Maybe a little.

634
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,800
But I'm not going to.

635
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,220
That's a very good sign.

636
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,720
That's a very good sign.

637
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,080
Measles kill. Broken homes don't.

638
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,040
Go to a bar, let off some steam.

639
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,460
I'm going to the range.

640
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,230
You have your own gun?

641
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,260
I have three.

642
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,220
Can I come?

643
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,020
Are you gonna talk?

644
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,810
No.

645
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,560
You pay for your own ammo.

646
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,200
- Hi, Shaun. - Hello.

647
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,240
No Lea?

648
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,060
She's out drinking with friends,

649
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,760
other friends.

650
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,770
I'm her friend, but I didn't want to go,

651
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,880
- so I'm watching Albert the fish. - Okay.

652
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,670
I brought some tests.

653
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,980
Where did I get my couch?

654
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,320
- What? - It's a memory test.

655
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,610
Hopkins Verbal Learning, COWA --

656
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,990
- these are memory tests. - Some of the questions are harder.

657
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,600
We are going to do this right.

658
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,240
Where did I get my couch?

659
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,620
Okay, fine.

660
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,620
You got your couch from the bus

661
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,320
you lived in with your brother.

662
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,400
Who gave me my bookshelf?

663
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,160
The town librarian, Jennifer.

664
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,910
And my lamp?

665
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,590
Do you know?

666
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,720
A teacher, Shannon.

667
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,980
No, that's wrong. Her name was Sheryl.

668
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,180
What kind of teacher was she?

669
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,890
Sheryl, Shannon -- you never told me that.

670
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,590
- Yes, I did. - I'm pretty sure you did not.

671
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,190
What's my brother's name?

672
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,930
Oh, come on, Shaun.

673
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,390
Really?

674
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,360
This is stupid. I know your brother's...

675
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,950
Your brother's name is Sam.

676
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,130
It's Steve.

677
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,170
You're losing your memory.
