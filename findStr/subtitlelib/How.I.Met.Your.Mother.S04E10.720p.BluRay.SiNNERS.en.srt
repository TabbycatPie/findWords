1
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:04,364
<i>Why do we fight?</i>

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:06,237
<i>What is that thing deep within each of us</i>

3
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:09,574
<i>that compels us to settle disagreements
with our fists?</i>

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,013
<i>Whatever it is,
it's there right from the beginning.</i>

5
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:15,642
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop fighting.
- Why?

6
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:20,587
- Because it's stupid and juvenile.
- We're six. We are stupid and juvenile.

7
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:23,481
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:28,590
<i>Kids, I've only been in one fight in my life,
and this is the story of how it happened.</i>

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,225
<i>Now, as you know,
I had recently been left at the altar.</i>

10
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,496
<i>And the worst thing
about getting left at the altar,</i>

11
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:37,541
<i>I mean, aside from actually getting left
at the altar, was what came next.</i>

12
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:41,304
<i>A steady, unrelenting,
unbearable stream of pity.</i>

13
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:43,676
Cranberry gin and tonic.

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,475
Scotch and soda.

15
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,951
Thank you.

16
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:59,122
- Can I see a menu?
- Ted, I'm going to go get you a menu,

17
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,461
but I promise you, I will come back.

18
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,101
Okay, we have to start
going someplace else.

19
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:11,472
At this bar, I'm always gonna be
the guy who got left at the altar.

20
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,204
- That sucks!
- Good times.

21
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:16,811
- Uh-oh. We lost Barney.
- What do you mean?

22
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:19,178
There's a girl over there
in a tight red sweater.

23
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:22,252
So he's not listening to a word
anyone's saying. Right, Barney?

24
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:23,946
Gimme a break!

25
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,785
See, he figured out a while back
he could fake an entire conversation

26
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:29,725
just by saying titles of black sitcoms
from the '70s and '80s.

27
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,557
- What's happening?
- Hey, Barney,

28
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:36,362
want to go upstairs and do stuff to me
that I won't even let Marshall do?

29
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,762
Huh. Different strokes.

30
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:42,438
What the hell is this?

31
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,304
<i>I've told you kids
about Doug, right?</i>

32
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,001
<i>I haven't? Oh, well.</i>

33
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,939
<i>Doug Martin was
a bartender at MacLaren's.</i>

34
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:50,743
<i>He was always kind of around.</i>

35
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,110
Have you met Ted?

36
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,980
No. No, no, no.
We're not playing, "Have you met Ted?"

37
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:57,419
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- Hey.

38
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:00,321
Tonight, I pick up a lesbian.

39
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,588
<i>Anyway, three things
you need to know about Doug.</i>

40
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:06,358
<i>The first thing is that Doug
had a bit of a violent streak.</i>

41
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,797
...crumbled, so he's on the ground, right?
And we're just kicking him,

42
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,359
just putting the boots to him.
Yeah, he's making that face, all shaking.

43
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:15,440
So, anyway, what we did was,
we left him there.

44
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,574
Top you up?

45
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:22,245
<i>The second thing is that
he was weird about his hair.</i>

46
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,578
- What?
- What?

47
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:28,745
- Are you looking at my hair?
- No, sir. I was not.

48
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,148
It's a toupee.

49
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:35,752
Is that funny? You want to laugh it up?
Is it funny, guy?

50
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,386
I tell you what, why don't you grab it?

51
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,827
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, go ahead, grab it.

52
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:43,460
Grab it right off my head. Go ahead.
You don't want to grab it? Come on.

53
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,231
Come on, go ahead and grab it.
Want to grab it off my head?

54
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:49,001
Grab my toupee right off my head.

55
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,644
I like you guys!

56
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,946
<i>But the third thing is
that he was very loyal to his regulars.</i>

57
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,952
- Hey, hey! There they are!
- Hey, man.

58
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,214
Hey, you guys want your booth?

59
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,415
- No. We're fine over here.
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah.

60
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:05,582
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>

61
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,557
- No. No.
- No, it's fine, it's fine.

62
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,824
Okay, you two lovebirds, let's take this
somewhere else. Booth's reserved.

63
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,558
Let's go! Now! Come on!

64
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,228
Give me some hustle, Father! Up you get.
Okay, guys, here we are.

65
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,570
<i>So, that's Doug.</i>

66
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:20,798
What the hell is this?

67
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:25,435
Oh. Some guys are sitting in our booth.
But you know what? This is fine.

68
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:32,311
- It's cool, I'll take care of it. Okay?
- Oh, boy, there he goes.

69
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:34,910
It's not...
Why are you yelling at us?

70
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,247
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, okay.

71
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:42,195
Ladies, if you'll please adjourn
to your usual booth.

72
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,729
Gentlemen, I will require
your assistance outside.

73
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,821
Our assistance with what?

74
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,834
We're going to go out in the alley
and fight those guys.

75
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,335
What's happening now?

76
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,377
I'm sorry, did you just say...

77
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:09,149
Those guys are being inconsiderate, okay?

78
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:12,089
So we're going to go outside
and cave in their skulls, okay?

79
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,922
This will be fun!

80
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:20,164
He wants us to fight?
Like, with our hands and stuff?

81
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,964
And feet, maybe?
I don't know what the rules are.

82
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,870
- Wow, a fight. Should we go out there?
- Come on, Ted.

83
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:31,274
There's only three things you'll ever see
me fight. The stubborn clasp of a bra,

84
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:35,338
sexual harassment charges, nine for nine,

85
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,251
and the urge to vomit when I see someone
wearing brown shoes with a black suit.

86
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:44,252
- Marshall?
- Dude, fighting is for losers.

87
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:47,260
We're civilized guys.
Civilized guys don't fight.

88
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:50,455
Unless it's with lightsabers. But that's like
three to five years away, so...

89
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:54,057
- Well, that's not true.
- Robin, I'm on the forums every day.

90
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,568
Three to five Thanksgivings from now,

91
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,106
I'm gonna be carving the turkey
with Old Green.

92
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,833
No, I'm saying there are plenty
of legitimate reasons to get in a fight.

93
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,241
It might not be pretty,

94
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,906
but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

95
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,280
Oh. Right, I forgot.
She thinks fighting's sexy.

96
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,216
No, I do not, a lot.

97
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,623
Look, I come
from a culture of hockey players.

98
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:19,558
If a guy can throw down,
it's somewhat way hot.

99
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:24,655
And scars, hello!
If a guy's got a scar, he's got a Robin.

100
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:27,930
And if he's missing teeth,
I'm missing my pants.

101
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:31,265
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.

102
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,674
Outpatient procedure. Local anesthesia.
Whatever. It ain't a thing.

103
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,976
Look, maybe we should go out there.

104
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,050
I can't believe
we're even having this discussion.

105
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,713
Ted, you're 30.
You're too old to act like this.

106
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:50,052
<i>I was 30, and in those 30 years
I'd been punched once.</i>

107
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,653
There's a very simple...

108
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,355
<i>There was that thing at camp.</i>

109
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,497
Today, we're going to braid
friendship bracelets.

110
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,735
<i>In college, I studied some kung fu.</i>

111
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>And, well, there was some other stuff.</i>

112
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,340
Come on. Come...

113
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,246
<i>The thing with the goat
wasn't for another few months.</i>

114
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,682
<i>The point is, I had never been in a fight.</i>

115
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,778
- I'm going out there.
- No!

116
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,653
Listen to me, please, trust me.
I've been in plenty of fights.

117
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,988
It's really nothing to be proud of.

118
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,189
- Who did you get in a fight with?
- My brothers.

119
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,763
Yes, I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rumpus room.

120
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,694
I love brotherly horseplay!

121
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:40,299
- Here comes the tickle monster!
- Noogie patrol!

122
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:43,904
Wait, wait, wait! Timesies! Timesies!

123
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:45,946
Cocoa break.

124
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,078
Cocoa break.

125
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:57,358
- Okay, it's clobbering time.
- Ted, don't do this, you're a nice guy.

126
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,929
- That's your best quality.
- Is it?

127
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,498
'Cause I seem to remember this nice guy
getting dumped by his fiancée

128
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,467
for a tae kwon do instructor.
Look, this may sound crazy,

129
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,030
but I think I need to do this.
I think this is an experience I need to have.

130
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,438
I'm going.

131
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:17,440
Me, too!

132
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:23,876
Guys, take a good look at this face,
because the next time you see it,

133
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:27,856
it will be disfigured
in the hottest possible way.

134
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,426
'Cause that's who I am, I'm a man.

135
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:34,326
I like to fight and mix it up
and get all dirty.

136
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:38,363
Could you find a wood hanger for this?

137
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,006
- Whoa! What happened here?
- I know, right?

138
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:49,067
Who's not looking at my toupee now?
Look what we did to these guys.

139
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,670
- We?
- Yeah, we.

140
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:54,479
Come on, man, we're a good team.
Nice work, boys, we did it!

141
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:57,247
No, no, you did it. We didn't do anything.

142
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:01,758
Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure,
I just beat up three guys by myself.

143
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:07,423
You guys. That's good.
You and you, free drinks for life.

144
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:16,931
- He thinks we were in this fight with him.
- We were in this fight with him.

145
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,135
And now we are going to go in there
and tell everyone

146
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:22,371
the legendary tale
of how we beat up some guys.

147
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,970
And everyone is going to think it's great

148
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,880
and everyone is going
to sleep with me again.

149
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:29,248
Dude, come on, no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight, look at us.

150
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,911
That's a good...

151
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,954
- What are you doing?
- What I should've done a long time ago.

152
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,460
- What?
- I don't know. I just hit myself in the eye!

153
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:38,825
I don't even know what I'm saying!

154
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,925
I throw an awesome right hook,
by the way.

155
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,798
- Okay, are you ready?
- To go back in?

156
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:45,892
No, for this.

157
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,708
You just punched me in the nose!

158
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,674
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying!

159
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,042
You just punched me in the nose.

160
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,707
Oh, that's going to swell up real good.
You're gonna look like Owen Wilson.

161
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:58,840
Okay, let's get back in there.

162
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,749
Okay, but just, let's play this down, okay?

163
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,378
I don't want this
to turn into a big thing.

164
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,013
Yeah.

165
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:08,383
And Ted comes and takes
his shoe off! Hits him in the mouth...

166
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,689
Hey, there they are!
The guys that got my back!

167
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:27,278
You two got in a fight. Really?

168
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,579
No, Barney punched me and himself
in the face

169
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:33,277
to make it look like we got in a fight.
Come on, Marshall.

170
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,943
Wow. Look at your eye.

171
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,920
You look like a badass.

172
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:42,550
I'm surprised to see you had it in me.
You. Had it in you.

173
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,827
Do you want to touch it?

174
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,035
Oh, my God, it's warm.

175
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,442
Hey, victory drinks.

176
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:00,640
Free! Free! Free!

177
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,806
Free! $7.50.

178
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:07,612
- Why do I have to pay?
- 'Cause you don't got my back.

179
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,881
- These guys got my back.
- Okay, you know what, Doug?

180
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,016
I will gladly pay. And you know why?
Because that's what grownups do.

181
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,788
They pay for their drinks
and they don't get into fights.

182
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,091
You know what I was doing
while you were out there being immature?

183
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,098
- I'll tell you what I was doing.
- Your nails?

184
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,495
No. I was doing...

185
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,037
<i>The relationship quiz
in this month's Cosmo?</i>

186
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,401
No. I was doing...

187
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,736
Your best not to cry
when Big came back for Carrie

188
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,801
<i>- at the end of the Sex and the City movie?
- No. Spoilers much? No.</i>

189
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,209
I'll tell you what I was doing...

190
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:37,045
The captain of the football team,
because he gave you his promise ring

191
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:40,051
and you looked so pretty in your
open-back homecoming dress?

192
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,016
Sorry.

193
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,187
I hate those guys.

194
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,455
Acting like they're the manliest guys
in the universe,

195
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:52,794
like they're Crocodile Dundee
and David Hasselhoff.

196
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,832
Those are the manliest guys
in the universe?

197
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,062
I don't understand
why they're getting all this attention.

198
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:00,868
- I mean, I'm the real hero here.
- Yeah, you are.

199
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,944
I'm serious, woman.
Put it back in your pants.

200
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:08,913
Marshall, you're the man
every boy should grow up to become

201
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,109
and every girl should marry.

202
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:15,918
You know what? I have two kids
in my class who won't stop fighting.

203
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:18,686
If you come to school tomorrow
and tell them your story

204
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:22,888
of choosing the path of nonviolence,
it might really set them straight.

205
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:26,524
And save me having to get up early
to make a lesson plan.

206
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,595
All right. Okay. I'll set them straight.

207
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,639
- You're a wuss.
- What? No.

208
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,903
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala
are telling you kids this story

209
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,038
- to illustrate...
- To illustrate that you're a wuss?

210
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,379
Why didn't you just fight those guys?

211
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,680
- Were you scared?
- What?

212
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,652
No. I wasn't scared.

213
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:52,920
- I've been in plenty of fights, okay?
- You're huge.

214
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:55,963
You must weigh like a thousand pounds.

215
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,727
Okay, first of all,
I'm wearing a baggy sweater,

216
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:03,133
and it has horizontal stripes.

217
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:06,207
And I also... I had a salty lunch...
And so I'm retain...

218
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,106
- You know what? Shut up!
- Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,186
Wow. So, you just beat those guys up?

220
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:20,721
Just?

221
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,488
Amanda, were it so simple.
You see, hand-to-hand combat

222
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:29,291
is about so much more
than just administering brute force

223
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,832
- on your opponent, right, B?
- You know!

224
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,423
It's a science.

225
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,366
The sweet science, as it were.

226
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:39,929
Wait, I'm confused.
What did those guys do to deserve it?

227
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,442
Well, this may sound petty,

228
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,775
- but they sat in our booth.
- They sat in our booth.

229
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,439
- And nobody...
- Nobody.

230
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,008
...sits in our booth. It's been taken.

231
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,819
Uh-oh. Are you gonna beat those guys up?

232
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,060
Um...

233
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:03,220
Yes, we are gonna beat those guys up.
Ted, come on.

234
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:10,196
You two. Our booth. Get out. Now!

235
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,432
- What are you doing?
- Relax, we got Doug.

236
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,567
- Big Doug's got our backs.
- Doug's not here tonight.

237
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:19,341
Can I get you guys anything? Drinks?
Cash? Those two girls over there?

238
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:21,544
Are you Ted Mosby?

239
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,286
- Yeah, I am.
- And you're Barney Stinson?

240
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,050
They've heard of us. It's cool, guys.

241
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,422
We'll let you leave
with your asses unkicked.

242
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,961
This time. A'ight?

243
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,729
- What's this?
- You've been served.

244
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,601
You're being sued for assault.
Enjoy your booth.

245
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,269
That was close.

246
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:57,018
Assault! They're suing us for assault!

247
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,988
Okay, what's the penalty for assault?
What, do I have to pay a fine?

248
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,289
Pick up trash on the highway? 'Cause
I've done that before, know what I mean?

249
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:06,555
I don't know.

250
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,893
<i>Actually, he did know
that the worst we were looking at</i>

251
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,127
<i>was a small civil settlement
and probably no criminal charges.</i>

252
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,759
<i>But he was really pissed at us.</i>

253
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,931
I mean, you guys could be
looking at some serious prison time.

254
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,270
- Prison?
- I can't go to prison.

255
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:23,845
I mean, I could get a lot of reading done,
finally write some short stories.

256
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:27,075
Work out all the time. Seriously, if I don't
come out of there completely ripped...

257
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:31,712
Ted, we can't go to prison.
People get shivved in the joint.

258
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:35,458
Plus, the meals are really starchy.

259
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,856
Well, you guys should have thought of that
before you beat up those guys.

260
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,157
What if we didn't?

261
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,029
- Didn't what, Ted?
- Didn't beat up those guys.

262
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,627
What if Doug beat up those guys all
by himself and we didn't do anything?

263
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:51,104
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

264
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:55,873
- You guys didn't throw a single punch.
- Well, I hit Ted and myself, so...

265
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,212
Well, who's the wuss now?
Answer? You guys.

266
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,482
- Look, can you just help us get out of this?
- You know the old expression,

267
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,580
"If you're not prepared to do the time
don't pretend to do the crime

268
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:10,150
"and laugh and get free drinks
and not stand up for your friend

269
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:13,856
"who, incidentally, has been
in plenty of fights with his brothers. "

270
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,466
Look, you've got to help us out, Marshall.

271
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,232
- We're the Three Musketeers.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,502
If I give up Ted,
how much time am I looking at?

273
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,167
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

274
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,336
Hey.

275
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:30,806
Hey, Barney. I've been looking for you.

276
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:36,514
I got tickets to this hockey game tonight.
It's stupid. You want to go?

277
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:39,591
It might go kind of late, so maybe
after the game we can grab a drink?

278
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,956
Oh, hey, Robin, get this.
You know that fight?

279
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,195
These guys faked the whole thing.

280
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:52,897
Oh. Oh.

281
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,269
I forgot. Tonight is no good.

282
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:58,969
I can't go to that hockey game tonight,
I got that...

283
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:04,210
That... That...

284
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:07,645
That...

285
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:12,885
That... That...

286
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:20,390
Good news. I talked to the guys.

287
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,593
- What guys?
- The guys you didn't beat up.

288
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:23,963
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.

289
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,127
Boom!

290
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:27,604
- Lawyered.
- What? They agreed to drop it?

291
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:30,903
Yeah, I just explained
that you two are wusses.

292
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,672
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh, actually.

293
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,907
I explained how you get
a mani-pedi once a month.

294
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,507
Weekly, Wolverine. Some of us care.

295
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,413
And how you played the hammer dulcimer

296
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:45,150
in the Pre-Reformation Dance Society
at Wesleyan.

297
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:46,418
Did you at least tell them

298
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:49,892
we were one of the premier medieval
chamber groups in the Little Ivies?

299
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:51,054
Oh, I did.

300
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:54,156
And we all agreed it was much more likely
that one guy beat up the three of them

301
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,668
than that you two had
anything to do with it, so...

302
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:02,407
- Wait, so now they're only suing Doug?
- Affirmative.

303
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:06,069
Angry, irrational, violent Doug,

304
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,842
who now knows we were the ones
who threw him under the bus.

305
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,205
They what?

306
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:15,516
- Look, Doug, we can explain...
- Explain what?

307
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:18,557
Explain how you stabbed me in the back
right to my face?

308
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:21,787
- Robin, I'm scared.
- Yeah. Is Doug seeing anyone?

309
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,488
Are you seeing anyone? You really should.

310
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:29,034
Doug, look, you don't understand,
you beat up those guys all by yourself.

311
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,365
It's true, all right?
They had nothing to do with it.

312
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:34,134
I mean, look at these two.

313
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,633
It was all Ted!

314
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,480
- Look at this guy.
- Yeah, look at me.

315
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,847
- He wouldn't last five minutes in a fight.
- I think I could last at least five...

316
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,386
He's got the muscle definition of linguini.

317
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:51,185
Yeah, linguini with
meatballs, maybe. Check it.

318
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,656
Ted. Ted.

319
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,193
- Look!
- Don't.

320
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,320
Okay, you know what?
Maybe it was just me.

321
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,728
Actually, you know what?
That makes a lot of sense.

322
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:02,859
I tend to black out a lot.
Anyway, look, I always got your back.

323
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:08,107
All I ask in return is that you got mine.
But you know what? You don't.

324
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:14,346
You can't be counted on.
No wonder your fiancée left you.

325
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:17,747
<i>And here it is, kids,
the only fight I've ever been in.</i>

326
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:20,650
<i>So what can I share
about the experience?</i>

327
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:26,392
<i>Well, for starters,
when you punch someone in the face,</i>

328
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,724
<i>it hurts your hand a lot.</i>

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,468
<i>But what hurts even more than that?</i>

330
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:35,991
<i>This.</i>

331
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:40,105
<i>And the next thing I remember
was waking up.</i>

332
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:43,444
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

333
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:47,607
<i>Turns out getting in a fight
was a terrible idea.</i>

334
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:51,411
- And that's my story.
- And what did you learn?

335
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,922
Well, I learned that fighting is bad

336
00:18:56,024 --> 00:19:00,188
- and you shouldn't do it, ever.
- Any questions?

337
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:01,719
Yeah.

338
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,197
- Where do you find these people?
- I know!

339
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,496
Was there a big sale at the wuss market?

340
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:09,661
- Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!
- Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

341
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,731
<i>Of course, I didn't tell
those kids what really happened.</i>

342
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:17,741
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

343
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,544
- What happened?
- This happened.

344
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:28,113
Holy crap!

345
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,581
<i>Yeah, turns out Uncle Marshall
and his brothers</i>

346
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,058
<i>did a little more than just roughhouse.</i>

347
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:40,633
Cocoa break!

348
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,909
- Marshall looks good. Has he lost weight?
- Bitch, don't even...

349
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,046
<i>Kids, I'd love to leave you
with the message</i>

350
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:59,246
<i>that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it,</i>

351
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,913
<i>but I know that's pointless.</i>

352
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:05,084
<i>So, I'll leave you with this. Don't ever
get in a fight with Uncle Marshall.</i>

353
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,186
<i>That guy's freaking crazy.</i>

354
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,601
It is so good to be home.

355
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:17,433
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.

356
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,009
Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat. Right?

357
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,304
Okay, here we go. Goggles on.

358
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,443
All right, so, you guys pass the plates.

359
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:33,114
- Lily, you want white or dark meat?
- Dark!

360
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,213
Honey, please be careful.
