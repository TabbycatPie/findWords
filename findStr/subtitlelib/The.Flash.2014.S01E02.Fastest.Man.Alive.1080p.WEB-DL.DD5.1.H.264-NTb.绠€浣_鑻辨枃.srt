14
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,760
我叫巴里·艾伦
My name is Barry Allen.

15
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,040
是现今世上速度最快的人
I am the fastest man alive.

16
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,170
我十一岁时  我母亲被杀了
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

17
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,850
我看到一道闪电
I saw a ball of lightning.

18
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,150
那里面  有个人
Inside the lightning there was a man.

19
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,570
他杀了我妈妈
He killed my mom.

20
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,060
我发誓这不是我干的
I swear to God I didn't do this.

21
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,200
-妈妈呢  -那晚发生的事让人无法相信
- Where's mom? - What happened that night was impossible.

22
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,750
但是一场事故让我也变得令人难以置信
Then an accident made me the impossible.

23
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,170
你陷入了昏迷
You were in a coma.

24
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,160
-昏迷了多久  -九个月
- For how long? - Nine months.

25
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,510
你的肌肉应该萎缩了
Your muscles should be atrophied,

26
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,610
但是却在进行细胞重生
but instead they're in a state of cellular regeneration.

27
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,790
我不是唯一一个受爆炸影响的  是不是
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,730
我们一直在寻找其他像你一样的超能力者
We've been searching for other meta humans like yourself.

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,970
我一直想更加有所作为
All my life I've wanted to do more.

30
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,840
然后我搞砸了我第一次帮助别人的机会
And the first chance I get to help someone, I screw up.

31
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,470
你所做的好事会远比这些错事更有意义
The good you do must far outweigh the bad.

32
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,360
你不会再在里面待太久了
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

33
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,210
不管杀害妈妈的凶手是谁 
Whoever killed mom,

34
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,900
我总算有办法找到他们了
I think I finally have a way to find them.

35
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,270
到这部分我好像应该
This is the part where I'm supposed

36
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,960
做自我介绍了
to do the whole intro thingy.

37
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,830
巴里·艾伦  现今世上速度最快的人
Barry Allen, fastest man alive...

38
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,060
但是这个大家应该都知道了
But you know all that already.

39
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,070
那好  我们就去做点好事吧
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

40
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
你看到那里的烟了吗  那是
You see that smoke? That's a fire

41
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,590
中城闹市区西街和第三大街处发生火灾了
on Western and 3rd in downtown Central City.

42
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,390
还有这团疾驰残影  是我正在赶往火灾现场
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

43
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,350
我现在时速是352英里
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,880
今天速度真是太慢了
And it's a slow day.

45
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,510
这里是52号云梯队
This is Ladder 52.

46
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,940
还有两分钟才能到达火灾现场
We're still at least two minutes out.

47
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,310
到时候建筑里的人会死的
People are gonna die in there.

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,270
我知道
I know.

49
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,480
巴里
Barry?

50
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,370
巴里
Barry!

51
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,290
怎么了  跑过了吗
What? Did I miss it?

52
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,460
已经跑过大约六个街区了
You overshot by about six blocks.

53
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,300
怪我
My bad.

54
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,200
佩奇
Paige!

55
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,850
我女儿  有人看到我女儿了吗
My daughter! Has anyone seen my daughter?

56
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,890
佩奇
Paige!

57
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,660
到了吗
You there yet?

58
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,150
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

59
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,950
没什么
Nothing.

60
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,390
你在跟谁说话
Who were you talking to?

61
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,240
-没人啊  -你是在跟巴里说话吧
- No one. - Are you talking to Barry?

62
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,750
-谁  -巴里·艾伦
- Who? - Barry Allen?

63
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,810
被闪电击中  昏迷了九个月
Struck by lighting? Was in a coma for nine months?

64
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,170
醒来之后能跑得比声音传播都快的那个人
Woke up being able to run faster than the speed of sound?

65
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,410
-记起来了吗  -没有
- Ring a bell? - No.

66
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,630
很久没跟他说话了
Haven't talked to him.

67
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,360
西斯科  这里火势很猛
Cisco, there's fire everywhere!

68
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,570
西斯科  你还在吗
Cisco, are you still there?

69
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,670
妈妈
Mom?

70
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,080
妈妈
Mommy!

71
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,480
妈妈
Mommy!

72
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,070
人都救出来了
Everybody's out.

73
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,730
还有什么吩咐吗  西斯科
What else you got for me, Cisco?

74
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,310
巴里  我是凯特琳
Barry, it's Caitlin.

75
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,060
凯特琳啊
Hey, Caitlin.

76
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,050
你好啊
How's your day?

77
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,420
马上回尖端科研实验室
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Now.

78
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,260
这就回去
On my way.

79
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
{n8}危险区域
闲人免进

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
你们俩都疯了吗
Have you both lost your minds?

81
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,920
你们以为自己是谁
Who do you think you are?

82
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,510
我负责眼观六路耳听八方  他负责跑步救人
Well, I'm the eyes and ears, and he's the feet.

83
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,450
一点都不好笑好吗
This isn't funny.

84
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,340
你这样会害死自己的
You could have gotten yourself killed.

85
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,020
你不能跟什么超音速消防员一样
You can't be running around the city

86
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,830
去市里火灾现场救人
like some supersonic fireman.

87
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,740
为什么不行
Why not?

88
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,920
我们不是说过了吗  要用我的速度做好事
This is what we talked about: Me using my speed to do good.

89
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,820
我们说的是你来
We talked about you helping us contain

90
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
帮我们控制其他可能
other people who might have been affected

91
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,330
被粒子加速器爆炸影响到的人
by the particle accelerator explosion.

92
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,440
是去对付超能力者
Meta-humans.

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,610
除了克莱德·马登  我们还没找到别人
And aside from Clyde Mardon, we haven't found any.

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,780
这座城市的人仍然需要帮助
People in this city still need help.

95
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,900
我能帮他们
And I can help them.

96
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,220
我们能帮他们
We can help them.

97
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,390
你能说句话吗
Will you please say something?

98
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,380
我觉得凯特琳的意思是
I think what Caitlin is saying,

99
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,550
她以这种独特的生气方式想说的是
in her own spectacularly angry way,

100
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,430
我们才刚开始理解
is that we are just beginning to understand

101
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,770
你身体的能力
what your body is capable of.

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,630
不是我跟你唠叨  艾伦先生
Not to sound like a broken record, Mr. Allen...

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,420
我觉得还是谨慎克制为妙
I do caution restraint.

104
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,300
威尔斯博士
Dr. Wells...

105
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,010
你就是因为克制才取得现在的成就吗
I doubt restraint is how you got to be the man you are today.

106
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,280
我现在是坐着轮椅被社会遗弃的人
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,310
正是因为缺少克制  我才落得如此下场
Lack of restraint is what made me these things.

108
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,980
量力而行
Know your limits.

109
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,430
你弄坏什么的时候
Don't expect me to patch you up

110
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,120
不要每次都指望我帮你
every time you break something.

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,180
你去救人的时候发生什么事了吗
Hey, uh... anything happen out there today?

112
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,650
你衣服上的传感器返回了
The sensors in the suit were kicking back

113
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,770
一些奇怪的遥感数据
some weird telemetry,

114
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,800
好像你的身体指数出现了几秒的骤增
like your vitals spiked for a few seconds.

115
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,720
我感觉很好啊
Never felt better.

116
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,280
乔  一切都好吗
Hey, Joe, everything all right?

117
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,790
好极了  我在案发现场
Great. I got a fresh crime scene...

118
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,780
有一具尸体
a dead body...

119
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,620
警探正在询问目击者
detectives interviewing witnesses...

120
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,700
黄色警戒线已经拉好了
Miles of that yellow tape stretched over everything.

121
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,010
只差一个人了  你猜是谁
I'm only missing one thing. Can you guess what that is?

122
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,410
我马上就到
I'll be right there.

123
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,640
工作召唤我了
My day job beckons.

124
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,900
你觉得他要什么时候才会意识到
When do you think he'll realize

125
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,680
他没换衣服
he didn't take his clothes?

126
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,640
罪犯们拿了几把手枪跑了
Perp made off with a bunch of handguns,

127
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,100
至少有六把格洛克19型手枪
at least six Glock 19s.

128
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,810
还有额外的弹夹
Fitted with extra ammunition magazines.

129
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,840
看来有人要准备大干一场啊
Somebody's looking to do a whole lot of bad.

130
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,740
不好意思我来晚了
Hey, sorry I'm late.

131
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,400
给自己买了点秋装啊  艾伦先生
Doing a little fall shopping, Mr. Allen?

132
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,010
我今早出来得太匆忙了  没注意到
I was going so fast this morning, I didn't even notice.

133
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,290
我把监控录像下载下来了
I downloaded the surveillance footage off the video camera.

134
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,380
看起来只有一个罪犯啊
Looks like only one perp.

135
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,310
录像上可能只有一个  但实际上有六个人
Footage may only show one, but it was six guys.

136
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,640
看看这些痕迹  它们都交错在一起
Look, the tracks. They're all crossing each other.

137
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,090
六种脚印  六把枪被盗
Six sets of footprints. Six guns stolen.

138
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,420
这应该是团伙作案
We should be looking for a crew.

139
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,150
真奇怪
Weird.

140
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,550
他们穿的鞋  看起来都是一个鞋码的
The shoes, it looks like they're all the same size.

141
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,660
我猜是男士的十码
Men's tens, I'd guess.

142
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,100
和你的鞋码一样  队长
Just like you, Captain.

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,270
不是说你是嫌犯  长官  我
Not that you're a suspect, sir. I--

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,460
你一心多用的能力真是令人赞叹
Your ability to multi-task is truly remarkable.

-都觉得难为情  -乔  我很抱歉
- all at the same time. - Joe, I'm sorry.

148
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,260
你就知道跟我说这句话
I'm starting to think "Joe, I'm sorry" is

149
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,040
我都觉得我的名字是"乔  我很抱歉"了
my actual name considering how often you say it to me.

150
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,050
我要处理的事情太多了
I'm dealing with a lot right now.

我知道你的境地
Look, I know you are.

相信我  我也一样
Believe me, I'm dealing with it, too.

153

以前我的想法非常简单
I've always had a very simple set of beliefs.

154
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,650
重力让一切东西坠落  水把东西弄湿
Gravity makes things fall. Water makes things wet.

155
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,150
直到几周前  我相信世界上跑得最快的人
And up until a few weeks ago, I believed

156
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,620
跑完一英里需要四分钟
the fastest man could run a mile in four minutes.

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,720
而不是四秒钟
Not four seconds.

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,890
我三秒就能跑完
I could do it in three.

159
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,810
好吧  无关信息
Not relevant.

160
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,230
你没跟爱瑞丝说这些吧
You haven't said anything to Iris about all this, have you?

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,450
没有  我答应过你  我说到做到
No, I made you a promise. I keep my promises.

162
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,400
继续这么撒谎
Keep on lying like that,

163
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,220
你还会被闪电击中的
you're liable to get struck by lightning again.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,490
现在就去实验室 
Get up to the lab.

165
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,920
开始分析从枪械店拿回来的证据
Start processing the evidence from the gun store.

166
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,760
爱瑞丝  你好
Hey, Iris.

167
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,290
巴里又跑了
Did Barry run away again?

168
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,350
除非这个问题出现在你的家庭作业里
Unless that's one of your homework questions, little lady,

169
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,500
不然就不关你的事  小朋友
it's none of your business.

170
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,640
回你房间去吧
Go on back to your room.

171
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,000
我想见我爸爸
I want to see my dad.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,330
巴里  我说了不行
I already said no, Barry.

173
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,010
他没做那些事  他没有伤害我妈妈
He didn't do those things. He didn't hurt my mom.

174
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,750
关于那晚我说的是真的  我看见了
I was there that night. I saw.

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,610
-当时有个男人  -我知道
- There was a man. - Yeah, I know.

176
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,330
我们已经谈过这个了
We've gone through this already.

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,650
那我为什么不能见他
Then why can't I go see him?

178
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,490
因为我说了不可以
Because I said so.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,790
你不是我爸爸  你无权告诉我该做什么
You're not my father! You can't tell me what to do!

180
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,030
现在  我是唯一一个关心你的成年人
Right now, I am the only adult that gives a damn

181
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,690
所以我能告诉你你该做什么
what happens to you, so yes, I can tell you what to do.

182
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,050
现在回你的房间去吧
Now go to your room.

183
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,350
我恨你
I hate you!

184
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,670
这都是你的错
This is all of your fault.

185
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,050
我本来可以选修欧洲民俗学
I could have taken European folklore

186
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,190
来达到我的社会学要求  但我没有
to cover my sociology requirement, but no.

187
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,890
你跟我说  "爱瑞丝  学新闻吧
You said, "Take journalism, Iris.

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,430
当记者最有趣了"
Reporters have all of the fun."

189
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,850
你猜怎么着  巴里  当记者一点趣都没有
Guess what, Barry? Reporters have none of the fun.

190
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,850
新闻无聊死了  我现在好无聊
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.

191
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,560
都怪你  怎么了
I blame you. What?

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,070
你为什么这样看着我
Why are you staring at me like that?

193
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,100
你看起来真美
You look really nice.

194
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,620
谢谢
Thanks.

195
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,670
你为什么不好好打扮一下
Why don't you look nice?

196
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,150
今天下午  西装革履
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

197
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,000
学校要授予西蒙·斯塔格
The university is giving Simon Stagg...

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,710
-西蒙·斯塔格  -一个大奖
- Simon Stagg. - some big award.

199
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,460
-你答应我  -为了你的报道
- And you agreed... - To explain the science stuff

200
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,650
要给你解释那些科学知识  我现在想起来了
for your article. It's all coming back to me now.

201
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,670
你要多久才能回家换衣服
How fast can you get home and change?

202
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,480
一会儿就好
Pretty fast.

203
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,830
你好  艾伦
Hey, Allen.

204
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,470
乔让我过来看看你在处理
Joe asked me to see where you're at

205
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,340
枪械店证据的事情上进展到哪一步了
on the evidence from the gun store shooting.

206
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,770
你好  爱瑞丝
Oh, hey, Iris.

207
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,700
警探  你好
Detective.

208
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,130
得了  你们还是接吻吧
Please, guys, just kiss already.

209
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,410
记得吗  我已经知道了
I already know, remember?

210
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,730
谢谢你表现得这么淡定  巴里
Thanks for being so cool about this, Barry.

211
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
我知道保守一个大秘密不容易
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

212
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,650
我正在习惯
I'm getting used to it.

213
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,200
我觉得挺不可思议的
I find it quite remarkable,

214
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
{n8}年度人物  感谢他为器官移植做出的贡献

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,140
当年我还是中心城市大学
having once been a timid freshman

216
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
一名羞涩的大一新生
at Central City University,

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,480
现在我已经站在你们面前

218
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,430
成为丽晶选择奖的年度获得者
the Regents Choice for man of the year.

219
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,040
虽然我很荣幸能够接受这个奖项
While I very much appreciate the award,

220
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,700
但对我来说  真正的荣誉是知道
the real honor for me is knowing that

221
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,490
我在器官移植方面做的工作
my work in organ transference

222
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,470
能够给予人们第二次生命的机会
helps give people a second chance at life.

223
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,550
非常谢谢你们的到来
Thank you all very much for coming.

224
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,690
好了  先说重要的
Okay. All right, first things first...

225
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,310
西蒙·斯塔格的细胞克隆工作
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning

226
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,480
为将来的器官替代学科
has led to huge advancements

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,490
带来了巨大的进步
in the future of organ replacement...

228
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,960
记者在工作时可以喝酒吗
Are journalists allowed to drink on the job?

229
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,450
好吧  如果你已经不耐烦了
Okay. If you are bored already,

230
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,640
还是得等到我们了解
just wait till we get to the science behind

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
细胞再生背后的科学
cellular regeneration.

232
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,620
真怀念这种感觉  巴里
I have missed this, Barry.

233
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,540
感觉我们自打你从昏迷中醒来
I feel like we haven't spent any quality time together

234
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,040
已经好久没有这样待在一起了
since you woke up from the coma.

235
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,610
是的  这几周过得真疯狂  我知道
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks, I know.

236
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,770
我觉得你因为艾迪总是在回避我
I thought maybe you'd been avoiding me because of Eddie.

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,550
我知道你认为我和老爸的搭档约会并不好
I know you think it's wrong, me dating my dad's partner,

238
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,550
-我就是  -不
- and I just-- - No.

239
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,480
并不是这么回事
That is not it. At all.

240
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,940
斯塔格先生  我能否引用您的话
Mr. Stagg, I was wondering if I could get a quote

241
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,040
来为我的报道添色
from you for my article.

242
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,170
现在不行  小姐
Not now, miss.

243
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,940
我还是自己编点东西吧
I'll just make something up.

244
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,920
你要跟我说什么
So... what were you gonna tell me?

245
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,600
你看起来好像要说什么重要的事
You looked like you were about to say something.

246
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,620
没错...
Yeah--

247
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,470
安静  所有人
Quiet down! All of you!

248
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,690
天呐
Oh, my god.

249
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,550
安静

想得多周到啊
How considerate!

251
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,510
你们都戴着最昂贵的首饰
You're all wearing your finest jewelry!

252
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,280
好像知道我们要打劫你们一样
Almost like you knew we were coming to rob you!

253
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,790
所有人排队站好
Now everybody line up!

254
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,230
不要  不要
Don't. Don't.

255
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,270
不许动
Freeze!

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,460
放下武器
D-d-drop your weapons!

259
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,840
巴里
Barry.

260
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,400
巴里
Barry!

261
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,530
我转过身来你就不见了
I turned around and you were gone.

262
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,040
发生什么事了  你没事吧
What happened? Are you okay?

263
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,070
是的  我没事
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I...

264
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,100
我跟着他们  想看清车牌
I went after them to try and get the plates.

265
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,130
-什么  -然后我就...
- Wha--? - And I...

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,730
我晕倒了
I fainted.

267
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,620
-你好  -爱瑞丝
- Hi. - Iris.

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,260
你们去哪了
Where were you?

269
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,570
爸爸  别紧张
Dad, go easy.

270
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,230
我在外面找到他的  他晕倒了
I found him outside. He fainted.

271
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,290
需要帮你找个医护人员吗  艾伦
You want me to get you a paramedic, Allen?

272
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,400
不用  我没事  谢谢  艾迪
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

273
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,500
我以为我死定了
I thought I was dead.

274
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,840
我看到子弹发射出来  然后就嘣一声
I saw the gun go off, and then-- boom.

275
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,250
瞬间我就到外面了
Suddenly I'm outside.

276
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,470
我根本不知道是怎么到外面的
I have no idea how I got there.

277
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,420
你过来跟我谈一下
Let me talk to you for a second.

278
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,490
好的
Yeah.

279
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,680
你去追那几个劫匪了  是吗
You chased those gunmen, didn't you?

280
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
是的  那几个劫匪
Yeah, they must be the same guys

281
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,760
一定就是前几天打劫枪店的人
that knocked over the gun shop earlier today.

282
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,450
如果你抓到他们了  打算怎么做
And what were you going to do when you caught them?

283
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,770
请求他们乖乖地停到路边吗
Ask them nicely to pull over?

284
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,000
你并不是刀枪不入
You're not bulletproof.

285
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,150
等等  你是吗
Wait. Are you?

286
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,100
-不是  但是...  -那好
- No, but-- - Okay.

287
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,710
不许再逞英雄
No more heroics.

288
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,310
抓坏人不是你的工作
Chasing bad guys is not your job.

289
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,140
是我的工作  你不是警察
It's mine. You're not a cop.

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,690
跟我保证
Promise me.

291
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,360
我保证
Promise.

292
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,810
你知道爱瑞丝可不是傻子
And you know Iris is not stupid.

293
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,150
编点比"我晕倒了"更好一点的借口
Start making better excuses than "I fainted."

294
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,120
我...
I...

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,790
你骗了我们
You lied to us.

296
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,430
怎么不告诉我们你有阵发性晕眩呢
How could you not tell us you're experiencing dizzy spells?

297
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,770
我们是你的医生
We're your doctors.

298
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,830
天知道你身体内到底怎么了
God knows what's going on inside your body.

299
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,270
你的细胞处在不断变化当中
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

300
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,620
你有可能会心肺衰竭
You could be experiencing cardiopulmonary failure

301
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,890
或者短暂性脑缺血
or a transient ischemic attack.

302
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,010
小中风  也可能不会
Mini stroke. Probably not.

303
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,090
在所有人当中你应该知道  科学要共享
You of all people should know that in science, we share.

304
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,100
我们之间不能有秘密
We do not keep secrets.

305
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,870
除了罗尼  还没有别人让她这么生气
Wow... I haven't seen anyone make her that angry since Ronnie.

306
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,960
罗尼是凯特琳的未婚夫吗
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiance?

307
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,350
加速器爆炸那晚死的那个吗
The one that died the night of the accelerator explosion?

308
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,130
是的  他...
Yeah. He is...

现在...
Now...

311

我们看看你身上到底发生了什么

{n8}尖端科研实验室

我们都准备好了

做点预防措施  以防万一
A little padding. Just in case.

315
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,270
好
Yeah.

316
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,440
你确定要这样做吗  西斯科
You're sure about this, Cisco?

317
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,460
大多数家用跑步机最大速度
Most home treadmills have a maximum speed of about

318
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,910
只能达到每小时12英里
12 miles per hour.

319
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,060
这个被西斯科改造了  相信我
This one has been Cisco'ed. Trust me.

320
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,210
它能承受你的速度
It can handle your speed.

321
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,820
好的
Okay.

322

心跳  血压  神经传导都很正常

323

脑电波在标准限额活动

325
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,860
我说过这台跑步机可以承受的
I told you the treadmill could take it.

326
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,610
凯特琳
Caitlin.

327
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,670
看他的血糖值
Look at the glucose levels.

328
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,600
天哪  这就说得通了
Oh, my god. Of course.

329
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,970
-对吧  -这么明显
- Right? - It was so obvious.

330
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,870
血糖值  巴里

331
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,440

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610

{n8}杀妻案

336
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
巴里去哪里了
Where's Barry?

337
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,290
在洗澡
Taking a shower.

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,170
下午三点洗澡吗
At three o'clock in the afternoon?

339
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,400
如果我上楼  会看到巴里·艾伦吗
If I go up those stairs, am I gonna see Barry Allen?

340
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,460
或者你会因为撒谎而被禁足一周
Or are you gonna be grounded for a week for lying to me?

341
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,220
对不起  爸爸
I'm sorry, daddy.

342
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,330
别担心  我知道他去哪里了
But don't worry. I know where he went.

343
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,150
我也知道
Me too.

344
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,860
我又晕倒了吗
I passed out again?

345
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,000
急性低血糖
Total metabolic failure

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,380
导致的新陈代谢衰竭
brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

347
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,510
我吃得不够
I'm not eating enough.

348
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,140
输一袋葡萄糖就没事了吗
So an I.V. bag and I'm good to go?

349
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,240
四十袋还差不多
Try 40.

350
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,040
看来你是渴了
Guess you were thirsty.

351
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,960
我们得根据你的代谢变化
We're gonna need to fashion you a new diet

352
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,490
为你设计新的食谱
based on your metabolic changes.

353
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,690
我计算了一下  你需要进食
I've done a few calculations. You need to consume

354
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,150
将近850个墨西哥卷饼
an amount equal to roughly 850 tacos.

355
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,740
除非你直接吃牛油果蘸芝士
Unless we're talking cheese and guac,

356
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,890
那样的话结果又会不同
which is like a whole other set of equations.

357
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,810
要想吃墨西哥菜  我推荐提托家
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's.

358
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,000
在布拉克纳街
On Bruckner avenue?

359
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,420
他们家的玉米煎饼最棒了
Best burrito in the city.

360
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,850
韦斯特警探
Detective West.

361
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,590
你怎么会来尖端科研实验室
What brings you to S.T.A.R. labs?

362
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,410
你不在你的实验室
When I couldn't find you at your lab,

363
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,130
我就开始调查
I started doing a little research.

364
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,010
原来最近出了一位红衣侠
Turns out there's been reports of a red streak around the city,

365
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,230
又是抗击强盗  又是救火救人
stopping muggers, rescuing people from burning buildings.

366
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,180
你没告诉他我们在合作吗
You didn't tell him we were working together?

367
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,570
乔  我可以解释
Joe, I can explain.

368
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,430
你在警察局已经有工作了  巴里
You already have a job in law enforcement, Barry.

369
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,350
我建议你回去专心工作
I suggest you get back to it.

370
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
别看我  我是支持你的
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

371
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
警探
Detective.

372
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,780
我们都是为了巴里好
We all want what's best for Barry.

373
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,800
你要真是为了他好
If you wanted what was best for Barry,

374
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,340
就应该好好劝劝他
you'd try to talk him out of this lunacy

375
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,380
而不是放任他出去拿自己的命开玩笑
instead of encouraging him going out there risking his life.

376
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,180
你也看到了  有个人能控制天气
You saw a man control the weather.

377
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,890
警方要怎么对付那样的人
What are the police gonna do against someone like that?

378
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,790
那场爆炸事件之后
Since the accelerator explosion

379
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,820
我们怀疑还有类似他的人
we suspect there may be more like him.

380
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,760
你准备怎么做
And you're gonna do what?

381
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,130
抓他们吗
Catch them?

382
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,960
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

383
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,800
你以为跑得快一点
You think because you can run real fast

384
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,980
就可以无敌了吗  并不是
that you're invincible? You're not!

385
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,450
你还是个孩子
You're just a kid.

386
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,720
我的孩子
My kid.

387
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,260
我不是你的孩子  乔
I'm not your kid, Joe.

388
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,520
你也不是我父亲
And you're not my father.

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,810
我爸爸正在经受牢狱之苦
My father's sitting in iron heights.

390
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,090
还抱着满腹冤屈
Wrongfully convicted.

391
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,030
是你的判断失误
You were wrong about him.

392
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,160
这次你也判断错了
And you're wrong about this.

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
也许我没能力帮他
Now I may not be able to help him,

394
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,250
但是如果我能从着火的大楼里救人
but if I can save someone from a burning building

395
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,020
或者阻止一些持枪歹徒  我一定会出手
or stop some armed thieves, I'm gonna do it.

396
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,750
你阻止不了我
And you can't stop me.

397
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,340
别白费力气了
So don't try.

398
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,330
你觉得自己聪明无比
You think you're so smart.

399
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,720
你们都这样
All of you.

400
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,750
但是有些事情你们根本不清楚
But you don't know what you don't know.

401
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,120
我希望你们能在发生死伤之前
And I hope that you're clever enough to figure it out

402
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,110
尽快想明白
before somebody gets killed.

403
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,020
你的其他同伴呢
Where's the rest of your crew?

404
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,570
只有我
Just me.

405
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,870
你要干什么  布莱克
What do you want, Black?

406
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,800
我的要求依旧只有一个
The only thing I still want in life...

407
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,260
让你的老板死
Your boss dead.

408
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,510
你和你的队伍动作太慢不能怪我
It's not my fault you and your team moved too slow.

409
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,890
我告诉你斯塔格在哪  可没说会待多久
I told you where Stagg would be, not how long he'd be there.

410
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,530
我要知道他的全部行程
I need his full itinerary.

411
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,880
还有他办公室和家里的安保权限
And security access to his office and home.

412
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,880
做梦
Screw you.

413
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,300
我在安保行业可是有名声的
I've got a reputation in the security business.

414
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,260
我的老板被杀是一码事
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.

415
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,880
在卧室里被杀就是另一码事了
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

416
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,600
你最好按我说的做  加瓦先生
You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

417
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,910
你没有军队  能把我怎么样
What the hell are you gonna do to me without your army?

418
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,350
我就是军队
I am an army.

419
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,570
{n8}警察局

420
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,680
你又要来冲我吼了吗
Come to yell at me again?

421
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,630
西蒙·斯塔格的安保主管昨晚被杀
Simon Stagg's head of security was murdered last night.

422
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,430
法医在现场收集了皮肤样品
The coroner took some skin samples.

423
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,080
但愿是凶手的
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

424
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,520
看看有没有匹配结果
See if you can find a match.

425
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,060
昨晚斯塔格的慈善晚宴遭到袭击不是巧合
Can't be a coincidence that Stagg's benefit was attacked last night.

426
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,480
我这就去询问斯塔格
I'm going to interview Stagg now.

427
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,150
-我跟你一起去  -你的工作在这里
- I'll come with you. - Your job is in here.

428
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,400
留下来搞定工作
Stay in here and do it.

429
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,260
-爸爸  -宝贝
- Hey, dad. - Hey, baby.

430
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,410
我要走了
Gotta go.

431
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,150
我爸为什么生你的气
Why is my dad mad at you?

432
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,720
工作上的事
Work stuff.

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,460
你为什么生我的气
Why are you mad at me?

434
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,900
我们本来要在吉特见面
You were supposed to meet me at Jitters

435
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,360
你要给我的文章提供一些科学背景资料
to give me some scientific background for my article.

436
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,820
结果我没去
And I didn't show up.

437
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,390
现在我得在24小时之内拿出一篇新文章
And now I have to come up with a new article topic in 24 hours

438
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,970
不然我的任务就无法完成
or I fail the assignment.

439
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,860
-爱瑞丝  -别说对不起
- Iris-- - Don't say that you're sorry.

440
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,320
我知道你有歉意
Okay, I know that you are.

441
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,880
我不明白的是你到底怎么了
What I don't know is what is going on with you.

442
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,180
我们在同一个屋檐下长大
We grew up one bedroom down from each other.

443
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,110
你真的以为我不知道你开心的样子吗
Do you honestly think that I don't know when you're happy?

444
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,510
或伤心  沮丧  迷失时的样子吗
Or sad or depressed or lost?

445
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,250
我再问你最后一次  巴里·艾伦
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Barry Allen,

446
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,170
你最好老实回答我
and you better be honest with me.

447
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,080
你到底...
What the--

448
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,130
你想知道我发生了什么事
You want to know what's happening.

449
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,770
我现在能高速移动
I'm fast now.

450
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
天呐  我很想告诉你
God, I just want to tell you.

451
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,540
我的感受
How I feel.

452
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,540
我对你的感觉
How you make me feel.

453
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,020
但是我不能说
But I can't.

454
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,530
你到底是怎么回事
Hell is going on with you?

455
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,860
这个问题我们还没说完
We are not done talking about this.

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,090
这是不可能的
That's impossible.

457
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,110
昨晚发生了一起谋杀案
There was a murder last night.

458
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,540
这些皮肤细胞属于凶手的
These skin cells belong to the murderer,

459
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,200
但这些都是初始细胞
but these cells are naive.

460
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,730
他们可以复制这些干细胞
Stem cells that they can replicate

461
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,610

变成身体所需的任何细胞
and become any cell the body needs.

463
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,110
这些只有婴儿身上才会有
They only come from babies.

464
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,060
意思说你的凶手是新生儿吗
This means your killer is what, a newborn?

465
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,300
你真的认为有人要杀我吗
You honestly think that someone wants to kill me?

466
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,160
我们还不确定  斯塔格先生  但是
Well, we're not sure, Mr. Stagg, but...

467
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,300
在你受邀出席的典礼上发生了持械抢劫
an event you were being honored at was robbed at gunpoint.

468
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,990
而你的安保主管今天早上被人谋杀了
And your head of security was found murdered this morning.

469
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,090
我是科学家  慈善家
I am a scientist and a philanthropist.

470
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,460
我们几乎不是杀手的目标
We're not often the targets of assassins.

471
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,820
那这些诉讼案呢
Well... what about lawsuits?

472
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,840
你有大概二十起悬而未决的诉讼案
You got about 20 of those pending against you.

473
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,970
这是无法改变的事实  警探
It is a sad fact of life, Detective, that

474
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,400
当你赚了一大笔钱时
when you earn a lot of money,

475
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,840
人们认为可以来分一杯羹
people who haven't think they can take yours.

476
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,930
比如说这个人吗
People like this guy, for example?

477
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,350
丹东·布莱克
Danton Black?

478
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,860
丹东·布莱克
Danton Black.

{n8}货物升降机

480
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,830
你把他解雇了  现在他要起诉你
You fired him. Now he's suing you.

481
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,830
很遗憾  我们的工作关系没能继续下去
Unfortunately, our working relationship wasn't successful,

482
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,050
但是我可以向你们保证一件事
but I can assure you both of one thing.

483
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,960
丹东·布莱克
Danton Black...

484
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,980
不是一个杀手
is not a killer.

485
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,670
他是名临床研究员  不是罪犯
He's a clinical researcher, not a criminal mastermind.

486
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,210
如果还有需要帮忙的地方  请联系我
Now, if I can help you in any way, please let me know.

487
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,170
我和你们一样  希望这些人尽快绳之以法
I want these people caught as much as you.

488
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,420
那就来吧
Then here we are!

489
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,110
趴下
Down!

490
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,370
队长  发生了什么事
Captain, what's going on?

491
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,150
晚点和你说  巴里
Not now, Barry.

492
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,370
一名武装枪手正在斯塔格工业制造骚乱
An armed gunman is shooting up Stagg Industries.

493
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,810
乔在那里
Joe's there.

494
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,660
把他带出去  我来掩护你
Get him out of here. I'll cover you.

495
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,820
准备好了吗  快走
Ready? Go.

496
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,470
快走
Go!

497
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,450
不
No.

498
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,820
不管你是谁  赶快投降吧
Whoever you are, give yourself up.

499
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,730
抱歉
Sorry.

500
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,340
我们哪也不去
We are not going anywhere.

501
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,560
除非西蒙·斯塔格死了
Until Simon Stagg is dead.

502
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,000
抱歉
Sorry.

503
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,620
这些擦伤已经快速愈合了
The abrasions are already rapidly healing.

504
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,780
是啊  我毫无还击能力
Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.

505
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,410
你把血都弄到这套衣服上了
You got blood on my suit.

506
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,020
有一些应该是属于凶手的
I think some of it belongs to him.

507
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,960
又是一个不友善的超能力者
Another not-so-friendly meta-human.

508
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,570
丹东·布莱克
Danton Black.

509
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,480
生物遗传学家  专门研究治疗性克隆
He's a bio-geneticist specialized in therapeutic cloning.

510
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,430
形成新器官  代替坏死的旧器官
Growing new organs to replace failing ones.

511
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,450
显然是斯塔格偷了他的成果并解雇了他
Apparently Stagg stole his research and then fired him.

512
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,650
我看到斯塔格能自我复制
I saw Black create duplicates from his own body.

513
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,840
真是讽刺
That's pretty ironic.

514
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,230
这人专门研究克隆
The guy specialized in cloning

515
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,070
现在他可以复制自身
and now he can make xeroxes of himself.

516
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,500
如果他在用自己做实验
If he was experimenting on himself

517
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,040
当他接触到粒子加速器爆炸
when he was exposed to the dark matter wave

518
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
所投放的暗物质波
released by the particle accelerator explosion--

519
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,060
来看看这位克隆队长
Meet captain clone.

520
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,440
别担心  我会再想个更帅气的名字
Don't worry. I'll come up with something cooler.

521
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,660
你要去哪
Where are you going?

522
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,670
乔说得对
Joe was right.

523
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,330
我被超能力冲昏了头脑
I'm in way over my head.

524
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,100
我的速度是快  但我不是战士
Yeah, I'm fast, but I am no warrior.

525
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,620
我一个超能力者都打不过  更别说六个了
Man, I could barely fight one meta-human, let alone six.

526
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,870
巴里
Barry.

527
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,760
我明白
I understand.

528
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,440
今天你失败了
Today was a setback.

529
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,780
但是每项伟大的事业都会经历挫折
But any grand enterprise has them.

530
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,800
不坠机几次  我们也无法飞上天空
And we can never learn to fly without crashing a few times.

531
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,520
这不是伟大的事业  威尔斯博士
This wasn't a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

532
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,560
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

533
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,150
爸
Dad!

534
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,460
抱歉  不能有肢体接触
Sorry. No physical contact.

535
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,670
五分钟  艾伦
Five minutes, Allen.

536
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,330
坐下吧  儿子
Sit down, son.

537
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,000
巴里  你怎么到这里来的
Barry, how did you get here?

538
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,370
我跑来的  乔不肯带我
I ran here. Joe wouldn't bring me.

539
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,830
-他不让我见你  我恨他  -别别
- He wouldn't let me see you. I hate him. - No, no.

540
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,170
别这么说
Don't--don't say that.

541
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,410
不是乔不想让你来
It isn't Joe that doesn't want you to come here.

542
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,690
是我不想让你过来
I don't want you to come here.

543
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,990
我不想让你看到我这个样子
I don't want you to see me like this.

544
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,060
你必须得放了他
You have to let him go.

545
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,810
我爸爸没有做那些事
My dad didn't do these things.

546
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,300
他没有伤害我妈妈
He didn't hurt my mom.

547
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,660
是闪电里的那个人
It was the man in the lightning.

548
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,060
闪电人杀了我妈妈
The lightning man killed my mom.

549
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,100
-巴里  看着我  -不是我爸爸
- Barry, look at me. - Not my dad.

550
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,990
看着我
Look at me.

551
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,620
你帮不了我
You can't help me.

552
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
明白吗  乔会在我出去之前照顾你
Okay? Now Joe's gonna look after you until I can get out of here.

553
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,430
你只要继续当爸爸妈妈的乖孩子就好了
You just be the good boy that your mom and I know you are.

554
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,460
爸爸
Dad?

555
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,790
爸爸
Dad?

556
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,960
警探  持枪人被控制住了吗
Detective, was the gunman apprehended?

557
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,300
枪手目前位置尚不明确
The shooter's whereabouts are unknown at this time.

558
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,470
{n8}英雄警察拯救斯塔格总裁

559
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,060
我们认为他持有武器并且极度危险
We consider him armed and extremely dangerous.

560
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,650
谢谢  问题到此结束
Thank you. No more questions.

561
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,810
干得不错  艾迪
Nice work, Eddie.

562
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,990
天时地利而已
Nah. Right place, right time.

563
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,970
不  你是今日的英雄
No, you were a hero today.

564
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,320
还有一个杀手没被中城警局逮捕
CCPD still has a killer on the loose.

565
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
我得回警局了
I should get back to the precinct.

566
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,760
你来这里是为了喝杯咖啡
So did you come here for caffeine,

567
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,320
还是为了来告诉我你到底怎么了
or are you finally gonna tell me what's going on with you?

568
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,550
斯塔格先生
Mr. Stagg,

569
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,160
我希望您重新考虑保护性监禁的事情
I wish you would reconsider our offer for protective custody.

570
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,190
丹东·布莱克杀人不眨眼
Danton Black has proven he is willing to kill,

571
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,630
而且他还有些  朋友
and he's got... friends.

572
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,660
相信我  他们都很危险
And trust me, they're all dangerous.

573
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,160
我增强了保卫  警探
I've increased my security, detective.

574
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,750
我倒希望布莱克来找麻烦
I hope Black comes looking for trouble.

575
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,470
因为他会发现麻烦很大
'Cause he'll find plenty.

576
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,440
说话真像一位慈善家
Spoken like a true philanthropist.

577
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,750
还是人道主义者来的
or is it humanitarian?

578
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,470
抱歉  我总是记不住
I'm sorry. I can never remember

579
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,490
你正在假扮的身份是什么  西蒙
which one you're pretending to be, Simon.

580
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,640
哈里森
Harrison...

581
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,260
不用起身了
Don't get up.

582
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,270
又是你的粉丝吗  博士
Another fan of yours, doctor?

583
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,780
我们能谈谈吗  警探
Can we talk, detective?

584
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,720
这么说你是对的了
So you were right.

585
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,570
巴里不是唯一的特殊人物
Barry's not the only one who's special.

586
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,190
今天这个想杀西蒙·斯塔格的人  可以
This guy that tried to kill Simon Stagg today, he could--

587
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,830
不断地自我复制
Replicate spontaneously.

588
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,290
我们知道了
Yeah, we know.

589
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,140
你知道巴里的事吗
Did you know about Barry?

590
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,450
当他刚进入昏迷时
When he was first in his coma

591
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,480
你来到医院  询问我
you came to the hospital, and you asked me

592
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,360
是否能够把他带到尖端科研实验室去
if you could take him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

593
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,810
你那时知道他的能力吗
Did you know what he could do?

594
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,500
我当时怀疑他已经被...
I had my suspicions that he was...

595
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,430
影响了
affected.

596
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,590
乔
Hey, Joe...

597
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,000
我从没有想成为某个
I was never looking to become the senior member

598
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,700
秘密犯罪打击小组的长老人物
of a secret crime fighting unit.

599
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,400
你和我都清楚
You and I both know

600
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,390
我们才是保护中城的真材实料
we are the only ones equipped to protect Central City.

601
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,090
也许我更想要保护巴里
Maybe I'm more interested in protecting Barry.

602
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,100
当然了  他已经被教育好
But of course he's all set to fly

603
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
与你一同赴汤蹈火
into the fire right along with you.

604
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,570
不  他没有
No, he's not.

605
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,200
不再是了  他退出了
Not anymore. He quit.

606
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,210
他没告诉你吗
He didn't tell you?

607
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
我还没见到他
I haven't seen him.

608
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,060
我肯定只是暂时的
Well I'm sure it's only temporary.

609
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,300
以我对巴里的了解来看
From what I know of Barry,

610
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,000
当他自己决定了什么事
when he sets his mind to something...

611
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,500
就没人能够说服他了
No one's gonna talk him out of it.

612
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,130
但是下一次他穿起战袍
But the next time he suits up...

613
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,540
直奔危险之处时
runs headlong into danger...

614
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,680
他会失败
he will fail.

615
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,050
为什么呢
Why?

616
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,320
他不认为自己有能力
He doesn't think he's capable.

617
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
疑惑
Doubt...

618
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,830
才是他真正的敌人
is his real enemy.

619
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,430
乔  不管外边发生了什么
Joe, not whatever's lurking out there.

620
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,360
只要你继续在质疑他
And as long as you continue to doubt him,

621
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
他就会继续自我疑惑下去
he'll keep doubting himself.

622
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,980
而且顺便一提
And for the record...

623
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,240
我也关心他
I care about him, too.

624
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,640
看起来你真饿了
Guess you were hungry.

625
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,420
缓解压力吧
Stress eating.

626
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,010
我是来道歉的
I came to say I'm sorry.

627
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,500
你是对的  我是有些冷漠
And you're right. I have been distant.

628
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,980
-没错  -像个混蛋
- Correct. - Kind of a jerk.

629
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,740
你应该多道道歉
You should apologize more often.

630
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,780
你挺会煽情的
You are really sensational at it.

631
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,150
那么  那天你想和我说什么来的
So... what were you going to tell me the other day?

632
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,600
我觉得我得做件事
I thought I had to do something.

633
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
做件我觉得很重要的事
Something I thought was important,

634
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,250
但是结果发现我对那事并不在行
but it turns out that I'm not very good at it.

635
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,690
可我对做你朋友很在行
But what I am good at is being your friend.

636
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,380
所以如果你需要我帮忙
So if you need help coming up with

637
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,230
-给你找个新话题来写  -我有一个了
- a new topic for your article-- - I found one.

638
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,150
我找到了一件让我特别感兴趣的事
Something that actually interests me.

639
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,540
我知道这听起来有些疯狂
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

640
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,030
这周网上把这事都传疯了
it's been all over the internet this week.

641
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,090
在大楼失火时
At a building fire...

642
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,250
银行被打劫时
at a bank heist...

643
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,680
还有那晚那些劫匪
even the other night when those robbers

开枪射击保安时
shot at the security guard,

00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,830
那保安说他被快速地转移到了外面
he said he was whooshed outside.

647
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,550
有什么在救这些人
Something out there is saving people.

648
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,040
我以为你想写的是新闻
I thought you were taking journalism,

649
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,570
不是科幻小说
not science fiction writing.

650
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,150
从我认识你开始
Ever since I have known you

651
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,680
你就一直坚信一切皆有可能
you have believed in the impossible.

652
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,830
如果你没有说错呢
What if you were right?

653
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,050
也许你母亲去世那晚的事你说的是对的呢
What if you were right about the night that your mom died?

我说了  我不干了
Look, I told you I'm through.

656
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,830
我知道  但你得来一趟尖端科研实验室
I know, but you need to get to S.T.A.R. Labs

657
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,470
马上
right now.

658
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,600
-巴里  没事的  -怎么可能没事
- Barry, it's okay. - It is not okay.

659
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,590
布莱克在这  而他就只是站着
Black is here, and he's just... standing there.

660
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,130
这不是他吧
That's not him, is it?

661
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,190
这是他的一个复制品
It's one of his replicates.

662
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,510
你们怎么弄到的
How did you get it?

663
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,710
我培养出来的
I grew him.

664
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,930
我从你衣服上分离出了布莱克的血样
I isolated a sample of Black's blood from you suit

665
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,400
试着能不能触发体外培养机制
to see if I could trigger the in vitro cultivation process

666
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,270
以便研究布莱克的增殖
and learn how Black multiplies.

667
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,240
所以我把靶细胞嫁接上了蛋白凝胶
So I exposed the target cells to a protein gel,

668
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,800
结果它们开始自我复制
and they began replicating...

669
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,740
成了这样
into that.

670
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,970
他为什么
Why isn't he...

671
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,110
它为什么不动
it doing anything?

672
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,540
我们做了一个大脑扫描
We did a brain scan.

673
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,040
只有无意识运动机制有活动  别无其他
Involuntary motor functions are active, little else.

674
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,410
我们认为它只是个接受器
We think it's acting as a receiver.

675
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,280
没有布莱克  克隆体只是空壳
The clones are an empty shell without Black.

676
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,790
只要打倒真的布莱克
Shut down the real Black,

677
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,670
可能就能一次打倒所有克隆体
and you might shut them all down.

678
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,720
但我们怎么知道哪个是真的丹东·布莱克呢
But how do we know which one's the real Danton Black?

679
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,940
我是因为你自己出现的昏迷才想到的
That occurred to me given your own passing out.

680
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,710
布莱克的能力有限制  就像你一样
Black has limits, just like you.

681
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,180
要控制所有克隆体
Controlling all of those clones

682
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,480
肯定要消耗巨大的体力
must require a tremendous amount of physical strength.

683
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,930
所以显示出疲惫虚弱的迹象的那个
So, look for the one showing signs of weakness or fatigue.

684
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,310
就是本体
He's the prime.

685
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,250
这只是个理论
Just a theory...

686
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,470
但你也许愿意实践一下  艾伦先生
but one you might want to put to the test, Mr. Allen.

687
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,050
还有  我做了这些高卡路里蛋白块
Plus, I whipped up these high-calorie protein bars

688
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,010
以便你能维持新陈代谢
for you to keep your metabolism up.

689
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,550
还有其他的吗
Any more of them?

690
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,570
没了
Nope.

691
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,240
它怎么突然动了
Why did it start moving?

692
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,650
是本体
The prime.

693
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,220
我想应该是本体下了命令
My guess is, the prime is on the move.

694
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,400
它也收到了战斗的召唤
This one heard the summons to battle.

695
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,140
而我知道它们正被召唤去哪里
And I know where he was summoned to.

696
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,830
斯塔格工业
Stagg industries.

697
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,780
那赶紧呼叫警员啊
You should call it in.

698
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,680
警方没法对付此事
Police can't fight this.

699
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,440
像马登一样  布莱克的能力
What Black's become, like Mardon...

700
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,720
我应付不了
beyond me.

701
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,570
警方应该也应付不了
Maybe way beyond them, too.

702
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,940
唯一一个能应付的人
The only person it's not beyond

703
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,120
就是你
is you.

704
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,400
你需要这么做  我明白
You gotta do this. I get it.

705
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,360
所以就这一次  你就听我一句话吧
So for once in your life, do what I tell you to do.

706
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
去阻止他
Go stop him.

我知道斯塔格偷了你的研究成果
I know Stagg stole your research,

714
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,650
但即使如此  你也无权杀人
but that doesn't give you the right to murder.

你以为我就是为了工作复仇吗
You think this is about my job.

我是为了伊丽莎白
This is about Elizabeth.

我的妻子
She was my wife.

她患上了冠状动脉退化
She had a degenerative coronary disease.

已经在移植名单上许多年了  但是
She'd been on the transplant list for years, but...

她没有时间了
time was running out.

所以我既然没法儿给她弄到新的心脏
So if I couldn't get her a new heart...

你就想给她培植一个

我马上就要成功了
I was so close.

可是斯塔格偷走了我的研究
Until Stagg stole my research.

So he could reap the glory.

Some people heal even stronger.

我希望如此
I hope so.

不能再伤害任何人
won't be able to hurt anyone else.
