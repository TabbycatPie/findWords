00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:02,814
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,050
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:07,410
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:09,595
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:12,598
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,901
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,937
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:21,774
but in doing so I opened up
our world to new threats.

9
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:25,160
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

10
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:28,113
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,533
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:30,964
Welcome to Earth-2.

13
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,099
I met your doppelganger.
She's a cold-hearted

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,767
ice queen named Killer Frost.

15
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,853
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

16
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:39,639
My brothers and sisters,

17
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,558
I've brought us to this new world,

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,894
ours for the taking!

19
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,896
[shouting] Whose world is this?

20
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:50,149
[all chanting] Our world! Our world!

21
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,986
Our world, our world!

22
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:58,574
[gunfire and zapping]

00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,169
Reloading!

25
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,641
Ah! [groans]

26
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,510
- David!
- [groaning]

27
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,645
Back door! Captain's down.

28
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,898
Go, go, go, go, go!

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,850
[thudding]

30
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:25,151
[tires screech]

31
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,023
Down, down! Down, get down!

32
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:37,330
[whooshing]

33
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,365
[gunfire, screaming stops]

34
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:48,508
Some people are calling
it the metapocalypse,

35
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,045
the days when Central City
was overrun by an army

36
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,547
with powers beyond imagination.

37
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,051
But in these dark times,

38
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,970
we must never forget our own strength,

39
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,107
our own power to fight back.

40
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,391
[keys clatter]

41
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,942
That it is only in the blackest of nights

42
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:13,329
that we can truly see the light...

43
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,699
and know for sure we are not alone.

44
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,870
We are never... ever... alone.

00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,460
We usually take these guys
down one at a time,

47
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:30,379
not 100 at a time.

48
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,464
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

49
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,300
I know we can do it.

50
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:37,136
Guys. You have to come see this.

51
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:39,889
Cisco, what are you...

52
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,223
Caitlin?

53
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,893
[sighs] She's in shock.

54
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,862
A little... dehydrated and malnourished,

55
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,981
but I think she'll be fine.

56
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,116
I'm okay.

57
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:53,202
What happened? How did you get away?

58
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:56,705
He... let me go.

59
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,158
I didn't think he would;
I thought it was a trap.

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,411
But... he told me you were dead.

61
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,129
I'm not. I'm right here.

62
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:07,466
We're all here, together.

63
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,084
Snow.

64
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,336
Jay's not here.

65
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,421
You're safe.

66
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:15,507
He's gonna overrun the city.
You can't stop him.

67
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,092
Yes, we can.

68
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,178
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,063
We've got this. This is our Earth.

70
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,264
You don't know that.

71
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,482
You don't know what he is capable of.

72
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,935
I know from being in the Speed Force

73
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,854
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

74
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:31,690
And if the universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose?

75
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,192
Right, guys?

76
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,777
Yeah, yeah, right.

77
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,330
You've been through a lot.

78
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:39,782
You should get some rest, come on.

79
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:43,035
You were in the Speed Force?

80
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,954
I... when you were gone.

81
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,923
It's hard to explain, but we
tried to get my powers back

82
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,292
and when the dark matter lightning...

83
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,127
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

84
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,764
Um, we don't think he's being
just a little too...

85
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,182
Overconfident?

86
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,268
Yeah, maybe it was
his time in the Speed Force.

87
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,021
I mean, he's acting like he's
invincible now or something.

88
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,973
Yeah, like nothing fazes
him anymore, which isn't...

89
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,691
Realistic, no.

90
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:08,477
Somebody needs to talk to him
before letting his guard down

91
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,279
gets him hurt or worse.

92
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,314
He did bring me out of my coma.

93
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,783
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

94
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,570
Well, like I said, somebody
needs to talk to him.

95
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,679
Amazing job, Anupam.

96
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,065
This is exactly the kind of
groundbreaking thinking

97
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,184
I built this company for.

98
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,602
Well done.

Hey.

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,317
She's out like a light, huh?

109
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,652
Yeah.

110
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,620
Jay really did a number on her.

111
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,155
It's not like he

112
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:24,459
exactly used kid gloves on the rest of us.

113
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,962
She'll be okay. She just needs time.

114
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:29,331
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.

115
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,166
Which we will.

116
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:35,304
Yeah, because the universe
is with us, right?

117
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:37,806
Listen, man...

00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:41,260

Hey. You okay?

123
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,361
- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

124
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,580
What'd you see?

125
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:04,449
I saw a bird.

126
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,168
Like, a dead bird.

It's under attack.

130
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:16,979
All right.

Thank you, Mr. Allen.

I'm not stupid.

136
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,410
Boom.

137
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,240
So how did you know?

138
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,741
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,026
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.

140
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,444
We're paid to be perceptive.

141
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,646
And you're always a little too well informed

142
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:39,249
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

143
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,700
But I don't believe we've ever met before.

144
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:42,168
Dr. Christina McGee.

145
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,370
Doctor Henry Allen.

146
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,788
I'm Barry's father.

147
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,039
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag,

148
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,340
did you happen to see who it was

149
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,925
that cause your building to collapse?

150
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,877
I didn't see anything. It happened so fast.

151
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,213
Maybe the security cameras caught something?

152
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,098
Can we access them?

153
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,351
Mercury Labs does have a
Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.

154
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,719
A what?

155
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,938
Virtually a black box for buildings.

156
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,523
It will have stored all the security footage

157
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,275
right up until the building collapsed.

158
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,860
Okay, great, I'll go find it.

159
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,895
This wasn't some random meta-human.

160
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,197
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted

161
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,316
in the past there's always
been a specific reason.

162
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,368
Yeah, someone's after something.

163
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,486
Yes, and that someone

164
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,705
is probably Zoom.

165
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,624
There may be one more possibility.

166
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,542
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells

167
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,244
running out of my facility.

168
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,413
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm certain it was him.

169
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:29,633
Is there any way he could
have anything to do with this?

170
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,217
A few months ago?

171
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,836
Sure.

172
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,304
Now?

173
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,006
No.

174
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,508
Yeah, there are a few
more things that we could

175
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,226
catch you up on, Dr. McGee.

176
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,151
Hey, my purse!

00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,070
[engine revs]

178
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,699
That ain't yours, punk.

179
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,250
Big mistake.

180
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,253
You picked a bad time to play hero.

Wally.

185
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,394
What the hell were you doing?

186
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,896
That guy just jacked a bunch of people

187
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,197
so I had to go after him.

188
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,149
You could have got yourself killed!

189
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:37,951
I'm not just gonna let
these guys get away with this.

190
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,069
I have to do something.

191
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,820
Wally, these are not just guys!

192
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,038
These are meta-humans!

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,873
Leaves this to the cops and The Flash.

194
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,492
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.

195
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,877
I... I have to do what I can to help.

196
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,580
I have to show him I was worth being saved.

197
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,252
Wally...

198
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,674
You are... worth it.

199
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,677
Really?

200
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,146
Am I?

201
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,481
'Cause last time I checked,
I'm the guy who avoided

202
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,767
his dying mother for weeks.

203
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,235
I'm the guy who shamed a bunch of other guys

204
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,154
and illegally took their cars from them.

205
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,856
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers and start

206
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,025
this whole damn "metapocalypse"
in the first place.

207
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,243
Wally...

208
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,579
Last time I checked,

209
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:26,032
I've a whole lot to make up for.

210
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,168
That's what I intend to do.

211
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,204
[somber music]

212
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,959
Damn it.

213
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,350
Snow.

214
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,885
Oh.

215
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,220
I didn't know you were here.

216
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,555
What you doing?

217
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:50,273
Uh... Jesse asked me to run some tests

218
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,278
to see if her genetic structure had changed.

219
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,398
Why did you ask Dr. Snow...

220
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,283
to run tests on you again?

221
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,068
Because I got hit with a dark matter, okay?

222
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,404
I mean, that must have affected me somehow.

223
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,742
[pensive music]

224
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:17,417
You're not a meta-human.

225
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,219
What you are

226
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,420
is a young woman

227
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:23,473
with a genius-level IQ that we could use

228
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:28,094
in our fight against
this new wave of meta-humans.

229
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,430
Okay. All right, fine.

230
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,182
Fine.

You all right?

234
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
Yeah, I'm fine.

[whooshing]

236
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,340
- Is this it?
- That's the one.

237
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,176
All right, great. Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco.

238
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,294
Why don't you guys crack this open,

239
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:02,962
- see what you can find?
- Sure.

240
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,547
We'll go see what kind
of meta-human powers

241
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,132
can take down a building
like that and how to stop it.

242
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,884
- Great.
- Sounds like fun.

243
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:10,303
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help

244
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,938
in the streets. Everybody cool here?

245
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,390
Should be a piece of cake, right?

246
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,978
- Hey, slugger!
- Hey.

247
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,364
Can I talk to you for a minute?

248
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,448
Yeah, sure.

249
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,117
What's up?

250
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,735
Well, I know you said that

251
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,121
what happened to you in the Speed Force

252
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,990
changed the way you see things,

253
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:33,459
but you seem very optimistic,
you know, with a lot

254
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,829
of meta-humans running around
tearing up the city.

255
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,964
What, did you see the future in there?

256
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,915
[laughs]

257
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,667
No... um... not this time.

258
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,085
No... I... look...

259
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,088
What I was shown in the Speed Force

260
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,390
didn't just change my mind,

261
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,843
it changed me.

262
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,645
I don't know...
what you're seeing as optimism

263
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,481
is, for the first time,

264
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,184
I'm just not afraid anymore.

265
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,656
Great, that's...

266
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,242
But...

267
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,362
You know you still
have to be careful, right?

268
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,164
What do you mean?

269
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,332
Well...

270
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,668
I don't... why are you trying to

271
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,338
take something from me
that I fought so hard to get to?

272
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,423
- Barry!
- I... you... you don't know

273
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,091
everything that I've been through, Dad.

274
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,127
You haven't been here long enough to know.

275
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,013
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

276
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,348
I don't know why I said that.

277
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,350
I think I do.

278
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,435
Hadn't been around.

Teach you how to drive
or take you to look at colleges.

280
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,689
But I've done everything in my power

281
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,225
to know who you are.

282
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,977
Barry, I don't want to
take anything from you.

283
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,313
I believe in you.

284
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,448
This isn't about my not believing in you.

285
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,283
I know that.

286
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,786
And I'm fine. Okay?

287
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,571
Thank you, thank you very much

288
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,989
for worrying about me.

289
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,158
I love you.

290
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,493
But I'm fine.

[alert beeping]

292
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
Come on.

293
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,923
What is that?

294
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,392
It's CCPD.

297
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:15,595
Don't do it.

You know, I never saw the crime photos

00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,991
of my mother's murder.

301
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,943
Well, I guess I didn't need to.

I have a ringside seat
while you got whisked away.

303

[foreboding music]

Not just a hologram after all,
are you, Flash?

306
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:48,711
Interesting.

307
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,100
I know you didn't
call me up here just to banter.

308
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,768
Let's finish this.

309
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,387
Right now.

310
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,305
Actually, I did.

311
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,724
I called you up here to
tell you you can't keep running

312

from one meta to the next.

00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,233
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

If only that were good enough.

00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:15,371
'Cause here's the thing.

00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,457
I know you.

I know you, I know what's holding you back.

You and me...

00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,836
Yeah, you keep saying that,

324
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,421
but it's not gonna make it true.

325
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,973
You'll see. We are.

326
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,011
Same tragic background.

327

Same reason for running.

328
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,399
Same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

329
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,984
The difference?

330
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,103
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

331
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,939
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

332
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:52,191
Doesn't it get exhausting?

333
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,826
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry!

334
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,529
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.

335
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,697
I'm not pretending.

Now if it were me,

00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,204
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought.

340
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,539
But you,

341
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,841
you'll never let that happen, will you?

342
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,761
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

343
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,515
Because you always have to be the hero.

344
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,800
And while you're
playing the good little boy...

00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:24,474
I'll be busy winning.

347
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,990
We can't let Zoom destroy another building.

348
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,665
We need to take him down.

349
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,385
Now.

350
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,256
And how do you propose we do that

351
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,975
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

352
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,894
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.

353
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,312
What makes us different?

354
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,764
We're a team.

355
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,017
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

356
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,035
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

357
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,270
Barry, we don't even know

358
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:56,855
how many of his minions there are.

359
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,990
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

360
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,109
And all of them, they're all
working with different powers.

361
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,744
It could take weeks to track them all down.

362
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,112
Guys, we don't have weeks.

363
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,864
So what we need do to is

364
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,699
come up with a way to stop them all at once.

365
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,701

00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,120
How?

367
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,338
Cisco,

369
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,009
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

370
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,809
Yeah, it was a whole different frequency.

371
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,695
And the way you took down the Time Wraiths,

372
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:22,113
that was based on frequency.

373
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,448
Hartley's entire shtick...

374
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,734
I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

375
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:28,119
- Yeah.
- So basically,

376
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,404
we create some vibrational tech

377
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:31,989
that can take down the Earth-2 metas.

378
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,407
- Basically.
- Oh, I gotcha.

379
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,326
- Me too.
- I'll help.

380
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,544
- Okay.
- I'll let you know

381
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:37,912
if I hear anything from CCPN.

382
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:41,716
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,918
You guys...

384
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,337
we got this.

Barr, can I talk to you for a second?

387
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,597
Yeah.

Why?

It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.

394
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,348
What's up?

395
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,467
Man, it's Wally.

396
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:34,518
Is he okay?

397
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,687
Not really.

398
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:39,557
Earlier, he thought it would be a good idea

399
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,275
if he used himself

400
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:45,396
as bait against a meta-human psycho.

401
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,398
Thought he could do things

402
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,867
the way The Flash would.

403
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,902
Joe, I mean, he... he did tell me that

404
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,239
he wasn't gonna waste the
opportunity The Flash gave him.

405
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,158
I don't know if you can stop him.

406
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,743
I'm gonna have to or
he's gonna get himself killed.

407
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:00,878
Look, he ain't you, Barry.

408
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,080
He can't just go Mach 50...

409
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,548
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

410
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,383
The point is

411
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:09,587
thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

412
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,923
Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

413
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,342
and him throwing caution to the
wind on top of all that?

414
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,311
No.

415
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,731
We got to keep him safe.

416
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:24,185
So... in the Flash,

417
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,187
talk to him.

418
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,521
Again.

419
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,992
Yeah, I'll talk to him. I'll try, I promise.

Harry's preferred method
of dealing with stress.

That is how frustrated I am right now.

You're okay, all right? You're shaking.

I... I thought I saw him... Zoom...

00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,334
I thought I saw him right there.

439
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,635
It's just me, okay?

440
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,003
Look at me, he's not here.

441
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:35,472
He's not here.

442
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:38,342
I see him everywhere.

443
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,261
Look, you literally

444
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,597
just escaped a psychopath
who kidnapped you, all right,

445
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,065
so I think it's normal for you to have

446
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,483
a severe reaction like this.

00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,652
This is so much worse than that.

I admire what you're trying to do,

leave this to the police.

Yeah, determined to get himself killed.

550
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,525
Or determined to help people.

551
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,994
And be glad, or you know,

552
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,495
I would not be standing here right now.

553
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,030
Well, he was lucky tonight.

554
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:54,166
I don't want to see the day when he isn't.

555
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:57,169
We've got more than luck on our side, Joe.

556
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,548
You know you're not invincible, right?

557
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,520
Yes, of course, I know this.

558
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,604
[sighs]

559
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:16,972
Joe's being

560
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,474
overprotective, but I get it.

561
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,142
Yeah, but it's like

562
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,029
you think that nothing can touch you.

563
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,032
Like nothing bad can get in your way.

564
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,818
That's not true for any of us.

565
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
What are you saying?

566
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,571
Look,

567
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,908
I know that you had an
experience in the Speed Force.

568
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,578
And I'm happy that you think
we're gonna win the day.

569
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,915
But I think a little fear
can be a healthy thing.

570
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:46,969
It helps you determine
which risks are worth taking.

571
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,254
I think that's something for both

572
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:49,922
you and Wally to take to heart.

573
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:52,758
[somber music]

574
00:26:56,597 --> 00:27:00,099
I met your little red friend tonight.

575
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,435
Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?

576
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,737
You didn't.

577
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,439
You're good but not that good.

578
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,860
And yet I seem to be

579
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,412
the only one of your top lieutenants

580
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,530
still standing.

581
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,450
Like I said, you're good.

582
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,369
So why don't you go
knock down a few more buildings?

583
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,421
Like I ordered.

584
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,706
What's the point?

585
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,461
The point is so that

586
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,629
it seems random.

587
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,631
That way The Flash and his merry band won't

588
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,967
realize what I'm up to

589
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,603
till it's too late.

590
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,893
What are you up to?

591
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,896
No good.

592
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,614
[foreboding music]

593
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:49,815
- Ow.
- Sorry.

594
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:52,201
- Ow!
- There we go.

595
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,486
Are you kidding me with this?

596
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,570
Hey, at least it works.

597
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,571
Tremendous.

598
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,956
What is it exactly?

599
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,325
It's just a small source of joy,

600
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,327
but more importantly, it's how
we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

601
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:03,162
By giving them all electroshock therapy?

602
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,498
By giving them all
dimensional shock therapy.

603
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,501
This is where I play stupid
and you explain science.

604
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,252
Okay. Fair enough.

605
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,922
So all matter vibrates at
its own unique frequency, right?

606
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,757
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

607
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,226
Like how an opera singer
shatters glass with her voice.

608
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,844
Exactly. So we found out that

609
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,429
all Earth-2 people vibrate at their own,

610
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,682
- more erratic frequency.
- Higher frequency.

611
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:25,818
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

612
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,187
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

613
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,439
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?

614
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,825
And he postulated that
we could create a sort of

615
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:35,444
dimensional tuning fork... VoilÃ ...

616
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,029
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

617
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,031
Just let me have this one, okay?

618
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,499
- Have it, have it.
- Thank you.

619
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,084
So if you run around the city

620
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,370
fast enough to create a refracting field,

621
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,505
the device can send out

622
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,923
a pulse

623
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,342
that'll bounce off of it, split apart,

624
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:52,595
and collide with itself over and over.

625
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,464
Amplifying it to an erratic
frequency on the Earth-2...

626
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,049
- Higher. Higher frequency.
- Higher frequency

627
00:28:57,051 --> 00:28:58,551
on the Earth-2 spectrum.

628
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,553
And when that pulse
hits anyone from Earth-2...

629
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,605
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

630
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,607
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

631
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,475
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

632
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,394
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

633
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:10,062
How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?

634
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,397
Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.

635
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:12,865
Yes you did.

636
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,817
Uh, we designed these headphones

637
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,235
to protect us from the pulse.

638
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,070
Beats by Wells. [laughs]

639
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:20,239
[alert beeping]

640
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,491
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

641
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,493
That's the high-rise development
on the west side.

642
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:25,911
Hundreds of people live there.

643
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,796
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.

644
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,466
Set that pulse off right now.
Allen, you need to start

645
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,251
generating that refracting field right now.

646
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,303
But Black Siren can take down
this building at any point.

647
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,838
Wha... all those people, Wells.

648
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,757
How many more people
are gonna die while we wait?

649
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,759
Guys, which is it?

650
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:45,347
I think I just got
the worst idea of all time.

651
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:48,267
[ominous music]

652
00:29:56,944 --> 00:30:00,863
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

653
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,415
Maybe you're not as powerful as you think!

654
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,418
[dramatic music]

655
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:21,133
What are you two doing here?

656
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:24,470
Why should you have all the fun?

657
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:33,515
I thought you two were dead.

658
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,851
Zoom thinks that too.

659
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:38,420
And we'd like to keep it that way.

660
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,574
For now.

661
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:46,028
You think you two can pull one over on Zoom?

662
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,063
Well, enjoy being dead.

663
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,698
I told you.

664
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,501
Give her a chance.

665
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:53,702
What chance?

666
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:55,704
She's not ready.

667
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,792
Excuse me.

668
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:02,878
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

669
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,713
Try it, and I'll shatter your entire

670
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:06,932
nervous system without breaking a sweat.

671
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:11,136
Wow, you really think you can take on Zoom.

672
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,106
We can.

673
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,892
You don't even know how powerful you are.

674
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:20,029
With a single call,
you can take down a building.

675
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,948
I'd call that impressive.

676
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,734
But why... stop...

677
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,953
there?

678
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,823
Why serve a master when you can be a master,

679
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:33,575
when you can be a god?

680
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:38,714
We... could be gods.

00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:47,923
- All right!
- All right.

We're synced up with whatever

684
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,643
the heck that thing is.

685
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,227
Finally something we're both baffled by.

686
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:53,812
I'm kidding. That, my friend,

687
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:58,267
is a 75KTSB 40,000-watt
reverberating sound amplifier

688
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,185
designed to single out
the operating frequency

689
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:02,271
of every single Earth-2
being on this planet...

690
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:04,323
which, went contained and magnified

691
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:06,025
by The Flash creating a sound pressure wall

692
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,610
around the city, will render all of us

693
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:11,413
Earth-2 beings unconscious.

694
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,532
Hence...

695
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:16,035
the safety precautions.

696
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,670
I'm baffled by it.

697
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,704
[laughs]

698
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,172
Are we ready?

699
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,092
- Yes, we are.
- All right.

700
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:25,594
[device activating]

701
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:28,514
Here... we...

702
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:30,099
go.

703
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:43,479
If I were interested

704
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:47,149
in forming an alliance with you two,

705
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,318
what's your plan?

706
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,237
Exactly?

707
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:55,491
We ambush Zoom at CCPD.

708
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,825
With our three powers combined,

709
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:58,577
he'll be no match for us.

710
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,662
Hmm.

711
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:03,632
Well, I like the sound of that.

712
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:04,967
Great.

713
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:07,503
Then let's go.

714
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:09,838
There's just one more thing.

715
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,344
Reverb... catch.

716
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:24,019
You know, all doppelgangers...

717
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,854
they're mirror images of themselves.

718
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:28,657
But you two, you didn't know that, did you?

719
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,659
Reverb is left-handed.

720
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,328
Well, I just... I just happened to...

721
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,781
catch it with my right... run!

00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:46,458
Oh, no.

724
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,343
What are we gonna do?

725
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:52,047
I don't think that
there's anything you can do.

726
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:58,103
What the what?

727
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,054
I don't know.

728
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:00,305
Well, do it again!
