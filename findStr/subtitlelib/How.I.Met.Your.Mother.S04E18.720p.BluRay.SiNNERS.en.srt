1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,993
<i>In the spring of 2009,
I'd been hired to design</i>

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:07,696
<i>a new headquarters
for Goliath National Bank.</i>

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:10,103
<i>And I was eager to add
as much of my voice as an architect</i>

4
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>into the plans as possible.</i>

5
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:16,069
Wood beams bathed in natural light
in the atrium.

6
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:19,343
They're gonna love it!

7
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:23,182
<i>There was only one problem,
and his name was Bilson.</i>

8
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:25,813
Wood? Natural light?

9
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:27,719
Uh, no!

10
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,920
Natural light reminds the workers
that there is an outside world

11
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,328
where they have family and friends.

12
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,457
We want to crush that!

13
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,401
You show up in the dark,
you go home in the dark.

14
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,301
You spend your whole damn day

15
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,566
in the dark!

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,372
I need to hear Lily's voice.

17
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,734
Who said you could leave?

18
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,910
<i>Bilson was killing
every original idea I had.</i>

19
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,081
<i>Then, one day,
GNB took him off the project</i>

20
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,121
<i>and created a new task force
to oversee my designs.</i>

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,713
<i>Suddenly, everything changed.</i>

22
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,816
We'll have a rooftop Zen garden
for quiet contemplation.

23
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,326
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,557
where local children can come
to make wishes.

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,532
The new GNB, a place of work

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,362
that you can call home.

27
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,573
Thank you, and, um,

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,702
welcome home.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,952
<i>Everything was going great,
until one day, in the elevator...</i>

30
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,459
Whoa!

31
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:34,986
Yeah, it's Ted.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,762
No, no, no, no.
I did not approve that change

33
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:40,334
for the blueprints
for the new GNB headquarters

34
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:43,370
for which I'm the head architect
at only 30 years old.

35
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:47,375
Yes,
I'm single and I give to charity.

36
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:49,502
What does that have to do with anything?

37
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,876
All right, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

38
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,751
You know that was a fake phone call,
don't you?

39
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:59,652
Yes, and I also know
that the new GNB headquarters project

40
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:01,189
was scrapped last month.

41
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,456
Nice try.

42
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,869
Check out Scarlett Johansson
at the Oscars.

43
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:24,277
If I could nail any celebrity,
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson.

44
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,681
Hot, talented, and nobody does
that many Woody Allen movies

45
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,845
without serious daddy issues.

46
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:33,083
If I could nail any celebrity, it would be Lily.
She's the star of my heart.

47
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,158
Aw!

48
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:36,921
For me, it'd be Hugh Jackman.

49
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:41,591
You know, I don't know, celebrities,
they're into some really weird sex stuff.

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,758
Trust me.

51
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,926
How would you know that?

52
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,132
This is embarrassing, but I...

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,969
I went home with a celebrity one night.

54
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:53,068
Oh, my God! Seriously?

55
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,205
Yeah. He wanted to do
this really freaky thing with me,

56
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,647
so I left. That's it. End of story.

57
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,912
No, no, not end of story.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,388
I need to know who, what, when
and in where. Spill it!

59
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:07,892
Lily, please settle down.
You're swallowing too much air.

60
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,622
But before you go any further,

61
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,494
I'm flattered, but technically,
I'm not a celebrity.

62
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,399
And plus, for the last time,
I put the mask on as a joke.

63
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,266
Okay, not you, Barney.

64
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,396
Okay, who is it?

65
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,839
Okay, now you gave Lily the hiccups.

66
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,209
Okay, I won't tell you anything specific,

67
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:30,683
but all I'll say is he is Canadian-born,
but you definitely know this guy,

68
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,082
and he got me back to his place

69
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,383
by offering to show me
a very unique collection.

70
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,457
What do you mean, collection?

71
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:39,993
Well, you know how some people collect,
like, stamps or coins? It's like that.

72
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,083
But I'm not telling.

73
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,357
Well, at least tell us the weird thing
he wanted to do.

74
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,456
I don't know
what you call it in the States,

75
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,330
but we have a name for it in Canada.

76
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,700
Look, I've already said too much.

77
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:53,468
So, mystery celebrity
who collects a mystery item

78
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:56,942
asked you to do
a mystery Canadian sex act.

79
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,438
- Yes.
- Tell us!

80
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:01,343
Okay, I'll tell you.

81
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,148
But only if you guess
all three parts correctly.

82
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,917
- Well, that's just impossible.
- Exactly.

83
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,253
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.

84
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,827
Well, you got your Sloppy Dog Sled,

85
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:14,658
your Alberta Fur Trapper,
your Full Mountie...

86
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,129
How do you know all these?

87
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,996
Canadiansexacts. org,
it's bookmarked on the top right.

88
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,594
- "Dot org"?
- Yeah. It's not for profit.

89
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,537
They really just want to get
the information out there.

90
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,636
Hey, so, I just had
the weirdest conversation.

91
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:31,647
This woman at GNB told me that the new
bank building was scrapped last month.

92
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,376
That's crazy, right?

93
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,449
Wait, what... What was that look?

94
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:36,645
- Should we tell him?
- I don't want to tell him.

95
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,016
- I think we should tell him.
- We're not telling him.

96
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:39,089
There was no look.

97
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,954
Guys, what the hell?

98
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,050
Okay, it's time that you know the truth.

99
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:46,289
A few weeks ago,
Bilson called us into his office.

100
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,762
We're scrapping the plan
for the new GNB headquarters.

101
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,466
This recession is killing us.

102
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,267
We're cutting anything non-essential.

103
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,401
And I have a lot of tough choices to make
at the bi-quarterly retreat in Saint Croix.

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,545
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

105
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,513
Not when he hears it
coming from his best friend.

106
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,678
- I have to tell him?
- I have to tell him?

107
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:08,852
You should tell him, you're his best friend.

108
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,446
- Am not, you're his best friend.
- Am not, you're his best...

109
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,388
- Am...
- Quiet, here he comes.

110
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,452
What, the white dude or the Asian fellow?
See? I barely know the guy.

111
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,055
- Hey, Ted, what's up?
- Hey, how're you doing?

112
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,498
I'm frustrated.

113
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,698
Anything innovative I put in my designs,
Bilson just hacks out with a machete.

114
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:28,036
I hate having to answer to a guy like that.

115
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,166
You should drop the project.

116
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,574
You should totally drop the project.
It's beneath you.

117
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,612
Then it's settled.
To Ted Mosby's new chapter.

118
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:35,147
May the wind be at your back,
and may the road...

119
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,481
Are you kidding? They just laid off
another architect at my firm.

120
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,020
I mean, Bilson's a pain, sure,

121
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,989
but without this project,
I'm probably out of a job.

122
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,583
Right. Um, it's funny
that you mention the project,

123
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,321
- because...
- You're nailing it.

124
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,657
Keep up the good work, buddy.

125
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:54,133
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.
You're shining like a diamond!

126
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:58,133
Thank you. I needed that.

127
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,808
All right, I'm going to head upstairs
and keep working.

128
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,676
I've got to find a way to introduce
some wood into Bilson's dark atrium.

129
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,482
I think you know what I meant.

130
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:13,246
- What was that?
- I... I have a thought, okay?

131
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,348
We're paying Ted's firm for two more
months of design work, no matter what,

132
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,259
so couldn't we just let him keep working
and not tell him?

133
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:24,026
He's had a rough year. Let's let the guy
be happy a little while longer.

134
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:28,161
Marshall, what you're suggesting
is an elaborate, long-term lie

135
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,398
that requires tremendous commitment.

136
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:33,203
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.

137
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,939
- Sure I can.
- Lie to me right now.

138
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,413
Okay. I have a spaceship.

139
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:41,644
- What kind of fuel powers your spaceship?
- Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

140
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:45,415
No! Stand your ground.
If someone questions you,

141
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,991
distract them from the original lie
with more lies.

142
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,892
Here, let me demonstrate. I own a pony.
Ask me a question.

143
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,261
Okay. Um...

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,492
What color is your pony?

145
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,935
Well, when I first got Dandelion,
she was a deep chestnut brown,

146
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,064
but sadly, her stable is located
near a chemical plant

147
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:04,665
which contaminated the drinking water.

148
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:08,803
So over time, she's turned
a sickly, grayish-white color,

149
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:12,008
and there's nothing
that the vet can do to fix her.

150
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:16,214
My God! I'm... That's horrible.
Is Dandelion going to be okay?

151
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,388
- Okay. All right. You are good!
- Huh?

152
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,961
Dandelion's not even sick, is she?

153
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:29,028
So the building's really dead
and you guys lied to me?

154
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,399
We just did it to protect you, Ted.

155
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:34,372
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my two best friends,

156
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,500
and I didn't even know it.

157
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,876
In Canada, that's called
a "Sneaky Snowplow. "

158
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:50,289
That building was my dream job,
and now, it's just gone.

159
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,361
- We're so sorry, Ted.
- I need a drink.

160
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:55,459
Poor Ted.

161
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:58,998
Would I seem heartless if I switched us
back to Canadian Sex Acts?

162
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,068
- Not at all.
- I'm surprised you waited this long.

163
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,399
What the hell is a Two-Hand Zamboni?

164
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:08,033
Let's just say the only thing the woman
is wearing is skates on her hands.

165
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,778
A Manitoba Milk Bag?

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,575
Okay, it's like a Chicago Mustache,

167
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,879
but the person on the bottom
is wearing a snowsuit.

168
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:19,921
- A Newfoundland Lobster Trap?
- Don't know. Don't want to know.

169
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,990
Those Newfies are out of control.

170
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,059
Okay!
Okay, I'm going to make my first guess.

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,525
Okay, but I'll only tell you

172
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:29,690
if you correctly guess the person,
the act and the collection.

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,667
Okay, I'm going to go. Bryan Adams.

174
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:38,605
He collects baseball cards,
and he wanted to do a Greasy Kayak.

175
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,401
No.

176
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:45,439
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,
a Squatting Eskimo.

177
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:48,214
- No.
- Mmm! Kiefer Sutherland,

178
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:52,346
souvenir shot glasses,
and a Sticky Flapjack.

179
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,218
No. That I would have done.

180
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,286
Wait.

181
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,989
Wait, if they pulled the plug
on the project a month ago,

182
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:01,497
why have I been going in once a week

183
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,863
to meet with
the New Headquarters Task Force?

184
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,903
Well, obviously you couldn't come in
and pitch to Bilson.

185
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,066
So, we invented the task force.

186
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,475
Then it was just a question
of putting together the team.

187
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,043
<i>You know Roy Waterman,
Vice-President of Capital and Risk?</i>

188
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,744
<i>He's actually Roy the janitor.</i>

189
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:24,516
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks?

190
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,120
How naked do I have to get?

191
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,460
<i>Louisa Mendoza,
Executive Vice-President of Assets?</i>

192
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,001
<i>She's actually Louisa the lunch lady.</i>

193
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:39,629
Louisa, I need your help with something,
but you can't tell anybody.

194
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,105
Exactly. This is a big secret.

195
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,305
How do you say "secret" in Spanish?

196
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:51,716
<i>Ah. Yes, albóndigas.</i>

197
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:56,081
<i>This will be our little albóndigas.</i>

198
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,291
Hey, can I have a couple
of meatballs, please?

199
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:04,261
<i>And Arthur Naismith, the eccentric
genius guru of corporate investments?</i>

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,528
<i>He's actually Crazy Arty,
15th Street's own one-man band.</i>

201
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:10,927
- Excuse me.
- Ah!

202
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,063
Do you have a minute to talk?

203
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:16,008
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,
makes all my appointments.

204
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,743
<i>We rounded out the group
with a few interns</i>

205
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:26,845
<i>and paid everyone 50 bucks to act
super-interested in what you were saying.</i>

206
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:36,297
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.

207
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:41,059
That was some of the most inspired
design work I've done in my entire career.

208
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,831
I was so excited.

209
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,606
Alex Trebek, a Musty Goaltender,
Beanie Babies!

210
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,009
- Nope.
- Damn it!

211
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:54,313
Wait. So that explains the thing
that happened with Louisa.

212
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,015
- Good job, buddy.
- Nice, nice!

213
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:05,124
Listen, Louisa.
What are we going to do about this?

214
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,094
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

215
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,225
I know you feel it, too.

216
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,301
What the hell?

217
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,781
No! No! No, this is wrong!

218
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,285
For God's sake, you're on the task force!

219
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,724
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

220
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,933
Well, you know how you played third base
for the GNB softball team?

221
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,357
Yeah.

222
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,528
There is no GNB softball team.

223
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,300
We just rented out a field,
rounded up a bunch of guys

224
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,999
and told them to make you the hero.

225
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,444
So my game-winning walk was a lie?

226
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,040
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew
that you'd be out of work soon,

227
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,911
and we just... We just wanted
to make you feel good.

228
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,417
- You know, that's what friends do.
- Lie to each other?

229
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,784
Sometimes, yeah,
to protect each other's feelings.

230
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,825
No way! You never lie to your friends.
I would never not be honest with you.

231
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:09,055
Really? What about that open mic night
at the comedy club?

232
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,595
<i>Are you like me, folks?</i>

233
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,465
<i>Have you ever thought about how many
different kinds of fish there are,</i>

234
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,734
<i>and the names of those fish?</i>

235
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,138
<i>Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.</i>

236
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:27,638
<i>"Trout. "Am I right?</i>

237
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,240
<i>"Sturgeon. "I don't think so, pal.</i>

238
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:31,641
<i>"Salmon. "</i>

239
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,687
<i>Ah! I'm going to say that again.</i>

240
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:35,723
<i>"Salmon. "</i>

241
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,654
<i>Who thought that was a good idea, right?</i>

242
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:41,830
<i>"Bass. " This guy over here
knows what I'm talking about.</i>

243
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,125
<i>"Halibut. "</i>

244
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,664
<i>Thank you, good night.</i>

245
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,964
- How was I?
- Oh! You were great. Really funny.

246
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,201
You killed

247
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,940
everyone's Thursday night.

248
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:00,615
Time out. You didn't like the fish list?

249
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:03,812
It was horrible! You just read a list of fish.

250
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,918
Anyway, you guys
just proved my point, okay?

251
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:13,258
You lied to me to protect my feelings.

252
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,456
This is completely different!

253
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:18,127
I just wasted a month of my life
working on a dead project.

254
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:21,069
That's time I could've spent
trying to bring my firm new business.

255
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:23,766
Instead, I'm going to go in there
tomorrow morning,

256
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,308
I'm probably going to get fired.

257
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,972
Best-case scenario, my boss is going
to ream me out in front of everybody.

258
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,610
- Back home, we call that a...
- "Saskatoon Totem Pole. "

259
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,584
Yes.
- It's on here.

260
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,788
Good morning, lying bastards.

261
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:47,696
Anything you want to lie about
before I head off to work to get fired?

262
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,358
- That's a nice shirt.
- You're the devil.

263
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:52,596
Ted, what if we told you
that we found you a new project at GNB

264
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:55,869
where you would be redesigning
part of the 20th floor?

265
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:58,945
Well, if that's a lie,
it's an incredibly dull one.

266
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,377
What exactly would I be doing?

267
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,615
This is the 18th floor ETR.

268
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,844
Basically, Bilson wants
a room just like this,

269
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,647
only two stories up, on our floor.

270
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,016
Wait, what's an ETR?

271
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:12,114
- It's the Employee Transition Room.
- What does that mean?

272
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:15,718
Well, it's a space
where a supervisor and an employee

273
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,028
engage in a knowledge transfer about
an impending vocational paradigm shift.

274
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,663
People get fired in here.

275
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,427
That's horrible.

276
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,406
Why do you need a room
specifically for firing people?

277
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:32,742
Well, GNB feels that people need a safe,
secure space to deal with the news.

278
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,878
Yeah. It gets pretty real in here.

279
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:26,266
<i>So, I reluctantly agreed to
design a room where people would be fired.</i>

280
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,167
<i>But I was determined to make it my own.</i>

281
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:32,801
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,
you'll exit into what I'm calling

282
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,345
the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway.

283
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,115
Uh-oh.

284
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:42,618
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber
with a trained grief counselor.

285
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,951
It's right here,
past the New Beginnings Fountain.

286
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,080
Uh-oh.

287
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:50,288
And there you have it.
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

288
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:56,296
a nurturing womb
birthing you into a new life.

289
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,596
I love it.

290
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,137
- Really?
- Yeah.

291
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,934
- Nice work, Ted.
- Thank you.

292
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,704
Can you add some of these touches
to the existing 18th Floor ETR as well?

293
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,575
- Absolutely.
- Great.

294
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,478
Let's take a look.

295
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:16,654
- Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...
- You're fired!

296
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:18,782
- What?
- I wanted this room!

297
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:21,656
This exact room, two floors up!

298
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,923
- But...
- You're fired!

299
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:25,464
Now, get the hell out of here.

300
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:30,304
Hey, honey.

301
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,739
Anyone from the band Rush,

302
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:41,373
a Montreal Meatpie,
and superhero lunch boxes.

303
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,005
No.

304
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:47,549
Okay. Rick Moranis,
the Reverse Rick Moranis,

305
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,180
antique Judaica.

306
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,282
- No.
- I give up.

307
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,624
I've been guessing for three days. I'm done.

308
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,392
If that means I never get to know, so be it.

309
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,799
- Fine.
- Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

310
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,495
Okay, you really want to know?

311
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,936
Yes!

312
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,063
Okay.

313
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,005
But this information
does not leave this table.

314
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,371
Oh, my God. I am so excited.

315
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:15,651
- I'm going to read it.
- Read it.

316
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,719
- I'm going to read it.
- Read it.

317
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,185
I'm going to read it. Here we go.

318
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:24,789
"The Frozen Snowshoe,
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays. "

319
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,326
Right.

320
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,699
I don't know
what any of those words mean.

321
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:35,672
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity?

322
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:39,937
Yeah, who the hell is Old King Clancy?

323
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:42,945
No, that's not the person, that's the sex act.

324
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:47,280
It's the same as a Sacramento Turtleneck,
except with maple syrup.

325
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:50,514
So the celebrity was Harvey Strays?

326
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:53,955
No, that's what he collected.
Harvey's trays.

327
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,995
You know, those classic orange trays
you get whenever you eat at Harvey's?

328
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,728
The restaurant?

329
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,960
Oh, come on, you're road-tripping
down the Trans-Canada Highway,

330
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,537
you get a hunger on
between Milverton and Wawa,

331
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:10,098
where are you gonna strap on a feed bag,
huh? Harvey's. "Over 12,000 Served!"

332
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:15,174
- So the celebrity was...
- The Frozen Snowshoe.

333
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:19,717
Oh, my God! You guys have never
heard of The Frozen Snowshoe?

334
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:23,085
He's only the most famous
professional wrestler in Canada.

335
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,887
I met him after he defeated
Reckless Rick Rogers

336
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:30,725
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena
back in '02. Classic match.

337
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:35,024
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

338
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,504
invited you back to his place
to look at Harvey's trays,

339
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,236
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy?

340
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:46,144
Exactly. And I'm serious,
you cannot tell anyone.

341
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,574
Well, my hiccups are gone.

342
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,618
Possibly forever.

343
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,022
Canada! You did it again.
You even found a way to ruin this.

344
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,857
Why? Why do we let you be a country?

345
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:02,989
- Hey, Mr. Mister.
- Hey.

346
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:06,466
Shouldn't you be upstairs,
designing your big, fancy ETR?

347
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,662
- I'm off the project.
- What?

348
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:11,501
- Bilson fired me.
- You're kidding me.

349
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:15,441
So what does this mean for you
at your firm? Are you going to get laid off?

350
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:19,036
- Actually, I just quit.
- Why?

351
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:22,607
Because I can't work for big,
heartless corporate clients anymore.

352
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,346
When I was pitching to your "task force,"

353
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,082
I was doing the most inspired work
of my career.

354
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,126
In a way, you idiots reminded me
how much fun my job can be

355
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,163
when I'm not answering
to the Bilsons of the world, so

356
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,630
- I quit.
- Wow.

357
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:40,133
- They fired you, didn't they?
- Yes, sir.

358
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:43,969
But I got a sweet severance package
and I've made a big decision.

359
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:45,565
I'm going to start my own firm.

360
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:46,905
- Whoa, buddy!
- That's exciting.

361
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,638
In this economy?

362
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,214
So you're not mad?

363
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,307
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

364
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,181
So how'd it all go down
between you and Bilson?

365
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,590
Well, after he proposed
a vocational paradigm shift,

366
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:05,687
I made an impromptu presentation
using a four-pronged approach

367
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,322
that really brought him to his knees.

368
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,525
- Hit him with a chair?
- Yep.

369
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,192
That's my boy.

370
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,704
And this one, I got on the drive
from Milverton to Wawa.

371
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:23,146
Wow. That's pretty impressive,
The Frozen Snowshoe.

372
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:25,717
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe. "

373
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,687
Have a seat.

374
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,553
So, Shoe,

375
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:37,630
how would you like to give me

376
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,831
an Old King Clancy?

377
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,440
I think you should go.
