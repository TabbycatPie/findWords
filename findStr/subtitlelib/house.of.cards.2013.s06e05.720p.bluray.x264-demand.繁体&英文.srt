154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,100
緊急求救
SOS.

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,790
救救我們的靈魂  救救我們的大船
Save our souls, save our ships,

156
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,160
這兩個說法都合適
Take your pick.

157
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,380
這可不是鬧著玩的
This ... is real.

158
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,580
我是梅樂蒂·科魯茲  這就是我的評論
I'm Melody Cruz, and that's what I got.

159
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,450
那張抓拍真不錯  是不是
That's quite a snapshot, right?

160
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,290
獨一無二  精心設計過
Unique. Carefully calibrated.

161
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,100
痛苦  歇斯底里再加一點點瘋狂
Pain, hysteria and just a small dose of crazy.

162
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,560
他們從未見過這樣的克萊爾·安德伍德
Claire Underwood, like they've never seen before.

163
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,430
其實沒有看上去那么簡單
It's actually not as easy as it looks.

164
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,300
要擺出那樣的表情
See, in order for me to make that face,

165
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,600
我得發揮想象
I have to imagine...

166
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,040
把各種情緒完美糅合到一起
the perfect combination of things.

167
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,060
配方如下
Here's the recipe.

168
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,770
首先  我得想著
First, I have to think about all the ways

169
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,490
我這一生中  男人操控我的各種辦法
in which men have tried to manage me my whole life.

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,020
然后  我要想到
Then, I think of...

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,140
美國民眾最擔心的事
America's worst fear...

172
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,110
就一個女人坐進總統辦公室而言
when it comes to a female in the Oval Office.

173
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,870
-她的日程全推干凈了  -最后
- Her schedule has been cleared. - And finally...

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,160
我最后悔的事  弗蘭西斯·J·安德伍德
...my biggest regret-- Francis J. Underwood.

175
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,340
總統女士
Madam President.

176
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,370
你病了嗎
Are you ill?

177
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,860
要是病了  我去請白宮醫生
If you're ill, I'll call the White House physician.

178
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,270
克萊爾
Claire.

179
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,530
出去  馬克
Just get out, Mark.

180
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,510
克萊爾  不能再這樣下去了
Claire, this has to stop.

181
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,450
請讓我一個人靜靜
Please, just leave me alone.

182
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,770
你引發了全國性的恐慌  你得振作起來
You are alarming the nation. You need to get up.

183
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,990
聽著
Listen.

184
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,660
我準備了一段簡短的聲明
I've prepared a short statement

185
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,290
解釋你之前為何不露面  并宣布回歸
explaining your absence and announcing your return.

186
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,460
你可以今天下午在玫瑰園發表聲明
You can deliver it in the Rose Garden this afternoon.

187
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,300
這是為了我們好
I promise you this is for both of our sakes.

188
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,740
你不明白
You don't understand...

189
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,990
請先回避
If you would, please.

190
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,090
克萊爾
Claire...

191
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,870
看著我
look at me.

192
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,420
-看著我  -出去
- Look at me. - Get out.

193
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,160
出去吧
Please get out.

194
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,920
-別管我  -你這樣不僅是自掘墳墓
- Just leave me alone. - You are not only digging your own grave,

195
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,180
還在葬送你的總統職位  別再這樣了
you are burying the presidency. Stop it.

196
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
你努努力
You can try.

197
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,970
-努努力好嗎  -不行  馬克
- Can you try? - I can't, Mark.

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,450
我做不到
I just can't.

199
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,380
我做不到
I can't.

200
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,710
別擔心
Don't worry.

201
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,120
我有計劃
I have a plan.

202
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,380
抱歉
Excuse me.

203
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,160
先生
Sir.

204
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,230
沒問題吧
We're good here?

205
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,930
好  謝謝
Yeah. Thank you.

206
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,180
是多疑還是應當
Was it paranoia or is it due diligence?

207
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,720
你說呢  馬克
You tell me, Mark.

208
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,160
我們剛剛見識了這個賤人多有能耐
We both just lived through what that bitch is capable of.

209
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,550
肯定是出了什么問題
Something is definitely wrong.

210
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,970
她...
She...

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,080
喝咖啡嗎
Coffee?

212
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,340
她連說話都缺乏條理
I mean, she can't even put two sentences together.

213
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,650
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

214
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,700
我從來沒見過她這樣  她一團亂
I've never seen her like this. She's a mess.

215
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,850
那么
Well...

216
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,200
不管怎樣  這改變不了我們的處境
Either way, that doesn't change where we are.

217
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,630
還有  馬克
And, Mark...

218
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,220
康威垮掉后
when Conway imploded,

219
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,510
我們發現你有些
we recognized that you were a little squea--

220
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,600
太過謹慎  沒有立即上位
squeamish about stepping in.

221
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,770
我們很欣賞這一點
And we appreciate that.

222
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,350
但現在是時候了
But it's time.

223
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,560
你會成為一個偉大的總統的
You'll make a great president.

224
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,270
我們會確保的
We'll see to that.

225
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,030
等等  我們把話說明白
Now, wait, wait. Let's be clear, okay?

226
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,760
我知道我們一直在狠狠打壓她
I know we've been hitting her pretty hard,

227
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,460
但我不能允許再對她下一次手
but I can't condone another attempt.

228
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,950
-我做不到  -冷靜
- I can't. - Calm down.

229
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,110
天啊  馬克  說真的
My God, Mark. I mean, really.

230
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,840
還有其他辦法
There are other ways.

231
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,720
好  我們是要彈劾她
Okay, so we're talking about impeachment

232
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,380
還是國會政府
or a congressional government?

233
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,260
第25修正案第四款
25th Amendment, Section 4.

234
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,240
從來沒人用過
Which has never been used.

235
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,220
是為了迅速扼殺信心危機
It's built for speed, intended to smother a crisis of confidence.

236
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,900
讓民眾安心
Reassure the public.

237
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,660
讓世界安心
Reassure the world

238
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,140
美國政府還能繼續運作
that continuity remains at the American government,

239
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,930
就算總統變得...
even if a president becomes...

240
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,800
-無法履行他的職責  -她的職責
- Unable to fulfill his duties. - Her duties.

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,270
-前提是她無法勝任  -她現在確實無法勝任
- It requires her to be unfit. - And she is.

242
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,340
而且
I mean...

243
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,120
我們的律師已經查過了
our lawyers have already looked into this.

244
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,110
她只要能力不足就行
She only needs to be deficient.

245
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,700
法律寫得模棱兩可  可以變通
The language is vague and accommodating.

246
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,530
馬克  如果你對此
Mark, if you have any doubt about this

247
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,090
-有所顧慮  -繼續說
- at all-- - I'm just listening.

248
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
內閣聽命于你
The Cabinet is yours.

249
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,400
你在參眾兩院都有關系
You have relationships inside the Senate, the House,

250
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,390
兩黨也都有人脈
on both sides of the aisle.

251
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,030
非常合適
It's a natural fit.

252
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,330
但這事必須做得
But the thing has to cascade with--

253
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,370
天衣無縫
Precision.

254
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,030
先由副總統和內閣多數成員
A chain reaction beginning with a letter to Congress,

255
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,200
聯名寫信給國會
signed by the vice president

256
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,960
建議彈劾我
and a majority of his Cabinet,

257
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,130
然后形成連鎖反應
recommending my removal from office.

258
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,440
我怎么會猜到他們的招數
And how do I know that's what they'll try to do?

259
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,400
因為第25條就是沖我來的
Because the 25th gets personal.

260
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,900
比爾喜歡我做落難少女
Bill likes me being the damsel in distress.

261
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,780
想得美吧
He wishes I were.

262
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,230
你去哪兒
Where you headed?

263
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,490
我在北方有家人
I have family up north.

264
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,680
哪兒
Where?

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,180
北方
North.

266
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,050
凱茜的姐姐還在科德角嗎
Cathy's sister still on the Cape?

267
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,660
在海恩尼斯  是吧
Hyannis, right?

268
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,760
很好
It's good.

269
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,360
家人很重要
Family's important.

270
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,050
尤其是在艱難時刻
Especially during trying times--

271
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,580
我也想請你進來  但我真的...
I'd invite you in, but I really--

272
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,740
有些事我總想不通
There's still something that I can't get straight.

273
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,870
你再跟我說一遍吧  當時
If we could go through it one more time. So...

274
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,720
她被一輛車接去醫生那兒
She was picked up by car to be taken to the doctor.

275
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,360
她不太舒服
She wasn't feeling well.

276
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,670
直到她發生栓塞前你一直跟她在一起
You were with her the whole time leading up to the embolism?

277
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,370
斯坦普先生  夠了
Mr. Stamper, enough!

278
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,610
我只想弄清怎么回事
I'm just trying to understand what happened.

279
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,080
你別再來纏著我了
I don't need you coming around here anymore.

280
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,920
你清楚是怎么一回事
You know exactly what happened.

281
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,720
也知道驗尸結果  事情就是這樣
You have the coroner's conclusions. And that's that.

282
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,220
我還在哀悼我妻子
I'm in mourning for my wife,

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,600
我不想再提起她生命的最后時刻
and I'm not reliving the final moments of her life anymore.

284
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,560
不想跟你提
Not with you.

285
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,390
我覺得你妻子是被謀殺的
I think your wife was murdered.

286
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,920
我要關門了
I'm closing the door now.

287
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,460
-喂  -道格  我是弗萊德·安博格
- Hello. - Doug. Fred Amburg here.

288
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,770
-這是誰的電話  -我的
- Whose phone is this? - This one's mine.

289
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,940
我剛出來
I just got out.

290
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,140
我才知道
I had no idea.

291
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
我今早還跟科爾通過話
I talked to Cole this morning.

292
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,220
我聽說了件我們那位心理醫生的事
Heard an interesting thing about our esteemed shrink.

293
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,470
他休假了  事假
You know, that sabbatical, leave,

294
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,230
去旅行了  隨你怎么說
walkabout, whatever you want to call it.

295
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,680
你在找他  是吧
You are looking for him, aren't you?

296
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,920
對
Yes.

297
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,650
他在弗吉尼亞州的一間小屋
He's in a cabin down in Virginia.

298
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,240
給
Here you go.

299
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,730
我可以...
Would you mind if I...?

300
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,340
謝謝
Thanks.

301
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,500
喂
Oh, hello?

302
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,010
別說話  別開口  等著
Don't say another word. Don't speak. Just wait.

303
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,490
抱歉  我拐錯彎  跑進樓梯井了
My apologies, I took a wrong turn and wound up in some stairwell.

304
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,080
我們時間不多  得趕回樓上
We don't have much time until we have to get back upstairs.

305
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,890
瑪茜最初跟我提這個想法時
When Marcy first came to me with this proposition,

306
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,090
豪不夸張地說  我震驚了
I was stunned, to say the least.

307
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,430
直到近來
Until recently I--

308
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,820
我才...我沒想到事情會這么糟
I don't know. I didn't realize how truly bad things were.

309
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,170
但趕總統下臺  我的天啊
But unseat the president? Jesus Christ.

310
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,320
總統是我的朋友
President's my friend.

311
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,060
雖說我擔心她的精神狀況
And while I worry about her mental state,

312
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,540
但我更擔心國家的狀況
I worry about the state of this nation more.

313
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,130
副總統先生  我很敬佩你
Mr. Vice President, I admire you greatly.

314
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,470
但我不習慣做這種事
But I'm not used to this kind of thing.

315
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,430
背地里謀算
Back rooms, after hours.

316
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,140
我們得一萬個小心
We need to take every precaution.

317
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,880
光是過來就很危險了
And yet we're still at risk just by being here.

318
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,070
抱歉
I'm sorry,

319
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,990
但我相信總統一職的神圣性
but I believe in the sanctity of the office of the presidency.

320
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,640
所以我們才聚在這里
And that's exactly why we're here.

321
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,900
你這是讓我們背棄誓言
You're asking us to betray an oath.

322
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,640
我是讓大家吐露心聲
I'm asking you to speak your mind.

323
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,660
這里的每個人齊心協力
A concentrated effort, all of us in this room.

324
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,160
我們或許救不了總統
We may not be able to save the president,

325
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,710
但或許救得了我們的政府
but we may just be able to save our administration.

326
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,520
第25條不僅要看準時機
The 25th is not just about timing.

327
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,470
還要絕對保密
It's about secrecy.

328
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,460
參議院一向守不住秘密
And the Senate hasn't kept a secret--

329
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,550
厄爾  感謝你提到這一點
Earl, I appreciate that.

330
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,130
眾議院已在我掌控之中  參議院也交給我
I have the House, and I'll take care of the Senate.

331
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,370
我會起草一封信
I'll prepare a letter

332
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,760
詳細列出總統的瀆職
detailing the president's dereliction of duty,

333
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,650
向國會和后世解釋清楚
laying out a case for Congress and for posterity.

334
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,300
等時機成熟  就會通知大家
And when the time comes, you'll all be notified.

335
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,790
我們都是愛國者
Look, we're all patriots here.

336
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,690
我們最牽掛的  我們唯一牽掛的  必須是
Our first concern, our only concern, has got to be...

337
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,350
國家的生死存亡
the survival of our nation.

338
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,690
該死
Fuck!

339
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,630
坐下吧  深呼吸
Sit and take a deep breath.

340
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,780
坐下
Sit down.

341
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,710
羅森醫生  坐下
Dr. Rosen, sit down.

342
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,240
你怎么進來的
How did you get in here?

343
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,560
我想  你在這兒是因為你很痛苦
I'm assuming you're here because you're suffering.

344
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,420
如果不是為佐伊·巴恩斯
And if it's not over Zoe Barnes,

345
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,390
就是為另一個被你毀掉的人
it's over some other soul that you've torn apart.

346
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,350
不對
No.

347
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,020
你想  我在這兒
You're assuming I'm here

348
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,270
是因為我發現了你拿走了我什么東西
because I figured out what you took from me.

349
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,800
-拿走  -沒給我
- Took? - Kept.

350
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,090
所有個人物品都應該在出院時歸還原主
All personal property should have been returned upon release.

351
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,450
你說得對  是應該
You're right. It should have.

352
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,550
專業人士竟然做出這種事
There's no accounting for the behavior of supposed professionals.

353
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,930
我曾經在社交場合遇到過一個心理醫生
I once met this psychologist, socially,

354
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,880
她跟我說
who told me about

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,550
她曾經給同僚們辦了一次派對
a party that she hosted once for a group of her peers.

356
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,480
請了一屋子的心理醫生
It was just a roomful of shrinks.

357
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,850
那晚派對結束后  她在打掃
At the end of the night, she was cleaning up,

358
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,650
走進衛生間
she went into the bathroom

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,940
發現她的某個同事把屎
and she saw that one of her colleagues had smeared shit

360
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,180
糊了一墻
all over the bathroom wall.

361
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,690
什么變態會做出那種事
Now, what kind of fucked up person would do something like that?

362
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,440
看來傳言是真的
Well, I guess it's true what they say.

363
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,470
心理醫生才是最變態的
That shrinks are the most fucked up of all.

364
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,150
那種行為很是暴力
Such a violence to that act.

365
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,540
但暴力很有趣
But violence is a funny thing.

366
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,590
其實受害者記得最清楚的
You know, it's not so much the physical pain

367
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,290
不是肉體上的疼痛
that can victims can remember.

368
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,020
而是當時的感覺
It's the feelings around it.

369
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,260
那種恐懼
The fear.

370
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,010
在哪  你扣下的遺囑在哪  你放哪了
Where is it? The will you intercepted? Where is it?

371
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,910
已經不在我這兒了
I don't have it anymore.

372
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,780
不在我這兒
I don't have it!

373
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,760
里面寫了什么
What was in it?

374
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,190
他把一切都留給了你
He left you everything.

375
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,340
天啊
God...

376
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,920
拿著吧
Take it.

377
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,050
謝謝
Thank you.

378
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,540
我當時就覺得那么問很奇怪
I thought it was a strange question.

379
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,470
什么
What?

380
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,300
你問我弗蘭西斯·安德伍德留給我什么了
When you asked me what Francis Underwood had given me.

381
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,450
遺囑的結語就是這樣的
That's how the will ends.

382
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,780
"記住我最后給你的那樣東西"
"Remember the last thing I gave you."

383
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,750
別給她打電話  否則我會回來的
Don't call her or I'll be back.

384
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
希望你能搞清楚自己的問題  醫生
Hope you figure out your problems, Doctor.

385
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,670
拿走吧
Take it.

386
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,790
想要的話  就送你了
If you want it, it's yours.

387
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,710
你想沒想過  自己過的是別人的生活
Do you ever wonder if you're living somebody else's life?

388
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,820
你過的是誰的生活  簡
Whose life are you living, Jane?

389
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,540
我在問你呢
Not me. You.

390
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,770
你好像飽受身份困擾
You seem to be struggling with your identity.

391
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,330
希望這樣說現任總統不會太...
If that's not too impertinent to say to a...

392
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,150
冒昧
sitting president.

393
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,570
過來陪我換睡衣吧
Come keep me company while I put my jammies on.

394
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,350
幫我一下
Please.

395
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,040
你在葬禮上佯裝順從
Your little show of compliance at the funeral

396
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,180
卻和維克多私下達成協議
as you made your side deal with Victor.

397
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,540
讓我不禁想
Makes me wonder.

398
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,860
現在呢
And now what?

399
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,330
你現在演的是哪一出
What do you call this show?

400
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,840
怎樣在短短三周內讓三億兩千三百萬人都反對你
How to turn 323 million people against you in three short weeks?

401
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,060
恭喜  克萊爾
Congratulations, Claire.

402
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,880
你現在讓所有人頭疼
You've become a problem for everybody.

403
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,030
還有
And...

404
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,950
你要知道
Just so you know,

405
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,520
敘利亞可能無可挽回了
Syria may be too far gone.

406
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,260
告訴我該怎么辦  簡
Tell me what to do, Jane.

407
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,430
我今晚參加了一個活動
I was at an event tonight.

408
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,380
通常  總統都會參加
An event the president usually attends.

409
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,700
今晚過得如何
And how was that evening?

410
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,060
正在形成的風暴很難對付
The storm that's gathering is a rough one.

411
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,670
你覺得他們什么時候會動手
When you think they'll strike?

412
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,950
我不知道
I have no idea.

413
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,000
有點晚了
It's late.

414
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,070
我正是這意思
That's exactly what I'm saying.

415
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,070
我想我該搬出去了
I think I should move out.

416
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,650
我理解
I understand.

417
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,400
你再這么下去  總統女士
Stick to this course, Madam President,

418
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,850
那么...
and...

419
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,700
座無虛席呢
Full house.

420
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,830
你們想必是想聽不同的答案
You must be looking for different answers

421
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,000
這相同的問題已經問了...
to the same questions we've been going over for the last--

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,020
24天
Now, 24 days.

423
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,200
而總統仍然沒離開官邸
And the president still hasn't left the residence.

424
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,370
-我只能說...  -凱爾茜  拜托
- And this is where I say-- - Kelsey, come on.

425
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,550
目前  與俄羅斯所達成的旨在維系
For now, the ground-breaking accord with Russia,

426
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,430
敘利亞公正且持久的和平的突破性協議
which aims for a just and lasting peace in Syria,

427
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,500
就足以說明一切
speaks for itself.

428
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,410
那么
So,

429
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,010
除非各位還有其他問題
unless there are any more questions,

430
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,740
應該說新的問題  請說
or shall I say new questions? Yes.

431
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,560
真正操盤的人是不是副總統
Isn't the vice president really the one running the show,

432
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,780
實質上掌控了總統實權
essentially acting as president?

433
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,400
有些內閣成員也這么說
There are members of the cabinet who are saying as much.

434
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,610
首先  提及白宮事宜時
Well, firstly, I would refrain from using the word "show,"

435
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,500
不建議使用"操盤"這種字眼
when it comes to the White House.

436
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,220
那么  今天就到此結束
And-- yeah. That's all for today.

437
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,340
謝謝
Thank you.

438
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,170
你確定不餓嗎
Are you sure you're not hungry?

439
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,990
湯還不錯
The soup is quite nice.

440
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,560
我不知道你怎么能...
I don't know how you can--

441
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,860
吃得下嗎
Eat?

442
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,590
不  我...
No, I'm...

443
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,710
很高興見你恢復食欲
glad to see you're eating.

444
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,010
總統女士  情勢已經無法挽救
Madam President, it's beyond repair.

445
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,370
到了這個地步  你明白吧
You understand that, at this point?

446
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,370
你失去了國會的支持
You've lost the Hill.

447
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,880
失去了內閣的支持
You've lost your cabinet.

448
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,340
失去了國家的支持
You've lost the country.

449
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,870
你輸了
You've lost.

450
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,240
你所屬的政黨也找不到理由支持你
Your own party can't even find a reason to support you.

451
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,910
我懇求你
I entreat you--

452
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,510
懇求我
You entreat me?

453
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,870
辭職
Resign.

454
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,950
你這是以副總統的身份對我說嗎
And are you speaking to me as vice president?

455
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,960
我以一個人的身份對你說
I'm speaking to you as a person.

456
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,110
就說是
Blame it on...

457
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,510
弗蘭西斯的死帶來的壓力  總統職務的重荷
the strain after Francis' death, the strain of the office itself.

458
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,670
說辭總是有  但你現在最好的結果
Language can be found, but the best you can hope for now...

459
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,510
就是帶著尊嚴離開
is a dignified exit.

460
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,070
他最令人動容之處  在于他沒法不如此
What's so moving about him is he can't help himself.

461
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,220
如此言行得體  充滿人性
He can't help being decent. Human.

462
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,230
他那光榮的缺陷
His glorious flaw.

463
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,110
這意味著
What this means is

464
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,060
他們會行動的
they're gonna go through with it.

465
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
不  馬克
No, Mark.

466
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,160
我哪也不去
I'm staying right where I am.

467
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,290
給你兩分鐘
You got two minutes.

468
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,900
這不是瑞秋·波斯納
That's not Rachel Posner.

469
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,300
是嗎
Is it?

470
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,250
你認識瑞秋·波斯納
You knew Rachel Posner.

471
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,990
應該
I mean...

472
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,630
算是吧
yeah, I guess.

473
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,870
你和她熟到可以把她名字給別人
Enough to use her name for someone else's ID?

474
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,840
這就是你做的生意吧
That's what you do, isn't it?

475
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,350
給下位客戶前一個人的名字
Kind of pay the names forward?

476
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,230
不是
No.

477
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,640
你給了瑞秋什么假名
What name did you give Rachel?

478
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,700
我不記得了
I don't remember.

479
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,190
我說真的
I don't.

480
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,720
你最后一次見到她是什么時候
When did you last see her?

481
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,980
饒了我吧
Come on.

482
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,940
可能幾年前吧
Couple of years ago or something.

483
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,890
在她上班的地方
It was where she worked.

484
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,220
她死了嗎
Is she dead?

485
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,400
-跟我沒關系  -你是不是幫兇
- I got nothing to do with that. - Did you help kill her?

486
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,040
我在跟你說話
I'm talking to you.

487
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,370
別這樣  我要找律師
Man. I want my lawyer.

488
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,650
你認識
Do you know...

489
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,450
道格·斯坦普嗎
Doug Stamper?

490
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,070
不認識
No.

491
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,880
你給了她什么假名
What name did you give her?

492
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,700
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

493
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,510
麗莎
Lisa.

494
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,950
-麗莎  -嗯  麗莎  凱茜
- Lisa? - Yeah. Lisa Cassie.

495
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,460
-麗莎·凱茜  -凱茜  麗莎
- Lisa Cassie? - Cassie, Lisa.

496
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,260
-對  -麗莎和凱茜
- Yeah. - Lisa and Cassie?

497
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
你回到白宮了
Back at the White House.

498
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,120
你住進了他的房間
You took his room.

499
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,410
更寬敞些
It's bigger.

500
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,040
你能告訴我為什么
Can you tell me why

501
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,170
我們非要現在在這里見面嗎
it was so important that we meet here and now?

502
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,080
老實說  我是希望能在白宮西樓會面的
Honestly, I was hoping we could meet in the West Wing.

503
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,720
我已經在這里足不出戶...
I haven't left the residence in...

504
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,610
我相信你還是看新聞的
Well, I'm sure you still read the news.

505
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,690
而且你的赦免
And your pardon...

506
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,720
沒有幫到我或弗蘭西斯
hasn't helped me or Francis.

507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,570
我在這里感覺不舒服
I don't feel comfortable here.

508
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,190
不管你在這里有什么不好的回憶  道格
Whatever bad memories you may have, Doug...

509
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,390
有時候要花很長時間才能理解
sometimes it takes a long time to understand

510
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,650
是誰真正傷害了我們
who's the real source of our harm.

511
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,240
我沒能讓你相信我
And I have failed to make you trust me,

512
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,310
這太遺憾了
and that's a shame.

513
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,380
我相信我所了解的
I trust what I know.

514
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,310
你有很多敵人  他們低估了你
You have enemies, and they underestimate you.

515
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,700
你認為他們會怎樣攻擊我
And how do you think they'll come at me?

516
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,070
科爾議員對你說什么了嗎
Has Congressman Cole said anything to you?

517
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,390
我覺得她還活著
I think she's alive.

518
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,770
凱茜·杜蘭特
Cathy Durant.

519
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,830
我不知道她在哪里或在搞什么事  但是...
I don't know where she is or what she's up to, but...

520
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,060
我知道你會想知道的
I knew you'd want to know.

521
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,080
我想讓你知道一件事情
I want you to know something.

522
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,380
弗蘭西斯死在這間屋子里
Francis died in this room.

523
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,420
我告訴大家他死在我床上
I told everyone it was in my bed.

524
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,740
但其實就在這片地板上
But it was right there on the floor.

525
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,480
不管是誰殺了他
Whoever killed him.

526
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,870
我遺漏了什么嗎
Am I missing something?

527
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,750
殺了他的人
Whoever killed him

528
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,120
將得到她或他應有的下場
will get what she or he deserves.

529
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,850
時機決定了宇宙的形狀
Timing decided the shape of the universe.

530
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,460
誰說的
Who said that?

531
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,490
我
Me.

532
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,040
地獄是明白得太晚的真理
Hell is truth seen too late.

533
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,680
這是你說的嗎
Did you say that?

534
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,510
托馬斯·霍布斯
Thomas Hobbes.

535
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,040
厄舍
Usher...

536
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,260
你下注
your bet.

537
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,710
-我要看牌  謝謝  -別這么禮貌
- I'll check, please. - Don't be polite.

538
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,190
我以前和你玩過
I played with you before.

539
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,770
我知道你有好牌
I know you're holding.

540
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,030
比爾  你確定嗎
Bill, you sure?

541
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,920
我可以在下一手分牌給你
I can deal you in on the next hand.

542
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,430
-我不玩  -她真瘋了嗎
- I don't play. - Is it true she's a basket case?

543
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,060
或者就是一個普通的民主黨人
Or just a plain old Democrat.

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,410
我會把信準備好
So, I'll have the letter.

545
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,200
要看我的牌得再加一百
That's a hundred to see mine.

546
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,750
等時間到了  漢克
And when it comes time, Hank,

547
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,860
我不想最后
I don't want to end up

548
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,360
在參議院里  一手拿著一張紙
on the Senate floor with a piece of paper in one hand--

549
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,860
另一只手上只有你的蛋
And your balls in the other?

550
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,540
我們都是過來人
We've all been there.

551
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,090
別說我的蛋了
Just keep my balls out of it.

552
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,080
厄舍  你要讓我去拉票
Usher, you want me to whip,

553
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,030
卻不讓我告訴參議員們他們在為什么投票
but you don't want me to tell my senators what they're voting on.

554
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,200
還要不經過討論就通過
And pass without debate.

555
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,130
我不跟
I'm out.

556
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,650
至少告訴我他們會得到什么
At least tell me what they're getting.

557
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,440
白宮的新主人
A new resident in the White House.

558
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,140
總統先生
Well, Mr. President.

559
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,860
你是跟還是不跟
Are you in or are you out?

560
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,180
我跟
I call.

561
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,720
還有...
And...

562
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,400
加注500
bump you 500.

563
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,040
我永遠不會稱這里為敵方領地
I would never call this enemy territory.

564
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,660
聽起來可能有點奇怪
It might sound quaint,

565
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,070
但我相信共和制
but I believe in the Republic.

566
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,300
感謝你的到來
Well, thank you for coming.

567
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,500
這種媒體的攻擊
It's not sustainable.

568
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,800
是持續不下去的
This media onslaught.

569
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,830
不知你是否可以考慮叫你的狗收手
I wonder if you'd consider calling off the dogs.

570
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,630
就暫緩一下  幾天就行
All I'm asking for is a pause. Couple of days or so.

571
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,820
你恭維我了  總統女士
You flatter me, Madam President.

572
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,000
但我的能力也不過如此
But my reach only goes so far.

573
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,830
看來他們想讓你辭職
It seems they want you to resign.

574
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,510
是誰想
Who's they?

575
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,480
誰不想
Who isn't?

576
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,060
請原諒我的直言不諱
Pardon my bluntness.

577
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,740
不  我喜歡直言不諱  這樣節省時間
Oh, no, I enjoy bluntness. Saves time.

578
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,160
但我是否應該因身為女性而辭職
But should I resign for the high crime of being a female?

579
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,580
我認為有比那更深刻的原因
Oh, I think the reasoning goes deeper than that.

580
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,270
我認為...
I think...

581
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,600
這只是我個人的觀點
and this is just my perspective,

582
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,790
-如果你想聽的話  -請盡管說
- if you want to hear it. - Oh, please.

583
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,250
我們家族與你之間的爭斗
Dueling agendas between my family,

584
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,280
已經開始自行發展了
and, well, you, have taken on their own life.

585
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,510
從某種意義上說  你丈夫又不肯放過你
And in some sense, your husband just won't leave you alone,

586
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,210
是吧
will he?

587
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,420
我無法改變過去
I can't change history.

588
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,290
不過有時候你肯定希望自己能
I'll bet sometimes you'd like to.

589
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,860
你不想抹掉他嗎
Wouldn't you like to erase him?

590
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,030
總統女士
Madam President...

591
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,220
你已故的丈夫跟我媽媽說了許多事
your dead husband told my mother things.

592
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,340
你不想讓全世界知道的事
Things you don't want the world to know.

593
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,400
我覺得  一個死人的話沒什么用
A dead man's words are worthless as far as I'm concerned.

594
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,810
要是他所說的能被證實就不一樣了
Not when his claims can be verified.

595
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,420
不過有辦法讓關于某個人的記憶消失
It's possible to make the memory of a person disappear.

596
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,720
用數字手段
Digitally.

597
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,070
至少能把記憶移得遠遠的
Move them far into the background, anyways.

598
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,990
總是有方法的
There are ways.

599
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,940
算法
Algorithms.

600
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,830
你是個非常自信的年輕人
You're a very confident young man.

601
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,570
你的作為也能消失
Even your deeds can go away.

602
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,700
我能讓我們更容易通力合作
Now, I can make it easier for all of us to work together.

603
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,550
你媽媽知道你來了嗎
Does your mother know you're here?

604
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,980
不知道
No.

605
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,730
就是好奇一問  你最早的記憶是什么
Just out of curiosity, what's your first memory?

606
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,790
關于她的最早的記憶
Your first memory of her?

607
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,090
這個問題好奇怪
That's a strange question.

608
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,160
我就是好奇
I was just curious.

609
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,110
我有一張她接住我的照片
I have a photograph of her catching me.

610
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,460
我媽媽把我扔到空中
My mother had thrown me up into the air,

611
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,360
我舅舅用他的新尼康相機抓拍到了那一幕
and my uncle snapped a picture on his new Nikon camera.

612
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,800
她喜氣洋洋
She's beaming.

613
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,140
特別高興
Gleeful.

614
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,230
我一直珍藏著那張照片
I treasure that photo.

615
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,040
我記憶中的她就是這樣的
It's how I like to think of her.

616
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,840
幫我個忙
Do me a favor.

617
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,590
問問安奈特
Ask Annette--

618
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,710
問問你媽媽  你是從哪來的
Ask your mother where you came from.

619
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,080
天怎么還沒黑
It's still light out?

620
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,900
你真是讓人大汗淋漓
You're very dehydrating.

621
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,940
我知道
I know, I know.

622
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,420
你想談談協議
You want to talk about the deal.

623
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,760
你把我排除在外  簡
You excluded me, Jane.

624
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,730
等塵埃落定  我會滿足你的
When the dust settles, I'll give you what you want.

625
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,480
我沒懷疑過你的本事
Never doubted your value.

626
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880
你見到我的手機了嗎
Have you seen my phone?

627
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,680
在衛生間
It's in the restroom.

628
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,630
該死
Shit.

629
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,100
你是不是動了我的...
Did you do something to my--

630
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,290
我去環保署了
I went to the EPA.

631
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,070
什么都沒有
There is nothing.

632
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,030
天啊
Jesus Christ.

633
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,460
有些人  混進了城里
There are people walking around this town,

634
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,070
穿著普通  裝成是本地人
dressed down, acting like they belong.

635
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,310
但我知道他們不是
But I know they don't.

636
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,290
你被威脅了嗎
Have you been threatened?

637
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,700
拜托  他們不會蠢到威脅我的
Come on, they're too smart for that.

638
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,540
所以他們在跟蹤你
Well, so they're following you.

639
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,510
但如果什么都沒有
But if there's nothing,

640
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,930
-那就...  -我有截圖
- then there's-- - I have screenshots...

641
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,420
郵件往來的截圖
of the e-mail chain.

642
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,180
因為他們做了錯事
'Cause it's wrong what they did.

643
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,960
因為我太傻了
'Cause I'm so stupid.

644
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,650
傻到相信在這個操蛋的世界里
So stupid to believe in doing the right thing

645
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,490
堅持正義
in this totally fucked up world.

646
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,320
其中有一封郵件是比爾·謝潑德的辦公室發的
There's an e-mail from Bill Shepherd's office in the chain.

647
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,950
我說過  他們早就知道
I told you. They knew.

648
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,900
他們早就知道會出人命
They knew somebody was gonna die.

649
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,810
我得走了
I gotta go.

650
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,250
等等
Wait.

651
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
怎么了
What?

652
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,510
你的手機
Your phone.

653
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,120
-手機怎么了  -我信不過
- What about it? - I don't trust it.

654
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,680
我丟掉了我的手機
I got rid of mine.

655
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,490
我發誓  感覺像是他們在跟蹤我的手機
I swear, it felt like they were following my phone

656
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,370
而不是我
and not me.

657
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,190
-怎么會  -我得走了
- How? - Look, I gotta go.

658
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,840
我會再聯系你的
I'll reach out to you.

659
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,150
-好嗎  -不  你說什么...
- Okay? - No. What--

660
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,930
她在沙特阿拉伯的某個地方
She's somewhere in Saudi Arabia.

661
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,070
女士  她落入敵人手中  對我們風險極大
Ma'am, she poses a significant risk in enemy hands.

662
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,040
你知道的
You know that.

663
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,780
美國不與恐怖分子談判
The United States does not negotiate with terrorists.

664
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,260
不用談判  特戰司令部在制定幾種行動計劃
No negotiations. Options are being drawn up at SOCOM.

665
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,220
但必須有行政命令才能執行
But nothing can happen without an executive order.

666
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,260
那...
Well, then.

667
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,420
等你當了總統  再發布行政命令好了
That's gonna have to happen when you're president.

668
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,620
簡被捕  誰的秘密都不安全
No one's secrets are safe with Jane in captivity.

669
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,230
你可能會比我更擔心這一點
That may be more concerning for you than it is for me.

670
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,760
捅了馬蜂窩  該開始推進計劃了
Kicking the hornet's nest. Time to move this thing along.

671
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,480
-你個自大的混蛋  -冷靜
- You arrogant little prick. - Please, just calm down.

672
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,810
你以為我發現不了嗎
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

673
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,640
你罵人的話  我可要走了
I'm not staying if there's name-calling.

674
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,960
我怎么罵都不過分  安妮
There's not enough names to call him, Annie.

675
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,510
真是蠢得清奇
Such stunning stupidity.

676
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,010
頭韻押得真妙  比爾舅舅
Nice alliteration, Uncle Bill.

677
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,500
這條毛巾都比你聰明
This towel is smarter than you.

678
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,260
這扇窗都比你聰明
This window is smarter than you.

679
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,540
這塊地毯都比你聰明
This rug is smarter than you.

680
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,700
-你好  賽斯  -你好  先生
- Hello, Seth. - Hello, sir.

681
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,620
賽斯都比你聰明
Seth is smarter than you!

682
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,880
我眉毛上的汗
The sweat on my brow

683
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,890
-都比你聰明  鄧肯  -我的天啊
- is smarter than you, Duncan. - Jesus H. Christ,

684
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,320
-行了吧  -因為我眉毛上的汗
- spare us. - Because sweat on my brow,

685
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,780
至少都清楚不能擅自去見
would have at least known not to pay an unsanctioned visit

686
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,510
-美國總統  -放開他
- to the President of the United States. - Get your hands off him.

687
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,710
我知道你不舒服  但
I know you're not feeling well, but...

688
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,610
這話是什么意思
Well, what the hell is that supposed to mean, anyway?

689
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,830
你不能這樣
You can't act like this.

690
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,220
我只是想幫忙  是她請我去的
You know, I was trying to help. She invited me and--

691
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,820
那你就去了  真他媽白癡
And you went, like a fucking idiot--

692
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,360
我想成為溝通橋梁
I wanted to be a bridge.

693
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,890
閉嘴  你們倆都閉嘴吧
Shut up, both of you, just shut up.

694
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,130
天啊  我們有什么沒為你做到的嗎
God, is there anything we haven't done for you?

695
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,170
家人之間就該如此
Well, you know, that's what people do for family.

696
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,820
-為彼此不惜一切  -聽著  你不該去的
- Anything. - Listen, you shouldn't have gone.

697
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,510
她不值得信任  我跟你說過無數次了
She can't be trusted, as I've told you a million times.

698
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,400
他壞了我們的時機
He jeopardized our timing.

699
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,200
他壞了我們對她下手的時機
He jeopardized our timing with her!

700
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,700
我再也受不了男人吵架了
I can't stand the sound of male arguing anymore.

701
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,480
她讓我問你件事
You know, she told me to ask you something.

702
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,830
她讓我問你我從哪來的
She told me to ask you where I came from.

703
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,460
賽斯  賽斯
Seth. Seth!

704
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,160
16周
Sixteen weeks.

705
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,050
她跟丈夫懷的那個孩子
The one from the pregnancy with her husband.

706
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,790
安妮  這的確不是好主意
Annie, I do think it'd be a mistake.

707
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,160
賽斯  確認下
Seth, confirm it.

708
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,030
-沒錯  16周  -她丈夫告訴我的
- That's right. Sixteen weeks. - Her husband told me.

709
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,360
但你不知道事態會怎樣發展  是吧
But you don't know how it's gonna play. Okay?

710
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,050
可能事與愿違  讓人們同情她
It could backfire. Get her sympathy.

711
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,500
-誰會等到16周  -我們無法控制輿論發展
- Who waits 16 weeks? - The narrative can't be controlled--

712
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,350
什么人會這么做  人們會談論這個
What kind of person, that's what people will be talking about.

713
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,860
給馬克打電話  立刻開始
Let's get Mark on the phone. We start this now.

714
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,400
我們就叫她麗薩
Only "Lisa" is what we called her.

715
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,700
她在中心市場的同事
The lady at Central Market, where she worked,

716
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,680
說你好幾次去找過她
said you stopped by a few times asking for her.

717
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,610
她欠我們錢  但
She owed us some money, but...

718
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,640
她死了嗎
She dead?

719

不知道
I don't know.

720
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,400
里面沒多少東西
There's not much in there.

721
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,400
幾封信
Some letters.

722
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,620
紙片  清單  還有
Scraps and lists and...

00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,770
照片
Picture.

724
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,870
都不值錢
Nothing, really.

725
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,890
我們國家遇到了問題
Our country has a problem right now.

726
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,130
總統
The president,

727
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,430
她無視高級顧問的建議
she has ignored the advice of her senior advisers,

728
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,150
那都是有學問  有作戰經驗的人
people who have studied and fought battles.

729
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,850
她的精神狀態讓我們陷入更糟的...
Her state of mind has left us in a weakened...

730
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,440
我們得守住陣線
We need to hold the line

731
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,730
直到國家回到正軌
till our country gets back on course.

732
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,490
這段視頻令人震驚
That is a truly stunning video.

733
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,560
對于國防部長對總統的批評
What is your reaction to the secretary of defense's critique

734
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,740

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,900
國防部長漢納是四星海軍陸戰隊將軍
Secretary Defense Hanna is a four-star Marine General

736
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,710
服役四十多年了

737
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,340
我理解他的失望
I understand his frustration.

738
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,400
據稱馬克·厄舍掌握著白宮實權
Is there any truth to the idea that Mark Usher

739
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,590
就像小布什的迪克·切尼  是真的嗎
is the Dick Cheney of this White House?

740
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,540
不  迪克·切尼只有一個
No, there is only one Dick Cheney.

741
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,730
-這話不假  -馬克·厄舍
- Okay, fair enough. - Mark Usher is

742
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,340
就是這屆政府的馬克·厄舍
the Mark Usher of this White House.

743
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,410
那你怎么定位現任副總統的角色
So, how would you characterize the vice president's role?

744
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,200
副總統受到了內閣的全力支持
The vice president has the full support of the entire cabinet.

745
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,230
那總統呢
And the president?

746
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,360
總統能為自己說話
Well, the president speaks for herself.

747
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,850
你的意思是國防部長
Are you suggesting that the Secretary of Defense

748
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,250
不是唯一不滿總統的人嗎
is not the only one who's frustrated with this president?

749
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,850
勞倫斯  這座城市充斥著流言蜚語
You know, Lawrence, this town feeds off of rumor and gossip

750
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,760
-這只會適得其反  -吃點嗎
- and it's counter-productive. - Raha?

751
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,530
這是分散注意力  我不來這套
It's a distraction. I don't work that way.

752
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,640
你不來這套  那你來哪套
You don't work that way. How do you work?

753
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,970
-你在現任總統那里來哪套  -你有電話
- How do you work with this president? - You have a call.

754
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,020
是你的總統
It's your president.

755
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,320
這屆政府無法正常運轉了嗎
Is this a dysfunctional administration?

756
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,680
我與總統的關系
My relationship with this...

757
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,090
克萊爾
Claire.

758
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,830
簡  我只想知道
Jane, I just need to know

759
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,200
他們到底什么時候動手
exactly when they're going to pull the trigger.

760
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,310
你不想回家嗎
Don't you want to come home?

761
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,770
你倒是挺開心的樣子
You look like you're having fun.

762
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,330
我認為你們是有真情的
I see real affection there.

763
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,690
當然外界也有關于我和湯姆的謠言
And, listen, there were rumors about Tom and me, of course,

764
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,420
但全都不是真的
but nothing to them.

765
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,500
他對我來說像個弟弟
He was like a brother to me.

766
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,900
總能安慰我
So comforting.

767
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,280
也正是因此  這才更讓人難過
Which is what makes this all the more difficult.

768
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,980
真相是  凱爾茜
The truth is, Kelsey...

769
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,930
是俄羅斯人殺了湯姆
the Russians killed Tom...

770
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,280
馬克·厄舍幫忙掩蓋了事實
and Mark Usher covered it up.

771
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,910
我將竭盡所能讓他為此事負責
Now, I'm doing my best to hold him accountable,

772
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,280
但我需要你的幫助
but I need your help.

773
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,860
我要你告訴聯調局
I need you to tell the FBI

774
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,690
你和湯姆的關系
about your relationship with Tom.

775
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,430
-總統女士  我...  -我懂  沒關系的
- Madam President, I-- - I know. It's fine.

776
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,910
說你倆當時在約會
You just say you were dating.

777
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,910
在談戀愛
You were in love.

778
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,140
有次在私下里
And in a private moment,

779
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,710
他向你透露了他懷疑
he told you about his suspicions regarding

780
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,810
馬克·厄舍與俄羅斯串謀
Mark Usher and his collusion with Russia.

781
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,970
而你最后一次見到他時
And the last time you saw him,

782
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,960
他正要去副總統的宅邸
he was on his way to the vice president's home

783
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,080
與他對峙
to confront him.

784
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,680
我不會讓副總統逍遙法外的
I'm not going to let the vice president get away with this.

785
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,800
你和我身為女人
You and I, as women,

786
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,660
我們必須反擊
we have to fight back.

787
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,920
我需要你和我并肩作戰
I need you by my side.

788
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,660
在我們送出信之前
And before we transmit the letter,

789
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,210
我想請所有人低下頭
I'd like to suggest we all take a moment to bow our heads

790
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,820
為我們偉大的祖國祈禱
and pray for this great nation.

791
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,140
能把信遞給我嗎
Could you pass me that letter?

792
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,520
還有  把你們的東西收好
And gather all of your things.

793
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,370
在場所有內閣成員
Every single cabinet member in this room

794
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,740
都可以走了
is dismissed.

795
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,570
你們都被解雇了
You're all fired.

796
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,160
送他們出去
Escort them out.

797
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,390
你知道
You know,

798
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,640
我從沒想過你是
I never took you for someone

799
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,880
想入主白宮的人
who wanted to get himself into the Oval.

800
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,830
不過是個四年的飯碗  幸運的話是八年
All it is, is a four year job, eight if you're lucky.

801
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,530
你在哪
Where are you?

802
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,640
什么
What?

803
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,690
好  我馬上回來
All right. I'm on my way back.

804
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,630
要是她干預簽署  那就是妨礙司法
Listen, if she prevented the signing, that's obstruction.

805
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,680
可能會使她遭彈劾
And likely, it's impeachable.

806
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,620
聽見了嗎
You hear me?

807
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,900
細節仍在傳來
Details are still coming in.

808
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,310
但是據了解  今天聯調局
But we're being told there are reports that the FBI...

809
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,610
-馬克  -收到證據顯示
- Mark. - ...has today been provided evidence...

810
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,730
-去看電視  -馬克·厄舍與俄國官員
- Get to a television. - ...that Mark Usher had quote...

811
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,130
-或是電腦  -有"情節重大
- Or a computer. - ..."significant and ongoing...

812
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,020
或是打開電臺
Or a goddamn radio.

813
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,320
且仍在持續的私下聯系"
...contact outside the logs with Russian officials."

814
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,900
這促成了總統近期所簽署的
This leading up to and during the president's

815
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,650
反應兩極化的敘利亞和平協議
recent polarizing Syrian peace deal.

816
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,110
聯調局會調查此事
The FBI's expected to look into the matter,

817
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,080
但他們尚未宣布是否會啟動
but has yet to announce whether or not they are opening

818
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,980
正式調查
an official investigation.

819
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,620
如果屬實  這將是本屆多災多難的政府
If so, this could be a catastrophic setback

820
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,260
遭遇的又一災難性挫敗
for an already-beleaguered administration.

821
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,950
在我們開始之前  我想給你一個請辭的機會
Before we begin, I'd like to offer you the chance to resign.

822
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,310
那我就不打擾你了
I'll leave you to it then.

823
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,940
我和俄羅斯從沒有過非正式聯系  從來沒有
I never had any contact with any Russians outside the logs. None.

824
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,350
1991年夏天你曾在副外交部長左爾金位于
You vacationed at Deputy Foreign Minister Zorkin's family dacha

825
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,690
-黑海的鄉間別墅度假  -二十年前的事了
- on the Black Sea in summer 1991. - That was 20 years ago.

826
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,540
我們回溯一下  從凱爾茜·斯圖爾特小姐的證詞
Let's work backwards, start with questions that have arisen

827
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,660
引起的疑問開始
after Ms. Kelsey Stewart's deposition.

828
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,670
誰
Who?

829
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:38,280
我們定位她的手機在貝爾波特的一家酒水店
We located her phone in a liquor store in Bellport.

830
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,830
她知道應用的事了
She knows about the app.

831
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,980
應該是吧
We should assume so.

832
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,870
你告訴我舅舅了嗎
Have you told my uncle yet?

833
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,220
我聯系不上他
I can't reach him.

834
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,770
我也聯系不上你母親
I can't reach your mother, either.

835
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,440
我們已經派人追蹤那位記者
We have some men tracking the journalist.

836
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,710
我們還不知道她是否取得了任何證據
But we don't even know if she has her hands on anything yet.

837
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,540
-謝潑德先生的包裹  -謝謝
- Package for Mr. Shepherd. - Oh, thank you.

838
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,380
寫著是給你的
This is addressed to you.

839
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,270
請讓我獨處一會兒
Leave me alone, please.

840
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,650
我是凱瑟琳·杜蘭特
My name is Catherine Durant.

841
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,470
今天是2017年7月18日  星期二
Today is Tuesday, July 18, 2017.

842
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,990
時間是
And the time... 

843
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,920
晚上8點37分
8:37 p.m.

844
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,480
在我開始之前  我想說
Now, before I begin, let me just say...

845
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,950
歷史必將帶給
that every punishment

846
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,630
克萊爾·安德伍德的所有懲罰
that history will surely visit upon Claire Underwood

847
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,270
都是她罪有應得
will be exactly what she deserves.

848
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,490
我萬分懊悔當初接受了她丈夫提供的
I rue the day that I accepted her husband's offer

849
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,700
國務卿一職
of secretary of state.

850
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,100
好了
Now, then...

851
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,630
我發誓我接下來絕無虛言
I hereby swear that everything I'm about to say is the truth.

852
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,450
她丈夫六小時前失蹤了
Her husband has disappeared, as of six hours ago.

853
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,060
-你還想聽嗎  -不了
- Do you want to hear any more? - No.

854
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,360
我知道后面是什么
I know the rest.

855
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,940
你覺得是俄羅斯人幫他們逃掉的嗎
Do you think the Russians got them out?

856
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,520
不  我能肯定是
Uh, no, I'm sure of it.

857
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,630
你覺得她發給其他人了嗎
Do you think she sent it to anyone else?

858
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,270
發了我們早就知道了
We would know about it by now.

859
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,300
我讓納森候命于你
I've asked Nathan to be available to you.

860
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,380
我知道你倆合作很默契
I know how well you two work with one another.

861
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,280
我們會找到她的
We'll find her.

862
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,490
道格  我還沒忘
And, Doug, I haven't forgotten

863
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,780
我們對彼此的承諾
about the promise we made to each other.

864
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,220
但愿你也沒有
I hope you haven't.

865
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,210
我剛從新墨西哥州回來
I just got back from New Mexico.

866
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,720
你把瑞秋怎么了  還是把凱茜怎么了
What did you do with Rachel? Or is it Cassie?

867
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,000
我離你只有五分鐘路程
I'm five minutes away.

868
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,360
掛了電話
Hang up the phone.

869
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,810
-道格  -掛掉
- Doug-- - Hang it up

870
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,420
不然我再不會聯系你
or you'll never hear from me again.

871
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,320
我去找你
I'll come to you.

872
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,260
納森
Nathan,

873
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:46,880
你還在聽嗎
are you still listening?

874
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,010
你相信她會保護你就太傻了
You're a fool to think she'll protect you.

875
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,540
這似乎挺合適  我回來工作后
Seems fitting, somehow, that you're the first

876
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,670
第一個見的人就是你
person I meet with after I've returned to work.

877
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,800
真是好輪回啊
There's something very full circle about it.

878
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,520
你跟你兒子談過咯
So, you've talked to your son.

879
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,370
準確說那不是你兒子
Or rather, not your son.

880
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,070
你知道那時候胎兒有多大了嗎
Do you know how developed a fetus is by then?

881
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,640
16周
Sixteen weeks is...

882
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,660
那可是成型的胎兒
beyond the beyond.

883
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,850
16周的胎兒有這么大了
That is what 16 weeks looks like.

884
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,120
這畫面在我腦海中揮之不去
That is what I can't get out of my head.

885
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,390
我在學梅樂蒂·科魯茲說話呢
I'm quoting Melody Cruz here, by the way.

886
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,140
她剛錄好視頻  明天就放
She just taped her segment, due to run tomorrow.

887
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,970
還有道具增強表現力
Visual aids and everything.

888
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,720
美國人民會首次聽到
For the first time ever, Americans will hear the story

889
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,440
膝下無子的總統
of a childless president...

890
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,550
在婚后
who had an abortion,

891
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,230
做了流產
while married,

892
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,510
打掉了16周的胎兒
at 16 weeks.

893
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,500
我就想看看你的表情
I wanted to see your face.

894
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,420
我想看你意識到弗蘭克的背叛
I wanted to see Frank's betrayal register.

895
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,830
現在誰都管不住自己的嘴
Nobody can keep their mouths shut these days.

896
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,160
秘密都帶進墳墓了還能被挖出來
Not even to-the-death secrets are safe.

897
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,280
真可恥
It's shameful.

898
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,630
但說實話  哪樣更痛苦
But honestly, what's worse?

899
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,500
他泄露了你的秘密
That he betrayed your secret

900
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,280
還是你等到16周才墮胎
or that you waited until 16 weeks?

901
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,100
你和你的黨派
You and your party.

902
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,250
就一副道貌岸然的樣子  
Your moral rectitude, how convenient.

903
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,740
你自己的話你一個字也不信  安奈特
You don't even believe half of what you say, Annette.

904
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,500
放吧
Run it.

905
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,070
科魯茲的報道
Cruz's piece.

906
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,510
放吧

{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}今年6月第一夫人梅蘭妮因腎病緊急入院做了手術
根據病情判斷  媒體以為術后三五天她就會重回公眾視野
但是沒想到梅蘭妮一直玩失蹤  長達25天沒在媒體前露面
第一夫人玩失蹤引發媒體各種猜測  有的說她乘機整容
有的說她跟老公特朗普鬧翻離宮出走...
不過25天后  她再次出現在公共場合  所有謠言都不攻自破
不過白宮也一直沒有解釋為什么第一夫人需要這么長時間閉門養病

00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:57,300
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}憲法第25修正案主要規定當總統和副總統職位出現空缺時
應怎樣啟動繼任程序  歷史上因總統副總統辭職
總統體檢麻醉等原因  共啟用過六次
本集中由副總統和內閣啟動繼任程序的第四條款  歷史上從未被使用過
特朗普上任后  他的政敵和媒體
一直對他的施政能力和各種言論進行猛烈攻擊
一些人曾在電視訪談中稱特朗普性情乖張  像瘋了一樣
精神狀態不適合履行總統職務  應該啟動第25修正案

927
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:37,300
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}18年9月21日  《紐約時報》爆料稱  司法部副部長羅森斯坦
曾私下建議啟用第25修正案  把特朗普從總統位置上趕下來
并表示自己可以暗中配戴竊聽裝置進入總統辦公室
偷錄特朗普講話  以證明總統無法控制白宮局勢
羅森斯坦本人堅決否認《紐約時報》的報道
但據說特朗普看了報道后一度想要炒掉羅森斯坦  但是后來回轉心意
在空軍一號上同羅森斯坦面對面交談后  決定不去動他
羅森斯坦是負責通俄門調查的最高級官員
如果特朗普把他炒掉  可能會引發"總統干預司法"的危機
