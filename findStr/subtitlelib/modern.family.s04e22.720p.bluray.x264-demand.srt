1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,430
真不错  我们买了辆
Oh, great. we've got the Prius that can

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,520
能预订餐厅  买电影票
make dinner reservations, buy movie tickets,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,380
预报天气的丰田普锐斯
tell us the weather.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,450
我只想要一辆门能打得开的车
I just want one that opens.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,260
也许我们该买那辆
Maybe we should've got that one.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,980
米奇尔
Mitchell!

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,100
天呐  泰迪
Oh, oh, my God! Teddy!

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,410
小卡  这是泰迪
Cam, this is Teddy.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,250
泰迪  泰迪  泰迪
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,160
医生  泰迪医生
Doc--Doctor Teddy!

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,200
泰迪是米奇在我之前的
Teddy was Mitch's one significant

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,040
一个比较重要的男友
boyfriend before me.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,480
那时米奇刚出柜
Uh, Mitch had recently just come out.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,710
就如他自己说的
And as he put it,

15
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,830
一个人如果不爱自己  就很难爱上别人
it was hard to love someone else if he couldn't love himself.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,720
我真说过那种话吗
I actually said those words?

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,200
现在倒是很难爱我自己了
Ugh. It's kind of hard to love myself right now.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,540
当年是你说  "我需要点时间
You were the one who said, "I need some time.

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,850
我疗好心伤后会再联系你的"
I'll call you when I heal more."

20
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,090
一晃都过去十年了
Ten years later...

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,470
我从没那么说过
I never said that.

22
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,830
需要时间疗伤  真是甜蜜又敏感啊
Time to heal more! That's so sweet and sensitive.

23
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,530
你为什么要扼杀掉这种天性
Why did you kill that part of yourself?

24
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,340
我这周末要为医院举办一个募捐集会
You know, I'm hosting a fund-raiser for the hospital this weekend

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,880
就在南大街的旱冰场
at that roller rink on South Main.

26
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,010
你们能来吗
Any chance you guys can come?

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,990
-当然  -可能吧
- Yeah. Absolutely. - Possibly. 

28
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,960
-我们一定去  -好吧
- We'll be there. - Okay.

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,010
太好了  周六4点见
Great. So 4:00 Saturday.

30
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,090
我真的很高兴碰到你们
I'm so glad I bumped into y'all.

31
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,100
我们也是  说再见  莉莉
Us, too. Say bye, Lily!

32
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,560
再见  莉莉
Bye, Lily.

33
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,610
我教她这样说的
I taught her that, so...

34
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,540
-再见  莉莉  -再见  泰迪
- Bye, Lily. - Bye. Bye, Teddy.

35
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,340
天呐  他人真不错
Oh, my gosh, he's great!

36
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,660
你不介意跟我前男友共度周末吗
You're okay making plans with my ex-boyfriend?

37
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,780
不介意  都过去那么久了
Um, yes. It's been a hundred years.

38
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,490
而且这也是当基佬的众多好处之一
Plus, this is one of the many benefits of being gay.

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,930
我们能跟前任做朋友
We can be friends with our exes

40
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,330
而不像直男直女们那样
without all the petty jealousy

41
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,580
饱受妒火的煎熬
straight people go through.

42
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,580
我跟胡娇算是朋友  所以
Well, I guess I am friends with Pepper, so...

43
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,900
我只跟胡娇约会过一次  就一次
I went on one date with Pepper. One.

44
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,020
你什么时候才能不提这茬
When are you gonna stop bringing it up?

45
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,360
你反应不这么激烈的时候
When you stop reacting like that.

46
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,220
爸爸爱胡娇
Daddy loves Pepper.

47
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,510
我教她的
I taught her that.

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,560
那是隐私
That's private.

49
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,220
抱歉  但为什么上面列了我们的名字
Oh, sorry. But why do you have all of our names down on a list?

50
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:50,920
为了写作文
It's for my school essay--

51
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,830
要求是在家人中选一个英雄
pick a hero in your family

52
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,000
并写出你为什么选择他
and write about why you've chosen him or her.

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,290
你还是有望入选的
You're still in the running,

54
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,760
但我不喜欢你照看我弟弟时喝葡萄酒
But I'm not loving that you're drinking wine while watching my brother.

55
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,290
是你家冰箱里有一瓶已经打开了的酒
Well, it was from an open bottle of white in your fridge, so...

56
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,290
这事关判断力  克莱尔
It's about judgment, Claire.

57
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,910
现在不是70年代了  我们都有常识的
It's not the 70's. We know better.

58
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,530
瓶子上有口红印
There was lipstick on the bottle.

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
我的宝贝们
There are my babies!

60
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,280
-晚餐怎么样  -非常完美
- How was dinner? - Perfect.

61
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,980
我吃了一份牛排  还有一些冰淇淋
I had a steak, I had some ice cream,

62
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,450
歌洛莉亚在她的鱼里发现了一根头发
Gloria found a hair in her fish,

63
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,860
结果餐厅给我们免单了
and it didn't cost us a penny!

64
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,420
也可能是我自己的头发
It might have been my own hair,

65
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,580
但杰很高兴我什么也没说
but Jay was so happy that I didn't say anything.

66
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,270
怎么了
What?

67
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,720
乖女儿  你走之前能抽点空吗
Honey, you got a second before you go?

68
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,690
我想跟你说点事
I wanna talk to you about something.

69
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,940
好吧  她为什么那样对我笑
All right. Why is she smiling at me like that?

70
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,940
是个好消息
It's good news.

71
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,810
好吧
Okay.

72
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,910
你记得我办公室的鲍勃吗
You remember Bob from my office?

73
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,530
记得啊  鲍勃叔叔  他变魔术
Yeah, uncle Bob. The one who did the trick

74
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,650
从我的耳朵里拿出一枚25分硬币
where he pulled a quarter out of my ear.

75
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,660
他后来又学了个魔术
He learned another trick.

76
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,680
从我们的养老金里掏走了5万美元
He pulled 50 grand out of our pension fund.

77
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,460
我把他炒了
Oh. I fired him.

78
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,570
但最糟糕的是
But the worst part is,

79
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,800
我当时正培养他接管公司
I was grooming him to take over the company.

80
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,720
但这事也有好的一面
But there's an upside.

81
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,590
他想让你为他工作
He wants you to work for him.

82
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,100
我知道现在只是普通工作而已
I know it's just a job right now,

83
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,160
但你知道他胸腔里不知得了什么毛病
but you know that he has this thing going on in his chest,

84
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,540
所以说不准什么时候
so you never know where

85
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,070
你就上位了  克莱尔
you're going to end up, Claire.

86
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,490
歌洛莉亚  我只是感冒而已
Gloria. Gloria, it's a cold.

87
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,530
总之  听着
Anyway, look,

88
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,360
我知道你一直想回归职场
I know you've been wanting to get back out there,

89
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,940
而我总是觉得  你要是重新开始工作
and I always kind of thought that if you did go back to work,

90
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,250
就该来跟我一块儿干
you'd come back to work with me.

91
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,790
我20年前在那里工作过半个暑假而已
I-I worked there for half a summer 20 years ago.

92
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,060
那时你干得非常棒  乖女儿
And it-- it was terrific, honey.

93
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,420
听我说  显然  我们会慢慢培养你
Listen, obviously, we'll start you out slow.

94
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,650
给你时间去重新了解这个公司
We'll give you time to re-learn about the place,

95
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,310
然后再提拔你  你是认识个关键人物的
and then maybe move you up. You know, you do know a guy.

96
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,410
他说的是他
He means him!

97
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,250
这机会太棒了  老爸  谢谢
It's a wonderful opportunity, dad. Thanks.

98
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,340
我能  我能考虑一下
Could I--could I think about it,

99
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,070
-问问菲尔的意见吗  -当然
- talk to Phil? - Oh, sure.

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,030
-我明天再打给你  -好好好
- I'll call you tomorrow. - All right. All right. All right.

101
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,300
-我儿子呢  还我儿子  -儿子还你
- Where's my boy? Give me my boy. - Here's your man.

102
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,950
小家伙还给你  真爱他
Here's your little man. Oh, love him.

103
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,930
关于这种"花"毯子我是怎么说的
What did I say about these flowered blankets for him?

104
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,890
把他扮得越来越像那位"花花公子"了
He's starting to take after Hugh Hef-nerd over there.

105
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,240
非常好笑  杰
Very amusing, Jay.

106
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,540
就让我把你的名字从这里划掉吧
Let me just get your name down here.

107
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,030
又是社区大学寄来的宣传册
Another brochure from a community college.

108
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,100
我赌这些都是老妈让他们寄来的
You know, I bet mom is having them send these.

109
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,850
是吗  你不觉得他们已经将你
Really? You don't think they've targeted you

110
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,480
锁定为必须招收的对象了吗
as a must-have recruit?

111
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,910
至少这一份没有矫揉造作的
At least this one doesn't have that fakey lunchtime shot

112
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,160
黑人亚裔妞儿印度人一起吃午餐的照片
of the black guy, asian girl, and an indian--

113
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,820
等一下  在这儿呢
Oh, wait! There it is.

114
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
那坐轮椅的孩子把其他人都逗乐了
Wow, that wheelchair kid is really cracking everybody up.

115
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,100
闺女们  你们的妈妈就要带晚餐回来了
girls, your mom's on her way home with dinner!

116
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,860
就当我从没收到过这个
I never got this.

117
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,660
要是被他看见  又要找我谈话了
If he sees it, we'll have to talk about it.

118
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
怎么了
What?

119
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,090
什么怎么了
What what?

120
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,300
如果外公打电话来  就说我不在家
If grandpa calls, I'm not home.

121
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,210
怎么了
What happened?

122
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,980
他想让我为他工作
He wants me to work for him.

123
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,430
培养我接管他的生意什么的
Like, groom me to take over or something.

124
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,770
我不知道该怎么拒绝
I don't know how I'm gonna say no.

125
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,620
你为什么要拒绝
Why would you say no?

126
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,330
你不是正要找工作吗
I thought you were looking for something.

127
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,500
而且我们也能增加收入啊
We could use the money, too,

128
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,310
尤其是万一海莉决定回去念书的话
especially if Haley decides to go back to school.

129
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,320
她还是把那些学校的宣传册都扔掉吗
Oh, is she still throwing out those college brochures?

130
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,580
刚才还扔了一份
Just tossed one now.

131
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,450
她以为是谁在负责倒垃圾啊
Who does she think empties the trash?

132
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,650
知道最惨的是什么吗
You know what really sucks?

133
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,240
那份工作本来挺不错的
That job could be great.

134
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,030
但我爸是个糟糕的老板  他太刻薄了
But my dad is a terrible boss. He is so mean.

135
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,170
"大小姐  咖啡壶是不会给自己洗澡的"
"Princess, coffeepot's not gonna wash itself."

136
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,610
原来你是从他那里学的
That's where you got that?

137
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,470
我就跟你说过一次
I said it to you one time.

138
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,800
那你直接告诉他好了  开诚布公
Well, you just gotta tell him straight up, man to man.

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,370
开诚布"母"  你的身材真棒
Woman to man. You're very shapely.

140
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,820
我知道  我会说的
I know. I will.

141
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,710
我只是非常讨厌那种感觉
It's just I hate it so much.

142
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,350
我让他非常失望的那4次
The--the four big times that I disappointed him,

143
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,310
让我很难受
it devastated me.

144
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,820
第一次是我剪短了我的头发
I mean, the first time, I cut off all my hair.

145
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,590
我去了别的州上大学
I went to college out of state.

146
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,750
我把他的复古车撞到了墙上
I crashed his vintage jag into a wall.

147
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,180
才三次啊
That's only three.

148
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,560
孩子们  吃饭了
Kids, dinner!

已经开始爱上这个了
Oh, loving this already.

150
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,650
如果没人摔成脑震荡的话
If no one gets a concussion,

151
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,660
我们一定会再来的
we're totally coming back.

152
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,730
听着  如果你觉得看到我和泰迪在一起
So listen, if at any point you're not okay

153
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,160
有什么不舒服的感觉

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,830
就直接告诉我  我们可以走的
just please let me know, and we can go.

155

好的  谢谢你  如果你觉得

我对这事如此坦然  让你有些不舒服的话
you're not okay with me being so okay with it,

157
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,100

非常感谢你请我们来
Thank you so much for having us.

164
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,440
我都分不出我的两个妞儿谁更兴奋了
I don't know which one of my girls is more excited.

165
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,070
好了  过来  我们给你找双旱冰鞋

173
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,930
你们怎么会在这里

174
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,160

178
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,750
小卡  你在这里做什么
Cam, what are you doing here?

179
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,830
见鬼  爸爸来了
Oh, hell, it's dad.

180
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,000
谁爸爸  不是你爸爸吧
Whose dad? Not your dad.

181
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,780
我一整天都没接他的电话
I have been avoiding his calls all day.

182
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,840
-快  菲尔  把我推远点  -走你
- Quick, Phil, slingshot me. - All right.

183
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,370
孩子们  林波舞滑法[后仰穿过横杆]
Oh. Limbo skate, kids.

184
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,070
你的身段能放多低
How low can you go?

185
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,540
周六晚上  我居然和家人在
I'm at a roller rink with my family

186
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,850
旱冰场玩  还能更低吗
on a Saturday night. I win.

187
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,020
我得给莉莉照张相
I have got to get a photo of Lily.

188
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,730
泰迪把她逗得前仰后合的
Teddy's making her giggle so hard.

189
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,550
人人都爱...泰迪
Oh, well, everybody loves... Teddy, so...

190
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,660
但你要是介意的话  就告诉我
But you'll let me know if you're not okay.

191
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,880
米奇尔  你知道你全家人都被你前男友
Mitchell, do you know your entire family's here,

192
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,040
邀请来了吗

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,020
小卡  这是场募捐活动  好吗
C--it's a-- it's a fund-raiser, all right?

196
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,780
我想他一定是把自己所有联系人都请来了
I'm sure he just invited everyone on his contact list.

197
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,380
那倒是能说得通
Oh, well, that makes sense.

198
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,410
是啊  当然了
Yes, of course it does.

199
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,800
还有  我受宠若惊
and... I'm flattered.

200
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,100
为什么你会受宠若惊
Why are you flattered?

201
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,010
-你懂的啦  -我不懂
- You know. - I don't.

202
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,490
你懂的
You do!

203
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,800
我真不懂
I really don't!

204
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,200
歌洛莉亚  穿上溜冰鞋跟我去冰上旋转
Gloria, throw on those skates and take a whirl with me.

205
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,050
我非常想去
Oh, I totally would,

206
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,420
但我在照顾莉莉  她不想滑冰
but I'm taking care of Lily and she doesn't want to.

207
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,310
我想滑
Oh. Yes, I do.

208
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,180
不  你不想  你之前告诉过我的
No, you don't. You told me before.

209
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,630
你不记得了吗  我怎么会撒谎呢
You don't remember? Why would I lie?

210
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,400
歌洛莉亚
Gloria.

211
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,390
你不会滑旱冰
You don't know how to roller-skate.

212
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,620
我当然会了  我没什么不会的
Of course I do. I know how to do everything.

213
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,030
对着你我真是撒不了谎
I can't lie to that face.

214
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,770
幸好我嫁的人不是你
It's a good thing that we're not married.

215
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,750
我不...
Well, I don't...

216
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,780
我不会滑冰  我是个优雅的女子
I can't skate. I am an elegant woman.

217
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,770
那意味着我永远也不去做
That means that I never do

218
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,160
那少数几件我做得不太完美的事情
the few things that I don't really do that good.

219
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,830
可我是个天生的滑冰老师
But I'm a natural teacher.

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,750
但我会看起来很蠢
But I'm going to look stupid.

221
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,810
歌洛莉亚
Gloria...

222
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,730
相信我
Trust me.

223
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,610
只要站在我身边
As long as you're standing next to me,

224
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,190
你就不会看起来很蠢
you will not look stupid.

225
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,250
太好了  都没地方坐了
Oh, thank god! There is no place to sit.

226
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,770
我总会给亲爱的侄女们留位置的
Always room at my table for my darling nieces.

227
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,550
被你们先抢了
Uhh... You beat us to it.

228
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,200
我们正准备问这小孩能不能一起坐呢
We were gonna ask this kid if we could share.

229
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,460
他就要走了
Well, he was just leaving.

230
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,000
你们完全可以过来一起坐
Yeah, you can totally sit with us.

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,040
我当时甚至不想把你们两个写进名单
You know, I debated even putting you two on here.

232
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,020
漂亮哦
Whoa, fancy.

233
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,280
我知道  我可是曾在这里工作过的
Yeah, I know. Well, I did used to work here.

234
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
等等  你是洗手间墙上照片里那个克莱尔
W-w-wait. You're the Claire from the bathroom?

235
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,600
那照片还在呢
Oh, is it still here?

236
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,340
是的
Y-yeah... oh...

237
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,930
看看你俩  多年未见
Oh! Hey! Look at you two catching up

238
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,070
-聊得真欢乐  -没那么久
- after all these years. - Well, it hasn't been that long.

239
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,460
也就一个月前  艾丽克斯得了流感
It's been like a month since you came by

240
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,380
-他还来过呢  对吧  -没开玩笑吧
- when Alex had the flu, right? - Oh, no kidding!

241
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,350
我还在她家吃了顿家常饭呢
Well, I do get a home-cooked meal out of it.

242
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,270
而且我欠他们个人情
Plus I owe these guys.

243
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,940
我最近两次买房  菲尔帮了不少忙
Phil helped me buy my last two houses.

244
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,060
真棒  多好的一段故事
Oh. So good. Such great stories.

245
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,940
-是啊  -叫你呢
- Yeah. - Hey, you!

246
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,400
你怎么不给我回电话
You owe me a phone call!

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,390
我知道  我会打给你的
I know! I'm gonna call you!

248
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,670
泰迪在这里
Hey! Teddy's here, huh?

249
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,290
你个赖账的  打高尔夫还欠我50块呢
Hey, you deadbeat, you owe me 50 bucks for the golf.

250
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,830
等你下次前列腺检查时我再塞给你
Well, maybe I'll slip it to you during your next prostate exam.

251
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,270
我打赌你就盼着那天了  小变态
I'll bet you're counting the days, you perv.

252
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,120
真有趣啊
Oh. So funny.

253
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,460
你和杰还真有话说呀  是吧
You and Jay really seem to have a thing, don't ya?

254
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,940
你和歌洛莉亚关系怎么样
And Gloria--what's the nature of your relationship with her?

255
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,540
事实上  我们今晚第一次见面
Well, actually, we just met tonight.

256
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,190
我不是很确定她喜不喜欢我
You know, I'm not so sure she likes me.

257
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,160
真的吗
Really?

258
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,720
我是说  她需要点时间才能熟络
Uh, well, I mean, she just takes a little time to warm up.

259
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,500
谢谢  也谢谢你今晚能过来
Oh, thanks. And thank you, again, for coming tonight.

260
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,240
利用筹集的这些钱  我们可以
With the money we raised, we'll be able

261
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,560
给4千多个有需要的孩子接种疫苗
to inoculate over 4,000 needy kids

262
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,310
抵御一些非常可怕的疾病
against some truly awful diseases.

263
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,240
你跟卢克关系怎么样
And how well do you know Luke?

264
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,380
我也喜欢那部电影
I love that movie, too!

265
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,960
在上海摩天大楼上的那场打斗戏太帅了
Yeah, that cool fight scene on that skyscraper in Shanghai--

266
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,670
让我好想去日本
It really made me want to go to Japan.

267
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,570
为什么  上海在中国
Why? Shanghai's in China.

268
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,260
我是说  你可不想飞到日本
I'm just saying, you don't want to fly to Japan,

269
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,650
然后打车说  "送我去上海市中心"
get in a cab and say, "Take me to downtown Shanghai."

270
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,420
那可太贵了
It's a pretty expensive ride.

271
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,510
我要去趟厕所
Uh, um, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

272
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,600
跟我一起去
Come with me.

273
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,110
马上回来哦  帅哥们
Be right back, guys.

274
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,240
你在干什么
Uh, what do you think you're doing out there?

275
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,700
-我在勾搭啊  -这就是我担心的
- I'm flirting. - That's what I was afraid of.

276
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,250
我可不会为了让一个男生喜欢我
Look, I'm not gonna pretend I'm stupid

277
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,440
-就故意装傻  -当然不
- just so a boy will like me. - Of course not.

278
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,620
但你不一定要贬低那可怜的男孩
But you don't have to put the poor guy to shame.

279
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,280
勾搭男人是要增加你自己的魅力
Flirting with boys is about increasing your value,

280
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,620
不是去打压他们
not decreasing theirs.

281
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,120
真是复杂  你在哪本杂志里学到的
That's a complicated thought. What magazine taught you that?

282
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,780
你又来了  又贬低他人
You're doing it again! The mean thing.

283
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,800
你自己有没有意识到啊
Can you even hear it or what?!

284
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,290
-我意识到了  -好
- I heard it. - Good.

285
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,370
现在他知道你很聪明了
So now that he knows that you're smart,

286
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,110
我们来试着表现得温柔些
let's work on being nice.

287
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,810
-把帽衫脱掉好吗  -不
- Wanna ditch the hoodie? - No.

288
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,820
没事没事  慢慢来
That's all good. It's a process.

289
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,100
哥们  在这家里想找出个英雄很难吧
Man, tough finding a hero in this family, huh?

290
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,480
我自己也有很多麻烦事
You know, I've got problems of my own.

291
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,580
我不可能总是配合你演出
I can't always be the lovable sidekick on "The Manny show."

292
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,060
你难道没有发现我在暴饮暴食吗
Did you even notice I'm binge-eating?

293
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,660
看来你真的有心事
You're really going through something.

294
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,530
想谈谈吗
Wanna talk about it?

295
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,930
一点也不想
Not even a little bit.

296
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,510
也别像往常一样烦我
And don't go hounding me like you always do.

297
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,960
多谢你重建我对这个家庭的信心
Well, thanks for restoring my faith in this family.

298
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,450
我要是泰迪的亲戚就好了
Too bad I'm not related to Teddy.

299
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,560
-他这人似乎很棒  -可不是嘛
- He seems terrific. - Doesn't he, though?

300
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,510
屈膝
Knees bent.

301
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,140
放松手臂  挺胸
Arms loose. Chin up.

302
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,250
提臀
Butt out.

303
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,550
不行  菲尔  太难了
Ay, no, Phil. This is too much.

304
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,900
记住口诀  "屈松挺提"
No, just remember, "Kbalcubo."

305
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,250
屈  松  挺  提
K-b-a-l-c-u-b-o.

306
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,500
就是"屈膝放松手臂挺胸提臀"
"Koala bears always lose cherries under big overpasses."

307
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,170
这么长  我怎么记得住啊
Ay, no! How am I gonna remember all that?!

308
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,700
我扶住你了
I gotcha.

309
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,590
泰迪  你真帅呆了
Ay, Teddy... Teddy, you're amazing!

310
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,450
谢谢你救了我
Thank you for saving me!

311
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,890
小子  让一让  让我来一拳
Let me get in there, boys. Excuse me.

312
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,340
走你
Boom!

313
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,100
好啦
Okay!

314
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,020
好啦  是时候聊聊了
Okay, clearly it's time to talk.

315
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,750
小卡  你显然是生气了
All right, Cam, Cam, you're obviously upset.

316
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,650
但你要相信我  
But trust me--

317
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,160
我和泰迪绝对没有藕断丝连
there are no lingering feelings between me and Teddy.

318
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,550
我才不在乎你和泰迪的事
I don't care about you and Teddy.

319
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,070
我是不喜欢他和你们家人藕断丝连
I don't like what's lingering between him and your family.

320
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,970
-什么  -米奇尔  你看看
- What? - Mitchell, look around.

321
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,380
你家人都在背叛我  和你的前男友厮混
Your family is cheating on me with your ex-boyfriend.

322
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,930
背叛  好吧  他们的关系确实
Cheating--okay, yes. Th-there is a bit more contact

323
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,320
比我知道的要更亲密一点  但是
between them than I realized, but--

324
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,150
是嘛  你又要怪我太敏感
Oh, o-oh, yeah. Now this is where we make Cam

325
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,560
怪我小题大做了
the over-sensitive drama queen.

326
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,720
就是不能为了我做出些改变
God forbid we take any action to make things right for me.

327
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,600
好好好  那你想要我怎么做
Well, okay, okay. Okay, what do you want me to do?

328
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,800
要我叫他们跟泰迪"分手"吗
Would you like me to ask them to break up with Teddy?

329
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,600
你是想让我这么做吗
Is that what you're asking?

330
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,130
当然不是  我绝不会提那种要求
Of course not. I would never ask that.

331
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,950
-那样也太疯狂了  -那就好
- That would be insane. - Well, good.

332
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,730
我如果那样要求  就太疯狂了
It would be as insane for me to ask that

333
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,020
但你主动提出来  就非常识趣
as it would be sane for you to offer it.

334
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,530
所以你就是要我那么做
So that is what you're asking.

335
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,170
不  我才没要你那么做
No, that's what I'm not asking.

336
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,350
但如果你要那么做  我希望你是自愿的
But if you decide to do it, I want it to come from you,

337
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,250
而不是我逼你的
Not me,

338
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,030
因为我显然没有那样要求你
because I'm clearly not asking for it.

339
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,140
-好吧  真是无理取闹  -是吗
- Okay, this is nuts. - Is it?

340
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,640
我千方百计  辛辛苦苦
I worked my fingers to the bone

341
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,530
讨你家的老顽固们的欢心
to get these jumpy protestants to love me,

342
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,910
现在却发现  他们和你的前男友
and now I find out they're holding a torch

343
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,720
打得火热  不可开交
for the man who came before me?

344
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,880
我不是无理取闹  我很痛心
It's not nuts. It's actually quite painful.

345
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,290
先生  打扰一下  您得奖了
Excuse me, sir? You just won a prize

346
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,200
您刚刚在拳击游戏机上创造了新记录
for setting a rink record on the boxing machine.

347
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,990
可以给您照张相
If you wouldn't mind taking a picture

348
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,340
贴在我们的光荣榜上吗
for our wall of fame?

349
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,410
当然可以  我一会儿就来
Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely. Just one second.

350
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,050
开心吧
That's exciting.

351
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,090
米奇尔  我知道你会做正确的事
Mitchell, I know you'll do what's right.

352
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,150
除非你喜欢看着我受辱
Unless you like seeing me humiliated.

353
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,910
谢谢
Thank you.

354
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,920
菲尔  大家都在盯着我
Everybody was staring, Phil.

355
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,970
要不我们到外面没人能看见的地方练习
Well, what if we practice outside where no one can see us?

356
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,560
我都紧张得打嗝了
Ay, and now I have the nervous burps!

357
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
克莱尔
Oh... Claire.

358
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,870
爸  你在这儿干嘛
Dad? Wh-what are you doing out here?

359
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,120
显然这是今晚找你聊聊的唯一办法
Apparently this is the only way we'll get to talk tonight.

360
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
关于工作的事
About this job.

361
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,790
同志们
Hey, guys.

362
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,100
好像有要紧事  爸  等会儿聊
This sounds really important, dad. Hang on.

363
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,040
米奇尔  你继续
Go ahead, Mitchell.

364
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,700
听我说  这是我本人的想法
Okay, so listen. This is coming from me.

365
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,140
没人逼我  我需要你们帮个忙
No one else. But I need you to do something,

366
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,120
-而且我不想你们吐槽我  -老天爷
- And I don't want you to give me any flack. - Oh, jeez.

367
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,060
你这就是在吐槽  我觉得你们
That's flack. I-I think it's a little weird

368
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,110
还和泰迪那么亲近很奇怪
how you all still hang out with Teddy so much...

369
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,720
我早说嘛
Told you.

370
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,510
我觉得  你们以后最好还是
And I think it'd be appropriate if maybe you all,

371
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,730
别再跟他来往了
you know, stopped seeing him.

372
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,530
这话是小卡让你说的  对吧
This is coming from Cam, isn't it?

373
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,690
不  不是
No, it's not.

374
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,610
慢着
Wait a second.

375
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,710
小卡觉得我们不能同时喜欢他和泰迪吗
Cam doesn't think we can love him and Teddy at the same time?

376
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,000
而且你就这么出卖了小卡
And you just sold Cam out like that?

377
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,130
等等  那是什么
Wait. What is that?

378
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,100
我告诉你是什么  是悲剧
I'll tell you what it is. It's sad.

379
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,560
各位顾客  请别慌张
Hey, skaters! Not an emergency,

380
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,990
我们的小吃店发生了小火灾
but we do have a small fire in the snack bar.

381
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,890
请大家有秩序地离开现场  谢谢
We'd like everyone to calmly file outside. Thanks.

382
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,510
各位  出口在这边
Okay, everyone, the exit's over here.

383
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,970
大家往这边走
Come this way, please.

384
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,170
走这边出来吧
Hey, this way, to the exit.

385
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,410
来吧  大家快从这边出来
All right, everybody over here.

386
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,820
-快啊  -你们帮帮我吧
- Come on. - You guys, just do this for me.

387
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,130
可是他离我们那么远
But... he's all the way over there.

388
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,340
你们"不用急"
There's no hurry.

389
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,830
我们可是在70年代建造的木建筑里
We're in a wooden box built in 1970.

390
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
-快走吧  -好  走吧
- Let's go! - Oh--all right, let's go.

391
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,850
谢谢你们  你们真"好"
Okay, thank you. That's very nice.

392
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,670
真是太"贴心"了
Sweet of you.

393
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,810
各位  好消息
Hey, skaters, good news!

394
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,230
火已经被扑灭了
Fire's out!

395
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,070
抱歉让你们受惊了
Sorry for the scare.

396
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,020
好啦好啦  先别生气
All right--all right, before you get upset,

397
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,410
这只是因为那边比较方便
this was just about convenience.

398
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,690
是吗
Was it?

399
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,810
还是在暗中向我表态
Or was it a perfect metaphor?

400
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,150
米奇尔  恭喜你
Congratulations, Mitchell.

401
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,380
这是我有生以来最难过的一次滑旱冰经历
This is the saddest I've ever been in roller skates.

402
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,150
小心点
Okay, be careful.

403
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,090
我不想受伤
I don't want to get hurt, okay?

404
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,170
-没人会受伤的  -抓紧我
- No one's gonna get hurt. - Hold on!

405
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,330
疼死我了
Aah! That hurts!

406
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,190
我们能不能
Okay, if we could just...

407
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,270
我"米"了个"奇"的 
Son of a Mitchell!

408
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,600
一点也别担心
Do not worry one bit.

409
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,540
你就快学会了
You are gettin' it!

410
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,180
我们还是离车远点  行不
Let's get away from the cars, huh?

411
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,430
好恶心
Disgusting.

412
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
克莱尔·普里契特
Claire Pritchett?

413
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,410
-杰夫  -真的是你
- Jeff? - No way!

414
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,950
你从这里辞职后我就再没见过你
I haven't seen you since you worked here.

415
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,660
你  你还在这工作啊
You... you still do.

416
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,770
是的  做自己喜欢的工作
Yeah, do what you love,

417
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,760
-工作也就不再是苦差事了  对吧  -对
- you never work a day in your life, right? - Right.

418
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,400
碰到你太好了
This is perfect.

419
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,040
刚才有个人在溜冰场上吐了
Some civilian just yakked in the rink.

420
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,150
你能不能帮我照看一下柜台
Can you take over for a minute?

421
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,820
不能
Um... no.

422
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,540
这是我赚钱最多的地方
Ah, it's kind of where I make most of my money.

423
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,500
我不想把它关了
You know, I hate to shut it down.

424
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,600
我把一姑娘肚子搞大了  这事说来话长
Ah, I got a girl pregnant. It's a whole thing.

425
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,100
-好吧  我暂时照看一下  -太好了
- All right. I'll do it for a minute, sure. - Great.

426
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,260
-太谢谢你了  -行了
- Thank you. Thank you. - Okay.

427
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,960
-对了  -什么事
- Oh, hey... - Yeah?

428
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,290
我还在回味那个吻
I still think about that kiss.

429
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,220
老天啊
Oh, god.

430
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,110
太恶心了
Gross.

431
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,580
妈妈  我刚刚吐了
Mom, I threw up.

432
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,620
亲爱的  那人是你啊  你会没事的
Oh, honey, that was you? You're gonna be okay.

433
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,300
我来找点东西安抚一下你的肚肚
Let me get you something for your tummy.

434
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,200
我压力太大了
I'm just so stressed out.

435
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,360
你知道我要写的那篇英雄的作文吗
You know that hero essay I have to write?

436
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,740
爸爸想当然地以为我写的是他
Well, dad kind of assumed I wrote it about him...

437
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,010
但我没写他
But I didn't.

438
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,410
他现在要读我的作文
And now he wants to read it,

439
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,960
我不知道该怎么办
and I don't know what to do.

440
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,630
别担心你爸  我相信他会理解的
Don't worry about your father. I am sure he'll understand.

441
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,790
克莱尔  我来给卡梅隆拿点冰块
Claire, I need some ice for Cameron.

442
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,220
还有  我们得谈谈工作的事情
And we have to talk about the job.

443
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,850
除非你决定回到这里工作了
Unless you've taken back this one.

444
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,450
爸  我在招呼顾客呢
Dad, I'm with a customer right now.

445
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,120
马上就来跟你谈
I'll be with you in just a moment.

446
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
亲爱的  我会跟你爸爸谈
Honey, I'll talk to your dad.

447
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,220
你觉得他不会因为我写的是你而生气吧
You don't think he'll be upset I wrote it about you?

448
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,680
你写的是我吗
You wrote it about me?

449
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,670
妈妈  你知道我一般怎么做作业
Mom, you know me and homework.

450
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,440
我没太动脑子  什么是英雄
I didn't give it much thought. What's a hero?

451
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,030
一个无所畏惧的人
Someone who's not afraid of anything,

452
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,860
一个强大的人  那就是你啊
and who's strong-- that's you.

453
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,990
可爸爸也很棒
But dad's so great, too.

454
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,500
-我又要吐了  -好了好了
- Here it comes. - Okay. All right.

455
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
你赶紧坐下来  坐下  宝贝
You just sit down. Sit down, sweet pea.

456
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,970
把这个喝了  你会没事的
Have your drink. You're gonna be fine.

457
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,900
真心话时间到
Here goes. Um...

458
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,420
爸爸  上次我们一起工作的时候
So, dad, the last time we worked together,

459
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,080
-我们的关系很紧张  -什么
- it was tense between us. - What?

460
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,210
-没有啊  -有的
- No, it wasn't. - Yes, it was.

461
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,930
你对我非常严厉
You were--you're really hard on me,

462
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,170
你说话时居高临下
and you talk down to me.

463
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,420
-你又胡说八道了  -好吧
- You don't know what you're talking about. - Right.

464
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,160
当我和你当面对质时  就像现在这样
And when I confronted you, like I am doing now,

465
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,150
你无动于衷  就像你现在一样
you were insensitive, like you are being now.

466
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,380
我谢谢你给我这个机会
And while I really appreciate the opportunity,

467
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,920
我很爱你
and I do love you very much,

468
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,430
但我觉得我们最好不要一起工作
I don't think that working together is a very good idea.

469
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,450
好吧
All right, fine.

470
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,240
说实话  我很失望
I'm not gonna lie. I'm very disappointed.

471
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,650
-我们赢了  -太逊了
- We won! - Man, that sucks!

472
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,820
是啊  我们太没男子气概了
Yeah, totally un-masculating.

473
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,820
{\an8}[正确表达是Emasculating]

474
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,680
至少你们玩的时候样子很酷
Well, at least you guys look cool when you play.

475
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,050
我们再玩一局  这局就当没发生
Let's play again. This never happened.

476
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,680
实际上  我们得去找我们的家人了
Actually, we need to go hang out with our family for a while.

477
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,960
真的吗  现在吗
Really? Now?

478
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,590
对  但我们不会走远  等会儿见
Yeah, but we'll be around. We'll see you guys.

479
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,210
怎么了  我又做错事了吗
What happened? Did I mess up?

480
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,830
-你做得很好  -那他不喜欢我吗
- No, you did great. - So he didn't like me?

481
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,090
-他可喜欢你了  -那我们干嘛要走开
- No, he totally liked you. - Then why'd we walk away?

482
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,520
他本来就不是重点
This was never about him.

483
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,320
这是为了给你增加点自信
This was about getting you some confidence.

484
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,190
男生们会意识到你这点的  更优秀的男生
Guys will pick up on that. Better guys.

485
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,250
那种即使输给女生  
Guys who can lose to a girl 

486
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,150
也不会觉得有损男子气概的人
without feeling e-masculated.

487
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,470
但愿你以后不会用我接下来的话反击我
Okay, try not to throw this in my face one day,

488
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,680
但我有时觉得你其实挺聪明
but sometimes you're actually really smart.

489
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,580
真正意义上的聪明  希望你知道
Like, smart smart. I hope you know that.

490
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,250
谢谢
Thanks.

491
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,840
我以后当然会拿这话来反击你
And I'm totally throwing that in your face one day.

492
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,050
你开玩笑呢吧
Are you kidding?

493
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,970
太感谢了  一切正常吗
Oh, thank you so much. Everything go okay?

494
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,150
不  我被困在柜台后面
No. Actually, I was trapped back here,

495
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,580
又跟我爸吵了一架
my dad and I got in a whole thing.

496
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,140
现在他生气了
now he's mad at me.

497
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,340
你在哪儿找到那个的
Whoa, where'd you find that?

498
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,280
我知道你把啤酒放在哪儿  杰夫
I know where you keep the beer, Jeff.

499
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,860
我太恨这感觉了
I hate this feeling!

500
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,190
我发誓  这从我12岁那年就开始了
I swear, it started when I was 12 years old

501
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,140
我在社会研究课考试中得了个C
and I got a "C" in social studies.

502
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,700
我爸看我的眼神  别人看到会以为
The way my dad looked at me, you would have thought

503
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,580
我穿着抹胸装去了教堂
I'd worn a tube top in church.

504
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,410
他知道我会非常伤心
He knew it crushed me.

505
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,640
他不在乎
He didn't care.

506
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,550
这就是我不能为他工作的原因
That's why I can't work for him.

507
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,960
他以前对我很严厉  现在也一样会
He was hard on me then. He's gonna be hard on me now.

508
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,060
告诉你  人是不会变的
I'm telling you, people don't change.

509
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,570
我改变了
I've changed.

510
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,470
我不想再忍受这些
I don't wanna put up with this stuff.

511
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,960
和20年前相比  我现在完全不一样了
I am a completely different person than I was 20 years ago.

512
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,160
孩子们  一共是18.5美元
All right, kids, that's gonna be $18.50.

513
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,120
收20
Out of $20?

514
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,600
找你1.5美元
There's your $1.50...

515
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,770
我想也是
I thought so.

516
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,010
我想说
Well, I mean,

517
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,470
你跟他说了实话  心里舒服些了吗
do you feel good that you were at least honest with him?

518
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,230
没有  想都别想
No. And... Super no.

519
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,110
因为每次我令他失望 
Because I'm the one who's left with this awful feeling

520
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,280
深感愧疚的人却是我
every time I disappoint him.

521
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
这不公平
It's not fair.

522
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,560
做恶人的不是我
'cause I'm not the bad guy here.

523
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,030
他需要知道这点
He needs to know that.

524
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,370
怎么样
How's that?

525
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,250
-好些了吗  -好多了
- That better? - Yeah, much better.

526
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,870
谢谢你  泰迪
Thank you, Teddy.

527
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,670
你好了  和我去溜冰
You're fixed. Skate with me.

528
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,350
我觉得还没好到那种程度  宝贝
I think it's a little soon, sweetie.

529
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,710
不  我是叫泰迪
No. Teddy.

530
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,220
没问题  孩子
But--oh, sure thing, kiddo.

531
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,800
尽量冰敷  三天不要做侧手翻
Hey, lots of ice, no cartwheels for three days.

532
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,020
-好的  -准备好了吗  来吧
- Yeah. - Ready? Come on.

533
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,430
很好的小伙子
Good guy.

534
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,330
泰迪吗  是啊  他最好了
Who--Teddy? Yeah. Yeah, he's the best.

535
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,460
真不敢相信他居然找不到伴儿
Nuts he can't find anybody, huh?

536
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,930
肯定有什么问题
Gotta be something a little off there.

537
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,630
反正他没让米奇尔表现出最好的一面
He definitely did not bring out the best in Mitchell,

538
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,800
这点我能肯定
I can tell you that right now.

539
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
是吗
Oh, really?

540
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,460
并不是说这有什么关系
Well, you know, not that it matters...

541
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,630
不过能不能说具体些
but in what way exactly?

542
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,950
说实话  他们在一起的时候
Honestly? When they were together,

543
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,320
米奇尔相当令人头痛
Mitchell could be a bit of a pill. 

544
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,950
我喜欢泰迪
Now, I like Teddy,

545
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,680
但他们分手时  其实我有些庆幸
but when they broke up, I was actually kinda glad.

546
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,720
当然了  米奇尔觉得
Of course, Mitchell thought that I was

547
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,780
我心里不舒服是因为不接受同性恋
uncomfortable because of the gay thing,

548
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,330
也许我当时是的  但是
and maybe I was, but...

549
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,270
我真的只是想让他开心
I really just wanted him to be happy.

550
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,120
像他现在这样
Like he is now.

551
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,250
你们在一起后  大家都想
And when you two started up, everyone thought,

552
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,690
就是他了
"Well, there it is."

553
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,620
孩子们  双人溜冰开始  
Okay, kids. Couples skate.

554
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,650
拉上你爱的人  开溜吧
Grab someone you love and get out there.

555
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,880
杰  你真是...
Jay, you can be so...

556
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,040
-我不会和你溜冰的  小卡  -好吧
- I'm not skating with you, Cam. - Yeah.

557
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,450
我呢  爸  你要和我一起溜冰吗
What about me, dad? You wanna skate with me?

558
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,530
什么样的人才有资格被称为英雄
What qualifies someone as a hero?

559
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,400
显然  英雄必须是我们尊敬的人
Obviously, a hero has to be someone we respect.

560
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,470
我们敬仰的人
A person we look up to.

561
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,480
心胸宽广的人
A person who is generous of spirit.

562
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,770
愿意成长与学习的人
Who's willing to grow and learn.

563
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,770
爸
So... Dad,

564
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,400
如果提议还有效的话
if that offer still stands...

565
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,390
真的吗  为什么改变主意
Really? What changed?

566
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,420
有些事不同了
A couple of things.

567
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,770
也许是这世上你最爱的人
Maybe it's the person you love most in the world

568
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
或是尽力享受生活的人
or the guy who makes the most out of life,

569
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,470
不管别人怎么想
no matter what anyone thinks.

570
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,310
没事的  大家都在笑我
It's cool! No, everybody's laughing at me!

571
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,430
-继续溜  机会来了  -不  
- Keep rolling! This is your chance! - No! No!

572
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,950
太好了
Yeah!

573
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,040
-菲尔  -我知道
- Phil! - I know!

574
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,880
-不过对我来说  -加油  爸
- For me, though... - Go, dad!

575
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,510
我家里的英雄就是我的家人
The hero in my family is my family,

576
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,430
我们在一起才是真英雄
because of who we are together.

577
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,380
C-
C-minus.

578
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,220
作业要求不是这样的
"This was not the assignment."

579
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,620
我告诉你谁不是我的英雄
I'll tell you who is not my hero.

580
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,110
丽塔·米克纳布老师
Mrs. Rita Mcnabb.

581
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,610
谢谢  谢谢
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

582
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,830
大家在看什么
What is everybody looking at?

583
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,440
我再说一次也没关系
Oh, I guess I can tell the story one more time.

584
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,700
是的  我当时正在生气
Sure, yeah. Well, I was mad about something.

585
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,040
我甚至不记得在气什么了
I don't even remember what.

586
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,590
我转过身  这一刻
I turned. Now at this point,

587
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,670
我更像是野兽  而不是人
I'm more animal than I am man.

588
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,400
猛击拳击游戏机
Strike the punching machine,

589
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,110
显然我是打破了什么世界纪录
and apparently I broke some sort of world record.

590
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,510
我想我永远不会忘记的就是
I guess the thing that I'll never forget

591
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,990
破纪录时游戏机发出的声音
is the sound that it made.

592
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,270
好像有敲钟声  口哨  汽笛
It was, like, bells and whistles and sirens.

593
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,840
不太可能描述清楚
It's impossible to describe.

594
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,530
不是吧
Oh, no!

595
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,210
这可是我生平打出的第一拳
That was literally the first punch I've ever thrown!

596
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,670
你这辈子都不准再见他了
You are never to see him again.

597
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,760
是  我知道
Yes, I know.
