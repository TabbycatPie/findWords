18
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,170
Think we found our guy.

19
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,530
Logan Peters.

20
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,490
We got intel he's hanging with the Southside Hustlers.

21
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,240
Roman said he'd call you once he found the guy,

22
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,950
Wait a second, you talking about Sean Roman?

23
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,020
- Kim's ex-partner? - Yeah.

24
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,700
What's he got to do with this?

25
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,540
My little sister Sarah, she went missing last week.

26
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,990
I need to know what happened.

27
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,670
Sean is in Chicago?

28
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,980
You are not a cop anymore!

29
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,310
No, But I'm Sarah's big brother.

30
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,450
'Cause I can't blame Sean for putting his family first.

31
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,210
I mean, let's do what we can to help him.

32
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,760
Here we go.

33
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,100
- What do we got? - Fire's contained.

34
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,920
Got a couple smoke inhalation injuries.

35
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,390
They're on their way now to Med with the GSW victim,

36
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,480
Travis.

37
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,330
Believe he started the fire.

38
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,350
Smelled gasoline when we entered.

39
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,730
So the, uh, shooter's the dealer, Logan Peters?

40
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,480
Yeah, he's in the wind. Fled during the fire.

41
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,120
It's too late for a perimeter.

42
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,050
All right, well, Kim will take your statement.

43
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,790
Someplace quiet, huh?

44
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,140
Okay, what's going on?

45
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,490
I arrived here after tracking Logan.

46
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,590
I'm not actually asking for your statement.

47
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,270
I'm asking why the hell you didn't come to us.

48
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,090
My sister's missing. I'm looking for her.

49
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,500
Yeah, we have an entire unit that specializes in just that.

50
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,830
Not to mention, you have me. And Intelligence.

51
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,440
I went to Fire first because of the ODs.

52
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,720
No...

53
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,390
I rode in a car with you for two years.

54
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,010
- I know when you're lying. - I couldn't come to you.

55
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,750
I don't care that we broke up.

56
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,920
It's not that.

57
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,900
Do you realize how bad this looks for you right now?

58
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,920
You're at the scene of a shooting--

59
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,070
- I can book you as a suspect. - You gotta be kidding me.

60
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,640
- I was a cop. - You're not anymore.

61
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,820
All right?

62
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,820
So if you want, I'll take you down to the station,

63
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,390
then you can answer my questions in the box.

64
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,560
Your choice.

65
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,090
She's dealing for him.

66
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,660
What?

67
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,400
My sister's an addict. She has been for a while now.

68
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,200
And I think she's dealing for her boyfriend.

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,470
And if she is, and a teenager died,

70
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,470
then she's staring down a drug induced homicide charge.

71
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,800
So yeah, I went to Fire first and lied my ass off.

72
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,780
Look, I need you to trust me now, okay?

73
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,070
Just...trust me, okay?

74
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,410
We've been treating at least three ODs an hour,

75
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,890
like stopping running water.

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,290
This kid who set the fire?

77
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,660
- Yeah. - Travis Butler.

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,200
Paramedics brought him in 15 minutes ago,

79
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,980
GSW to the stomach, smoke inhalation.

80
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,400
- He's still in surgery, but-- - If you're saying this place

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,760
is too busy, then you see my daughter first.

82
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,590
No, but my son's in worse condition than your daughter.

83
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,080
Sir, sit down.

84
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,190
This kid could've killed everyone in there.

85
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,090
Hey, what's going on?

86
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,280
Victims from the fire were brought here,

87
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,990
and so was Travis.

88
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,000
- I do know that you-- - Get your hands off of me!

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,380
Police! Hey, police!

90
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,130
Police! You need to calm down!

91
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,660
- Calm down. Calm down. - My son's in worse condition.

92
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,190
- Calm down. - Okay.

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
Come on, let's go this way.

95
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,250
I'm sorry. I would never hit a cop. A woman.

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,680
- I'm sorry. - It's okay, I'm fine.

97
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,620
They say my son started the fire.

98
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,000
Uh, we believe the guy who shot your son

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,750
is also involved in other crimes.

100
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,330
- What? - He was in the apartment

101
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,050
- where the fire started. - No witnesses saw Logan flee.

102
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,120
- Mr. Butler? - Yeah?

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,100
Surgery went well. Travis is stable.

104
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,240
Can I see him?

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,290
Thanks.

106
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,530
See you guys. Thank you.

107
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,370
- Good work. - Thanks.

108
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,640
No, I didn't see where Logan went.

109
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,460
He, uh, he shot me,

110
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,830
I saw him leave the room, but that's all.

111
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,060
How well do you know Logan? You know where he might run to?

112
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,550
I don't know him at all.

113
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,140
Friend of mine told me where to find him.

114
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Told me he killed my girlfriend.

115
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,520
He dealt to her?

116
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,310
She was happy. She was perfect.

117
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,790
Then he started selling to her.

118
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,660
He's responsible for this.

119
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,640
I was just trying to make it right.

120
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

121
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,960
Oh, man.

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,800
I should've told you to come here from the jump.

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,270
I'm sorry. I steered you wrong.

124
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,630
Well, I'm here now.

125
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,540
You, uh, you gonna talk to Voight?

126
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,760
- Yeah. - Hey, O'Malley.

127
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,650
Oh, come on, I finally got detailed to TACT.

128
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,460
But who needs a three-house raid when there's the honor

129
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,780
of covering your desk?

130
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,860
- Hey, welcome back. - Thanks.

131
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,660
- Sorry to hear about the-- - Thank you.

132
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,730
Sorry for your loss.

133
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,150
- What's he talking about? - Uh, I got injured on the job.

134
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,070
That's all.

135
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
My mother called me last week.

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,110
She found pills in Sarah's room.

137
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,110
Flushed them, then accused her of dealing.

138
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,980
- Which didn't go well. - She ran?

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,730
She's been gone nine days.

140
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,910
We thought she ran off with her boyfriend.

141
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,770
I didn't even know his name until yesterday.

142
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,470
Logan Peters.

143
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,560
If she did sell to those kids that OD'd...

144
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,640
She's looking at a big charge.

145
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,010
I know her, Sarge. She's a good kid.

146
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,360
She's just down on her luck, needs our help.

147
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,310
Well, we find her first,

148
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,170
- we'll do what we can to protect her. - Okay.

149
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,960
All right.

150
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,940
You can roll with Kim.

151
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,390
On a short leash.

152
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,840
I'm gonna tell you something, you go off on your own

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
while you're with my unit...

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,840
you're gonna see a whole other side of me, you understand?

155
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,830
Yeah.

156
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay, he's yours.

157
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,180
Thank you.

158
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,960
Ann Hoffman, 15. Clarke Preston, 17.

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,420
Two more ODs pronounced at

161
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,000
Med in the last 24 hours.

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
And their tox report

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
matches our original DOA, Brandi.

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Mass amounts of fentanyl in their systems.

165
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,150
Same compound product our dealer Logan Peters is pushing.

166
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,900
The kid's got a few priors for possession, theft,

167
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,990
and a statutory rape charge.

168
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,730
He was 23, his girlfriend, 15.

169
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,360
- Charge was dismissed. - All right, and the pills?

170
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,730
Thinking Mexican oxy. Looks, feels, tastes like

171
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,450
regular oxy, but it's fake. Made with fentanyl, instead.

172
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,780
Comes directly from cartels,

173
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,660
and is dealt to Hispanic gangs in the city.

174
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,770
I got something.

175
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,700
Latin Players said Logan wasn't getting product from them.

176
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,090
Southside Hustlers were granting him asylum.

177
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,540
Well, begs the question, where's he getting his product?

178
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,720
- Witness popped. - Okay.

179
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,170
Guy across the street from the fire says

180
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,810
he saw Logan running towards the L.

181
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,500
I pulled the footage. He got off at Wilson.

182
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,660
All right, so run all Logan Peters' known associates

183
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,600
near that stop.

184
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,830
I mean, the guy's hiding somewhere, right?

185
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,780
We find him, flip him for his supplier,

186
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,700
get this product off the street before that board grows.

187
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,820
Hey, you, uh, you want me to ride with you, or...

188
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,260
No.

189
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,750
Smaller numbers, it's a quicker spread.

190
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,980
- Right, okay. - Yeah.

191
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,820
Well, we'll see you back here.

192
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,140
- What was that in there? - What?

193
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,000
You seem different.

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,420
No, we just haven't spoken in years.

195
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,240
Your unit seems to be walking on eggshells around you,

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,650
especially Ruzek.

197
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,680
You should've stuck around, Roman.

198
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,160
You would've made detective.

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,250
And you seem different too.

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
No, hey, you can't just come in.

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,620
You answer the door high, holding a joint.

202
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,030
- Not sure what you expect. - I ain't high.

203
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,500
And it's legal now.

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,660
No, man, you're high on something

205
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,570
a lot stronger than marijuana, and you're on probation--

206
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,170
Baby, can you please not be so loud?

207
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,470
Come here. Get over here.

208
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,590
Let's go.

209
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,000
You trying to get to the drugs before we do?

210
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,880
Have a seat. Sit down!

211
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,610
All right, you answer my questions,

212
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,490
I won't search this place, we have a deal?

213
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,180
You know this guy, Logan Peters?

214
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,250
- I don't know him. - You do know him.

215
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,830
He listed this address for two months

216
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,210
after he got out of prison. Try again.

217
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,440
- Hey, look at this. - Haven't seen him in a long time.

218
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,380
What about her? Sarah Roman.

219
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,950
You know her? She dating Logan?

220
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,800
- Don't know her. - Do you know her?

221
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,010
We don't know her.

222
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,920
Hey, does it look like I'm talking to you?

223
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,900
Do you know her?

224
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,910
- She's my little sister. - Baby, no.

225
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,110
Well, she doesn't look like that anymore.

226
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,850
Oh, my God.

227
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,830
- So you've seen her? - Day--day--days ago.

228
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,140
Okay, where, where's the last place you saw her?

229
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,280
Logan doesn't date these girls.

230
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,900
He just...plays with them.

231
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,680
Listen, I don't care about that,

232
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,520
I want to know where the last place you saw Sarah was.

233
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,800
Look at me, not at him.

234
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,680
Where's the last place you saw Sarah?

235
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,700
The old lake house.

236
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,740
We break in there to party sometimes.

237
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,230
- I want that address now. - Yeah.

238
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,700
No. No.

239
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,380
Clear.

240
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,380
Clear. Roman.

241
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,340
Now we're clear.

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,670
- Might as well start in here. - Okay.

243
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,940
You okay?

244
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,800
Yeah.

245
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,090
What happened on the job? Injury?

246
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,650
Sex trafficking case.

247
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,910
I went in without backup, I got worked.

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,290
You lose a victim?

249
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,260
The PO at 21 said, "Sorry for your loss."

250
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,340
Ruzek and I got together, I got pregnant,

251
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,620
and I'm not anymore.

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,980
What?

253
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,810
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I can't even imagine.

254
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,560
It's okay. It was early. It was an unplanned pregnancy.

255
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,450
I'm fine.

256
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,160
Look at this.

257
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,230
It's the Southside Hustlers' emblem.

258
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Yeah, you said Logan was getting asylum from them, right?

259
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,570
Looks like an oxy pill.

260
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,280
Let's hope it's one of the fake ones.

261
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,130
Kim. That's Sarah's.

262
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,080
What?

263
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,590
- Sure? - Yeah, it's her jacket.

264
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,570
Okay. Sarah?

265
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,760
- Sarah! - Sarah?

266
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,390
- Sarah! - Sarah--

267
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,490
Sarah!

268
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,690
Sarah.

269
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,770
I believe Sarah died a week ago.

270
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,680
Her body indicates she struggled to survive.

271
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,640
Someone strangled her, beat her.

272
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,400
There's presence of internal bleeding in her stomach.

273
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,030
But none of those factors are the actual cause of death.

274
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,760
It's likely she appeared dead to her assailant

275
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,610
but survived these injuries.

276
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,530
Ultimately, she froze to death.

277
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,400
Your body tricks you when you freeze.

278
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,730
You think you're warm.

279
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,900
Probable she took off her jacket trying to cool down,

280
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,490
- went to the water and-- - How long?

281
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,100
How long was she alone outside?

282
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,710
I would guess she was alive outside for around 19 hours.

283
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,070
Sean.

284
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,900
Kim?

285
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,970
Sean?

286
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,510
What's going on?

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Sean.

288
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,050
We found Sarah's body, Mom.

289
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,750
She died a week ago.

290
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,150
No.

291
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,210
She's gone.

292
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,840
No, no.

293
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,490
- No! - She needed you!

294
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,010
- No, no, no, no. - We needed you!

295
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,930
Please, please stop, please.

296
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,800
- You all right? You all right? - I'm fine!

297
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,300
How'd it go with Roman's family?

298
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,420
- It went. - All right, M.E. confirmed the DNA

299
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,210
found under Sarah's fingernails popped in the system.

300
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,200
It was Logan's.

301
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,290
All right, somebody tell me we got something on this prick.

302
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,680
We ran the pill we found at the lake house through ISP.

303
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,750
They did confirm that it matches our ODs,

304
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
but it ain't Mexican oxy.

305
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,890
That pill is way too sloppy for the cartels.

306
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,140
ISP believes it's homemade.

307
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,280
Might have something.

308
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,230
Reran Logan's GPS stats.

309
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,470
The tower pings up against known Southside Hustler hot spots.

310
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,860
One hit an old stash house leased to a Leon Miller.

311
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,330
Guy's a bit of a heavy.

312
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,280
Known for leasing dope corners.

313
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,690
It's a long shot, but that stretch of the city

314
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,430
is dead man's land. There ain't nothing there.

315
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,160
I mean, it's a damn good place to hide out.

316
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,360
Yeah. Let's roll on it. Nice work.

317
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,270
Thanks.

318
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,660
All right, we'll take front, you guys--

319
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,950
5021 Frank, we got shots fired

320
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,640
coming from inside a warehouse at 1600 West Racine.

321
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
Get us some cars over here.

322
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,830
Copy that.

323
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,190
Go, go, go.

324
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,810
Hold on, hold on.

325
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,730
Body.

326
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,120
Crossing.

327
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,540
Ruz, you good?

328
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,670
Yeah, I'm good. We got Logan Peters.

329
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,480
DOA, looks like two gunshot wounds to the chest.

330
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,150
Cross.

331
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,640
Rear, possibly side of the building.

332
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,840
Copy that.

333
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,290
Chicago PD! Don't move!

334
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,430
Don't move.

335
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,300
Where's the gun? You got the gun?

336
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,590
I don't know, I don't see it. I don't see it.

337
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,000
Buddy, where's the gun?

338
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,370
- He's foaming at the mouth. - What is he, an OD?

339
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,920
- I don't know, you got Narcan? - No.

340
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,430
- Oh, God. - 5021 George, emergency.

341
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,270
Roll an ambo to 1600 West Racine,

342
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,990
we got an OD victim. Nonresponsive.

343
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,860
Advise responding to set up a four-block perimeter.

344
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,280
We still might have a shooter here.

345
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,880
His pulse is strong.

346
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,740
- Let's get that Narcan or we're going lose him. - Yup.

347
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,020
- Stay with us. - Here you go.

348
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,170
- Come on, come on. - Come on, come on, come on.

349
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,790
There you go. There we go, that's it.

350
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,230
Okay, let's get going.

351
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,740
Easy, easy.

352
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,910
I gotta get his gloves checked for GSR.

353
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,060
We've really gotta get him to the hospital.

354
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,460
- All right. Can we go? - Yup.

355
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,990
It's hard to imagine this guy's capable of firing a gun.

356
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,470
Looks that way, but you never know.

357
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,500
- Right behind y'all. - One, two, three.

358
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,190
Okay, all right, drop him.

359
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,460
What can I do?

360
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,670
- Buckle him. - Got it.

361
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,340
Hey, how's Roman? Is he doing okay?

362
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,080
He's tough. Losing his sister like that.

363
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,930
- It's hard to accept. - Yeah, more like impossible.

364
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,720
You get the other guy to Med?

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,590
Yeah.

366
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,000
Looks like Logan was hiding out here.

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,450
Yeah, well, someone found him.

368
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,290
He's got plenty of self defense wounds, bruising on his knuckles.

369
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,780
Looks like he was in quite the scrape before he got shot.

370
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,470
Logan's getting a lot of heat for the ODs,

371
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,970
supplier gets spooked.

372
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,840
Beats him, kills him, ties it off.

373
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,200
Do you want us to work this, Sarge,

374
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,180
or do you wanna wait for Homicide? They're on their way.

375
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,090
Well, if this punk's murder can get us to our supplier,

376
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,710
get these pills off the street, yeah, we'll work it.

377
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,790
I mean, for that. Not for this.

378
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,280
Why do you still have that sonogram up, Adam?

379
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,210
I don't know. Just couldn't get rid of it yet.

380
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,730
That doesn't really make sense, but okay.

381
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,610
It does to me.

382
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,580
Look, I'm not trying to weird you out.

383
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,890
I'll take it down right now if you want me to.

384
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,570
No, if you want to keep it up, that's your call.

385
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,050
- You sure? - Yeah, you do what you need to do.

386
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,290
'Cause, you know,

387
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,600
I don't know if we're in the same place with all this.

388
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,490
We haven't really had a chance to talk.

389
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,150
Okay, let's do it. Let's talk. Let's talk.

390
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,710
No, no, no, we don't have--

391
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,820
No, we should because

392
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,990
it's better than us avoiding each other and--

393
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,970
You just--you just go ahead,

394
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,790
you say what you're gonna say, and you get it off your chest.

395
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,930
Okay. What am I meant to get off my chest?

396
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,810
- Your feelings, your anger. - What do you mean?

397
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,260
Adam, I can tell-- I can feel it.

398
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,180
You blame me for losing the baby.

399
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,100
- Blame you? - Yeah.

400
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,130
I don't blame you. What are you talking about?

401
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,840
'Cause I wasn't supposed to be in the field,

402
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,010
I wasn't supposed to be at the motel--

403
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,500
And you were.

404
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,210
And because you were, you saved a kid's life.

405
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,560
Yeah, but I could've waited three minutes--

406
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
No, you couldn't have. That man would've beat

407
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
that girl to death, had you waited outside.

408
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
Kim, you were doing your job. You're a cop.

409
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,320
You were at a scene--

410
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,940
I wasn't supposed to be on the scene!

411
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,340
I wasn't supposed to be in the motel!

412
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,460
I wasn't supposed to lose the baby!

413
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,630
Don't you get that? I don't want pity.

414
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,300
And I don't want support.

415
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,540
- What do you want? - I want you to be angry with me,

416
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,240
as angry with me as I am.

417
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,210
I can't do that.

418
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,170
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,440
Yes, okay.

420
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,090
Got it.

421
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,910
Okay, yes, thank you.

422
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,850
GSR on the junkie is negative.

423
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,610
Dude ain't no killer, just a stone cold addict.

424
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,740
I just talked to him at Med. Good news is he's stable.

425
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,620
Bad news is he didn't see a damn thing.

426
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,040
He said as soon as he heard the shots, ran off scared.

427
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,120
All right, so what do we got on Leon Miller?

428
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,250
Confirmed he's the one that's paying rent on the warehouse.

429
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,340
It's bad paper, but the money traces back to him.

430
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,380
Narcotics says that he's well-established, smart,

431
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,210
and strategic.

432
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,960
He's a good fit for Logan's supplier.

433
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,510
All right, so dig into it. See if we can put him

434
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,220
or one of his associates at the scene.

435
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,950
- Sarge? - Yes?

436
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,870
- Okay if I update Roman? - Yeah.

437
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,480
We found Logan in an abandoned warehouse.

438
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,670
He was beaten. Two shots to the chest.

439
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,510
He's dead, Roman.

440
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,740
We think that his supplier, Leon Miller, looks good for it.

441
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,180
He also owns the warehouse where Logan's body was found.

442
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,520
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

443
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,730
Who cares if he's dead?

444
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,150
She's still gone.

445
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,910
I know. But down the line it could help, you know?

446
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,990
Knowing the man responsible for her death is gone too.

447
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,630
I doubt it.

448
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,990
Sean, it's not on you.

449
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,890
This is on Logan.

450
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,370
What's not? That I left her?

451
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,790
- No-- - My sister needed me, Kim.

452
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,100
She was coming apart, and she needed me

453
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,630
to just get on the plane and come home to her.

454
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,840
But I didn't.

455
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,930
So you can give me any platitudes you want

456
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,740
but you didn't want to hear them from me, okay?

457
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,680
And I don't want to hear them from you.

458
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,650
This is on me.

459
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,800
Yeah.

460
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,840
- Yeah, I'm not sure-- - Jay?

461
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,580
- Yeah? - Any new leads?

462
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,840
No. We can prove that they knew each other from texts,

463
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,640
social media, but there's no tower pings,

464
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,260
there's no footage, nothing that puts Miller or anyone

465
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,170
associated with him near Logan's murder.

466
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,340
Guys.

467
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,150
- Who was that? - He's a potential witness.

468
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,060
He says he was near the crime scene, saw a black Range Rover

469
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,030
speed away a minute after hearing two gunshots.

470
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,400
That's the lead we've been waiting for.

471
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,780
Miller drives a black Range Rover.

472
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,470
Yeah. He also got a partial plate. Time to move.

473
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,740
Go.

474
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,820
- Ready? - Yeah, let's go.

475
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,700
Police! Gun!

476
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,220
I got you. Move up.

477
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,430
Move up, move up. Come on, come on.

478
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,080
- Shots fired at the police. - Gun!

479
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,480
Go, Burgess, go Burgess, I got you.

480
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,340
Sarge, I got a runner! He's headed straight for you!

481
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,940
Don't shoot.

482
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,820
Shut up, Leon.

483
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,970
Keep your hands up.

484
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,300
Sarge.

485
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,190
Stand back.

486
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,000
Leon, we found 2,000 counterfeit oxy pills.

487
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,060
Plus a boatload of uncut fentanyl.

488
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,330
Ain't mine.

489
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,460
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

490
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,630
I'm gonna pretend you didn't start there.

491
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,820
And you're gonna pretend you give a damn your pills

492
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,520
killed three teenagers.

493
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,940
It ain't mine.

494
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,940
You can't connect me to none of that.

495
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,540
I ain't never seen or touched those drugs--

496
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,780
Kid, you tell your lawyer to play that.

497
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,160
I promise you it ain't gonna work for the murder.

498
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,030
Murder? What the hell is you talking about?

499
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,160
Logan Peters.

500
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,150
I ain't kill Logan.

501
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,340
He was hiding out at your warehouse.

502
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,090
You're the only person who knew where he was.

503
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,350
Look, man, I told him he could hide out there.

504
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,810
No way I killed him.

505
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,190
I'll tell you whatever you want on that, but I ain't kill nobody.

506
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,150
I ain't been at that warehouse in years.

507
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,630
We got Miller on tape eating at Frank's Grill

508
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,630
over on Marquette 12:31 to 2:18.

509
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,430
Son of a bitch is telling the truth.

510
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,340
Well, maybe he didn't pull the trigger himself,

511
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,000
doesn't mean he didn't order the hit.

512
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,180
Keep looking.

513
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,460
Hey, we finally caught a break with a bus cam.

514
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,100
He was passing Racine, two blocks out,

515
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,300
three minutes after the gunshots.

516
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,560
Caught this blue Nissan sedan driving westbound.

517
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,190
Unfortunately, because of the glare on the windows,

518
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,520
you can't make out the driver.

519
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,570
And the black Range Rover?

520
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,010
No, it's just the blue Nissan, no plates.

521
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,350
Okay, so we start looking for owners of blue Nissans.

522
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,810
- Hey, Kim. - Yeah?

523
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,190
Talk to that witness again, maybe he saw a blue Nissan too.

524
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,400
Copy you.

525
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,840
Did you see any other cars, anybody else?

526
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,630
Uh, no, only saw a black Range Rover.

527
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,330
Okay, did you get a look at the driver?

528
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,850
No, just the car.

529
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,910
And which way was it headed?

530
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,290
Not sure.

531
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,080
I was driving to my sister's house,

532
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,420
thought my tire was flat, pulled over, checked the tire,

533
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,090
heard two gunshots.

534
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,350
And then what?

535
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,800
Got the hell out of there.

536
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,800
What happened to the flat?

537
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,090
Wasn't as bad as I thought.

538
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,430
Where does your sister live?

539
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,120
In Englewood. Lancaster Road.

540
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,650
And where were you coming from?

541
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,070
Uh, I was at home. In Pilsen.

542
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,610
Okay. Question.

543
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,200
See, Pilsen is here, and Englewood is here,

544
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,330
and the location of the warehouse

545
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,040
where the shooting took place is about here.

546
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,540
Now, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

547
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,540
That line ain't too straight, Christian.

548
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,060
I'm not so good at directions.

549
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,920
Not so good at lying, either.

550
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,590
Anything else?

551
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,680
Why are you lying to me, Christian?

552
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,970
I ain't lying to you.

553
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,940
I told you exactly what happened.

554
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,020
You know what? I don't need this.

555
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,360
Platt. I need you to do a deep dive on that witness,

556
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,280
Christian Lewis.

557
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,470
I'm not handing out work.

558
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,330
I just need this done off the record.

559
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,080
- Okay, fine. - Thank you.

560
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,020
You guys are fishing in the wrong pond here.

561
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,230
Hit men do not drive Nissans.

562
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,210
Exactly why a smart one would.

563
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,810
- Hey, we have anything? - I don't know.

564
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,440
I got three accountants, two teachers, and a dentist, so...

565
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,550
Hold on, Ruz, I think got one.

566
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,700
Robert Harper, age 43. White as hell.

568
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
I mean, makes Halstead look like Lil Wayne.

569
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,580
This man is very legit.

571
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,660
He's got three outstanding parking tickets.

572
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,150
And if that's not gangster, he's got a jaywalking citation.

574
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,280
I say we grab his ass up.

575
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,290
Where are you going? You just got here.

577
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,120
It turns out your witness, Christian Lewis,

578
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,190
used to be an informant.

579
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,220
He was on our books for a couple years.

580
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,140
- When? - 2014 to '16.

581
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,830
I don't know what's going on,

582
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,020
I don't wanna know what's going on,

583
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,940
but you're making me nervous.

584
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,900
Oh, I'm fine.

585
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,030
- You like it here, right? - Of course I like it here.

586
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,320
Then be careful.

587
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,250
Keeping secrets from Voight is not a game many people win.

588
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,380
Kim, you know you're not alone in this.

589
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,130
You got people. Me.

590
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,510
People tend to lighten the load.

591
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,450
Hey, what's up? It's almost midnight.

592
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,280
We need to talk, now. Here, someplace else.

593
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,450
- Come on in. - Thanks.

594
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah, my parents are finally sleeping.

595
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
The doctor gave them some sleeping pills.

596
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,640
Good. That's good.

597
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,270
- So what's going on? - I wanted to talk to you

598
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,380
before too many people got involved.

599
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,180
- What's that mean? - It means that things are starting to break

600
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,390
a certain way in Logan's murder, Sean.

601
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,970
- What way is that, Kim? - In a way that points to you.

602
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,490
Our key witness, Christian Lewis,

603
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,000
the guy who saw a black Range Rover--

604
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,110
the exact car that Leon Miller drives--

605
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,820
is one of your old CIs.

606
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,840
And the car that was actually at the scene, a blue Nissan,

607
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,010
just so happens to be the same type of car

608
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,080
that your cousin, Tamra Riley, drives.

609
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,180
I've met her, Sean, at your house, at parties.

610
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,140
I've met her, and according to social media,

611
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,850
she has been in Florida the last five days--

612
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,270
It's late, and I need to get ready for my sister's funeral.

613
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,320
Sean, I don't think you meant to kill him--

614
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm giving the eulogy,

615
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,890
- and I wanna make sure I do a good job, Kim. - Sean.

616
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,680
I appreciate you coming by.

617
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,270
Get some rest, Sean.

618
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,790
Where we at?

619
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,010
We find any blue Nissan owners

620
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,350
with a connection to Leon Miller or the DOA?

621
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,350
So we went through all of Miller's known associates.

622
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,090
Nobody drives a blue Nissan.

623
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,400
So, other than the car, the only piece of evidence

624
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,510
we got is this witness, Christian Lewis.

625
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,610
Who popped up out of nowhere

626
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,700
and luckily saw a black Range Rover speed from the scene.

627
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,530
Maybe Miller let one of his associates

628
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,390
drive the Range Rover to do the hit.

629
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,210
It's possible, but Miller seems smarter than that.

630
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,370
So that leaves you-- the killer drives the exact

631
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,540
same car as Miller, with similar plates.

632
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,280
Or witness is lying his ass off.

633
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,820
All right, Kim, you talked to the witness yesterday.

634
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,700
He seem credible to you?

635
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,720
You know, I-I couldn't tell that he was lying,

636
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,670
but his story did have some holes in it.

637
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,500
Bring him in.

638
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,010
We got open door.

639
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,350
Chicago PD.

640
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,860
Christian Lewis. Chicago PD.

641
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,240
What the hell?

642
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,200
Lewis packed up fast.

643
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,510
He's gotta be playing us. Made up the Range Rover

644
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,760
to get us to focus the investigation on Miller.

645
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,950
Why do that?

646
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,580
'Cause someone pays you to.

647
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,040
Let's go knock on some doors.

648
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,390
Good afternoon, sir, I was hoping you could help me out.

649
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,610
Thanks so deeply for your concern about the city of Chicago.

650
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,180
No, no, no, what I'm saying is Christian is a good dude.

651
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,780
I mean, he ain't gonna run for president,

652
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,040
but he's doing the best he can.

653
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,120
Well, what do you mean by that?

654
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,750
He's an addict. Heroin, crack, you name it.

655
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,150
But he's been getting himself right,

656
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,940
going to meetings, making amends.

657
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,170
Landlady say he just gave her an envelope

658
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,300
filled with fresh hundreds.

659
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,840
This landlady, she live in the complex?

660
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,660
Yeah. Apartment 2C.

661
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,830
How's it going? Any leads?

662
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,230
Best one I have so far is Lewis is trying to make amends.

663
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,350
He just handed the landlady an envelope full of cash.

664
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,260
- Yeah, I just talked to her. - Okay.

665
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,720
Lewis gave her three grand in cash, squared up his whole debt.

666
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,640
Fresh cash, too, so we can trace the serial numbers.

667
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,680
That's good.

668
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,310
Yeah, we identify the bank where the money was withdrawn,

669
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,230
I'm guessing that'll get us to the guy who paid Lewis to lie.

670
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,530
Unless, of course, you already know.

671
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,620
No. I-I'm just doing the math, like you.

672
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,290
- Do you want me to run the cash? - No, I got it.

673
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,330
Okay.

674
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,880
Funeral for Roman's sister is in a few hours.

675
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,130
You should go.

676
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,340
- Go. - Okay.

677
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,420
Good morning, everybody.

678
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,920
On behalf of the Roman family,

679
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,920
I would like to thank you all for being here today.

680
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,880
I'd like to start with a reading from Ecclesiastes.

681
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,600
"My child, when you come to serve the Lord,

682
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,680
"prepare yourself for trials.

683
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,100
"Be sincere of heart and steadfast,

684
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,360
"and do not be impetuous in times of adversity.

685
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,110
"Cling to him, do not leave him,

686
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,780
"that you may prosper in your last days.

687
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,950
"Accept whatever happens to you;

688
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,790
"in periods of humiliation, be patient.

689
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,060
"For in fire gold is tested, and the chosen,

690
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,590
"in the crucible of humiliation.

691
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,210
"Trust in God, and he will help you;

692
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,800
make your ways straight and hope in him."

693
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,430
Word of the Lord.

694
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,470
Thanks be to God.

695
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,150
I love you.

696
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,990
Did the right thing to call me.

697
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,710
My sister Sarah, she died alone in a ditch.

698
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,630
Temperature was minus-4 degrees.

699
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,760
Can only imagine how scared she was.

700
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,220
How alone she was.

701
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,480
Growing up...

702
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,980
My sister was never alone.

703
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,440
Uh, she was always surrounded by her friends,

704
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,540
cousins, kids from down the block,

705
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,700
kids I didn't even know where the hell--

706
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,990
heck they came from.

707
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,950
You know, they'd just be there,

708
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,260
in the kitchen one day, drinking pop out of a two liter,

709
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,620
waiting for my sister.

710
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,420
She drew people to her because she was warm.

711
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,640
She was loving, and she was always herself.

712
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,640
Strong and stubborn.

713
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,350
She was a fighter.

714
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,770
When they found her...

715
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,570
My sister had scratches

716
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,780
on her hands and knees from crawling,

717
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,950
from fighting.

718
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,290
But there was no one there to save her.

719
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,960
She screamed for help, but no one heard her.

720
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,500
She was screaming weeks before.

721
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,340
Sarah needed help.

722
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,850
But I wasn't there for her.

723
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,900
"Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper."

724
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,940
"But he who confesses

725
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,420
and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

726
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,320
Proverbs 28:13.

727
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,450
If you ask me, that's a lie.

728
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,510
You can't just recite a passage, say a few Hail Marys,

729
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,830
and then wash away your sins.

730
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,090
And we shouldn't be able to.

731
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,320
We should be required to carry around our sins

732
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,010
for the rest of our years.

733
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,010
All the pain and guilt too.

734
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,390
We need to feel them

735
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,640
so we can do better next time.

736
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,750
So that we can be there the next time

737
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,730
someone screams for help.

738
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,100
- That was a hell of a eulogy. - It was honest.

739
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,770
You believe in absolution?

740
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,320
Kim, I don't think like that.

741
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,410
Yeah, I know.

742
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,370
I appreciate you waiting till the service was over.

743
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,290
So how we gonna do this?

744
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,050
We're not.

745
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,180
Logan Peters deserved what he got.

746
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,020
As for the person responsible...

747
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,710
Well, we're gonna continue our investigation,

748
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,020
but it's no longer a top priority.

749
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,360
I mean, we'll keep you--

750
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,030
keep you posted with any new information, but

751
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,990
other than that...

752
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,290
I wish you the best.

753
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,630
What just happened?

754
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,010
I don't know.

755
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,020
Sean.

756
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
I think you're right.

757
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,820
Maybe we should be required to carry this pain...

758
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,870
But then don't we get to decide what we do with it?
