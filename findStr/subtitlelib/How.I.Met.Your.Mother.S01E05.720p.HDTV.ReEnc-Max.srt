OLDER TED: So, kids, would you like to
hear the story of the time I went deaf?

2
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:19,675
- Why does he even ask?
- I know, he's just gonna tell us anyway.

3
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:21,873
I sure am. It all began...

4
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:24,665
<i>when Robin strolled into the bar and said...
</i>

5
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,674
- Say you're my bitch.
- I'm your bitch.

6
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:27,563
Why this time?

7
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:32,227
Because tonight,
I am getting us all into Okay.

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,552
Okay? Awesome!

9
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,611
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,876
Okay is the name of a club.

11
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,465
Yeah, it's supposed to be
incredibly exclusive.

12
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,493
This friend of mine once waited
outside for two hours, couldn't get in.

13
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,601
A friend of yours named you?

14
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:48,177
No, a friend of mine named, shut up!

15

Yeah, well, the owner goes to my gym.

16
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,821
It turns out that he is a fan
of my reporting for Metro News 1.

17
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,349
- So now I'm on the list for tonight.
- Nice going, Scherbatsky.

20

own VIP, if you know what I mean.

30

- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
- Chug! Come on! Chug! Chug!

34

I don't know, I just felt embarrassed.

35
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,661
Claire's my age, and she and her husband
do all this classy grown-up stuff.

36
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,938
Maybe we should start doing
some grown-up stuff.

37
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,558
That's some pretty grown-up stuff
we did this morning.

38
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,275
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,828
Maybe we should have a winetasting party.

40
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,659
I like wine. I like tasting.

41
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,285
You know I can party. Let's do it.
Let's rock it. Maturity style!

42

will not be joining us.

47
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:29,267
My friend Kelly's gonna be there.

48
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,904
- Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love.
- Oh, you are gonna love Kelly.

49
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:35,723
She's fun, she's smart,
she lives in the moment.

51

- Oh, and she's totally hot.
- Okay.

52
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,236
I guess I could take her off your hands
for an evening.

53
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,594
So, do you have any other
hot single friends?

54
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,946
No. Kelly works in...

55
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,939
- Oh, no, Ted! Your blazer.
- What? What? What?

56
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,342
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.
Love it.

57

Oh, wait, no, that's just my shirt

One of the 24 similarities
between girls and fish...

to shiny objects.

heterosexual relationship...

00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,314
Find a cutlet, lock her in early,

79

These strategies ever work for you?

81
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:11,224
The question is, do these strategies
ever not work for me?

82
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,658
Either way, the answer's
about half the time.

about getting into the VIP room.

170
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:57,845
I have been in tons of VIP rooms.
Not exactly a VIP room virgin.

171
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,721
But seriously, call me back.

172
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,952
Oh, I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm on the list.

173
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:09,029
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.

174
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,434
But I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm a reporter for Channel 1.

175
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:16,078
There's a Channel 1? Back of the line.

176
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,244
Should've snuck in with Brian Affleck.

177
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,276
(EXCLAIMING)

178
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:58,735
Coat wench, do not uncheck
that man's jacket!

179
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,674
Sorry, I was just being dramatic.
You're not a wench.

180
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:03,813
No, no, no, coat wench. I like it.
I should get a sign made up.

181
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,832
Wait. What are you doing here?
Lily let you go?

182
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,814
(SCOFFING) Lily? Who cares, right?

183
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,422
- You are so dead.
- Oh, I'm so dead.

184
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:11,968
- Well, I'm going home.
- No!

185
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:15,484
I put my ass and probably other parts
of my body on the line...

186
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,292
to come down here and party with my bro.

187
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,694
- Now damn it, we're gonna party.
- All right. One beer.

188
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:24,150
Yes. Finally I don't have
to wait a half an hour for a drink.

189
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:27,622
Yeah!

190
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:30,086
No tannins!

191
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,391
<i>Oh, man. I can't believe
I forgot to tell you this.</i>

192
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:34,622
<i>This is important to the story.</i>

193
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,102
<i>Earlier that day,
Marshall went to the dentist...</i>

194
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,943
<i>and got a temporary crown put in.</i>

195
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,262
<i>Okay, so anyway...</i>

196
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:47,640
What?

197
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:50,682
C'mon, let's go!

198
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,783
I'm staying!

199
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:53,829
What?

200
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,263
Marshall, are you okay?

201
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,029
<i>(PHONE RINGING)</i>

202
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:29,460
<i>OLDER TED: Again, I wasn't there,
so I'm a little foggy on the details.</i>

203
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,294
Taxi!

204
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:40,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

205
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:43,478
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.

206
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,550
Can you get me in there?
I kind of need to kill him.

207
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,504
Actually, I can't even get myself in.
I was such a dork.

208
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,414
I get recognized one time
and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts.

209
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,503
I'm no VIP. I'm not even an IP.

210
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:01,340
I'm just a lowly little P
sitting out here in the gutter.

211
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:03,318
You know something?

212
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:07,908
I'd take a P in the gutter
over Julia Roberts any day.

213
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:14,687
There's Barney.

214
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,031
I'm leaving.

215
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:22,350
Hey!

216
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,328
Broke my tooth!

217
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:27,990
Do you have any aspirin?

218
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:33,576
Maybe there's a machine in the restroom.

219
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,186
<i>Now, to this day, I don't know
what happened in there.</i>

220
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,275
<i>But when Marshall came out
a few minutes later...</i>

221
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,381
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:04,670
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?

223
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:09,583
Because all of the stuff
you're supposed to like, usually sucks.

224
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,576
Like these clubs. Or cruises.

225
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:17,227
- Or New Year's Eve.
- Or the Super Bowl.

226
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:20,071
- Or parades.
- The Rockettes.

227
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,332
- Or parades.
- You said that already.

228
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,014
- I really hate parades.
- Okay.

229
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:31,126
He just left in the middle of our own party.
You don't do that.

230
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,591
Unless, of course,
you're chasing after somebody...

231
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:38,410
who's already done it,
and then I think it's okay.

232
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:42,076
Well, I hate to take his side.
But, come on, a winetasting?

233
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,111
What's the big plan for next Saturday?
Scrabble night?

234
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:46,838
Don't check your email.

235
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,260
Why are you becoming this person?

236
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,817
I heard that in college you flashed
a campus tour group on a dare.

237
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,998
Once on a dare.
The other times were just for fun.

238
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,265
I'm not in college anymore.

239
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:05,259
I'd love to go back and be that person
again, but you can't move backwards.

240
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,972
- You can only go forward.
- False.

241
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:09,925
You can go wherever you want.

242
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,567
I guess, the question is,
where do you want to go?

243
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,930
I want to go into this club
and find my fiancé.

244
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,108
- Well, that you can't do.
- You wanna bet?

245
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,570
Follow my lead.

246
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,458
Hey, big guy.

247
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,937
I said, follow my lead.

248
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:35,771
- Yes, please, please.
- Do it, do it.

249
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:36,381
- Follow her lead.
- You have to. Follow it.

250
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:37,369
Please.

251
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,828
Those were the four greatest
and only breasts I have ever seen.

252
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:52,677
Yeah. See, if everyone keeps telling you
something is supposed to be fun,

253
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,140
it's usually not.

254
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,311
- Right.
- Right.

255
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,590
So by that logic, if you and I were to,
say, go out on a date...

256
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,553
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere
that's supposed to be fun.

257
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,832
Right. The DMV it is.

258
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:08,247
- Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.
- Sounds awful. It's a date.

259
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,633
Okay.

260
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:14,334
But there's still one big question
that needs to be answered.

261
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:19,497
How many of these coats do you think
I could put on all at once?

262
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,534
I'll go this way, you go that way.

263
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:06,005
Okay. For the wedge.

264
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,863
Barney?

265
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,142
- Barney.
- Ted.

266
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,560
- Get your coat, we're leaving.
- What?

267
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,777
What happened to that cutlet
you were grinding with?

268
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,539
- That was my cousin Leslie.
- What?

269
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:41,248
No. No. No.
We are not laughing about this, Ted.

270
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:44,812
This is not gonna be some funny story
that we'll be telling in a couple months.

271
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,004
It's not going to be like,
'Hey, remember that time...

272
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,630
'when you were grinding with...' No!

273
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,735
And you know why?

274
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:55,497
<i>Because, italics,
"This night did not happen."</i>

275
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,041
And you promise me
that you will never, ever, ever tell...

276
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,314
another living soul
what transpired here tonight.

277
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,936
- You promise. Promise.
- All right, I promise.

278
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,489
Let's get Marshall and go, okay?

279
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,594
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll taIk to you soon?

280
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,788
- Hey, tip her, Barney.
- Why? I didn't check a coat.

281
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,648
And even if I did, on principle
tip jars have become so...

282
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,225
Funny story. Barney was grinding
with this girl all night...

283
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,817
Fine!

284
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,605
Just...

285
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,185
That's a handy new trick.

286
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:40,061
<i>So Marshall and Lily
rediscovered their youth.</i>

287
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,265
<i>It was nice.</i>

288
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,711
<i>And then it got... icky.</i>

289
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,484
(YELLING) I'm really glad
you guys came out tonight!

290
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:02,859
(YELLING) You know, dude,
can I just say something?

291
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,332
It kind of hurt that you guys
didn't invite me out.

292
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:10,982
I mean, I know things have changed
since I got engaged,

293
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:13,586
but it would've been nice to be asked.

294
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:19,124
- I'm sorry! I assumed you had other plans.
- They played some good songs tonight.

295
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:22,703
- I mean, lately...
- I know, I know, it just, seems like...

296
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,670
suddenly we're living
in two different worlds.

297
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,109
Maybe you've got more in common
with Barney.

298
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,983
- What?
- Are you crazy?

299
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,531
You think I like going to those clubs?

300
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,617
I'd so much rather go
to your fruity little winetasting.

301
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,486
Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf!

302
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:41,489
Where's my purse, where's my...
No, I'm okay.

303
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,665
The problem is you can't do
any of that couple stuff...

304
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,504
unless you have someone to do it with.

305
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,908
And the only way I'm gonna find
that someone is by going out...

306
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:53,659
- and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.
- What?

307
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,609
But, man, when I find her...

308
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,918
we're gonna have some
bad-ass winetastings.

309
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:03,680
It's a plan.

310
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,002
Hey, maybe it'll be that cute coat-check girl.

311
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:11,435
Yeah. Maybe it will be.

312
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:12,517
<i>It wasn't.</i>

313
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,650
You know, Ted.
I don't say this nearly enough

314
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,314
- but I really value...
- Hey, that place has great salads.
