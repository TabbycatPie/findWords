她說她希望我死  而你當上總統
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.

27
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,130
我希望一個女人入主白宮
I want a woman in the White House.

28
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,120
我們需要你讓自己跟佐伊·巴恩斯的死掛上鉤
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.

我殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
I killed Zoe Barnes.

00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,910
你們都已經利用我太久了

所以我將辭去美國總統一職

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,180
-不  克萊爾  -毫無準備  稀里糊涂

如今真難知道能相信誰
It's hard to know who to trust these days.

42
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,630
如果她不赦免我
If she doesn't pardon me...

43
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
我就殺了她
I'll kill her.

"上帝從未想要一個女人統治這片土地
"God never intended a woman to rule this land.

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,110
她是反基督
She is the anti-Christ.

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,030
-還是猶太人"  -猶太人
- And a Jew." - A Jew?

54
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,050
-我們真有必要聽這些嗎  -是的
- Do we really need to hear all of this? - Yes.

55
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,050
一篇未發表的社論
An unpublished editorial.

56
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,680
有個人拿槍指著你的肖像
Someone pointing a gun at your likeness.

57
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,630
網上還有好多這種東西  包括
Lots of other online stuff, including a...

58
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,990
一個比賽
contest...

59
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,450
比什么
For?

60
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,540
比最有創意的殺你的辦法
For the most creative way to kill you.

61
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,640
哪種方法贏了
And the winner?

62
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,910
我不太想說  女士
Rather not say, ma'am.

63
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,920
我想聽  把報告給我  里克
I want to hear. Just hand me the report, Rick.

64
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,730
基本上是  把你剝皮
It involves, essentially, skinning you.

65
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,760
把你的身體切成數塊
Cutting your body into dozens of pieces

66
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,210
然后擺成美國國旗的形狀
and arranging them in the shape of the American flag.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
肉做白條  血做紅條
Flesh for the white stripes, blood for the red.

68
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,000
還有嗎
What else?

69
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,910
很多包含C打頭詞的威脅  女士
Lot of threats involving the C-word, ma'am.

70
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,130
好多好多C打頭的那個詞  很不幸
Lots and lots of the C-word, unfortunately.

71
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,340
-是"克萊爾"嗎  -單子很長
- You mean Claire? - It's a long list.

72
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,820
如果您真想聽  那我...
If you really want me to, I'll--

73
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,070
我不是第一個遭遇威脅的總統
Listen, I am not the first president to face threats.

74
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,720
我知道弗蘭西斯那時  一天里能有好多
I know with Francis, sometimes there were several a day.

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,250
情況差不多嗎
Is it about the same

76
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,750
我們現在面臨的威脅
what we're dealing with here?

77
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,020
這...
It's...

78
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,110
數量明顯上升
significantly up.

79
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,760
上升多少
By how much?

80
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,100
你上任以來  每天收到的威脅
There are roughly four times as many threats

81
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,060
大概是之前的四倍
on any given day since you took office.

82
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,750
而弗蘭西斯死后又翻了一番
Now it's twice that since Francis died.

83
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,840
我以為大家都喜歡寡婦呢
I thought everyone loves a widow.

84
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,140
如果她還是三軍統帥可能就不喜歡了吧
Not if she's also Commander-in-Chief, I guess.

85
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,200
這些人并不理智  總統女士
These are not rational people, Madam President.

86
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,250
但女士  就今天的威脅而言
But, ma'am, as far as today's threat,

87
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,920
關于你的第一次公開露面
regarding your first scheduled appearance--

88
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,450
我們要取消
We're canceling the appearance.

89
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,050
我們不能取消
We're not canceling.

90
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,090
那是軍事基地
It's a military base.

91
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,560
那對于總統該是世界上最安全的地方了
That's got to be the safest place on Earth for a president.

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,370
一個身份未知的士兵做出了嚴重威脅...
An anonymous soldier has made a serious threat--

93
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,410
"要代表全美國
"To shoot me in the cunt

94
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,270
給我的屄來一槍"
on behalf of the United States of America."

95
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,370
是的  馬克  我聽說了
Yes, Mark, I heard.

96
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,470
這個威脅并未證實
The threat's unconfirmed.

97
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,200
他說他是今天出征的士兵之一
He says he's among those shipping out today.

98
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,190
誰都能這么說
Anyone can claim that.

99
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,940
還說你無權向敘利亞宣戰
And that you have no right waging war in Syria.

100
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,830
尤其是你
You, in particular.

101
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,600
我們還是別去了  里克  你說是吧
I think we stay away. Rick, don't you agree?

102
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,640
并無證據表明這威脅可信  是吧  里克
There's no proof the threat is credible. Isn't that right, Rick?

103
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,660
我們的情報部門正在調查
Our intelligence division is investigating,

104
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,980
先遣隊已經去了
and the advance team is already there,

105
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,770
但至少要一天
but it'll take at least a day

106
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,960
才能把基地查一遍
to comb through that base.

107
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,750
我認為副總統的提議是最佳選擇
I think what the vice president says is the best course.

108
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,210
或許到明天  你就能...
Maybe by tomorrow you could--

109
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,400
明天就不是獨立日了
Tomorrow is the fifth of July.

110
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,490
-是  女士  -那你說我怎么辦
- Yes, ma'am. - So what do you suggest I do?

111
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,740
祝大家遲到的國慶節快樂嗎
Wish the nation a happy belated birthday?

112
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,290
我們只是擔心你的安全...
Our only concern is your safety--

113
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,770
不能取消
We're not cancelling.

114
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,120
我要讓那些士兵上戰場
I am sending those soldiers onto a battlefield.

115
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,770
美國史上第一位女性總統
The first female president of the United States

116
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,120
才不要在7月4日這天被人嚇得說不出話
is not gonna keep her mouth shut on the Fourth of fucking July.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
蓋拉格中將也能理解的
Lieutenant General Gallagher would understand.

118
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,690
我可以替你出席
I could appear instead.

119
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,380
-替你講話  -停下
- Speak for you. - Stop.

120
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,530
你擔心的是我的安全
Is it my safety that concerns you,

121
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,730
還是我可能背書蓋拉格
or my potential endorsement of Gallagher?

122
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,570
當然是你的安全第一
Your safety first, of course.

123
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,690
但單提她  這是挑釁
But singling her out, that's a provocation.

124
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,660
那又如何
And so?

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,090
我就不能刺激下他們嗎
I can't provoke them?

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,540
你在支持一個謝潑德家族反對的
You're forwarding a candidate the Shepherds are against,

127
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,050
家鄉州候選人
in their home state.

128
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,740
-經過了數月的協商  -這不是協商
- After months of negotiation. - This is not a negotiation,

129
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,480
這是最后通牒  簽署法案  否則
this is an ultimatum. Sign the bill or what?

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,900
否則什么  馬克
Or what, Mark?

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,580
弗蘭西斯想給他的基金會拉資助時
When Francis was looking to finance his foundation,

132
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,300
你為什么給他介紹了比爾和安奈特
why did you point him towards Bill and Annette?

133
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,550
我沒有  是雷蒙德·塔斯克安排的
I didn't. Raymond Tusk arranged it.

134
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,420
也或者是他們聯系了他
Or maybe they reached out to him?

135
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,650
我不記得了
I don't remember.

136
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,430
有什么關系呢  他們現在跟你合作了
I-- What does it matter? They're working with you now.

137
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,580
我要直接見謝潑德兄妹
I need to meet with the Shepherds directly.

138
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,510
總統女士
Madam President.

139
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,490
我去基地前先見他們一面
I'll see them before my appearance at the base.

140
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,080
-不行  -什么
- You can't. - I what?

141
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,230
我會通知他們的
I'll let them know.

142
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
謝謝
Thank you.

143
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,650
您4:45要到基地
You're due at the base by 4:45,

144
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,830
然后8:30回來這里
which will have you back here by 8:30.

145
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,150
煙火秀9點過后開始
The fireworks show begins right after nine.

146
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,330
《紐約觀察家》想請您過下這些照片
And the Examiner would love your okay on the photos.

147
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,280
那個聲音的來源查出什么進展了嗎
Is there any progress on the source of the sound?

148
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,060
總務管理局還在調查
The GSA is still looking into it.

149
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,980
他們在檢查樓上樓下的地板
They're checking the floorboards above and below,

150
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,430
-以防...  -我不想再等了
- in case there's-- - I don't want to wait anymore.

151
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,360
請轉告行政管家
Please tell the executive housekeeper

152
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,080
把前總統的東西收拾好
I'd like the former president's belongings packed up.

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,530
我會去處理的
I'll have it taken care of.

154
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,590
他多年前對你們說的那句話是不對的
It's not true what he told you all those years ago.

155
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,700
痛苦有兩種  一種讓你變強  一種毫無價值
That there are two kinds, useful and useless.

156
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,850
其實只有一種
There's only one kind.

157
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,470
痛苦就是痛苦
Pain is pain.

158
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,540
弗蘭西斯
Francis...

159
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,580
我和你結束了
I'm done with you.

160
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,200
瞧
There.

161
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,020
沒有痛苦了
No more pain.

162
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,730
你一整天都做這個嗎
You do this all day?

163
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,400
我在接受精神科觀察  賽斯
I'm under psychiatric observation, Seth.

164
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,940
就得這樣
This is what you do.

165
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,900
你的新裁縫是誰
Who's your new tailor?

166
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,660
總得打扮得像樣
You gotta look the part.

167
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,180
他們什么時候做出決定
So, when do they decide

168
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,290
你瘋沒瘋
whether you're crazy or not?

169
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,740
因為如果你沒瘋
Because if you're not,

170
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,700
你應該來為我們工作
you should come work for us.

171
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,590
我們
Us?

172
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,000
你不也就才在那兒工作了五分鐘嗎
Have you been working there for about five minutes?

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,420
其實都一個月了
It's been a month, actually.

174
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,490
他還尸骨未寒呢
So his body wasn't even cold.

175
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,260
他也會希望如此的
It's what he would have wanted.

176
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,260
安德伍德基金會基本上將會參照
The Underwood Foundation was basically gonna be modeled after

177
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,850
謝潑德自由基金會來建設
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

178
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,330
我不需要這份工作
I don't need the job.

179
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,390
作為認罪殺人犯  你還挺自信啊
Well, for a confessed murderer, you're pretty confident.

180
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,730
我就要被赦免了
I'm about to be pardoned.

181
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,930
什么
Pardon?

182
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,370
你真覺得她會赦免你
You really think that she's gonna give you one?

183
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,020
你還是那樣  什么都不知道
As usual, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

184
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,070
他在加夫尼下葬時  出席的人數
You know, there wasn't the kind of crowd that you'd expect for him

185
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,150
沒有按說該有的那么多
down there in Gaffney.

186
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,580
他本想葬在阿靈頓公墓的
He wanted to be buried in Arlington.

187
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,020
而不是挨著他父親
Not next to his father.

188
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,630
他妻子可不是這么說的
That's not what his wife said.

189
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,840
告訴我
Tell me something.

190
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,850
她哭過嗎
She even shed a tear?

191
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,820
知道嗎
You know...

192
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,350
老實說  我都有點嫉妒
I'm almost envious, to tell you the truth.

193
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,590
就算他進了墳墓
That even beyond the grave,

194
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,310
你也愿意為弗蘭西斯·安德伍德赴湯蹈火
you'd do anything for Francis Underwood.

195
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,610
道格  你給我拿打火機了嗎
Doug, do you have my lighter?

196
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,770
多謝
Much obliged.

197
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,770
那是我想的那個人嗎
Was that who I thought it was?

198
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,960
弗萊德·安博格  他也瘋了
Fred Amburg? He went off the deep end?

199
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,740
每個人都有點問題  賽斯
Everyone has problems, Seth.

200
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,640
尤其是自以為沒有的那些
Especially the ones who think they don't.

201
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,810
-克萊爾  -安奈特
- Claire. - Annette.

202
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,070
你收到我的信了嗎
Oh, did you get my note?

203
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,660
我還沒能鼓起勇氣讀悼念信呢
Oh, I haven't had the courage to read the condolences yet.

204
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,410
很高興看到你終于出來活動了
It's good to see you finally out and about.

205
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,410
你受了多少苦啊
Oh, what you've been through.

206
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,870
你最了解了
You know all about it.

207
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,750
很長一段時間里  我假裝他還活著
Well, for a long time, I pretended he was still alive.

208
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,750
只是出城了
Out of town.

209
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,160
是我們的兒子鄧肯挽救了我
It was our son Duncan that really saved me.

210
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,290
當然了  我們結婚可遠沒有
Of course, we weren't married anywhere near

211
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,720
你和弗蘭克那么久
as long as you and Frank.

212
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,590
克萊爾·黑爾
Claire Hale.

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,350
九年前
Nine years.

214
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,270
晚春
Late spring,

215
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,190
太陽谷
Sun Valley.

216
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,180
你一點沒變
You look exactly the same.

217
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,560
城市催人老
Well, it's cities that age you,

218
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,100
我總跟人那么說
it's what I tell everyone.

219
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,230
希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind

220
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,170
跟幾位我們最好的朋友打招呼
saying hello to a few of our closest friends.

221
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,480
他們就是來喝杯雞尾酒
They're just here for a cocktail before the--

222
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,370
等著太陽落山后  其余的客人到來
the sun goes down and the rest of the party shows up.

223
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,210
我妹妹的煙火秀算是成了個傳統了
My sister's fireworks show have become a bit of a tradition.

224
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,840
別擔心  他們會保密的
Don't worry. They know how to be discreet.

225
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,920
斯考特剛收購了奈克西斯安保
Scotty here just got his hands on Nexis Security.

226
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
聽說你還要就此事跟副總統談
I heard you are speaking to the vice president about this.

227
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,250
就是一家維和公司
It's a company of peacekeepers, mostly.

228
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,360
有構建國際合作的大潛力
Oh, tremendous potential to create global partnerships.

229
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,740
是你丈夫幫我談妥了協議
Your husband helped me secure the deal.

230
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
我本想拉他進董事會的
I wanted to bring him onto the Board.

231
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,570
比爾還說...
Bill was saying...

232
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,000
是啊  我還說呢
Yes, I was just saying.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,670
他們為什么要在
Why in the world do they play

234
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,530
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}由柴科夫斯基創作
紀念1812年俄國人民擊退拿破侖大軍的入侵
作品以曲中的炮火聲聞名  一些演出中還會真用大炮

235
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,000
煙火秀上演奏《1812序曲》
the "1812 Overture" at a fireworks show?

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,530
那可是徹頭徹尾的俄國曲子
It's Russian, for Chrissakes, in every sense.

237
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,510
這是塔比莎
This is Tabitha.

238
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,670
彼得斯  我知道
Peters, I know.

239
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,610
弗蘭克
Frank...

240
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,760
-他今天本來也會到的吧  -是啊
- Wasn't he planning to be here today? - He was.

241
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,630
你肯定很想他
You must miss him terribly.

242
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,530
我曾多次跟他進行過長時間的激烈對話
I had some long and hard-fought conversations with him.

243
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,810
他本想幫我解決內華達州那邊
He was going to help me resolve this AFL-CIO thing

244
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,770
曠日持久的勞聯-產聯的問題
that's been going on forever out in Nevada,

245
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,560
當然了  是在你的幫助下
with your help, of course.

246
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,220
工會如果阻擋創新
When the union stands in the way of innovation,

247
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,310
就是自尋死路
it's sentencing itself to death.

248
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
我很欣賞你堅持與黨派站在一起
I do admire the way you hang on to your party.

249
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,840
如此忠誠
Your loyalty.

250
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,200
這是真的嗎  據說南茜·蓋拉格中將
Did I hear that Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher

251
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,390
今天稍后會與你一同露面
will be appearing with you later today?

252
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,580
我認為她能是個好候選人
I think she'd make an excellent candidate,

253
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,100
如果她決定競選的話
if she decides to run, of course.

254
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,340
她絕對會的
Oh, she's going to run.

255
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,930
總統日程很緊
The president is on a tight schedule.

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,230
失陪
Excuse me.

257
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,170
這真令人沒想到
Well, this is a surprise.

258
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,980
你知道中西部的人不喜歡意料之外的事
You know how Midwesterners feel about those.

259
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,270
別聽他的  你也該出來了
Oh, don't listen to him. It's about time you came out.

260
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
我們似乎有事要談
Seems we have some things to discuss.

261
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,930
是啊
Yeah.

262
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,230
就這場特別選舉來說  克萊爾
Well, as far as this special election is concerned, Claire,

263
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,470
你要知道即將退休的蓋拉格女士
you need to know that the soon-to-be-retiring Miss Gallagher

264
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,700
是絕對不行的
is out of question.

265
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,320
我很高興我們都喜歡
And I'm happy to see we're both fans

266
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,780
《獨立宣言》
of the Declaration of Independence,

267
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,300
天賦人權什么的
unalienable rights and all that.

268
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,790
但你待會兒要發表的演講里寫著...
But it says down here in the speech you're gonna give later--

269
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,960
我支持蓋拉格女士
Miss Gallagher has my support.

270
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,070
我相信馬克表達了我們的擔憂
I believe Mark conveyed our concerns.

271
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,210
希望他也表達了我的
And communicated mine, I hope.

272
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,780
她褪去軍裝就是個支持大政府的民主黨
She's a tax and spend Democrat underneath that uniform.

273
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,430
-是簡歷卓越的愛國者  -克萊爾
- A patriot with a pristine resume. - Claire.

274
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,320
而且高調反對讓私人承包商
Who is very vocal about keeping private contractors

275
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,710
-插手美軍行動  -就算作為協商籌碼
- away from US military operations. - Even as a negotiating point,

276
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,870
也有比她強的
you can do better than her.

277
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,180
我厭倦了你的拖延  總統女士
And I am tired of these delays, Madam President.

278
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,090
你該說到做到了
It is time for you to deliver.

279
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,570
-你丈夫和我有協議的  -弗蘭西斯死了
- Your husband and I had an agreement. - Francis is dead.

280
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,140
-我們得到了承諾  -不是我給的
- Promises were made. - Not by me.

281
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,550
就像你一樣  我也想自己談協議
Just like you, I like to negotiate my own agreements.

282
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,720
別搞錯了
And make no mistake about it,

283
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,100
中將并不是個例外
the lieutenant general is not an anomaly.

284
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,700
我知道  我看到了你的中期選舉候選人
I know that. I've seen your list of candidates for the midterms--

285
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,830
是啊  大都是女人
Yes, mostly women.

286
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,000
我才不管他們是男是女
I don't care what sex they are.

287
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,750
另外  沒人比我更喜歡女人了
And for the record, nobody loves women more than me.

288
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,120
但你的候選人名單  會拖垮這個國家
But this slate of yours, it will bankrupt the country.

289
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,230
會讓我們倒退一代  會完全...
They will set us back a generation. They will completely--

290
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,760
支持我  和我的立場
Support me and what I stand for.

291
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,700
那是什么
And what is that?

292
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,550
-得了  比爾  -不  你說啊
- Oh, come on, Bill. - No, no. Tell me.

293
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,190
我想聽聽  你的使命是什么
I wanna know. What's your mission?

294
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,350
-我想知道你的綱領是什么  -得了
- I wanna know what your platform is. - Oh, please.

295
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,600
我知道你想一下肅清華府
I know you'd like to drown DC all at once.

296
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,380
但我這就告訴你  我不會允許的
But I'm gonna tell you right now, I cannot let that happen.

297
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,710
我依然相信政府
I still believe in government

298
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,740
相信它有能力改善其公民的日常生活
and its ability to make the everyday lives of its citizens better.

299
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,480
-嗯  -你不想支持我的候選人
- Yeah. - You don't wanna support my slate,

300
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,470
好啊
that's fine.

301
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,560
-克萊爾  -我只要求你別礙事
- Claire... - All I ask is stay out of the way.

302
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,160
你桌上有一份法案
There's a bill sitting on your desk.

303
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,660
這份法案耗時數年
A bill that took years...

304
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,460
耗費財力才獲得通過
and money to get passed.

305
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,020
你簽署了
You sign that,

306
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,120
我就知道我在白宮里有朋友
and I know I got a friend in the White House.

307
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,530
如果你不簽
If not...

308
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,070
-那我就沒有  -夠了
- Then I don't. - Enough.

309
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,610
有她在  你是不會有好果子吃的
Nothing good happens to you when she's around.

310
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,590
相信我
Nothing.

311
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,860
你為什么贊助了弗蘭西斯
Why did you come out for Francis?

312
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,230
他的基金會
For his foundation?

313
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,510
我沒覺得你真喜歡過他
I don't think you ever really liked him.

314
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,860
可能從未尊重過他  為什么現在支持他
Probably never respected him. Why back him now?

315
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,270
因為他把你給了我們
Because he gave us you.

316
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,730
告訴我們的朋友們  我會趕上下來看煙火的
Tell our friends I'll be back down in time for the fireworks.

317
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,520
你要知道  我一直喜歡弗蘭克
Just so you know, I always liked Frank.

318
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,130
喜歡他的絕望
His desperation.

319
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,130
很遺憾你不能留下
I'm sorry you can't stay.

320
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,240
我很喜歡組織我們的煙火秀
I do enjoy curating our little show.

321
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,640
我出行時收集了各種煙火彈
I collect a variety of fireworks shells as I travel.

322
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,920
意大利  西班牙  中國
Italy, Spain, China.

323
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,050
你知道最難做的色彩是什么嗎
Do you know what the hardest color to make is?

324
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,430
-紅色嗎  -不  紅色很簡單
- Red? - No, red's easy.

325
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,010
白色也很簡單
White's easy.

326
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,290
是藍色
It's blue.

327
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,920
銅和溫度的化學調劑很難弄
Very tricky chemistry involving copper and heat.

328
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,680
真正的亮藍色是非常不好做的
A truly bright blue is extremely elusive.

329
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,750
不管弗蘭西斯承諾了什么  做了什么
Whatever Francis promised or did...

330
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,170
都跟他一起入土了
is buried with him.

331
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,300
我知道
No, I know.

332
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,990
我們都得對他放手
We all need to let him go.

333
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,280
從頭做起
Start from some kind of scratch.

334
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,470
但你肯定很難安吧
Though it must haunt you,

335
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,170
他就在床上你身旁長眠不起
the fact that he died next to you in bed.

336
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
親愛的
Hon...

337
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,490
耐心點
be patient.

338
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,780
你是說  她不喜歡這名字嗎
Are you saying, she doesn't like the name?

339
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,920
我覺得她認為名字不夠完整
I think she finds it incomplete.

340
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,610
《綜合安全法案》有什么不好
What's wrong with the Comprehensive Safety Act?

341
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,000
那《綜合化學安全法案》呢
Comprehensive Chemical Safety Act?

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,120
也可以再回去用《精簡安全法案》
Or we could go back to the Smarter Safety Act.

343
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,580
她會更喜歡"精簡"嗎
Would she like "smarter" better?

344
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,200
不行  得有個好縮寫
No, we need a good acronym.

345
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,510
副總統先生
Mr. Vice President?

346
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,130
馬克
Mark?

347
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,980
嗯  是啊
Yeah. Agreed.

348
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,900
我們還曾考慮過《不安全監管廢止法案》
At one point, we talked about the Repeal Unsafe Regulation Act.

349
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,870
如果能再加個L開頭的就是"農村"了
That's RURAL if we come up with an L.

350
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,950
立法嗎
Legislation?

351
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,260
那跟其他的湊不到一起去
That doesn't make sense with the rest of it.

352
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,890
"農村"這詞不好念  "安全"更好
"RURAL" is too hard to say. "SAFE" is good.

353
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,590
安全  未來
Safety. Future.

354
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,240
-"未來"好  -聯邦綜合有毒危險物...
- I like "FUTURE." - Federal Universal Toxic and Unsafe...

355
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,300
-去監管法案  -好
- Regulation Eradication. - Okay.

356
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,030
-那就《未來法案》了  -可以
- The FUTURE Act. - That could work.

357
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,090
可以問一下  副總統先生
May I ask, Mr. Vice President,

358
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,130
除了名字她還有其他疑慮嗎
does her hesitation go beyond the name?

359
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,870
她會想通的  我猜...
She'll come around. I'm guessing...

360
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,930
到今天晚上吧
by the end of the day.

361
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,700
因為不管是什么名字
Because in one form or another,

362
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
這份法案已經在她桌上放了...
this bill has been on her desk since--

363
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,050
她會簽的  亨利
She'll sign it, Henry.

364
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,360
比爾
Bill.

365
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,510
你要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

366
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,540
把她從自己的軍事基地拽回來嗎
Yank her from her own military base?

367
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,530
在人類大事件的過程中  當一個人
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary

368
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,520
有必要解除將他們與另一個人
for one people to dissolve the political bands

369
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,790
聯系在一起的政治紐帶時
which have connected them with another,

370
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,830
你得當機立斷
you just have to do it.

371
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,240
切斷關系
Sever the relationship.

372
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,510
我們國家的立國文獻
Our nation's founding document,

373
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,520
《獨立宣言》
the Declaration of Independence--

374
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,250
美國的獨立
America's independence--

375
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,490
是經過艱苦斗爭贏來的
was hard-fought and hard-won.

376
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,770
你還在聽嗎
Are you still there?

377
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,090
我們的國父構想了一個自由國度
Our Founding Fathers imagined a nation that was free.

378
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,190
擺脫專制
Free from despotism.

379
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,860
擺脫暴政
Free from absolute tyranny.

380
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,700
擺脫國王壓迫
Free from an oppressive king.

381
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,150
你想弗蘭西斯了嗎
Do you miss Francis?

382
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,510
暴君有多種多樣
Tyrants come in many forms.

383
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,830
從美國政治寡頭
From the American oligarchs

384
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,850
企圖改變社會根本
trying to change the very fabric of our society,

385
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,130
到在海外叫囂的獨裁者
to autocrats threatening from abroad.

386
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,120
我們每個人都要維護我們的命運
Now, each one of us has to defend our destiny.

387
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,460
在我看來
And as I see it,

388
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,210
抵抗暴政是戰爭的唯一合理理由
the fight against tyranny is the only justification for war.

389
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,900
我作為總統的頭一百天很艱難
My first 100 days as president have been difficult.

390
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,670
我失去了丈夫
I lost my husband.

391
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,450
我們本來正要慶祝結婚30周年
We were about to celebrate 30 years together.

392
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,360
但我了解他的心愿
But I know what he would want.

393
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,860
他會希望我停止哀傷  繼續生活
For me to stop mourning and carry on.

394
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,270
在南茜·蓋拉格中將這樣的女性的幫助下
With the help of women like Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher,

395
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,710
我的任期將充滿實干
my presidency will not rest.

396
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,600
南茜深深激勵了我
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.

397
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,860
她是不倦的勇士
A tireless warrior.

398
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,880
我向她也向你們保證
I promise her and all of you

399
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
我會為我們的民主國家
that I will work on behalf of the rights

400
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,010
這241年間所贏得的權利和自由而奮斗
and freedoms earned over the last 241 years of our democracy.

401
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,670
當我看著今天
As I look into the eyes

402
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,630
站在我面前的這些勇敢戰士們的眼睛
of you brave soldiers standing before me today...

403
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,430
是這樣的
Here's the thing.

404
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,080
我此刻無比驕傲
I'm feeling so proud right now.

405
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,320
為做你們的三軍統帥驕傲
Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.

406
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,830
不管弗蘭西斯這五年來對你們說了什么
Whatever Francis told you the last five years,

407
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,540
一個字都別信
don't believe a word of it.

408
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,820
我們國家已經241歲了  朋友們
Our country is 241 years old, my friends.

409
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,750
我們祝這個偉大國家生日快樂吧
Let's wish this great nation a happy birthday.

410
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,050
跟我一起說

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,420

我們的情況會有所不同
It's going to be different for you and me.

414
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,890
再來一次
One more time.

415
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,480
我要對你說實話

卡拉馬祖  總統先生

427
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,700
-抱歉  總統女士  -沒事的
- Excuse me, Madam President. - That's quite all right.

428
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,420
我其實討厭"女士"這個詞
I actually hate "Madam."

429
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,910
讓我覺得自己是管理妓院的老鴇
Makes me sound like I'm running a brothel

430
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,220
不是在管理國家
and not a country.

431
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,520
-謝謝你的服役  -謝謝  總統女士
- Thank you for your service. - Thank you, Madam President.

434
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,410
南本德  女士

435
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,280
我愛印第安納州
Oh, I love Indiana.

436
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,680
我是在您上任前不久入伍的

437
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,510
我向你和美國所有女性保證
Well, I promise you and every woman in this country

438
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,210
在我任期內
that during my presidency

439
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,850
會確保《平權修正案》的關鍵部分
the key components of the Equal Rights Amendment

440
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,390
終能獲得通過
will finally pass.

441
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,200
我會確保這一點的
I'm going to make sure of it.

442
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,860
我希望你知道我支持你
I want you to know I support you.

443
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,420
你制定好計劃了嗎
Do you even have a plan?

444
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,370
你說什么
What did you say?

445
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,040
一個不會把我們都害死的計劃
One that won't get us all killed?

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,660
天吶
Oh, man...

447
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,220
如果我是個男人你還會這么問我嗎
Would you have asked me that if I were a man?

448
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,010
總統女士
Madam President!

449
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,610
請回答一個問題
One question, please!

450
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,240
我們還有多久能上飛機
How much longer till we get to the plane?

451
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,790
還有25分鐘左右  總統女士

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,250
好  謝謝
Okay, thank you.

453
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,070
該死
Shit!

454
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,590
-她中槍了嗎  -趴下  趴下
- Is she shot? - Stay down, stay down!

455
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,120
有人開槍  有人開槍
Shots fired! Shots fired!

456
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,450
你沒事吧  總統女士
Are you okay, Madam President?

457
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,350
-你沒事吧  -沒事
- Are you all right? - Yes.

458
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,530
孤星安全
Lone Star is safe.

459
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,700
先生  剛有人企圖行刺總統
Sir, someone just tried to kill the president.

460
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,920
我剛收到警報  她沒事吧
I just got the alert. Is she all right?

461
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,690
這邊請
This way.

462
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,760
林肯
Lincoln,

463
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,910
加菲爾德  麥金利
Garfield, McKinley,

464
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,740
肯尼迪
Kennedy.

465
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,480
刺殺成功  一共四起
Successful assassinations, total of four.

466
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,170
企圖刺殺  是九起嗎
The attempts-- Nine?

467
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,430
杰克遜  兩個羅斯福
Jackson, both Roosevelts.

468
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,940
特魯門  福特兩次
Truman. Ford twice.

469
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,560
里根
Reagan...

470
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,250
第一任安德伍德  還有...
the first Underwood and...

471
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,940
我得說  那個企圖殺我的人
I will say, whoever tried to kill me,

472
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,520
事與愿違了
perversely,

473
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,390
這是100天以來  我第一次真正感到受尊重
it's the first sign of real respect I've gotten in 100 days.

474
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,660
有人企圖殺她
Somebody tried to kill her.

475
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,800
比爾
Bill.

476
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,660
也難怪吧
Can you blame them?

477
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,110
安德伍德夫婦都挺耳背的
The Underwoods have always been hard of hearing.

478
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,040
她不是他
She's not him.

479
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,420
是啊
No, no.

480
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,870
她的確不是
She is not.

481
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,160
這你最清楚了
You know that better than anyone.

482
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,630
公開了嗎
Is it public?

483
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,280
被特勤局保密了  據說是標準程序
Secret Service shut it down. Standard procedure, apparently.

484
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,750
威脅會招致威脅
Threats beget threats.

485
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,480
比爾
Bill...

486
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,750
是你搞的嗎
were you behind this?

487
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,910
我們要錯過煙火了
We're gonna miss the show.

488
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,630
-你們好嗎  -總統女士
- How are y'all? - Madam President.

489
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,560
真抱歉
Hi, I'm so sorry.

490
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,860
我想為延遲出發表示道歉
I want to apologize for the late departure.

491
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,880
我知道你們都還有家人和慶典在等著你們
I know you all have families and festivities waiting.

492
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,660
總統女士  我可以問問發生了什么嗎
Madam President, may I ask what happened?

493
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,410
因為安全原因  "野獸"總統專車改道了
The Beast was re-routed due to security concerns.

494
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,510
很正常的
It's pretty routine.

495
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,050
我知道我已經挺久沒來過后面了
I know it's been a while since I've been back here.

496
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,740
我想祝大家國慶節快樂
I just wanted to wish you all a very happy Fourth,

497
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,780
雖然你們要明天才能慶祝了
even if you're gonna be celebrating it on the fifth.

498
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,850
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

499
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,300
你的講話  之后...
Your speech, afterwards with--

500
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,210
是啊  那名新兵
Yes, the new recruit.

501
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,160
如果一名新兵  尤其還是女兵
If a new recruit, especially a female one,

502
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,500
不能表達自己的看法
can't speak her mind,

503
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,000
那我真不知我們生活在什么樣的國家里了
I don't know what kind of country we actually are.

504
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,060
如果你們沒啤酒了一定要說
And be sure to tell us if you run out of beer.

505
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,900
因為我敢肯定我們還有幾箱
Because I am sure there's a couple of cases

506
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,050
是卡特政府時期留下的
left over from the Carter administration.

507
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,390
你是新來的
And you're new.

508
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,050
是的  女士  梅樂蒂·科魯茲
Yes, ma'am. Melody Cruz.

509
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,730
我是首都電視的
I'm with Beltway Television.

510
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,030
希望大家對你還算熱情
Well, I hope everyone is making you feel at home.

511
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,470
很熱情
Very much so.

512
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,370
很榮幸終于見到了您
It's an honor to finally meet you.

513
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,280
我有點激動了  抱歉
I'm a bit overwhelmed, sorry.

514
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,960
-沒事  我不咬人  -我知道
- Don't worry, I don't bite. - No, I know.

515
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,880
很奇怪  我本該采訪您丈夫的
It's strange, I was supposed to interview your husband.

516
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,220
本來安排在他死后的幾天
It was scheduled for a few days after he died.

517
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,810
本來會是一篇獨家專訪
It was going to be an exclusive.

518
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,880
我們已做了幾次預采訪
We'd had a number of pre-interviews.

519
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,910
也說定了一些問題
Questions we'd agreed on.

520
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,380
什么樣的問題
Questions like?

521
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,070
比如  總統會赦免他嗎
Like, was the president going to pardon him?

522
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,870
以及何時
And when?

523
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,000
你會嗎  甚至是在他死后
Will you? Even now, posthumously?

524
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,040
我知道你跟《紐約觀察家》做了專訪
I know you did an exclusive with The New York Examiner,

525
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,050
但我猜那只會停留于表面
but I'm guessing that's only going to scratch the surface.

526
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,280
我相信你還有更多想說的
I bet you have more to say

527
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,540
-關于你的婚姻狀況  -小姐
- about the state of your marriage-- - Miss...

528
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,480
科魯茲小姐  是吧
Cruz, is it?

529
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,990
不知道有人跟你說過沒有
I don't know if anyone's told you,

530
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,270
但總統來飛機這一區時
but when the president visits this part of the plane,

531
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,450
一般是默認為不做記錄的
it's usually considered off the record.

532
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,690
但等我們落地了  你有什么問題
But you can ask my press secretary anything you like

533
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,300
都可以問我的新聞發言人
once we're back on the ground.

534
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,790
你今晚尤其地安靜
You're especially quiet this evening.

535
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,080
或許我有點焦躁
Maybe I'm a little agitated.

536
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,810
我們的病人對煙火的反應都不佳
Our patients don't do too well when it comes to fireworks.

537
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
抱歉
Pardon me.

538
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,280
怎么了
Yes?

539
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,340
我不明白我們會面時  你為什么還開著它
I don't understand why you leave that on when we're meeting.

540
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,460
反正你也不會說點什么新東西
Well, it's not like you're saying anything different or new.

541
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,250
你照本宣科的執著都堪稱可敬了
Your dedication to your script would be admirable

542
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,290
只是這太讓人擔心
if it weren't so concerning.

543
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,690
再過幾周  我就要出席一場聽證會
In a few weeks, I'll be appearing at a hearing

544
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,170
就你的心理狀態作證
regarding your state of mind

545
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,600
至于你的供認
and when it comes to your confession,

546
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,010
有罪之人也會時不時改變說辭
even a guilty man changes his story now and then.

547
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,320
你聽命于誰
Who do you answer to?

548
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,160
你為誰工作
I mean, who do you work for?

549
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,770
你
You.

550
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,930
至少該是這意思
That's the idea, anyway.

551
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,370
每個人都有老板的
Everybody works for somebody.

552
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,190
我曾經的老板是一個不肯認輸的人
I worked for a man who refused to fail.

553
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,840
我尊重那點
I respected that.

554
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,460
也很感激
I appreciated it.

555
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,350
沒有他我早死了
I'd be dead without him.

556
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,230
為什么
Why?

557
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,790
我原本是一個議員的助理
I was working as an aide for a congressman.

558
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,270
他理想化又天真
He was idealistic and naive.

559
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,860
一看就沒有連任的命
Had one-term written all over him.

560
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,830
但我需要份工作  需要個去處
But I needed a job, a place to be.

561
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,080
我當時在勉強支撐
I was barely keeping it together.

562
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,170
弗蘭西斯和我在一場活動上相識
Francis and I met at some function.

563
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,670
就是那種站著的活動
You know, the kind you stand up at.

564
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,080
我不知道他怎么知道的  但我車里有八瓶酒
I don't know how he knew, but I had eight bottles in my trunk.

565
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,750
那晚他找到我家時  我已經喝了四瓶
I got through four that night when he came to my door.

566
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,090
我不記得多少了
I don't remember much.

567
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,480
都很模糊了
Not clearly.

568
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,550
他帶我回了他家
He took me to his home.

569
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,440
但克萊爾...
But Claire...

570
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,770
弗蘭西斯幫我戒了酒
Francis got me dry.

571
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,570
我抖得好厲害  我以為自己會死
I shook so badly I thought I was gonna die.

572
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,470
等我終于戒掉了
And then when I was finally got clean,

573
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,640
他給了我第一份工作
he gave me my first job.

574
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,340
做助理嗎
As an aide?

575
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,970
算是吧
Sort of.

576
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,320
他叫我去找愛荷華州的凱爾議員談談
He asked me to go talk to Congressman Kyle from Iowa.

577
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,060
談什么
To what end?

578
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,310
說服他
To persuade him.

579
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,200
我做到了
And I did.

580
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,570
但克萊爾...
But Claire...

581
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,050
她對待他的方式
The way she treated him,

582
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,100
不論是生前還是死后
in life and in death...

583
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,140
但為他那樣的人工作總要付出代價
But you pay a price, when you work for somebody like him.

584
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,590
欠下人情債
Somebody you owe.

585
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,830
我一個親近的人死于了車禍
Somebody close to me died in a car accident.

586
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,580
所以我才違反了軟禁協議
That's how I broke the terms of my house arrest.

587
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,470
我去看她的車禍現場了
I went to see the site of her wreck.

588
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,670
場面很難看  就在路邊
It was twisted on the side of the road.

589
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,690
我站在那里
I just stood there.

590
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,630
事故嗎
An accident?

591
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,770
他們說是的
So they said.

592
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,040
佐伊·巴恩斯呢
And Zoe Barnes?

593
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,400
我殺了她
I killed her.

594
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,760
為了總統
For the president.

595
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,690
以前他贏了就會這么敲
That's what he used to do when he won.

596
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,370
他給你留下了什么
What did he leave you with?

597
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,350
弗蘭西斯給我的最后一樣東西
Last thing that Francis gave me was

598
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,420
是他桌上的拆信刀
the letter opener from his desk.

599
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,060
是我選的  但是
I mean, I chose it, but...

600
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,960
或許該說他最后給我的一樣東西  是一句道歉
But I guess really the last thing he gave me was an apology.

601
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,150
他死的那晚我跟他說過話
I spoke to him the night he died.

602
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,650
我的任期將充滿實干
My presidency will not rest.

603
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,410
南茜深深激勵了我
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.

604
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,920
她是不倦的勇士
A tireless warrior.

605
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,670
我向她也向你們保證
I promise her and all of you

606
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,680
我會為我們的民主國家
that I will work on behalf of the rights

607
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,910
這241年間所贏得的權利和自由而奮斗
and freedoms earned over the last 241 years of our democracy.

608
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,430
暴君有多種多樣
Tyrants come in many forms...

609
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,390
可悲
Pathetic.

610
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,400
從美國政治寡頭企圖改變
From the American oligarchs trying to change the very...

611
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,990
你真不用休息一兩個小時...
Are you sure you don't want to take an hour or two to--

612
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,420
馬克  我在白宮呢
Mark. I'm inside the White House.

613
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,050
總統辦公室里只有你我  除非你帶槍了
There's only two of us in the Oval, so unless you're packing,

614
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,700
這對我真的是最安全的地方了
it's literally the safest place I can be.

615
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,610
我沒帶槍  總統女士
Well, I'm not packing, Madam President,

616
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,770
但沒人會怪你休息一會兒  喘口氣的
but no one would fault you for taking a breath for a minute.

617
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,140
我氣喘得很勻
I'm breathing just fine.

618
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,940
我們能把這事保密嗎
Can we keep news of this contained?

619
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,800
我已經采取了一切可能措施
I've taken every possible step, I think.

620
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,910
他是什么人
So who is he?

621
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,340
他們在路上進行了采證
Well, they did forensics on the route.

622
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,960
并與空中安保進行了溝通
Compared notes with the aerial detail.

623
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,080
國土安全部和聯調局都已介入
Homeland Secretary and the Bureau were brought in.

624
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,370
他就沒有離開他開槍的地方
He never left the place he took the shot from.

625
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,840
你能直截了當地回答我嗎
Can you answer a single question directly and simply?

626
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,950
他一槍爆了自己的頭
He shot himself in the head

627
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,060
用的是他自己的美軍標準配發手槍
with his own US military-issued handgun.

628
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,780
我們確定槍手就是他
And we're sure he's the one?

629
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,010
是  支持民兵組織  反政府
Yeah. Pro-militia. Anti-government.

630
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,310
去年被開除軍籍  有所有典型特征
Dishonorably discharged last year. All the typical markers.

631
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,990
特勤局確定是他
Secret Service is confident.

632
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,100
聯調局也在調查了
And the Bureau's investigating.

633
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,100
比爾·謝潑德怎么拿到我的講話的
How did Bill Shepherd get his hands on my speech?

634
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,430
什么
What?

635
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,100
媒體往往幾小時前就能拿到
Well, the press usually gets it hours before.

636
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,560
想拿到一份應該不難吧
It wouldn't be that hard to access a copy, I guess.

637
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,500
我今天不會簽那個的
I won't be signing that today.

638
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,120
你去那兒宣布你的獨立
You went there to declare your independence,

639
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,520
也宣了戰
and you declared war.

640
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,490
那是個錯誤
That was a mistake.

641
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,480
不  錯誤是我沒雇幕僚長
No, the mistake was I didn't hire a chief of staff,

642
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,880
就有些事疏于管理
and things are slipping through the cracks.

643
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,130
這我就不能認同了
That's where I have to disagree with you.

644
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,370
我們得保持一個小圈子
We need to keep this circle small.

645
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,730
弗蘭西斯提醒過我小心你
You know, Francis warned me about you.

646
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,250
我向你保證  我為你效力  總統女士
I assure you, I serve at your pleasure, Madam President.

647
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,330
你不能再在我的辦公室里開不帶我的會了
You need to stop meeting in my office without me.

648
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,140
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,490
是特勤局牽頭調查的
Secret Service took the lead.

650
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,810
但你相信這個說法嗎
But do you believe the theory?

651
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,730
是一個不滿的退役士兵沖我開了槍
That it was a disgruntled service person who took a shot at me?

652
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,100
警方調查部認為是
PID does.

653
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,340
我問你怎么想
I'm asking what you think.

654
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,360
這要看這是警告還是真正的刺殺企圖
It depends if it was a warning or an actual attempt.

655
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,730
看他的準頭
Given the accuracy,

656
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,830
槍手應該有足夠的情報知道
the shooter would have been informed enough to know

657
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,880
.50子彈無法穿透"野獸"
that a .50 caliber round wouldn't penetrate the Beast.

658
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,100
我認為他就是想嚇你
I think he wanted to scare you.

659
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,060
替人辦事
On behalf of someone.

660
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,570
有很多人會對在任總統發出威脅
Lots of people make threats against sitting presidents.

661
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,480
我開始認為弗蘭西斯是被謀殺的
I'm starting to believe Francis was murdered.

662
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,050
他死前
Before he died,

663
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,810
曾與一些很有勢力的人結了盟
he aligned himself with some very powerful people.

664
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,800
我認為他們與他反目  并想殺死他
And I think they turned on him, and they wanted him dead,

665
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,850
我覺得他們還想殺我
and I think they want me dead, too.

666
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,900
你覺得這聽上去瘋狂嗎
Do you think that sounds crazy?

667
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,010
不  女士
No, ma'am.

668
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,090
但我覺得我們該叫鮑曼特別探員來
But I think we need to bring in Special Agent Bowman--

669
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,510
這些人  這些大家族
Of these people, these powerful families,

670
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,390
他們倡議解散情報機構
they advocate dismantling intelligence agencies.

671
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,500
中情局  聯調局  國土安全部
CIA, FBI, Homeland.

672
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,590
你知道吧
You know that, right?

673
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,490
-女士  -我們現在
- Ma'am-- - We cannot bring

674
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,650
不能再拉上任何其他人
anyone else in at the moment.

675
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,670
我指望你了
I'm relying on you

676
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,460
我知道我丈夫當初就能指望你
the way I know my husband could.

677
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,950
請你去查查看
So, please see what you can find.

678
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,930
你被稱作過納特嗎
Is it ever Nate

679
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,580
還是一直叫納森
or always Nathan?

680
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,220
納森
Nathan.

681
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,110
就像弗蘭西斯
Like Francis.

682
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,770
至少我總那么叫他
For me, anyway.

683
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,840
你跟道格·斯坦普談過了嗎
Oh, have you spoken to Doug Stamper?

684
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,510
沒有
No.

685
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,860
我好擔心他
I'm so worried about him.

686
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,860
他做了令白宮每個人都不恥的事
He did things no one in this White House should be proud of.

687
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,720
媽媽
Hey, Mom.

688
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,840
你那邊有多少人
How many people do you have there?

689
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,160
不多
Not many.

690
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,390
至少沒什么有趣的人
Nobody that interesting, anyway.

691
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,030
她的基地之行
Her visit to the base.

692
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,480
關于獨立的講話
Independence speech,

693
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,020
甚至士兵的出言不遜對她都很有利
even the naughty soldier is playing well for her.

694
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,780
她的魅力不減
Her charmed life persists.

695
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,030
告訴比爾舅舅我們該加把勁
Tell Uncle Bill we should step up.

696
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,100
我可以操縱輿論  削減她的魅力
I can manage the narrative. De-charm her.

697
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,220
他不會喜歡那樣的
He won't like that.

698
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,400
反正這一切都不會讓他高興的
He's not going to like any of it,

699
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,970
有什么區別呢
so what's the difference?

700
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,170
-還是不好吧  -媽媽  就去說說吧
- I don't know. - Mom, just say the word.

701
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,260
相信我
Trust me.

702
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,530
我回復你之前什么都別做
Don't do a thing until I get back to you.

703
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,700
都看不出這里還是華府
Can't even tell you're still in DC.

704
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,780
這座城市里有些地方永遠都會是個秘密
There are parts of this city that will always remain a secret.

705
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,680
順說  我覺得我短期內
I don't think I'll be welcome back

706
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,820
不會再被邀請加入白宮記者團了
in the White House press pool anytime soon, FYI.

707
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,600
沒關系
Doesn't matter.

708
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,880
她不肯跟我談
She won't speak to me.

709
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,240
-采訪不可能的  經過...  -她會答應的
- An interview? Not after-- - She will.

710
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,070
今晚  他第一次主動開口
Tonight, for the first time, he was forthcoming.

711
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,970
但還堅稱他有罪
But still saying he's guilty?

712
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,620
是的  一如既往
Yeah, as always.

713
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,040
他提到格雷森先生的名字了嗎
And did he mention Mr. Grayson by name?

714
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,030
沒有  他只是更難過了
No. He was just more distressed.

715
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,770
他在惡化嗎
So he's getting worse?

716
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,830
也可能是好轉  他可算開口了
Or better, he's finally talking.

717
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,420
但要說短期內讓他離開那里
But the idea of his leaving the facility anytime soon,

718
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,310
還是不可能的  這是為了他好
that's still out of the question. I mean, for his own good.

719
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,910
他要么真犯了罪
He's either guilty of the crime

720
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,500
-要么認罪是在發瘋  -總統女士
- or psychotic for admitting to it. - Madam President,

721
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,610
謝潑德女士打到白宮來了
Miss Shepherd is on the White House line.

722
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,520
或許該給他開抗精神病藥了
Well, maybe it's time to give him one of the antipsychotics.

723
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,240
或許吧  但我們得考慮他的癮史
Possibly. But we'd have to consider his history of addiction.

724
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,310
對了  回答你的問題
By the way, in answer to your question,

725
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,120
是一把拆信刀
it was a letter opener,

726
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,280
弗蘭西斯從桌上拿來送他的最后一樣東西
the last thing that Francis gave him from his desk.

727
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,980
有情況再通知我  查爾斯
Keep me posted, Charles.

728
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,610
謝謝你
And thank you.

729
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,340
不客氣
Sure.

730
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,050
你準備好了嗎
Are you prepared?

731
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,960
什么
Excuse me.

732
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,640
你不記得了嗎  安多弗
Don't you remember? Andover?

733
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,190
我們的預科學校玩笑
Our prep school joke?

734
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,490
我準備當掉測試
I'm prepared to fail the test.

735
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,250
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

736
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,710
抱歉這么晚打來  我聽說了今天的事
I'm sorry to call so late. I-- I heard about what happened today.

737
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,520
這些事總是不脛而走
These things have a tendency to leak out.

738
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,590
我擔心你
I'm worried about you.

739
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,810
車隊玻璃是防彈的
It's bulletproof, the motorcade glass.

740
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,200
他們抓到那男人了嗎
Did they catch the guy?

741
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,040
你怎么知道是男人
How do you know it's a guy?

742
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,890
總是男人嘛
It's always a guy, right?

743
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,690
比爾希望修改我講話的哪一部分
What was it Bill wanted adjusted in my speech?

744
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,650
就是關于
Something about...

745
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,520
自由的
freedom.

746
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,560
我惦記著你  克萊爾
You're in my thoughts, Claire.

747
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,250
謝謝
Thank you.

748
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,240
他還在我們身邊  是吧
He's still with us, don't you think?

749
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,320
誰
Who?

750
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,880
弗蘭克
Frank.

751
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,900
幸好他死前我們能跟他共度那么多的時光
We're so glad we got to spend so much time with him before he died.

752
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,220
他對我們說了些很有趣的事
He told us some fascinating things.

753
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,800
我一直在想他
He's been on my mind.

754
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,420
比爾和我幾天前總算去了趟加夫尼
Bill and I finally went down to Gaffney a few days ago...

755
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,610
前去悼念
to pay our respects.

756
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,690
克萊爾
Claire!

757
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,530
我不該讓他們那么做的
I shouldn't have let them.

758
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,700
對不起
I'm sorry.

759
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,530
出來吧
Come on out now.

760
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,190
你還在嗎
Are you still there?

761
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,570
在啊
Yes.

762
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,100
救命
Help!

763
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,690
救命
Help!

764
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,320
我知道
I know.

765
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,720
你想知道他究竟發生了什么
You want to know what really happened to him.

766
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,930
弗蘭西斯那樣的男人不會就那么死去
A man like Francis doesn't just die.

767
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,690
那就...
That would be...

768
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,340
怎么說的來著
what's the word?

769
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,300
"太巧了"
"Convenient."

771
00:50:41,870 --> 00:51:21,870
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}在內政  外交  經濟  社會等各種議題上
共和黨和民主黨都持不同的觀點和立場
但兩黨最核心的分歧  在于對聯邦政府的定位不同
民主黨的基本信念是"大政府能夠辦大事  辦好事"
而共和黨則認為應該限制政府的權力
大政府必然帶來官僚主義和腐敗
共和黨總統里根曾說
"政府不是解決問題的答案  政府就是問題所在"
因此  共和黨人反對政府增加稅收  反對加大政府開支
還費盡心機地試圖通過立法放松政府對企業公司的監管
謝潑德兄妹希望克萊爾簽字的法案
就是一個要放松環保監管的法案

{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}"野獸"是美國總統的專車
在現實生活中  美國總統特朗普剛剛更換了自己的座駕
今年9月聯合國大會期間
特朗普乘坐新訂制的"野獸"在紐約街頭飛馳而過
據美國媒體報道  新款"野獸"是由通用公司研發的凱迪拉克
上世紀八十年代前  美國總統專車則一般是林肯
全車重約七千到九千公斤  車身厚20厘米  不僅防彈  還防生化武器
另據NBC報道  這款車還能發射催淚彈  煙霧彈以及向車后路面灑油
車門把手可以釋放高壓電
車內有全套急救設備  一個冰箱里儲備了跟特朗普同血型的血液
車載通訊設備也是最先進的  極端情況下可以下達核攻擊指令
出于安全考慮  總統車隊出行時  會有一模一樣的兩輛"野獸"
根據合同  通用會制造10到12輛這樣的車  總造價一千五百萬美元左右

{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}過去兩年中  關于"美國選民是否有'厭女癥'"的討論一直不斷
在2016年大選中  希拉里·克林頓意外敗給了特朗普
一些媒體和希拉里的粉絲認為  社會觀念上的落后
導致選民無法接受白宮內出現一位女當家
同歐洲一些國家相比  女性在美國政壇的影響力的確有限
目前在聯邦政府和國會中  女性政治人物所占比重只有20%左右
包括3名女性最高法院法官  7名女性內閣部長  50個州中有6名女性州長
百名參議員中有23位女性  435名眾議員中有84名女性
但是希拉里落敗的主要原因  同她的女性身份關系不大
2016大選期間  民調始終顯示她是歷史上最不受歡迎的候選人之一
主要原因是她同老公比爾·克林頓在美國政壇活躍數十年  丑聞不斷
大選過程中又爆出"郵件門"等丑聞  所以記憶力好的選民對她很不買賬
有評論甚至認為特朗普當選的主要原因  正是大家討厭希拉里
2016大選結束后  美國社會中的女性參政意識有了一個井噴
在剛剛結束的中期選舉中  有創紀錄的256名女性候選人參加普選角逐
最后有96名成功進入國會兩院成為女議員
民主黨奪回眾議院控制權后  加州的南希·佩羅西也二度成為女議長
在2020大選中  民主黨內預計會有大量女性候選人參加初選
