1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:03,064
2011年秋天 莉莉和马修从
In the fall of 2011, Lily and Marshall received

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:05,098
莉莉的祖父母那里得到了一份惊喜的礼物
a surprising gift from Lily's grandparents:

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,850
他们在长岛的房子
their house in Long Island.

4
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:10,820
莉莉和马修决定卖了它 只因为一个原因
Lily and Marshall decided to sell it for one simple reason.

5
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,188
它在长岛
It's Long Island.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,574
我可不想在长岛过周六
I don't want to spend my Saturday in Long Island.

7
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:15,859
我知道 宝贝
I know, babe,

8
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,944
但房屋中介想用假家具布置房子
but the realtor staged the place with fake furniture

9
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:20,330
她让我们在开放之前再检查一遍
and she wants us to check it out before the open house.

10
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,348
好吧
All right.

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,366
最起码我们可以在假床上滚床单吧
Can we at least do it on the fake bed?

12
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,336
这还要问吗 你真让我觉得尴尬
I'm embarrassed that you have to ask.

13
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,371
所以 他们出发去了长岛
So, they headed out to Long Island,

14
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,274
当他们走进门时
and when they walked in the door...

15
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,076
我们要买下它
We'll take it!

16
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,427
我们不能买下它
We-We can't take it.

17
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,262
这房子就是我们卖的
We're the ones selling it.

18
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:38,431
我们要把它卖了 对吧
We are selling it, right?

19
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,517
宝贝 你祖父母把这个房子毫无保留的给了你
Baby, your grandparents gave you this house outright.

20
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,585
所以 在我看来 我们有五个选择
So, the way I see it, we have five options.

21
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:43,686
一 卖了它
One, sell it.

22
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,889
二 一年一度的鬼屋
Two, year-round haunted house.

23
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,926
三 用巨大的围栏围起来 黑猩猩保护区
Three, giant fence around the perimeter, chimp sanctuary.

24
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,260
后院已经有一个轮胎秋千了
There's already a tire swing in the backyard.

25
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:53,563
四 我们用大锤毁了它
Four, we destroy it with sledgehammers.

26
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,281
我喜欢四
I like four.

27
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,701
五 我们搬进来 抚养我们的孩子
Five, we move in, raise our children

28
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:00,770
让这变成我们的温馨小窝
and make this our family home.

29
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,123
直到他们毕业
Till they graduate.

30
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,992
然后我们用大锤把它毁了
Then we destroy it with sledgehammers.

31
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:08,795
全家人一起
: As a family.

32
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,747
不行 太疯狂了
No, this is crazy!

33
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:11,998
我们是纽约人
We are New York people.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,617
我们有一个我们都喜欢的 又大又漂亮的公寓
We have a big, beautiful apartment that we love.

35
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,718
你说得对
You're right.

36
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,120
但那天 在莉莉和马修身上
But something happened

37
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,505
发生了一件事
to Lily and Marshall that day.

38
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,306
所有从外地回家的纽约人
Something that happens to all New Yorkers

39
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:23,143
都会发生了一件事
who return home from anywhere other than New York.

40
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,979
它们又大又可爱的公寓
Their big, lovely apartment...

41
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,847
哈 真奇怪
Huh. That's weird.

42
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,684
变小了
...shrank.

43
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:45,347
好吧 过完感恩节 我就要节食了
Okay, after Thanksgiving, I'm cutting out carbs.

47
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:04,277
现在 孩子们 巴尼蜀黍这几周过得很糟糕
Now, kids, it had been a rough couple weeks for Barney.

48
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,949
首先 他背着女朋友和罗宾上床了
First, he cheated on his girlfriend with Robin,

49
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,851
然后他为了罗宾 和女朋友分手了
then he broke up with his girlfriend for Robin,

50
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:10,752
然后罗宾选了凯文 而不是他
then Robin chose Kevin over him.

51
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:13,038
所以他处境不大好
So he was kind of in a bad place.

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,306
嘿
Hey.

53
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,424
你还好吗
You all right?

54
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,925
我有什么不好的
Why wouldn't I be all right?

55
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,176
哥又单身了
Barney's single again!

56
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:20,045
整个美国为之欢呼雀跃
It's what America's been clamoring for.

57
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,730
你刚刚经历了一次分手
You just went through a break-up.

58
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,315
通常人们这时候都会做些蠢事
That's usually when people do something crazy.

59
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,234
如果你是个女的 你已经剪了头发
If you were a girl, you'd have cut bangs

60
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,185
然后和你约会了
and be dating you by now.

61
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:29,187
向我保证你不会做蠢事
Just promise me you won't do something crazy.

62
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,440
我保证不会做蠢事
I promise I won't do something crazy.

63
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,092
别担心 他就要做蠢事了
Don't worry, he's gonna do something crazy.

64
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,745
实际上 我觉得我和女的玩腻了
In fact, I think I'm done with girls.

65
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:38,730
我不确定我是否还喜欢她们
I'm not sure I even like them anymore.

66
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,415
根据你这些年对她们做过的事情
Based on all the stuff you've done to them over the years,

67
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,500
我不确定你喜欢过她们
I'm not sure you ever liked them.

68
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,368
我是说真的
I'm serious.

69
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,586
得了 你爱死女孩了
Come on, you love girls.

70
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,738
如果有人和女孩玩腻了 那也应该是我
If anyone should be done with girls, it's me.

71
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,239
看看我这一年所经历过的
Look at the year I've had.

72
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,175
佐伊 维多利亚 淫荡南瓜妹
Zoey, Victoria, the Slutty Pumpkin.

73
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:52,594
现在我有点担心你会做蠢事
Now I'm worried you're gonna do something crazy.

74
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:54,429
我不会做蠢事
I'm not gonna do something crazy.

75
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:58,433
猜对了 我就要做蠢事了
And yes, I'm gonna do something crazy, too.

76
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,235
但女孩们 伙计
But girls, man.

77
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:01,603
女孩们
Girls.

78
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,189
-你知道什么疟了吗 -当同性恋吗
- You know what would kick ass? - Being gay?

79
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,525
当同性恋疟了
Being gay would kick ass!

80
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,360
一语中的 男人们互相理解
Word. Guys understand each other.

81
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,978
想像下 在一段关系中
Imagine a relationship where,

82
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,947
你们不会一直讨论感情
instead of talking about feelings all the time,

83
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,432
取而代之的是 玩疯狂橄榄球 吃披萨
you just play some Madden, eat a pizza,

84
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,234
互相幸福的抚摸全身
give each other a happy, roll over

85
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,869
闭着眼睛相拥在一起
and have some cuddle-free shut-eye.

86
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,237
兄弟 不管怎样
Bro, for what it's worth,

87
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,491
如果我们都是同性恋 你是我的首选
if we were both gay, you'd be my first call.

88
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,459
你介意打电话告诉马修吗
Would you mind calling Marshall and telling him that?

89
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:25,494
因为他觉得
'Cause he thinks...

90
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,112
不 这个假设仅限于
No, this is only in a scenario

91
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:29,414
只有你我是同性恋 马修不是的前提下
where just you and I are gay, not Marshall.

92
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,949
但如果我们三个都是同性恋
But if all three of us were gay,

93
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,634
你就会选我而不是马修 对吗
you'd pick me over Marshall, right?

94
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,436
如果我们三个都是同性恋
If all three of us were gay?

95
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,307
小姑娘 我们三个会一起好好乐一乐的
Girlfriend, we would all three of us have some fun.

96
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,342
绝对的
Damn right we would.

97
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,596
我们不是同性恋
We're not gay.

98
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,848
没错 还是离不开女孩
Nope. Stuck with girls.

99
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,217
我希望男人能自己生孩子
I wish men could have children

100
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,736
就像海马那样
on their own, like sea horses.

101
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,487
你说的和我想的是一件事吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

102
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:53,488
雄性海马有育儿袋
They have a little pouch.

103
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,906
他们就应该被叫做 海中的袋鼠
They should be called sea kangaroos.

104
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,743
不会吧 你想要孩子吗
No, y-you want kids?

105
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:00,979
我最近是在思考这个问题
Maybe I've kind of lately been thinking

106
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:04,249
关于娶妻生子的问题
about the whole wife and kids thing.

107
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,034
娶妻还是算了
Just minus the wife.

108
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,652
不用老婆就可以有孩子的
You could always go it alone.

109
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:09,821
就像《细路仔》里面的德拉蒙德一样
Like Mr. Drummond on Diff'rent Strokes.

110
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,958
对啊  但那可是80年代 那个时候 你可以不负责任地
Yeah, but that was the '80s, when you could just swing by

111
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,793
在豪华车上乱搞
any inner-city playground in your limo

112
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,178
然后把小孩带走
and scoop up some kids. - Mmm.

113
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,347
那真是个简单的年代啊 
- Simpler times. - Hmm.

114
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,664
我想还是有一个人 陪着你比较好
I guess it's better to have someone

115
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,433
对吧 相伴一生
in it with you anyway, you know? Lifetime partnership.

116
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,135
我生命中 唯一能经得起时间考验的
The only partnership in my life

117
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,470
就是这份感情
that has stood the test of time is this one.

118
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:28,306
兄弟之间的感情
The sacred bond of man and bro.

119
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:31,009
或许我们应该一起组成个家庭
Maybe we should start a family together.

120
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,114
你在开玩笑么
Are you kidding?

121
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,983
这个地方可大了
This place is huge.

122
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,736
你看 我都能很嗨的在这跳舞
I mean, look, I can dance all crazy in here.

123
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,371
哦 糟了
Oh! Sh...

124
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,374
罗宾 听着
Listen, um, Robin,

125
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,325
如果我们感恩节到去东梅多过
are you okay with us all

126
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,378
你会不开心么
doing Thanksgiving out in East Meadow?

127
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,912
不会啊 我觉得挺好的啊
Uh, yeah, I guess that'd be nice.

128
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,080
噢 太棒啦
Oh, great!

129
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,249
在感恩节以后 我和莉莉打算
And then after Thanksgiving, Lily and I were thinking

130
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,367
就呆在那里不回来了
that we would just stay at the house

131
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,303
直到  你懂的
until, you know...

132
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,871
我们老死
we die.

133
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,089
什么
What?

134
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,674
不行
No!

135
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,060
你们不能搬到长岛去
You can't move to Long Island!

136
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,012
但是那个房子很棒
But this house is so nice.

137
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,932
它很大很干净 而且如果有小强的话
It's big, and it's clean, and if there's cockroaches,

138
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,518
它们会鬼鬼祟祟的出没而不被我们发现哟
they respect us enough to sneak around.

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,603
看看你自个说的话
Listen to yourself.

140
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,055
这又是孕妇思维在作祟了吧
This is Pregnancy Brain all over again.

141
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,824
不 我已经过了那个阶段了
No, I'm done with Pregnancy Brain.

142
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:22,911
而到了诡异的性幻想阶段了
I've moved on to weird pregnancy sex dreams.

143
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,496
长官
Officer.

144
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:27,699
你懂的 你一定懂的
You know. You know.

145
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:32,170
我只是在说 你现在的思维方式
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not in the right mind to be making

146
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,288
不适合做重大的决定
this decision right now.

147
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,923
你知道么 罗宾是对的
You know what? Robin's right.

148
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:38,076
我们现在不适合做重大的决定
We are in no state of mind to make this kind of decision.

149
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,629
谢谢 你总算正常了
Thank you. And now you're stepping off the crazy bus.

150
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,180
我们让宇宙来决定
We let the universe decide.

151
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,632
现在 你又疯了
And now you're back on board.

152
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,217
宇宙 你听到了么
You hear that, Universe?

153
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,553
如果你在接下来的24小时里面
If you send us a sign in the next...

154
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,640
给我们一个迹象 我们就搬去长岛了
24 hours, then we're moving to Long Island!

155
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,358
行么
Okay?

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,276
计时开始
Go.

157
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,426
嘿 你们听好了
Hey, guys,

158
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,145
再说最后一遍 这个地方空间是很大的
for the last time, this place is enormous--

159
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,146
噢
Oh!

160
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:00,532
天哪 你们到底有多少灯啊
Geez, how many lamps do you have?

161
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,784
这个想法太天才了
It's genius!

162
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,370
不用和一个女孩子结婚 而放弃路边的野花们
Instead of throwing away your life marrying some girl,

163
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:08,623
你可以和你最铁的兄弟合养一个孩子
you just go splitsies on a kid with your best bro!

164
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,708
我甚至不用
I wouldn't have to choose

165
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,609
在泡妞和养家糊口中做选择
between dating and having a family.

166
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:14,279
太对了 我可以带着孩子去约会
Hell, I could bring the kids on dates!

167
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,464
一个破碎的家庭
And a broken home?

168
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,748
那是什么东西
Um, what's that?

169
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,883
我们的孩子永远不会理解
Our kids will never know,

170
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,450
因为我们永不分离
'cause we're never gonna split up!

171
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:20,469
我们为什么要分开呢
Why would we?

172
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:21,887
我的意思是 当你的妻子走进家里
I mean, sure, when your wife walks in

173
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,955
看到你和一群空姐宽衣解带 你绝对会离婚
on you banging a hot flight attendant, you get a divorce.

174
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,623
但是当另一个奶爸走进你家
But when your bro-parent walks in on you

175
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,958
看见你和一群空姐宽衣解带
banging a hot flight attendant...

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,227
你会和这五根小坏东西们 击掌庆祝的
You get five of these bad boys, right up high!

177
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,147
你会加入到滚床单的大军里的 对吧
And you totally join in, right?!

178
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,965
-哦 不行 哥可是有底线的啊 -这就是底线啊
-Oh, no, there's the line. -That's the line.

179
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,067
我们找到底线了啊 真是好
We found the line. It's good we know where it is.

180
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,102
两位好
Hey, guys.

181
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,487
你们来了啊
- Hey! - Hey.

182
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,622
我们要宣布一件事
We have an announcement.

183
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,524
所以你刚才的意思是
So what you're saying is,

184
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,743
如果你们注定要去搬去长岛
if you're meant to move to Long Island,

185
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,111
宇宙中的一些迹象
some sign from the universe

186
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,746
会神奇的出现在你家门口吗
will magically appear at your doorstep?

187
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,865
孩子们 我并不觉得 当时有人敲门了
Now, kids, I don't think there was a knock on the door

188
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,434
但是为了剧情需要 你懂的
at that exact moment, but for the purposes of this story...

189
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:57,255
你们好 我是克里夫
Hi, I'm Clive.

190
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:58,673
我住在你们楼上
I live upstairs from you.

191
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,759
这个是你们的牌子么
Is this your sign?

192
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,795
我不知道啊 克里夫
I don't know, Clive.

193
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,163
是么
Is it?

194
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,015
哦 我们把它丢在外面了么
Oh, did we leave that outside?

195
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,634
恩是我们的牌子 我们要卖长岛的房子
Yeah, we're selling our house in Long Island.

196
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:11,803
太可惜了你们卖的不是这个公寓
Oh. Too bad you're not selling this place.

197
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,555
我想把我的公寓改造成复式楼
I'd love to turn mine into a duplex.

198
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,673
而且 我会给你们一个很好的价格
And I'd give you a really good price for it,

199
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,742
因为我很有钱呢
because I am so rich.

200
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:20,712
他没说那句话
He did not say that.

201
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,113
看看他鞋子就知道了
His shoes did.

202
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,449
好,我想说的是,我们得到这个迹象了
Okay, the point is, we got the sign.

203
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,735
我们这就搬到东梅多
We're moving to East Meadow.

204
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,570
我们开瓶香槟吧
Let's get some champagne.

205
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:30,238
就这样,莉莉和马修
And just like that, Lily and Marshall

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,873
开始了他们人生中新的篇章
were beginning a new chapter in their lives.

207
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,042
这对于我们来说就是…
Which meant only one thing for us...

208
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,911
我们要有娃儿了!
We're having a baby!

209
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,695
启动奶爸双雄模式!
Bro-parents activate!

210
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,052
-嘿 我们来给宝宝起名字吧! -巴尼…
- Hey, let's talk baby names! - Barney...

211
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,903
额滴神啊! 这也是我的首选啊
Oh, my God! That was my first choice, too.

212
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:50,306
不 听着 我们两个都喝醉了
No, listen. You and I are drunk.

213
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:53,910
这意味着领养一个孩子 在一定几率上
Which means there's a chance that adopting a baby--

214
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,112
无论他我脑海中的样子有多么萌
no matter how cute he is in my head

215
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:59,282
穿着小牛仔装 像骑马一样
with his little cowboy outfit on and he's riding our dog

216
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:01,834
骑着我们的狗狗 我们会养条狗的
like a horse and we also have a dog,

217
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,620
得是条金毛 不过无所谓了 它得是一条搜救犬
purebred Golden, but it's okay, she's a rescue--

218
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,422
可能不是一个好主意啊
might not be a good idea.

219
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,458
你太对了
You're right.

220
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,594
所以说我们回家 然后吃些阿司匹林
So let's go home, take some aspirin,

221
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,829
喝一肚子白开水
drink lots of water,

222
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,883
然后我们明天再看看 这还是不是一个好主意
and then see if it's still a good idea tomorrow.

223
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,801
这还是一个好主意
It's still a good idea!

224
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,386
必须地
It's totally still a good idea!

225
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:21,721
我们要有孩子了
We're having a baby!

226
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,558
孩子们 爹再强调一遍
Kids, I cannot stress this enough:

227
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,194
巴尼和我那个时候都很不顺
Barney and I were going through a tough time.

228
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,513
你们不能搬 就这么定了
You're not leaving, and that's final.

229
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:34,517
看看姐早上四点 在纽约城淘到了神马
Look what I bought at 4:00 a.M. In New York City.

230
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,155
一盘盗版的 超级流行的棒子电影
A bootleg VHS of a very, very popular Korean movie,

231
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,024
还有这个正品驴牌儿的钱包
this genuine Lenny Vintone purse

232
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:45,194
以及一个能给我搞来一个肾的 器官贩子的电话号码
and the number of a man who can get me a kidney.

233
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,579
有本事在长岛做这些试试
Do that on Long Island.

234
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,749
听着 罗宾 我们很感激你这么想要我们呆在这里 
Look, Robin, we appreciate that you want us

235
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,335
但是那边才是我们想要的
to stay in the city, but this is what we want.

236
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,886
我说 你也知道的 对吧
I mean, you understand, right?

237
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,305
不
No.

238
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,890
这里有些有关于长岛的
Here are a few fun facts

239
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,093
小知识
about Long Island.

240
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,812
第一 从形状上看 它就像布鲁克林的屁
Number one: it's Brooklyn's fart trail.

241
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,880
所以巴尼和我
So Barney and I--

242
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,715
再重申一遍 我们那时不太顺
and again, going through a tough time,

243
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,067
怎么强调都不够啊 
can't stress that enough--

244
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,769
找到了一个儿童领养的网站
found an adoption agency Web site

245
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:11,988
然后我们在线把表给填了
and filled out their online application.

246
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,774
巴尼?斯丁森
Barney Stinson.

247
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,609
泰德?莫斯比
Ted Mosby.

248
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,577
地址…
Address...

249
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,078
唔 填我在威彻斯特的地址
Oh, put my address in Westchester.

250
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,363
网站上的人希望看到我们将
They'll want to see we'll be

251
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,998
在一个良好的环境中抚养孩子
raising this child in a good environment.

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,166
郊区 你懂得
You know, the suburbs.

253
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,500
神马 不要
What? No.

254
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:27,203
-我所有的伙计们都在这里 -你的伙计们
- All my guys are here. - Your guys?

255
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,005
对 你知道 我是怎样找到那个为我打理好一切的伙计吗
Yeah. You know how I got a guy for everything?

256
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,289
他们都在纽约
Well, they're all in New York.

257
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,375
我的西装男 皮鞋男 票子男 夜店男
My suit guy, my shoe guy, my ticket guy, my club guy.

258
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:33,909
而且我要是没有某些专门的伙计
And if I don't have a guy for something,

259
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,711
我就会有个伙计男帮我物色个伙计
then I have a guy guy to get me a guy.

260
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,547
而且 其一大萌点就是 他就叫伙计
And oddly enough, his name is Guy.

261
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,415
好吧 这样吧
Okay, fine. How about this?

262
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,251
我们在周一到周五在城里呆着 然后到了周末
We stay in the city during the week, then on the weekend,

263
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,553
去郊区的那栋大房子
country house in the burbs!

264
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,055
这就是为啥 咱奶爸双雄可以有的原因啦
This is why bro-parenting works!

265
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:46,973
妥妥滴
Totally!

266
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:49,225
而且我的薪水加上你的薪水
And with your salary plus my salary,

267
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,260
这两个地方我们统统付得起
we can totally afford two places.

268
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,279
唔
Oh.

269
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,547
什么
What?

270
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,818
这么说来 你还打算要工作 是吧
So... uh, you're gonna keep your job?

271
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,538
罗宾 不用再说了
Robin, this discussion is closed.

272
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,957
老天要我们做这些事的 我们就照做了
The universe told us to do it, so we're doing it.

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,077
唔 老天爷也有犯糊涂的时候啊
Well, the universe gets it wrong sometimes.

274
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,329
还记得马修在犹豫
Remember when Marshall was trying to decide between

275
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,915
是当一名环境律师 还是在银行工作的时候吗
becoming an environmental lawyer and working at a bank?

276
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,650
这个故事很好玩的
That's a funny story.

277
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,086
那时马修受够了为巨人银行而工作
Marshall was fed up with his job at GNB and was

278
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,421
也想要辞掉这份工作
thinking about leaving it all behind,

279
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,456
所以他和莉莉认为他需要等待一个
so he and Lily agreed he should wait for a sign

280
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,308
老天爷告诉他该怎么做的迹象
from the universe to tell him what to do.

281
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,010
然后有一天
Then one day...

282
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,353
绝对的
Of course.

283
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,521
明摆着的 不是吗
It's so clear.

284
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,240
这不一直在那儿的吗
It's been right there all along.

285
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,974
我得给莉莉打个电话
I have to call Lily.

286
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:41,110
不好意思 不好意思 先森
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

287
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:44,163
抱歉 唔 我能否借下你的…
I'm sorry, but, um, can I please borrow your...

288
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,949
-埃尔尼 哈德森 - 怎么了
- Ernie Hudson? - Yes.

289
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,085
我能借下你的手机吗
Can I borrow your phone?

290
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,320
打给谁啊
Who you gonna call?

291
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,508
然后马修就成了幽灵克星
And did Marshall become a Ghostbuster?

292
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,577
那个消防局还杵在那儿待售呢
That firehouse is still for sale.

293
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,496
就连埃尔尼 哈德森都在求你不要打电话
Even Ernie Hudson begged you not to go through with that.

294
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,797
埃尔尼 哈德森真是个孬种
Ernie Hudson is a coward!

295
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,466
噢
Oh!

296
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,700
当然 我得上班啊
Of course I'm gonna keep my job.

297
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:05,868
为什么我就得辞职呢
Why wouldn't I keep my job?

298
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,939
我说 这整个叫建筑学的东西
Well, I mean, this whole architecture thing...

299
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,557
不最多就是一爱好吗
isn't it more of a hobby?

300
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,025
你说什么
Excuse me?

301
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,644
现在我们开吵了 我告诉你
And now we're fighting. You know what?

302
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,295
当我什么都没说
Forget I said anything.

303
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,731
不 不 不 不 不行 我们得好好谈谈
No! No, no, no. We're having this discussion.

304
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,015
当建筑师是我毕生的事业
Architecture is my life's work.

305
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,951
你为嘛不辞掉你的工作 我甚至不知道
Why don't you quit your job? I don't even know

306
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,703
你是做什么的
what it is you do for a living.

307
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:26,122
哥是做什么的
"What it is I do for a living?"

308
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:31,244
我上班啊 泰德 哥每天用上十四个小时的班挣来的钱 
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day so that our baby can have food

309
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:33,496
来填饱咱们孩子的肚子 给他穿上衣服 让他住上好房子
and clothes and a nice house,

310
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,364
而你就只坐在一边乱涂乱画你的大楼
while you sit around doodling pictures of buildings.

311
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:36,883
这就是哥的工作
That's "What it is I do."

312
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:39,502
你知道么 去你丫的 老子去酒吧
You know what? Screw this. I'm gonna go to the bar.

313
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:41,304
哼 哼 是啊 因为你的答案总能在
Yeah, right, right, 'cause the answer's always

314
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:43,172
酒瓶底找出来
at the bottom of a bottle!

315
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,975
等等 等一下
Wait, wait, wait! Hold it!

316
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,928
大脑风暴 开始思考
Brainstorm. Brainstorm.

317
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,664
谁都不许辞职
Nobody quits their job.

318
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,765
我们找个保姆
We get a nanny.

319
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:53,766
保姆我定了
Dibs on the nanny.

320
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,151
不 不许上保姆
No. No banging the nanny.

321
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,186
泰德 求求你别深究
Ted, please don not dig in on this whole

322
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,237
‘不许上保姆’这个原则
no-banging-the-nanny policy.

323
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,822
好吧 我们请两个保姆
Okay, fine. We'll get two nannies.

324
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,241
一个用来上 一个用来照顾孩子
One for banging, one for childcare.

325
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,226
给“上”字画个重点线 两个保姆都是我的了
Slash banging. Dibs on both nannies!

326
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,362
你想想 泰德 你和我
Just think of it, Ted, you and me,

327
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,664
跟孩子住在一起
living together, with our kid,

328
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,137
我们两个火辣保姆 我们的宠物眼镜蛇
my two hot nannies, our pet cobra...

329
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:11,748
什么
What?

330
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,086
孩子需要一条眼镜蛇做宠物 泰德 别那么神经过敏
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted. Don't be a pill about this.

331
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,422
而且我们派对一开就一个周末
And we'll have amazing weeklong parties,

332
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:19,292
到处都放着剑和忍者用的飞镖
and there'll be swords and ninja stars lying around.

333
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:20,626
那时我意识到了
That's when I realized:

334
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:23,679
跟朋友一起领养一个孩子 那是疯子
adopting a baby with a friend? Crazy.

335
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:27,583
跟巴尼一起领养一个孩子 二逼到家了
Adopting a baby with Barney? Freaking nuts.

336
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,802
我不能跟你一起领养孩子 巴尼
I can't adopt a baby with you, Barney.

337
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:30,853
为什么
Why not?

338
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,471
因为我们现在根本没有孩子
Because we don't even have one yet

339
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,940
你就已经成为一个糟糕的老爸了
and you're already a terrible father.

340
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,058
哦 我知道了
Oh, I get it.

341
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,977
你想要一个保姆
You want one of the nannies.

342
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,928
不行 她们是我的 不给你
Well, you can't have 'em! They're mine!

343
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,815
你只能再给你自己找第三个保姆
So you're just gonna have to get yourself a third nanny.

344
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,651
只不过第三个保姆我也预定了 拜拜
Except dibs on the third nanny! Good day!

345
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,704
感恩节到了
Which brings us to Thanksgiving.

346
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,990
马修 莉莉和罗宾一早就赶去长岛
Marshall, Lily and Robin were heading out

347
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,959
为感恩节做准备
to Long Island early to get ready.

348
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,301
天啊 怎么可能这样
Okay, how is this even possible?!

349
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,221
之前我们怎么拿进去的
'Cause how did we even get it in here?!

350
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:10,292
好嘛 我改主意了 分娩时我要做硬膜外麻醉术
（一种在分娩时用的麻醉手段 使产妇下半身肢体没有知觉）
Okay, I change my mind. I want an epidural.

351
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:12,561
你俩真疯了
You guys are crazy.

352
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,930
这地方大极了
This place is enormous.

353
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,482
我的意思是 看看四
I mean, look arou...

354
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:19,185
你们就没有听说过吊灯吗
Have you never heard of overhead lighting?!

355
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,607
你说对了
You're right.

356
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,192
我理解了
I get it.

357
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,278
这地方好极了
This place is great.

358
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,831
喔 那啥 卫生间在哪儿
Um, excuse me. Where is the restroom?

359
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,450
喔 就在那儿 很好 
Oh. Right there. Oh, good, great.

360
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,002
我就是去那儿然后
I'm just gonna go in there and...

361
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:39,255
永远不出来除非你答应我你们搬回纽约
not come out until you promise never to move away!

362
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,509
家里有三个卫生间真好
It's a good thing we have three bathrooms.

363
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,462
嘿 巴尼
Hey, Barney.

364
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,163
那啥 那天我说你是个糟糕的父亲
Uh, listen, sorry about the other day

365
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,099
实在是对不起
when I said you'd be a terrible father.

366
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,385
你没必要多想
You had no reason to think otherwise.

367
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,886
我完全理解 我没疯
Totally understandable. I'm not mad.

368
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,021
谢谢
Thanks.

369
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:56,155
说实话
And, uh, let's be honest,

370
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,606
我们那时表现得确实有点疯
we were both acting a little crazy.

371
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,642
我觉得我们俩谁都没有真正准备好
I don't think either of us is truly ready

372
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,176
来承担抚养一个孩子的责任
for the responsibility of...

373
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,729
爸爸回来了
Daddy's home.

374
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,054
巴尼 你从哪儿弄到这个孩子的
Uh, Barney, uh, where did you get this baby?

375
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,527
嗨
Please.

376
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:15,777
你收养的
Did you adopt it?

377
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:16,828
切
Please.

378
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,130
莫非你有个孩子男
Do you have a baby guy?

379
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:22,417
难道是你的伙计男给你找了个孩子男吗
Did Guy the guy guy get you a baby guy?

380
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,151
泰德 我们该走了
Ted, we should get going.

381
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,504
不不不 我才不跟你走
No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere with you.

382
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,989
据我所知 我可能
For all I know, I could be

383
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,257
正在协助并唆使你绑架儿童
aiding and abetting a kidnapping.

384
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,042
嘘 奶爸可没发疯哟
Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.

385
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:35,680
他只是爱吵人哦 他相当相当耐你哦 是的
He's just being a wittle loud. He wuvs you! Yes, he does!

386
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,832
- 这太疯狂了  - 你出门就感觉好些了
- This is insane! - You'll feel better outside.

387
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,717
- 来吧   - 不 我不能
- Come on. - No, I can't.

388
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,302
是吧快来
Yeah. Na-na-na.

389
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:44,639
接着我们出门了
But then we went outside.

390
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:45,890
噢 我的天
Oh, my goodness.

391
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,892
- 多可爱的宝贝啊  - 谢谢
- What a beautiful baby. - Thank you.

392
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,177
顺便说下 我朋友和我 我们不是一对儿
By the way, my friend and I, we're not a couple.

393
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,146
我们是两位单身直男
We are two straight guys who are single

394
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,315
有孩子的单身直男  就这些
and we have a baby. Just so you know.

395
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,618
看看这可爱的小姑娘
Look at this sweet girl.

396
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
嗨 我刚告诉第一个女孩
Hi. I was just telling this first girl,

397
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:00,455
我朋友和我  都是直男
my friend and I, both straight,

398
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,540
都是单身 而且我们有个孩子
both available, and we have a baby.

399
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,042
哎哟 这个小天使是谁呀
Oh, who is this little angel?

400
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,326
好吧 长话短说  我和他
Okay, real quick: me and him,

401
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,911
直男 单身 有孩子
not gay, single, have a baby.

402
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:08,563
我们应该考虑做个告示牌
We should look into having a sign made.

403
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,782
孩子们 再次强调下 我们那时候过的很糟糕
Kids, again, we were going through a difficult time.

404
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,100
但是这一段还挺好玩得
But this part was kind of fun.

405
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:16,671
啊 好可爱
Aw...! So cute!

406
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,506
太赞了
This is awesome.

407
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,875
对吧
Right?

408
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,894
罗宾 出来和我们谈谈
Robin, come out and talk to us.

409
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,429
我不出来
I'm not coming out of this bathroom

410
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:27,048
除非你们每个人都表现得正常点
until everyone stops acting crazy!

411
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,067
没人不正常
No one is being crazy.

412
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,085
再说一遍 剧情需要 
Again, for the purposes of this story...

413
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:35,773
泰德和我有宝宝了 多荒唐
Ted and I have a baby. Crazy!

414
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,358
这是肿么回事
What the hell is that?

415
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,662
伙计们 这是 哈里肯・斯丁森-莫斯比
Guys, this is Hurricane Stinson-Mosby.

416
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:41,829
莫斯比-斯丁森
Mosby-Stinson.

417
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,165
你给孩子取名哈里肯（飓风）
You named your baby Hurricane?

418
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,167
这种做法
That is...

419
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,620
对孩子极度不负责任
ultimately inconsiderate to the child

420
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:50,505
她被迫带着这个名字过活了
who has to live with that name.

421
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,258
好吧 巴尼的孩子到底从哪来的
Okay, how the hell does Barney have a baby?

422
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,575
不知道 迷惑中
No idea. Super confused.

423
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,911
我觉得最好不要多想
I'm finding it best to just sort of go with it.

424
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:59,180
她可爱死了 有木有
She's super cute, though, right?

425
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,432
等等
Wait a minute.

426
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:05,586
哦 哇 哈里肯尿了
Oh, guh! Hurricane dookied in her drawers.

427
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,973
哈哈 小屁孩儿
Ha-ha! Poopy pants!

428
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,591
她需要换块尿布
She needs a new diaper.

429
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:12,527
对 尿布在哪儿
Right. Where do you keep your diapers?

430
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,811
我们没尿布
We don't have any.

431
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:15,229
你们没 哇噢
You don't... Wow.

432
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:19,117
好吧 我觉得我该去买点
Okay. I guess I'll go buy some.

433
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,653
你就要当妈妈了居然没有尿布
You're gonna be a mom and you don't have any diapers?

434
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,656
上帝 保佑那个孩子吧
Lord, watch over that child.

435
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,391
额 好的
Uh, okay.

436
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,943
来吧 宝贝
Come here, you.

437
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:32,797
呃 刚刚我听到有盘奶酪 在哪呢
So, there was talk of a cheese plate?

438
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,423
嘿
Hey.

439
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,842
要奶酪吗
Cheese?

440
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,394
谢谢
Thanks.

441
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,599
如果你不介意的话 
If you don't mind me asking...

442
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,818
我可不可以问下到底发生了什么
what-what is this all about?

443
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,438
我是说 你是我认识最坚强独立
I mean, you are one of the most strong, independent,

444
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,640
不会在感恩节
non-locking-themselves-in-

445
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,659
把自己锁在厕所里的人之一
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving people I know.

446
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,313
为什么我们搬个家让你这么心烦
Why-why are you so upset about us moving?

447
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,783
也许我比你想象中更依赖你们
Maybe I just need you guys more than you think.

448
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:13,237
你是不是还有事没告诉我们
Is this about more than us moving?

449
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,506
这奶酪不错
This is good cheese.

450
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:18,576
罗宾
Robin?

451
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,378
怎么了
Yeah?

452
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,014
你觉得我是不是应该成为个幽灵克星
Do you think I should've become a Ghostbuster?

453
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,099
是个好主意 哥们儿
I think you made the right call, buddy.

454
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:29,854
好吧 泰德 我不想问你巴尼的孩子是哪来的
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you where Barney got this baby.

455
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,173
但你知道他为什么带个孩子吗
But do you have any idea why?

456
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,525
呃 几天前 我们在聊
Well, a few nights ago, we were talking...

457
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:37,729
呃 “我们讨厌女生 我们希望我们是同志”
you know, "We hate girls, we wish we were gay,"

458
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,513
之类的男人间的事情
just guy stuff.

459
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,483
然后我们大概可能也许决定
And we kind of sort of decided to...

460
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:44,035
领养一个孩子
adopt a baby.

461
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,820
嗯 这很荒唐
Yeah, that's crazy.

462
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,038
我知道
I know.

463
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,039
真的吗
Is it, though?

464
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,073
真的
Yes.

465
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,074
我知道
I know.

466
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,542
到底是真的吗
But is it, though?

467
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:52,543
不假
Yes.

468
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,878
呃 荒唐又怎样
Well, so what if it's crazy?

469
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,030
很久以来 我一直想遇见一个能和我组成家庭的人
I've been ready to meet someone to start a family with

470
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,249
但我总是遇不到
for a long time now, and I keep not meeting her.

471
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,885
巴尼是我最好的朋友之一 我们很少吵架
Barney is one of my best friends in the world, we rarely fight,

472
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,054
一旦我们解决了关于宠物眼镜蛇的问题的话
and once we iron out the whole pet cobra thing,

473
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:04,806
我们就是完美老爸了
we will be amazing dads.

474
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,307
为什么我们不试试看呢
Why shouldn't we try this?

475
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,542
你上次喂她是什么时候
When's the last time you fed her?

476
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,428
她在火车上喝了点根啤
She had some root beer on the train.

477
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,764
哦 泰德 我很抱歉
Oh, Ted. And I'm sorry,

478
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,381
但你真的不能给宝宝取名叫哈里肯
but you cannot call a baby Hurricane.

479
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,017
实际上 她的名字是赛迪
Actually, her name is Sadie.

480
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:18,236
詹姆斯 你来这里干什么
James, what are you doing here?

481
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,771
巴尼难道没告诉你们
Did Barney not tell you

482
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,406
我们要来过感恩节
that we were coming for Thanksgiving?

483
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,723
呃 没有
Uh, no.

484
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,392
那么估计他也没告诉你们
Then he probably also did not tell you

485
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,278
他在照顾我们的小女儿
that he was babysitting our new daughter.

486
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,247
这是你女儿
This is your daughter?

487
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,032
哦 谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

488
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,834
恭喜啊
And congratulations.

489
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,568
谢谢 来 爸爸抱
Thanks. Come here.

490
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,587
哦...哦...
Aw... Aw...

491
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,257
再见了 哈里...赛迪
I guess this is good-bye, Hurri... Sadie.

492
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,794
你的名字叫哈里肯 永远都不要忘记
Your name is Hurricane. Don't ever forget it.

493
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,763
我们过去吧
Go with him. Go on.

494
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:46,964
过来 宝贝女儿
Come here. That a girl.

495
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,100
嘿 泰德
Hey, Ted,

496
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:51,185
我听到了你的小演说
I overheard your little speech.

497
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,437
这确实不荒唐
It's not crazy.

498
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,806
十年前
About ten years ago,

499
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:57,775
我最好的朋友和我差点也做了同样的事
my best friend and I nearly did the same thing.

500
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:01,062
她单身 我也单身 我们都想要一个家
She was single, I was single, we both wanted a family.

501
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:03,147
情理之中
It made sense.

502
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:04,699
可现在呢
But now?

503
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,152
每一天 我们都感谢上帝当时我们没有那样做
Every day, we thank our lucky stars that we didn't do it.

504
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,771
因为她找到的她的丈夫
'Cause what she found with her husband

505
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,657
我找到了我的 
and what I found with mine--

506
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,959
等待是值得的
it was worth the wait.

507
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,045
飓风这个名字超酷
Hurricane's a cool name.

508
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,882
是吧 汤姆
Isn't it, Tom?

509
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,567
宠物商店离得近
The pet store was closer,

510
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,302
我给她买了几片尿垫
so I just got her some wee-wee pads.

511
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:25,803
喔 对 还有这个
Oh, I also got this.

512
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,889
牛肉口味的 咀嚼对她的牙齿很好哟
It's beef-flavored and it's good for her teeth.
