00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,880
戴維斯女士  你有什么提議
Miss Davis. What are you offering?

26
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,980
我可以幫忙  總統女士
Help. Madam President.

27
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,470
他知道  你們不就是想知道這個嗎
He knew. Isn't that what you're all wondering?

28
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,420
您今天最沒想到會見到的就是我吧

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,220
你要讓我在南極洲任意開采石油

30
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,170
我告訴你為什么

31
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,180
我手上有料
I have something.

32

或者說有你們想要的人

33
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,160
你的艾丹·麥卡倫
Your Aidan Macallan.

34
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,760
總統獲勝的可能性有多大
What are the president's chances?

35
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,240
田納西和俄亥俄的重投是他的最佳機會
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.

36
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,510
我一定會成為總統
I'm gonna be the president,

37
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,580
你也一定要把那該死的操縱桿給我
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.

38
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,020
你會被稱為副總統
You'll be called vice president,

39
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,710
但實際上  你將做到更多
but you will be, de facto, something more.

40
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,280
我們得和厄舍談談
We need to sit down with Usher.

41
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,230

我們崇敬你  我們崇敬你  我們崇敬你
We honor thee! We honor thee! We honor thee!

49
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,800
人間煙火燒不盡俗世煩惱
No mortal flame can destroy common woe.

50
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,700
唯有真火才能將其震懾
Just one fire can conquer.

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,580
那就是在極樂之地燃燒的真火
Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.

52
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,380
致敬吧  弟兄們  眾弟兄
Hail, brothers! Many brothers!

53
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,010
兄弟為眾  乃成一心

致敬吧  同胞  致敬降臨在翠綠王國的圣鴉
Hail, fellowship! Hail Crow in his verdant kingdom.

55
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,490
俗世煩惱啊  散去吧
Common woe, be done!

56
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,840
致敬吧  弟兄們  俗世煩惱啊  散去吧
Hail, brothers! Common woe, be done!

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,600
釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free!

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,610
釋我自由  釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!

59
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,980
釋我自由  釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!

60
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,670
釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free!

61
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,470
釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free!

62
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,400
釋我自由  釋我自由
Set us free! Set us free!

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,890
看看四周吧
Yeah... look around.

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,010
世界上最有權勢的一些人
Some of the most powerful men in the world

65
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,850
聚集在這片林間空地
are gathered in this clearing.

66
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,770
他們都是全國最難加入的俱樂部的成員
Members of one of our country's most exclusive clubs.

67
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,410
僅限邀請  當然了  除非你不請自來
Invitation only, unless, of course, you invite yourself.

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
他們在這里聚集  是想
They gather here to seek God

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,890
在參天大樹和綠林之間與上帝交心
between the branches of these magnificent trees.

70
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,690
他們一起吃喝  一起撒尿
They eat together, they piss next to each other,

71
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,650
就像周末烤肉一樣切割這世界
and they carve up the world like a Sunday roast.

72
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,750
真正的權力就在這里
This is where the real power is.

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,790
女人和總統禁止入內
No women or presidents allowed.

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,150
我不是前者  我將會再次成為后者
The former, I am not. The latter, I will be again,

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,980
因為我成功將一場全國大選
because I have managed to reduce

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,590
縮小到了一個州的競爭
a national election down to one state.

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,550
雖然讓這些人
And while these men here

78
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,500
左右全國的選票不太可能
can't swing the votes of an entire nation...

79
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,920
但區區一個小州
one measly state?

80
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,130
他們還是可以的  所以我才來到這里
Well, that they can do. And that's why I'm here.

81
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,560
那么  歡迎來到極樂之地
So welcome to Elysian Fields.

82
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,430
他不在  你是不是覺得很別扭
It's strange for you, isn't it? Without him here.

83
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,780
沒什么別扭的  夫人
It's not strange, ma'am.

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,200
莉安去辛辛那提敲定辯論的事了
LeAnn's in Cincinnati, trying to close the deal for the debate.

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,550
等總統回來  就巡回全州  出席多場
The president will make a series of appearances across the state

86
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,960
拉票活動
as soon as he gets back.

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,410
如果他能挺過這個周末  有消息嗎
If he survives the weekend. Anything?

88
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,620
那里不讓帶手機
No phones allowed.

89
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,640
我們這是分頭行動  各個擊破
Well, we're dividing and conquering.

90
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,210
這份對華貿易協定
This Chinese trade agreement

91
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
會讓俄亥俄州選民非常開心的
is going to make Ohio voters very happy.

92
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,340
能幫我們勝選
It could help us win.

93
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,100
-我不知道協議談妥了  -就快談妥了
- I didn't know the deal had closed. - Well, we're on the verge.

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,140
等總統到坎頓出席活動的時候可以當眾宣布
The president can make the announcement in Canton when he appears.

95
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,440
不用了  我自己宣布就行
Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself...

96
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,790
畢竟是我談定的
since I did the deal.

97
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,920
道格  你非常真誠
Doug, you are very sincere...

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,210
對弗蘭西斯也很忠誠
and very loyal to Francis.

99
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,810
我也忠于你  夫人
And loyal to you, ma'am.

100
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,860
我希望您知道這一點
I hope you know that.

101
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,310
其實你叫我克萊爾也是可以的
I don't mind it if you call me Claire, you know.

102
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,270
我這就帶戴維斯女士進來
I'll show Ms. Davis in.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,190
你好啊  簡
Hi, Jane.

104
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,390
在會見部長之前  你能和我一起
Would you mind going over these numbers with me

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,020
再過一遍這些數字嗎
before we meet with the minister?

106
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,330
我知道中方嘴上能接受的數字
I have what China says they'll settle for,

107
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,270
也知道他們心里愿接受的數字
and what I know they'll settle for.

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,050
我想感謝你在這件事上給我們的幫助
And listen, I want to thank you so much for helping us with this.

109
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,960
我就想看到安德伍德執政
I'd like to see an Underwood administration.

110
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,730
道格  沒別的事了
Doug, that's all for now.

111
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,710
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,520
-你可以給我看的  -我不想讓你看
- You can show me. - I don't want to.

113
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,180
你不用這么保護我
You don't have to protect me.

114
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,160
她們每個人背后都有一段故事
Each of them has a story.

115
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,640
就算她們后來迷失了
Even if they got lost somewhere.

116
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,560
消失比你想得要困難
It's harder to disappear than you would think.

117
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,730
但瑞秋
But Rachel...

118
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,610
完全不見蹤影
is nowhere.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,390
這脖子我一眼就認出來了
I recognize that neck.

120
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,140
弗蘭克·安德伍德  真沒想到
Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,220
打賭你贏了
Well, I owe you this.

122
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,920
他不認為你會來
He didn't expect you to show up.

123
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,430
能見到老朋友總是很開心
I'm always happy to see old friends.

124
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,650
交新朋友也很開心  弗蘭克·安德伍德
And make new ones. Frank Underwood.

125
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,990
-本杰明·格蘭特  -波利跳的那位  是啊
- Benjamin Grant. - Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.

126
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,230
你是我對手的強烈支持者
You're a big supporter of my opponent.

127
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,550
他是個高瞻遠矚的人  也是我朋友
He's a forward-thinking guy and a friend,

128
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,880
他現在應該是總統
who should be president right now.

129
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,470
先生們  在這兒的時候
There's no talking politics or business

130
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,400
不能談政治或生意
while we're here, gentlemen.

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,220
是啊  我們可別用爭吵荼毒了自然
Yes, we don't want to poison all this nature with words.

132
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,270
你知道這兒的口號
You know the motto.

133
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,740
是啊  "辛勤的蜜蜂別在這兒干活"
Yes, "Buzzing bees, sting not here."

134
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,970
想看不見都難
It's hard to miss.

135
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,680
泰德  這幾位你都認識吧
Ted, I think you know everybody.

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,960
俗世煩惱毫無勝算  總統先生
Common woe never stood a chance. Mr. President.

137
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,560
據我所知  這是你第一次受邀
First time you've been invited, I understand.

138
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,950
這句話里肯定有侮辱的意味  將軍
I'm almost sure there's an insult in there somewhere, General.

139
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,020
泰德和我
You know, Ted and I

140
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,860
剛剛在坎頓一家牛排店
just had the most remarkable piece of red meat

141
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,810
吃到了最好吃的紅肉
at a steak house out in Canton.

142
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,500
我記不清了  你喜不喜歡上等肋條
I can't remember, do you like prime rib?

143
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,660
要是有合適的人陪的話
In the right company.

144
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,490
先失陪了
If you'll excuse us,

145
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,390
泰德和我答應本杰明
Ted and I promised young Benjamin here

146
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,620
給他點一杯成人飲料
we'd find him an adult beverage.

147
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,530
-喝酒嗎  -還是不了
- Drink? - I'd rather not.

148
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,730
所有人都想跟將軍
You know, everybody was looking forward to

149
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,430
談幾句
spending some time with the general.

150
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,420
現在你也來了
And now you're here as well.

151
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,900
這個周末之后  誰知道呢
After this weekend, who knows?

152
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,270
也許這混蛋大選
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election

153
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,050
能自行解決
will get itself resolved.

154
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,840
既然你來了
Oh, one little piece of advice

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,210
我還想給你一條小小的建議
that I could give you as long as you're out here.

156
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,610
要是你不招惹胡蜂  他們也不會惹你
If you don't bother the yellow jackets, they won't bother you.

157
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,830
你為什么不邀請康威
So why didn't you invite Conway?

158
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,360
被邀請的是布洛哈特
Brockhart was invited instead.

159
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,550
下周不會有辯論了  對吧
So there's not going to be a debate next week, is there?

160
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,250
不會有總統辯論
Not a presidential one, no.

161
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,270
我真應該在俄亥俄  跟人握手
I should really be in Ohio, shaking hands.

162
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,110
你可是費了好大勁進來的  弗蘭西斯
Yeah, you bargained to get in here, Francis,

163
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,890
既然你都來了  那我給你點建議
and now you're here. So let me suggest something.

164
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,080
去他的俄亥俄
Fuck Ohio.

165
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,780
這就是競選
This is the campaign.

166
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,030
將軍是個叛徒  這你清楚
The general is a traitor, you know that.

167
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,460
將軍想當個政客
The general is trying to be a politician.

168
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,070
換成你也會這么做
You would have done the same.

169
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,350
對  但做得更高明
Yeah, but better.

170
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,170
安德伍德總統
President Underwood?

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,940
安德伍德總統  抱歉  女士
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am,

172
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,920
但戰況室急需你過去
but you're needed in the Situation Room.

173
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,230
凱茜
Cathy.

174
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,070
進屋之前  我想先跟你說句話
I wanted a moment with you before we join the rest of the team.

175
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,560
-來的路上他們已經跟我說明了  -說得不全
- Oh, I was briefed on the way over. - Not fully.

176
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,970
一艘俄羅斯考察船受困  在下沉
A Russian research vessel is stuck and sinking--

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,780
對  他們聲稱是在采集冰芯樣本
Yes, they claim they were taking core samples,

178
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,590
全球變暖那套屁話
some global warming nonsense.

179
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,520
但他們其實是在勘探石油
But they were looking for oil.

180
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,110
他們發出了求救信號
There was a distress signal

181
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,280
然后通訊就完全中斷了
and then all communication just shut down.

182
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,470
我們是附近唯一能發起救援的國家
We're the only country in position to rescue.

183
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,850
所以20分鐘前  我們向他們提出援救
So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.

184
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,440
-他們不接受  -而且拒不承認
- They declined? - And denied.

185
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,350
佩特羅夫不希望我們知道船上有什么
Petrov does not want us to see what's on board.

186
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,700
我明白這決定很難做
I understand this is a difficult decision,

187
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,440
但人命關天
but there are human lives at stake,

188
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,810
如果救援隊抵達
and if help arrives,

189
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,470
-佩特羅夫只能被迫接受  -好吧
- Petrov will be forced to take it. - Okay.

190
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,890
謝謝  我得直接和佩特羅夫總統通話
Well, thank you. I need to speak with President Petrov directly.

191
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,660
海上救援  給你機會羞辱我們嗎
A rescue at sea and a chance to embarrass us?

192
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,320
而且就在第二次大選日前夕
Just before your second Election Day?

193
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,690
感覺更像是我幫你  對嗎
Sounds like I would be helping you, hmm?

194
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,460
船一沉  你的船員就會死
The boat sinks, your crew dies.

195
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,480
俄羅斯國內輿論會怎么樣
How is that going to look at home?

196
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,140
我讓我的人民怎么想  他們就會怎么想
I tell my people how things look, and that's how they look.

197
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,950
我想給你看個東西
I want to show you something.

198
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,880
稍等
Wait a minute.

199
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,920
這個  你喜歡我的樣子嗎
There. Do you like my face?

200
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,740
你不適合留胡子
A beard doesn't suit you.

201
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,550
不知你的人民會對你做的事有何感想
I wonder how your citizens would feel about what you've done.

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,390
我可以把你們的船員送回俄羅斯  維克多
I could return your crew to Russia, Viktor.

203
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,730
你把艾丹·麥卡倫還給我們
You could return Aidan Macallan.

204
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,290
我不喜歡量化人的價值
I don't like to quantify human worth...

205
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,030
但麥卡倫的價值確實更高
but Macallan's is higher.

206
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,980
社交媒體是個強大的工具
Social media is a powerful tool.

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,680
如果美國采取任何救援措施
If there is any rescue attempt by the United States,

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,220
我就告訴俄亥俄州的人民你的真面目
I will tell the people of Ohio exactly how you look to them.

209
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,630
告訴他們你是如何破壞他們州的選舉的
Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.

210
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
他們會相信我的
And they will believe me.

211
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,440
奧本海默也曾是成員
Oppenheimer was a member.

212
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,450
那邊那棵樹
That tree right over there,

213
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,730
曼哈頓計劃就是誕生在那棵樹下
right under that tree, Manhattan Project was born.

214
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,100
而我在這顆樹下小解
And right under this one, I'm relieving myself.

215
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,220
希望你不是把我和原子彈畫上等號
I hope you're not equating me to the atom bomb.

216
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,290
你想要什么  內閣職位
What do you want? Cabinet position?

217
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,660
-弗蘭克·安德伍德  -司法任命
- Frank Underwood-- - Judicial appointments?

218
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,980
-支持你的法案  -勿談公事  勿談公事
- Legislative support? - Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.

219
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,860
對哦  因為曼哈頓計劃
Oh, right. Because the Manhattan Project

220
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,040
和商業或政治
had absolutely nothing to do

221
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,770
-毫無關系  -我希望你放松
- with business or politics. - I want you to breathe.

222
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,700
我希望你看看月光穿過樹稍的景色
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts through the trees.

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,510
弗蘭西斯  好好利用這次機會
Take this time, Francis,

224
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,480
了解一下其他人
to know your other attendees.

225
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,890
想想你究竟想做一名什么樣的總統
Think about what kind of president you really want to be.

226
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,680
這樣又如何
What am I supposed to do with that?

227
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,180
就是...
Just...

228
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,220
你就是這么跟將軍說的嗎
Oh, is that what you told the general?

229
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,960
抗命
Insubordination.

230
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,350
密謀叛變
Clandestine coup.

231
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,450
對  這才是真正的領袖
Oh, yes, that's the stuff of real leadership.

232
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,650
有錢人喜歡軍人
People with money like uniforms.

233
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,230
馬克  告訴我他們想要什么
Mark, just tell me what they want.

234
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,120
他們在等你
They're waiting for you.

235
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,980
你起得真早  總統先生
You're up early, Mr. President.

236
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,340
習慣了
Always.

237
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,020
你餓嗎  我有雞蛋
Are you hungry? I have, uh, eggs,

238
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,730
還有橙汁  山蛤蜊
and orange juice, mountain oysters.

239
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,150
你說的是牛睪丸  對嗎
You mean bull's testicles, don't you?

240
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,500
我喜歡叫它們的本名
I prefer to call things what they are.

241
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,130
出人意料啊
This is unexpected.

242
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,100
我以為你會一直忙著競選的事
I thought you'd stay out there campaigning

243
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
直到最后一口氣
till your dying breath.

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,350
怎么  把你們丟在這荒山野嶺
What, and leave you out here all alone in the wilderness

245
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,120
去做那些重要的決策嗎
to make all these important decisions?

246
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,040
我以前待你不薄  雷蒙德  我希望你支持我
You've done well by me, Raymond. I'd like your support.

247
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,570
是你妻子待我不薄
I've done well by your wife.

248
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,990
而她現在又正好是掌管白宮的人
Who happens, at this moment, to rule the White House.

249
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,000
別跟我說你是想拿你妻子來賄賂我
Tell me you're not peddling influence with your wife?

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,130
你是說現在的美國代總統嗎
Who, you mean the current acting President of the United States?

251
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,980
也就再做兩周吧
For the next two weeks.

252
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,800
稍有收斂  那才讓人出乎意料呢
A little restraint? Now, that... that would be unexpected.

253
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,920
你的雞蛋想怎么吃
How do you like your eggs?

254
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,730
下午再吃
In the afternoon.

255
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,330
早上好  總統先生
Good morning, Mr. President.

256
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,800
在極樂之地可沒有總統  不是嗎
Oh, no presidents here at Elysian Fields, isn't that right?

257
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,220
只有前任的  或者將來的
Only former ones... or future.

258
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,110
我不會把這稱為政治  這只是時事
Well, I won't call this politics, then. Just current affairs.

259
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,980
我們有過很好的機會拿下艾哈邁迪
We had a real chance to get Ahmadi.

260
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,010
我們的團隊收到簡報了
Our campaign was briefed.

261
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,800
你們知道得要更詳細些吧
I think a little more than just briefed.

262
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,590
你有多的襪子嗎  雷蒙德
Do you have an extra pair of socks, Raymond?

263
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,530
服了30年的兵役
After 30 years of military service,

264
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,230
按說我該自己備好呢
you'd think I'd arrive prepared.

265
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,780
這里肯定有人能幫你找一雙[膽子]
Oh, I'm sure someone around here could find you a pair.

266
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,290
-我的鋪位下面有  -謝謝
- Under my bunk. - Thank you.

267
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,940
他是個好人
He's a good man.

268
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,260
很難找到不信任或不喜歡他的人
Hard to find anybody who distrusts or dislikes him.

269
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,310
你到底要不要雞蛋
So do you want eggs or not?

270
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,900
以這個關稅率
With this rate of tariff,

271
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,350
我有信心會對反傾銷案例
I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect

272
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,350
起到減震作用
on the anti-dumping cases.

273
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,720
我覺得這能行
I think this is going to work.

274
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,510
我得向我國外交部國務委員請示
I'll need to run this by my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.

275
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,450
我認為今天對我們兩國都是個好日子
I think this is a very good day for both of our countries.

276
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,750
是的
Yes, it is.

277
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,780
船上有個美國人
There's an American on the boat.

278
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,010
那艘俄羅斯的考察船上
The Russian research vessel.

279
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,280
-你怎么知道的  -你進來前徐先生告訴我的
- And how do you know that? - Mr. Xu told me before you came in.

280
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,000
我需要證據
I will need proof of that fact.

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
當然  但我們告訴你
Of course, but we are only telling you

282
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,930
只是因為我們知道你們會想援救他
because we know you'll want to rescue him.

283
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,450
中方愿在力所能及的范圍內盡量幫忙
And China is willing to help in any way we can.

284
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,540
我很好奇  徐先生
I'm just curious, Mr. Xu,

285
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,780
你為何如此關注這一情況
why are you so focused on this situation?

286
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,440
出于人道主義原因
For humanitarian reasons.

287
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,950
謝謝您的時間和合作  代總統女士
Thank you for your time and cooperation, Madam Acting President.

288
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,440
這是必要條件
It's contingent.

289
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,000
如果希望部長繼續關稅交易
The minister won't proceed with our tariff deal

290
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,870
我們必須向他保證  救援已經開展
if we don't give him assurances that the rescue is underway.

291
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,470
中方為何如此關心
Why do the Chinese care so much

292
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,550
這艘俄羅斯船上有什么
about what's on this Russian boat?

293
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,020
不知道  我自己也是剛知道
I don't know. I was just informed myself.

294
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
他們在合作嗎
Are they working together?

295
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,220
再說一次  我不知道
Again, I don't know.

296
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,720
你在跟他們合作嗎
Are you working with them?

297
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,610
我跟誰都合作
I work with everybody.

298
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,300
但這不是重點  關鍵是船上有個美國人
But that's beside the point. There is an American on board.

299
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,920
你相信嗎
And you believe that?

300
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,480
你可不想做出錯誤的決定
Well, you wouldn't want to make the wrong call.

301
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,570
公牛的睪丸
Bull's balls.

302
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,740
一只大烏鴉
A giant crow.

303
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,650
還有百萬富翁們呼喊著  "釋我自由"
And billionaires chanting, "Set me free."

304
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,610
這地方真是把我無法言表的感覺都呈現出來了
Well, this place says everything I feel, but can't express.

305
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,170
他不可能是你的朋友
He can't be your friend.

306
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,750
塔斯克沒有朋友
Tusk doesn't have any friends.

307
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,810
他是個...伙伴
He's, uh, an associate.

308
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,410
是嗎
Really?

309
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,800
他跟你有什么伙伴關系
And how does he associate with you?

310
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,370
別管那該死的蜜蜂了  沒人在意它
Oh, to hell with the buzzing bees. No one else is heeding it.

311
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,480
一個電視臺總裁  一個電信首席執行官
A network president, a telecom CEO,

312
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
還有一個副總統候選人
the vice presidential candidate.

313
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,780
你覺得他們都在聊什么
What do you think they're all talking about,

314
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,710
-他們最近看的書嗎  -你又在看什么
- the last book they read? - What are you reading?

315
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,350
你的臉
Your face...

316
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,170
它讓我知道了你有多不想待在這里
which tells me how much you don't want to be here.

317
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,720
塔斯克先生曾是威爾競選的主要捐助者
Mr. Tusk was a major donor on Will's campaign.

318
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,120
嗯  所以他沒受邀  這很有趣
Yes, so it's interesting that he wasn't invited.

319
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,490
我們在合作一個項目
We're partnering on a project.

320
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,550
沙漠里的大規模數據存儲中心
Large-scale data storage centers in the desert.

321
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,030
太陽能的
Solar-powered.

322
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,710
我得去準備我的演講
I need to get ready for my talk.

323
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,840
《來世: 我們留下的》
"The Life After: What We Leave Behind."

324
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,120
但愿你會出席
Hope you'll be there.

325
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,760
你聞聞
Smell that.

326
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,120
高斯巴雪茄
Cohiba.

327
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,100
我知道你很喜歡
I know you're a fan.

328
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,330
雖然我不抽了  但不代表我不能...
Even though I don't smoke anymore, doesn't mean I can't--

329
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,470
誰組織的這周末的聚會  你嗎
Who called this weekend's gathering? You?

330
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,250
不是  是塔斯克
No. Tusk did.

331
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,730
怎么
Why?

332
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,200
我們覺得中國人說得對  船上的確有一位美國人
We think the Chinese are right. There is an American on board.

333
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,500
這是撒德·彼得森  兩年前退休了
This is Thad Peterson. Retired two years ago.

334
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,520
地球物理研究主任
Director of geophysics research

335
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,470
在美國幾家頂尖石油公司供職
for some of the country's top oil companies.

336
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,410
我們強烈懷疑他在那艘船上
We strongly suspect he's on board the boat.

337
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,060
正在和俄羅斯人合作
Working with the Russians.

338
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,490
證據呢
Where's the proof?

339
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,310
這是通訊中斷前
This was sent from a Russian sailor's cell phone

340
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,320
俄羅斯船員的手機發出的
before communications were cut off.

341
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,450
打開無線電求救
Get on the radio and call for help!

342
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,860
他的妻子確認
His wife confirmed that

343
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,330
錄音里就是撒德·彼得森的聲音
this is Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.

344
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,310
24小時后  最多36小時  那艘船就會沉
In 24, 36 hours tops, that boat's gone.

345
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,730
對  但那不能證明撒德·彼得森在船上
Yes, but that doesn't prove that Thad Peterson was on the ship.

346
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,260
但女士  他是美國人
But, ma'am... he is an American--

347
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,660
不  我們不能確定  除非有乘客名單
No, we can't be sure until we have a passenger manifest.

348
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,000
等有更多信息再開會
Let's reconvene when you know more.

349
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,640
-怎么了  凱茜  -你決定不干預
- What is it, Cathy? - Your decision not to intervene.

350
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,120
如果有美國人在非法工作
If an American is working illegally,

351
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,930
他不會出現在名單上
he will not be on the manifest--

352
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,250
我還沒做決定  我在等更多信息
I haven't made a decision. I'm waiting for more information.

353
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,280
這關系到了艾丹·麥卡倫
This is about Aidan Macallan.

354
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,510
我非常確信
I am very confident

355
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,280
中國謊稱有美國人在船上
China is lying about an American being on board.

356
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
船上有他們想要的東西
There is something on that boat they want

357
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,650
得等我知道是什么再說
and I can't proceed until I know what it is.

358
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,220
他們說自己的動機是救人
They say they're motivated by saving human lives.

359
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,880
但那不是他們的真實動機
But that's not what's driving them.

360
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,320
我只是覺得難以接受
And I just find it so frustrating

361
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,720
人命受到如此漠視
when human life is treated with such disregard.

362
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,630
抱歉  但...
We're sorry. But...

363
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,720
俗話說的"林間漫步"不適合我
The proverbial walk in the woods is not for me.

364
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,810
在林蔭小徑尋尋覓覓
Navel-gazing on some forest path.

365
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,610
思考死亡與永生
Contemplating mortality. Immortality.

366
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,020
才不  歷史要去爭取
No. History is earned.

367
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,470
贏了今天  然后再去贏明天
You win the day, and then you win the day after,

368
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,010
日復一日  至死方休
and you do the same thing every day until you're dead.

369
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,890
你被載入史冊  不是因為你總贏
And you're remembered not for the winning,

370
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,650
而是因為你從不輸
but because you never lost.

371
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,830
好了
Now...

372
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,970
道格
Doug?

373
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,530
道格  能聽到嗎
Doug, can you hear me?

374
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,560
我現在需要些籌碼
I need some leverage out here right now.

375
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,630
-怎么了  -康威完了
- What's going on? - Conway is finished.

376
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,690
如果他們勝選
If they win,

377
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,180
布洛哈特會操控大局
Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.

378
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,720
他會成為真正的總統
He'll essentially be the president.

379
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,180
我們該利用對手研究信息
We should have used the oppo.

380
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,350
聽著  布洛哈特是塔斯克挑的人
Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.

381
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,350
我得找辦法逼那老頭支持我
I need to find a way to force that old man to support me.

382
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,550
-先生  總統先生  -聽得到嗎
- Sir? Mr. President? - Do you hear me?

383
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,460
我在聽
I'm here.

384
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,490
塔斯克和波利跳達成了交易
Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.

385
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,620
我需要想辦法阻止他們
I need to find a way to stop that.

386
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,270
發個行政命令
An executive order...

387
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,410
先生
Sir?

388
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,140
稍有收斂
A little restraint...

389
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,530
那才讓人出乎意料
would be unexpected.

390
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
總統先生
Mr. President?

391
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,580
-道格  -先生
- Doug. - Sir?

392
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,260
什么都別做
Don't do anything.

393
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,250
我不明白
I don't understand.

394
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,550
什么都別做  等我的指令
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

395
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,190
-先生  波利跳交易怎么辦  -聽見了嗎
- Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal? - Do you hear me?

396
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,570
-什么都別...  -總統先生  我
- Don't do anything... - Mr. President, I...

397
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,360
你打回去了嗎
Have you tried calling him back?

398
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,730
沒人接  我們該做什么
There's no answer. What should we do?

399
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,370
什么都不做  總統既然說了  那就聽他的
Nothing. That's what the president said, so that's what we'll do.

400
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,870
-讓護衛把他撤出來嗎  -不  我們等著
- Should we have his team pull him out? - No. We wait.

401
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,650
夫人
Ma'am...

402
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,560
-如果我們沒能妥當處置營救的事  -道格
- if we don't handle this rescue correctly... - Doug.

403
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,270
讓我想辦法讓總統和佩特羅夫通上電話
Let me find a way to get the president on the phone with Petrov.

404
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,400
不  弗蘭西斯不需要分心
No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.

405
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,550
我不同意
I disagree.

406
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,340
我知道你不同意
I know you do.

407
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,370
人說三代之后就沒人會記得我們了
They say we're only remembered for three generations.

408
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,210
那一個人該做些什么才能不被忘卻呢
What would one have to do not to be forgotten?

409
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,970
小本杰明知道未來是啥樣
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.

410
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,430
誰在乎他沒聽說過約翰尼·卡森[主持人]
Who cares if he's never heard of Johnny Carson?

411
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
可憐的老塔斯克
Poor old Tusk.

412
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,030
別看他嬉皮笑臉的  但他可騙不了我
He wears that game face, but he doesn't fool me.

413
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,550
未來讓他恐懼  因為他知道自己時日無多
The future terrifies him because he knows it's short.

414
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,040
聲明一下  我知道約翰尼·卡森是誰
For the record, I have heard of Johnny Carson.

415
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,570
他每天晚上哄我爸媽上床
He tucked my parents into bed every night.

416
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,910
我今天得到了特別的許可
I've been given special permission

417
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,360
向大家展示我們的成果
to show you what we've been working on.

418
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,170
想象這樣一種可能  你的大腦  你的意識
Imagine the possibility of your brain, your consciousness,

419
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,370
都實時進行數字化存儲
stored digitally in real time.

420
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,000
永生究竟是什么
I mean, what is immortality?

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
終有一日  格蘭特的設想也會過時
In time, even Grant's vision will get old.

422
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,160
早晚的事  誰都免不了
It will happen, as it does for all of us.

423
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,900
這還只是早期版本
Now this is still in the early stages,

424
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,550
但我們一直在收集儲存
but we've been collecting and storing

425
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,900
雷蒙德的記憶  想法  怪癖和愛好
Raymond's memories, thoughts, quirks and tics.

426
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,530
這還只是實驗版本  但最終
This is a mock-up. But eventually...

427
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,770
這個雷蒙德
this Raymond...

428
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,470
會像各位眼前這位一樣活生生
will feel as real as the one standing before you.

429
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,540
我更喜歡腳踏實地
I like dirt and rocks...

430
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,880
貨真價實
and facts.

431
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,970
這我也同意
No argument here.

432
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,850
我只相信能抓在手里的  或者能親眼看到的
I trust only what I can hold in my hand or see on my horizon.

433
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,250
但你不能光干坐著看風景啊
Well, but you can't just sit back and admire the view.

434
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,330
我就發現一定要緊抓當下
I've learned you've got to grab the present by the balls.

435
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,350
那才是美國人民在乎的
That's where the American people live.

436
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,480
你更像個推銷員而不是總統  總統先生
You sound more like a salesman than a president, Mr. President.

437
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,010
我們是美國人  我們就是推銷員
Well, if we're Americans, then we are salesmen, right?

438
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,420
這是我們天生的權利
That's our birthright.

439
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,630
賣車  賣手機  賣汽油
Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.

440
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,640
我眼里的美國可不是這樣
That's not how I see America.

441
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,670
我是愛國者  我為國效力
I'm a patriot. I serve.

442
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
那我們向你致敬  將軍
Well, then, we salute you, General.

443
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,850
但你為國效力的意義是什么
But you serve to what purpose?

444
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,470
不還是為了其他美國人能去推銷
So the rest of America can sell.

445
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,860
你看  這個周末  你和我
I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend,

446
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,910
不就在這個營地推銷自己嗎
we're here at this camp selling ourselves.

447
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,180
人的品質不言自明
Character speaks for itself.

448
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,220
人民需要一個他們能信賴的總統
People want a president they can trust.

449
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,150
錯  不對  他們需要一個他們了解的總統
No, they don't. They want a president they know.

450
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,530
而我也了解他們
And I know them.

451
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,190
我唯一感興趣的未來就是接下來的四年
The only future I'm interested in is the next four years.

452
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,590
所以沒錯  我明天要推銷  后天接著推銷
So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow and the day after that

453
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,300
大后天還要推銷
and the day after that.

454
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,260
我是在推銷一個曾經住在桃子農場的男孩
I'm selling a boy who used to live on a peach farm

455
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,360
而他現在住在白宮
who now lives in the White House.

456
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,250
我要推銷一個
I'm selling a tomorrow

457
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,360
可觸可感的明天
that you can see and touch and feel.

458
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,640
要是你把這個奪走
Now, you take that away,

459
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,330
我不知道這國家還剩下什么
and I don't know what this country has left.

460
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,080
只剩下一群成年男人
Except a group of grown men

461
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,570
圍成一圈  盯著一小塊屏幕
standing around in a circle, all staring at a small screen.

462
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,930
只向內看  而不往外面看
Looking in instead of looking out.

463
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,810
那隨時給我蓋一把黃土吧
Heck, give me a peck of dirt any day of the week.

464
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,910
說得好  敬黃土
Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,960
-說得好  -我要敬這一杯
- Hear, hear. - I will drink to that,

466
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,850
也要敬將軍一杯  他是位優秀的公仆
but I will also drink to the general, a good servant.

467
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,210
敬將軍
To the general.

468
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,800
我敢肯定  這一交易隨時可能落空
I promise you, this deal is on the verge of falling apart.

469
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,140
就在重新投票之前
Right before your revote.

470
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,910
我只是個傳話的
I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.

471
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,050
我們不能讓這筆交易落空
We can't let this deal fall apart.

472
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,250
沒錯  但我們必須馬上救援
Agreed. But the rescue has to happen immediately.

473
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,550
你好像跟這事有利益關系
You seem personally invested in this.

474
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,120
不不  我只是在尋找解決方案
Oh, no, no. I'm just looking for a solution.

475
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,590
我有個想法
I had a thought.

476
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,680
我愿意讓駐扎在喬治王島的
I would be willing to allow the Chinese sailors

477
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,450
中國船員登上我們的破冰船
that are stationed on King George Island to board our icebreaker.

478
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,360
然后  在內部攝像機前
Then, purely for the in-house cameras,

479
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,340
擺出是中國領導了此次救援的樣子
we let it appear as though the Chinese led the rescue.

480
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,300
當然  自始至終
Now, of course, the whole time,

481
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,280
都會是美國控制船
the Americans would remain in charge of the boat,

482
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,100
但不必讓俄羅斯人知道我們參與了
but the Russians don't need to know our involvement.

483
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,750
我覺得這是可以接受的
I imagine that would be acceptable.

484
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,990
我馬上就向徐先生轉達
I'll relay this scenario to Mr. Xu immediately.

485
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,550
我還想把關稅湊整成20%
But I'd also like to round up the tariff to 20%.

486
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,990
我們已經商定19%了
We have a firm deal at 19.

487
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,050
我知道  但突然間  這似乎不夠高
I know. But suddenly, it just doesn't seem high enough.

488
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,210
我覺得他們會答應的
I think they'll be okay with it.

489
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,690
祈禱如此吧  我盡力
Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.

490
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,520
-還挺順利的  -是啊  非常順利
- That went rather well, I think. - It did. It went very well.

491
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,890
你超出了所有人的預料
You've exceeded everyone's expectations,

492
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,470
整個周末你的表現很出色  但是
the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...

493
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,560
他們能預料布洛哈特的一舉一動
Brockhart's someone they can predict.

494
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,630
話先別說太早  這事還沒完
Don't get ahead of yourself. This is not over.

495
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,450
你要干什么  弗蘭西斯  你要利用對手研究嗎
What are you gonna do, Francis? Are you gonna use the oppo?

496
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,140
你似乎很著急嘛
Well, it seems to have worried you enough.

497
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,500
他還只是副總統候選人
He's still only the vice presidential candidate.

498
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,340
我要走了
I'm leaving.

499
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,480
-你不用走的  -我知道  什么都不是必須的
- You don't have to go. - No, I know. I don't have to do anything.

500
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,130
你記得我們第一次見面的情景吧
Do you remember when we first met?

501
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,590
你差一點就加入我第二次競選了
You almost joined my second campaign.

502
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,980
我們坐在加夫尼的便宜館子里
We sat down at that little greasy spoon in Gaffney.

503
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,800
記得  要是你招了我  肯定就大獲全勝了
Yeah, if you'd signed me on, you would have won by a landslide.

504
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,650
我還是贏了  因為我從不輸
I won anyway, because I never lose.

505
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,060
你知道當時我為什么沒雇你嗎
You know why I didn't hire you back then?

506
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,470
因為你去結賬的時候
Because when you went to pick up the check,

507
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,730
你告訴我不用給你錢
you told me I didn't have to pay you.

508
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,410
你愿意不要報酬為我工作  我不信
That you would work for free. I don't trust that.

509
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,050
因為誰也不會不要報酬
Because no one works for free.

510
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,980
總統女士  恐怕我不能同意20%
Madam President, I'm afraid I can't agree to 20%.

511
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,140
-對經濟的影響  -我們陷入僵局了
- The economic implications-- - We're at an impasse.

512
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,300
我很希望能繼續對話  但與此同時
I'm willing to keep the conversation going, but in the meantime--

513
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,770
你們不同意  我們就不行動
We'll do nothing until you agree.

514
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,810
總統女士  會有人喪命的
Madam President, people will die.

515
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,760
所以我才驚訝你居然不同意我的條件
Which is why I'm surprised you won't agree to my terms.

516
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,830
除非外交部國務委員同意
I can't agree to the terms without the approval

517
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,520
否則我不能同意你的條件
of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.

518
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,650
船上有112人
There are 112 people aboard the vessel.

519
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,250
要是算上彼得森先生就是113人
113 if you count Mr. Peterson.

520
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,080
20至32小時后  船就會完全沉沒
Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.

521
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,840
現在南冰洋的水溫
The temperature of the Southern Ocean right now

522
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,430
是零下2攝氏度
is 28 degrees Fahrenheit.

523
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,560
在這么冷的水里  人不到45分鐘
A body will freeze to death within 45 minutes

524
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,080
就會凍死
in water that cold.

525
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
更不要說在凍死之前早就失去游泳能力了
And, of course, one loses the ability to swim long before that.

526
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,320
徐部長  你還在嗎
Minister Xu, are you still there?

527
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,700
和佩特羅夫總統合謀永遠是個錯誤
Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.

528
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,810
20%的關稅會幫你們長長記性
The 20% tariff will help you keep that in mind.

529
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,050
我等你回復
I'm waiting.

530
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,290
這些人的死活取決于你了
It's up to you if they live or die.

531
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,090
-船員呢  -全部獲救
- The crew? - All rescued.

532
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
撒德·彼得森呢
And Thad Peterson?

533
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,130
你猜的沒錯  中國人在撒謊
You were right. The Chinese were lying.

534
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,770
只有他仍然下落不明
He's the only one still unaccounted for.

535
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,040
上將說還有機會拯救那艘船
The admiral says there's still a chance to save the boat.

536
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,180
讓它沉吧
Let it go down.

537
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,500
那佩特羅夫放在船上的東西呢
And whatever Petrov has on it?

538
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,390
我們這么做是對的  凱茜
We're doing the right thing, Cathy.

539
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,750
你已經達到目的了  維克多
You got what you wanted, Viktor.

540
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,490
船已經沉了  讓我們接著往下談吧
The boat is gone. Now let's get back to where we left off.

541
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,910
你想要什么  才能換艾丹·麥卡倫回國
What will it take to get Aidan Macallan back on American soil?

542
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,370
他挺喜歡這里的
He likes it here.

543
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,350
要走了嗎  總統先生
Leaving, Mr. President?

544
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,810
先放車上吧  謝謝
You can put that in the car, thank you.

545
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,250
-你沒事吧  -好多了
- Are you all right? - Better now.

546
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,810
你喝醉了
Are you drunk?

547
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,660
-來一口嗎  -不了
- You want a pull? - No.

548
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,750
我討厭這地方
I hate this place.

549
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,660
這些人
These men.

550
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,630
一個個仗著特權  趾高氣揚
Their privilege, their presumption.

551
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,100
和塔斯克的交易就是個錯誤
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.

552
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
你知道嗎
Do you know...

553
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,230
雷蒙德想把自己凍起來
Raymond wants to be frozen?

554
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,220
封進冰里  等將來再解凍
Put on ice until a later date.

555
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,900
-我要走了  -威爾·康威是我的朋友  但
- I have to get going. - Will Conway's my friend. But...

556
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,020
如果他贏了  不會有什么好結果的
this won't end well for him if he wins.

557
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,160
你照顧好自己  本
You take care of yourself, Ben.

558
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,300
他們有段他的錄音
They have a recording of him.

559
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,690
我馬上就過去
I'll be right there in a minute.

560
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
你必須向我保證
You have to promise me

561
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,800
威爾·康威絕不能知道是我給你的
Will Conway never finds out this came from me.

562
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,940
你知道我會成為總統吧
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?

563
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,650
-希望如此  先生  -你希望如此
- I hope so, sir. - You hope so?

564
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,190
我只是說我支持你  先生
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.

565
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,440
我一定會成為總統
I'm gonna be the president,

566
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,210
你也一定要把那該死的操縱桿給我
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.

567
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,200
先生
Sir!

568
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,730
這肯定是飛行員錄的
I think this must have been recorded by the pilot.

569
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,990
我們應該先發給MSNBC和CNN
We should go to MSNBC and CNN first.

570
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,150
-我們可以大范圍傳播  -不  先等等
- We can go wide. - No, let's wait.

571
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,310
弗蘭西斯  你也聽到了
Francis, you heard what I heard.

572
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,310
所以留到明天效果一樣好
And it'll be just as good tomorrow.

573
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,890
讓道爾來核實  明天早上見
Have Doyle confirm it. I'll see you in the morning.

574
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,350
為什么不現在動手
Why not do it now?

575
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,340
我們要等總統回來
We need to wait for the president.

576
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,390
新聞持續關注

看來兩位候選人終于精力不濟
Exhaustion must be catching up with the candidates,

585
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,610
安德伍德總統和他的競選搭檔周末休息

590
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,560
還有更糟的死法
There are worse ways to go.

591
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,160
我要坦白一件事
I have a confession.

592
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,760
你做了什么
What'd you do?

593
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,800
你在紐約時  我有時讓人監視你

她叫凱倫

595
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,390
她是誰

596
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,940
我覺得你沒資格問這個
I don't know you get to ask that.

597
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,500
她是我以前的老師
She was my teacher.

教過我神學和一些別的
Theology, among other things.

我不知我為什么那么做
I don't know why I did that.

600
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,810
不是因為嫉妒
It's not... about jealousy.

601
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,600
其實  她救過我的命
She saved my life, actually.

602
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,570
我很高興
I'm glad.

603
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,970
我們短時間內不會再見到凱倫了
Well, we won't be seeing Karen for a while.

604
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,010
她懂我  她看得出我對你的感覺
She knows me. She could see how I feel about you.

605
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,990
女士  這是初步協議
Ma'am, an initialed agreement.

606
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,640

中國和俄羅斯
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians

608
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,830
獲取了一項他們不該有的技術

609
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,260
又不想失去
and didn't want to lose.

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,460
現在他們失去了
And now they've lost it.

611
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,700
你有什么沒告訴我的
What aren't you telling me?

612
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,830
你想從中得到什么
What did you want out of all of this?

613
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,200
我告訴過你我想要什么
I told you what I wanted.

614
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,310
我想要那美國人離開那艘船
I wanted that American off the boat.

615
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,470
他就是那項技術
He was the technology.

616
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,700
來  給我
Here, give me that.

617
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,910
走吧

619
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,610
警探  我拿到盤了
Detective, I got the drive.

620
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,950
還沒有  我剛放進電腦
Uh, no, I just put it in.

621
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,760
時間標識是
And... the time stamp says

622
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,180
2013年11月3日晚8:13
November 3rd, 2013, 8:13 p.m.

623
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,010
等一下
Hold on a second.

624
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,680
你沒事吧
You all right?

625
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,040
沒事  我要出去一下
Yeah. I just need to get out for a minute.

626
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,310
我在
I'm here.

627
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,750
我知道  我知道你忙
I know. I know you're busy.

628
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,930
感謝無以言表  我...
And I can't thank you enough, I...

629
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,330
我看看
Let me back you up a bit.

630
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,730
好  這是她死前兩天的錄像
Okay, so this is two days before she died.

631
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,970
州長聽起來精神錯亂了
The governor sounds unhinged.

632
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,430
不過我不太安心
It bothers me, though.

633
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,730
這也來得太容易了  你不覺得嗎
It came too easy, don't you think?

634
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,180
是的  但如果用上它  我們就能贏
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.

635
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,450
我不知道  克萊爾  你了解這些人
I don't know, Claire. You know these types of people.

636
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,080
你要是在場就好了
You should have been there.

637
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,340
他們為什么要給我
Why would they hand me...

638
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,440
他就那么交給我了 為什么呢
He just handed me this. Why?

639
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,640
他們從不希望我當選  從一開始就是
When they've never wanted me, not from the beginning,

640
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,080
不論我怎么做
no matter what I do!

641
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,960
-讓他們見鬼去  -我正有此意
- Fuck 'em. - I intend to.

642
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,240
那你打算怎么做
And how do you intend to do that?

643
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
我要回來工作了
I'm going back to work.

644
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,130
我要回來工作了
I'm going back to work.

645
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,490
我們很高興你能來
We're glad you came.

646
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,780
聽說這種周末活動過后得緩上一陣
I hear those weekends can, uh, take some recovery time.

647
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,730
我得說  我沒想到這么快就會再來
I must say, I didn't expect to be back here so soon.

648
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,870
馬克  我們再次請你來是因為
Well, Mark, we asked you back here because...

649
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,630
我們又拿到了一份錄音
we've come into possession of a second audio recording

650
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,240
是你的候選人在飛機上說的話
of your candidate on an airplane.

651
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,300
-他在錄音里說...  -我知道他說了什么
- He's been recorded saying... - I know what he said.

652
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,120
我當時在場
I was there.

653
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,590
不知我們能否商討一下
So, we were wondering if we can discuss how...

654
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,940
我們可以如何合作
we might be able to work together.

655
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,110
我們三個人能實現很多成果
We can accomplish a great deal. The three of us.

656
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,920
在你說話前
Now, before you say anything,

657
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,330
我先說說這場談話會如何進行
let me tell you how this conversation's going to go.

658
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,170
你會說到黨派忠誠
You're going to talk about party loyalty,

659
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,350
我會說你的候選人有多差勁
and I'm going to talk about how weak your candidates are

660
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,130
你其實別無選擇
and that you really have no choice.

661
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,260
然后你會說你們還能贏下俄亥俄州
And then you're going to say that your ticket can still win Ohio.

662
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,200
接著我會說"不  贏不了"
And I'm going to say, "No, they can't."

663
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,230
但這場談話中不會談到
But what's going to go unsaid in this conversation

664
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,640
我和克萊爾
is that Claire and I...

665
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,000
愿意不惜一切
are willing... to do anything.

666
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,240
我們知道
And we know...

667
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,810
你也如此
that you are no different.

668
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,380
好吧  我可以先為你倆安排一些會面
Okay, I can start by setting up some meetings for both of you.

669
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,520
當然不能公開行動
I can't do that publicly, of course.

670
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,810
我建議你們慢慢抖出手上的料
I suggest you release whatever you have slowly.

671
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,690
一次一條
One at a time.

672
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,340
讓事情發酵
Let's make this build.

673
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,010
消息一曝光
Once it gets out,

674
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,490
我會確保共和黨人
I'll make sure the Republicans

675
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,590
不會維護我的候選人
don't come to my candidate's defense.

676
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,230
我當時的情況很糟
I was in a really bad place.

677
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,670
什么都做不了
I couldn't do anything.

678
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,890
無法離開我的公寓
I couldn't leave my apartment.

679
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
為什么
Why?

680
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,760
這種事的發生  很莫名
It's mysterious, isn't it, when these things happen?

681
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,550
或許你沒遇到過
Or maybe it never happened to you.

682
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,890
但我有一天醒來  感覺好像...
But I woke up one day and it felt like...

683
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,810
我考慮要做的一切
everything I contemplated doing, everything,

684
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,840
從去咖啡店
from going to the coffee shop...

685
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,990
到看一本書  寫一章書  就是很...
to... reading a book, writing a chapter, it was just...

686
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,190
可笑
laughable.

687
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,190
什么意思
As in?

688
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,370
就是  沒有意義
As in... pointless.

689
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,350
但多虧了凱倫
And Karen, bless her...

690
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,990
她幫我找到了意義  不是找到
she helped me find a point. Or, not find one.

691
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,440
而是發現找到意義的可能性
Realize the possibility of one.

692
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,310
你們當時在一起嗎
Were you together?

693
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,050
沒錯  我們還結了婚
Yeah. We were married.

694
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,140
大概三年  都是陳年舊事
For about three years. A million years ago.

695
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,490
她人很好
She's a good person.

696
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,060
她只是...現在狀況不太好  所以我想幫她
She's just... having a hard time. So I'm trying to help her.

697
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,920
找到意義
Find a point?

698
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,460
你經歷過那種低谷嗎
You ever been that dark?

699
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,400
我想和你在一起
I wanna be with you.

700
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,310
我愛你
I love you.

701
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,780
我也許也愛你
I think I might love you, too.

702
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,570
這是30秒宣傳片的稿子
That's the script for the 30-second spot.

703
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
我們不想下手太重
We don't wanna hit him too hard.

704
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,010
不然可能被當成落井下石
There's a risk of kicking him while he's down.

705
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,980
誰上晨間節目
Who's doing the morning shows?

706
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,930
朋友  他們會禮貌地質疑康威的勝任能力
Friends. They'll respectfully question Conway's ability to serve.

707
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,480
然后在晚間新聞中
And then in the nightly news,

708
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,200
會有退休軍人權利活動家爭取更好的醫療
we'll have veteran rights activists arguing for better care.

709
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,280
很好
Good.

710
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,390
先生  計劃先打擊州長
Sir, the plan is to go after the governor first,

711
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,750
等將軍出面維護他
and when the general comes to his defense,

712
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,390
我們再用他抗命的錄音扳倒他
we use his hot mic comments to take him down, too.

713
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,290
祝賀你  先生
Congratulations, sir.

714
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,180
我想第一個祝賀你
I wanted to be the first to say it.

715
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,090
我們還得走競選流程
We still have to campaign.

716
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,550
沒錯  但您會勝選
Yeah, but you're going to win.

717
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,880
我們會的  道格
We are, Doug.

718
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,290
我們會的
We are.

719
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,790
俗世煩惱啊  散去吧
Common woe, be done.

721
00:43:37,190 --> 00:44:37,190
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}各種各樣的兄弟會組織在歐美國家有著悠久的歷史
其中最廣為人知  同時也是同美國總統聯系最多的是"共濟會"
共濟會成立于18世紀的英格蘭  組織神秘  對會員遴選嚴格
會員中有許多政客  藝術家  科學家
如莫扎特  馬克·吐溫  發明青霉素的弗萊明等  都是共濟會會員
傳至美國后  同美國建國的歷史一直有著千絲萬縷的聯系
在簽署獨立宣言的55人中  有9名共濟會會員
而迄今為止的45任美國總統里  有15名是共濟會會員  達三分之一
(其中林登·約翰遜沒能完成晉級程序  未成為正式會員
所以有的統計沒將他算上  認為只有14名總統真正是共濟會會員)
