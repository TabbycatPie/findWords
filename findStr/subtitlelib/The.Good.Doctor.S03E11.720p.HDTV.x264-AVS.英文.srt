18
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,820
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

19
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,500
Can we just hold each other for a little bit?

20
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,860
Deal with your crap

21
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,100
before this is who you really become.

22
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm sorry for making you meet me after hours like this.

23
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm always available for my patients.

24
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,470
Come on in.

25
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,160
Your dad's been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

26
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,090
You're not like other people.

27
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,700
You're like a spoiled, little baby.

28
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,500
Shaun?

29
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,610
You okay?

30
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,120
We have to be at the airport at 7:00 a.m.

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,990
I think when you're taking the first flight out of Casper,

32
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,200
you don't need to be there 90 minutes early.

33
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,930
Or maybe you do.

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,610
You want to talk about last night?

35
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,820
I think we should.

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,880
Why?

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,390
Because you were in a pretty bad place,

38
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,030
which is totally understanda...

39
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,320
I feel better now.

40
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,510
Thank you.

41
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,630
I'm glad I could help you.

42
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,060
But I also think

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,550
we shouldn't tell anyone I stayed here all night.

44
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,370
People might get the wrong idea.

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,500
Okay.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,490
We slept together.

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,120
Did you use protection?

48
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,460
N-no. We did not have sex. We just slept.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,130
Together.

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,960
Held each other.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,890
I was upset, and Lea comforted me.

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,200
Lying in bed with her,

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,660
it felt...

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,100
Different than it does with Carly.

55
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,370
Well, maybe that's why you invited Lea

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,640
instead of Carly in the first place?

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,950
Lea and I are just friends.

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,660
Yeah, she's made that very clear.

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,000
Sometimes you learn more about someone

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,690
by what they do than what they say.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,770
Of course, who the hell knows what she wants.

62
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,740
But more importantly, what do you want?

63
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,180
I don't know.

64
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,180
Well, you better figure it out soon.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,670
Sex or no sex, the wheels are in motion.

66
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,740
And someone's about to get run over.

67
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,180
They had Mallomars.

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,070
Let's roll.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
Respiratory tech to 3 East.

72
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,460
Respiratory tech to 3 East.

73
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,480
Shaun, y-you're back already?

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,150
Why wouldn't I be? I like being here.

75
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,000
Shaun.

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,250
I'm really sorry to hear about your father.

77
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,040
How are you doing?

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,950
He died.

79
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,730
And the seat was very uncomfortable on the flight,

80
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,860
so I couldn't sleep.

81
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,880
And they only had the salty peanuts

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,770
and not the pretzels I like.

83
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,280
Yeah. Life sucks.

84
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,230
We need a doctor!

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,210
We were mountain biking.

86
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,890
She fell down a rocky slide.

87
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,980
Her leg...

88
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,450
We'll need an X-ray and an MRI.

89
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,980
Let's also get you something stronger

90
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,040
- than this ice pack for the pain. - N-no.

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,410
Uh, they gave me Vicodin when I had my wisdom teeth pulled.

92
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,680
I was sick for two days.

93
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,340
We have other painkillers...

94
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,650
Really, I'm fine.

95
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,310
Look, I made it through childbirth without drugs.

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,590
I can make it through this.

97
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
That hurts less than childbirth?

98
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,080
Tender and bloated.

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,640
We should get you admitted, get an X-ray.

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,860
That's all right. All I need are laxatives.

101
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,340
Intestinal blockage could be fatal if we don't treat it.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,420
Please.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,220
I'm unemployed, and I don't have insurance right now.

104
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,520
How about this...

105
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,020
We skip the X-ray, give you the meds.

106
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,830
But in exchange, you agree to stay here

107
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,170
till you've had a bowel movement,

108
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,570
and we have peace of mind.

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,460
Deal.

110
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,670
Shaun, you're back.

111
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,270
Hello, Carly. It's good to see you. I missed you.

112
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,560
Morgan and I have a patient

113
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,610
with a comminuted leg fracture.

114
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,230
We need a rush on a C.B.C. and coagulation panel.

115
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,490
Shaun, I'm sorry about your Dad.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,570
Why didn't you return any of my calls or texts?

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,030
I was very busy.

118
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,190
You had time to text me.

119
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,020
I wasn't sure what to say.

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,610
Shaun, I know that you don't always understand people's feelings.

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
But a part of you had to understand

122
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,430
that ignoring me would be hurtful.

123
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm not sure what to say now.

124
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,710
My patient is getting an MRI.

125
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,200
I need to get back to them.

126
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,530
Are you going to take the samples?

127
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,840
PTSD.

128
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,870
It's an interesting topic.

129
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,490
Just organizing some notes for a potential case report.

130
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,050
Nice. Look forward to reading it.

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,620
I started seeing a therapist.

132
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,810
Good.

133
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,970
I hope you find it helpful.

134
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,760
She thinks I, uh... I might have PTSD.

135
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,160
Sounds a bit excessive.

136
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,220
You've definitely dealt with some childhood trauma.

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,710
You think she's right?

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,170
I think doctors make the worst patients.

139
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,090
The best patients are the ones who ask a lot of questions.

140
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,600
And keep an open mind.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,940
We gave him the laxatives,

142
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,340
and right away, he tried to leave.

143
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,690
Ended up passing out and vomiting.

144
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,270
I'm fine. I can take care of this at home.

145
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,620
We need to get him to Radiology.

146
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,280
We need an abdominal CT stat.

147
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,060
No. You can't keep me...

148
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,110
Can't keep me against my will.

149
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,600
Wherever you need to be, it can wait.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
You need help now.

151
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
What are you transporting?

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,550
Painful constipation, nervous agitation,

153
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,880
refusing scans...

154
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,970
You're obviously packing drugs.

155
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,580
The balloons have either created a complete obstruction

156
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,170
or one of them burst.

157
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,230
Please, I just want to go home.

158
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,620
Luca, we're doctors, not cops.

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
He definitely sounds like a cop.

160
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,560
We won't call the police, I promise.

161
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,150
Whatever is wrong, let us help you.

162
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,240
How's Carly?

163
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,700
She wasn't upset about you ghosting her

164
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,230
while you were with Lea in Wyoming?

165
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,430
She said it was hurtful.

166
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,270
You got off easy.

167
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,800
Is this your weird way of breaking up with Carly to get with Lea?

168
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,790
I don't want to break up with Carly.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,030
But you do want to get with Lea.

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,820
I didn't say that.

171
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,900
Not out loud.

172
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,570
And you're making a big mistake.

173
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,720
Carly's smart. Pretty.

174
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,800
And the fact that she's willing to deal with all your stuff

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
means you should be thanking whatever God you pray to

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,940
that you ever met her.

177
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,210
While Lea is... Well, a flake.

178
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,380
She's not a flake.

179
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,400
She showed up on your doorstep

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,820
without even giving you a heads-up

181
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,710
that she was coming back to San Jose.

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,320
Then she needed to move out, but then she moves in.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
Not to mention the whole

184
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,310
"Let's get drunk on tequila and I'll teach you how to kiss,

185
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,280
but I just want to be friends" nonsense.

186
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,600
She's...not a flake.

187
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,920
There is traumatic avulsion of the ligaments.

188
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,940
She's going to need surgery.

189
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,330
We hammer a long rod through the medullary canal

190
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,250
to hold the two ends of the break together.

191
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,720
It's a broken leg.

192
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,090
Can't you just put a cast on it or something?

193
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,950
Obviously, you'll be asleep. You won't feel anything.

194
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,070
I lied.

195
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,410
About the vicodin making me sick.

196
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,350
My husband doesn't know.

197
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm an opioid addict.

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,890
I've been clean for 10 years,

199
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,820
but one dose could send me right back.

200
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,320
Do whatever you need to do to fix my leg,

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,640
but you can't use any narcotics.

202
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,500
Not even an epidural?

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,450
Strongest thing she'll let us give her is Tylenol.

204
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,780
Ketamine? What about Ketamine?

205
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,960
It's non-narcotic and can create a dissociative effect.

206
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,550
It's mind altering and potentially addictive.

207
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,480
Hypnosis has been shown to be effective.

208
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,270
Only when used in conjunction with narcotics.

209
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,600
Studies say playing the patient's favorite music

210
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,930
can help manage pain in certain surgeries.

211
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,460
Yeah, we hammer a nine-inch rod

212
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,640
through her tibia,

213
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,980
but she's okay because she's listening

214
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,590
to the soundtrack from Hamilton.

215
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,040
I said "Certain surgeries."

216
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,740
Okay. That's the answer.

217
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,200
Music?

218
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,640
A different surgery.

219
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,240
Some other way of putting her leg back together.

220
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,750
An external fixation.

221
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,280
We put two pins through the proximal tibia.

222
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,870
Another two in the distal end of the bone beyond the fractures.

223
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,560
Healing will take much longer,

224
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,660
and there's an increased risk

225
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,520
of infection and permanent deformity and...

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,220
And small pins are much less painful than a huge nail.

227
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,300
I'll get her prepped.

228
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,370
I got laid off.

229
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,820
I needed money, and this was just a one-time thing.

230
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,790
But it was a mistake. It was a stupid mistake.

231
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,060
This works best if you don't talk.

232
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,920
Our plan is to attach a metal frame with pins into your leg.

233
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,700
It'll stabilize the fractures,

234
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,300
and we can do it without narcotic anesthesia.

235
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,070
I know she's worried about an allergic reaction,

236
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,130
but aren't there any other drugs you can use?

237
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,900
Given your wife's medical history,

238
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,400
this is the best strategy.

239
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,230
Don't worry, sweetie.

240
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,730
Remember... I'm strong like Wonder Woman.

241
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,190
There's over 50 latex balloons

242
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,720
lodged near the ileocecal junction.

243
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,230
They'll need to be surgically removed.

244
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,660
And we need to alert San Jose Vice/Narcotics.

245
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,330
No.

246
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,830
The only reason he agreed to treatment

247
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,460
is because we promised we wouldn't do that.

248
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,520
I didn't promise that. Neither did Dr. Melendez.

249
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,880
We don't call the police

250
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,860
on overdose victims or addicts.

251
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,350
He's got probably two kilos

252
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,420
of what I'm sure is heroin in his gut.

253
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,430
He's not an addict. He's a dealer.

254
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,880
I know you feel for this guy.

255
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,920
But hospital policy is clear.

256
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
Take a few more of those deep breaths for us.

257
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,090
Just two more to go.

258
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,750
Kerry, we need you to somehow keep your leg still.

259
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,700
{\an7}BGM: Claire de Lune by Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

260
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,800
B.P. is 190/110.

261
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,050
Push I.V. beta blockers.

262
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,780
- Wait, no! - No, they're not narcotics.

263
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,020
We just need to give you something to reduce the pressure.

264
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,470
Back to 150/80.

265
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,460
- Kerry, how are we doing? - Better.

266
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,150
We'll get this last one in, and you'll be good to go.

267
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,850
No. You promised me.

268
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,650
Yeah. You value honesty and morality over all else.

269
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,380
If you leave this hospital now, you will die.

270
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,800
I'll take my chances.

271
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,570
You know what'll happen when one those balloons bursts?

272
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,840
You'll start feeling weak, get cold.

273
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,820
Soon you'll have secretions filling your lungs and airway.

274
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,740
You'll try to scream for help, but nothing will come out.

275
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,040
Can you get the release paperwork?

276
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,360
I'll be back in a few minutes.

277
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,580
Luca, I understand where you're coming from.

278
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,670
You're a doctor.

279
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,510
Last job I had, I was a busboy.

280
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,330
I grew up in a trailer.

281
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,800
A bunch of 'em, actually.

282
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,460
My mother wasn't the type to save for a rainy day.

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,250
But we never gave up.

284
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,760
Even when you think you're alone, you're not.

285
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,180
I want to help you.

286
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,950
You just have to give me a little more time.

287
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,830
One hour.

288
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,940
If I can't figure out how to treat you

289
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,330
and keep you out of jail, you can walk out the door.

290
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,110
One hour.

291
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,000
And then I'm gone.

292
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,770
You'll have some discomfort for the next few weeks,

293
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,090
but all you need right now is rest, and you should be able...

294
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,010
Mommy!

295
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,760
Oh, my gosh, that's so cool.

296
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,980
Everyone says their spouse is the strongest person they know.

297
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,350
But I have actual proof now.

298
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,460
Told you.

299
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,390
Wonder Woman.

300
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,080
This is absurd.

301
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,390
If this was a tumor, we'd take it out and toss it.

302
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,080
This time, it just happens to be drugs.

303
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,450
Yeah, because cancer is not a felony.

304
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,500
You can't just toss out the drugs with the medical waste.

305
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,800
He's not a gangster or a hardened criminal.

306
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,780
He's just... he's just a scared guy trying to survive.

307
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,660
You're assuming anything he's told you is true.

308
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,710
And even if it is,

309
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,980
not everyone who needs money becomes a drug mule.

310
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,130
You can't imagine what it's like

311
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,690
to grow up in that kind of poverty.

312
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,000
Shouldn't you be judging this guy the harshest?

313
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,550
You made it out just fine without breaking the law.

314
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,310
That's not exactly true.

315
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,380
My mother used to go on these trips.

316
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,330
I would come home from school, and she'd be gone.

317
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,750
Sometimes hours, sometimes days.

318
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,320
I didn't have any money.

319
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,700
So when I needed supplies and food from the store,

320
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,750
I would sneak them away in a backpack.

321
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,580
One day, the bag broke

322
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,210
and all of the soup and oatmeal that I had stolen

323
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,030
fell out right in front of a security guard.

324
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,180
And she looked at me,

325
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,800
at my face, at my clothes,

326
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,610
and then she helped me pick them up

327
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,230
and let me go with a warning.

328
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,520
If she hadn't given me a break,

329
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,420
I wouldn't be standing here, as a doctor,

330
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,830
discussing this with you.

331
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,050
Maybe there's a way to save Luca

332
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,830
without ruining his life or breaking policy.

333
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,060
Shaun.

334
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,330
You need the elevator. Use the elevator.

335
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,920
What am I doing wrong?

336
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,330
I never know where I stand with you.

337
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,140
One minute, we're sharing

338
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,950
deep, personal fears with each other,

339
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,110
and the next, you're running away

340
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,170
because you can't stand to touch me.

341
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,770
Be honest...

342
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,690
Is there anything going on with Lea

343
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,190
that you're not telling me?

344
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,210
Say something, Shaun.

345
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,300
It's different.

346
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,120
I...

347
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,650
like you, Carly.

348
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,830
When I'm around you,

349
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,850
I want to be impressive to you.

350
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,070
I don't feel like I have to impress Lea like I do you.

351
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,870
We will have to keep whatever medical waste

352
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,770
we collect during your surgery in the lab for testing.

353
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,450
But we will discharge you

354
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,860
before the pathology report comes back.

355
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,370
At which point we'll be obligated to alert the police.

356
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,630
How do I know you're not gonna call the cops

357
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,030
right after you put me to sleep?

358
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,940
You'd be a moron not to trust Dr. Browne at this point.

359
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,190
She's gone way beyond the call to save your ass.

360
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,260
Okay.

361
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,670
Say thank you.

362
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:07,970
Thank you.

369
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,150
Dr. Murphy.

370
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,590
How about you head home for the night?

371
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,020
We still need to monitor Kerry.

372
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,230
And it's easier for me to avoid Carly here

373
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,330
than it is for me to avoid Lea at home.

374
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,210
Okay, I'm only gonna respond to the first objection.

375
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,570
You've had a long week,

376
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,870
and it's important you get some rest.

377
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,300
Morgan will take point.

378
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,780
How did you know your wife was the right woman for you?

379
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,730
Personal advice?

380
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,720
I thought that was Dr. Glassman's domain.

381
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,450
Dr. Glassman is divorced.

382
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,570
He seems happy with his marriage now,

383
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,000
but I have no way of knowing for sure.

384
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,660
You're better than him.

385
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,940
For this.

386
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,230
I knew I wanted to be with Isabel the first time we spoke.

387
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,880
Freshman-year biology class.

388
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
And I have not wavered in that resolve in the 27 years since.

389
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,840
But...

390
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,260
How did you know?

391
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,090
It was a feeling I had in the pit of my stomach

392
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,540
every time I was around her.

393
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,550
I felt...

394
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,790
Nervous?

395
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,150
Excited.

396
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,170
It's a cliche,

397
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,210
but my heart sped up every time I saw her.

398
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,320
Still does.

399
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,990
Not quite in the same way, but...

400
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,310
Now, if you don't mind, I need to get home to that woman.

401
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,080
Hey, you.

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,390
How was the first day back?

403
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,500
Confusing.

404
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,880
Problem with a patient or Carly?

405
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,030
If you don't want to talk about it, we can just hang.

406
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,150
Let's just hang.

407
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,560
Copy that. Commencing a hang.

408
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,630
Sh... Shaun?

409
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,770
What's up?

410
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,380
This will just take a few seconds.

411
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,170
Hello?

412
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,230
It didn't work.

413
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,090
Kerry's leg is swelling up.

414
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,920
I think she has compartment syndrome.

415
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
You need to get back here.

416
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,160
We'll have to do the surgery we've been trying to avoid.

417
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,000
We'll first have to make multiple incisions to relieve the pressure

418
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,260
and then replace the external frame with an internal nail.

419
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,840
If we don't act soon,

420
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,220
you could be facing an amputation.

421
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,800
Okay.

422
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,030
You'll need to be sedated.

423
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,820
No. Look, I can take it.

424
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Kerry, you had a blood-pressure spike

425
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,700
during the fixation procedure.

426
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,910
Without anesthesia,

427
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,710
you could have a hypertensive crisis,

428
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,110
a risk of stroke, or heart attack.

429
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,250
Post-op, we can help you manage the dosing.

430
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,340
And if you relapse, we have counselors that...

431
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,450
No.

432
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,670
I remember waking up all those mornings cold and alone,

433
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,670
wondering if I could ever be happy again,

434
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,590
if I deserved to be happy.

435
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,840
Any amount of pain is better than losing everything again.

436
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,600
My husband, my daughter...

437
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,910
How long can you keep secrets from the people you love

438
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,480
before they stop being the people you love?

439
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,330
Every relationship has secrets.

440
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,990
This, it doesn't have to be one of them.

441
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,860
Drug addiction is a disease.

442
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,070
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

443
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,790
It happens because of the choices you make.

444
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,460
When you have lost everything,

445
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,750
but you still manage to find someone

446
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,020
who makes you want to get up and live another day,

447
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,470
you do whatever you can to hold on to them,

448
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,530
even if it means

449
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,890
burying a piece of yourself in the process.

450
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,190
If we can't convince her to change her mind,

451
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,210
maybe her husband can.

452
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,210
Impracticality isn't cause

453
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,550
for breaking doctor-patient confidentiality.

454
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,200
This isn't impractical.

455
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,700
It's irrational and barbaric.

456
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,910
We're not permitted to reveal any secrets to the husband.

457
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,210
But we can tell him that.

458
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,430
Last one.

459
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,530
What's wrong?

460
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,850
It's too adherent to the intestinal wall.

461
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,190
Could use Potts Scissors to dissect it free.

462
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,070
Let's give it a try. Nurse?

463
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,950
Your idea. Only fair you do the honors.

464
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,100
Check it for perforations.

465
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,350
It's intact.

466
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,910
Vitals are stable.

467
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,950
Take the specimen container to the lab.

468
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,610
Dr. Browne, you're leading closure.

469
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,260
There's been some complications.

470
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,330
We need to perform an additional surgery.

471
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,870
What do you need to do?

472
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,410
I can't tell you.

473
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,020
I'm unable to go into further detail.

474
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,390
It would violate your wife's confidentiality.

475
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,790
Confidentiality?

476
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,260
Haven't you been telling me everything?

477
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,970
Again, I'm unable to go into further detail.

478
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,770
What's going on?

479
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,560
Why can't the doctors talk to me?

480
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,410
Kerry, obviously, there's something going on

481
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,860
you don't want me to know.

482
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,160
Are you dying?

483
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,610
No. No. It's...

484
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,450
It's nothing like that.

485
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,240
Then what?

486
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,750
Whatever it is, I want to be able to help.

487
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,330
Please.

488
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,270
I'm an opioid addict.

489
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,630
I've been clean for a decade, but...

490
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,320
That's why I never take painkillers.

491
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,060
And that's why I can't let them use anesthesia.

492
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,850
Why didn't you ever tell me?

493
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,770
You don't know the kind of person that I was.

494
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,070
Who the drugs turned me into.

495
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,010
I tried quitting so many times,

496
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,530
but it never stuck.

497
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,660
Until you.

498
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,080
Meeting you saved me.

499
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,040
But...

500
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,880
if I relapse, I know I'll drive you away.

501
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,390
How could you ever think I'll stop loving you?

502
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,310
The woman who knows the lyrics

503
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,470
to every Boyz II Men song?

504
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,490
The woman who rushes home

505
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,150
to watch those stupid home-makeover shows live.

506
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,210
The woman I'm raising our daughter with.

507
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,280
The woman who will steal from you,

508
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,320
the woman who will lie to you,

509
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,670
- who will hurt you... - No.

510
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,010
the woman you won't be able to trust.

511
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,450
No.

512
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,270
Just do what the doctors tell you.

513
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,670
Take the meds.

514
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,630
I will be there for you.

515
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,920
No matter what happens.

516
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,220
I love you.

517
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,390
And I know you mean that.

518
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,120
But I'm not as strong as you think I am.

519
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,150
Baby. I just can't.

520
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,110
I'm so sorry.

521
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,250
We'll start prepping you for surgery.

522
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,200
I like your laugh. I like your smile.

523
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,030
I don't usually look at eyes,

524
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,620
but I think yours are pretty.

525
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,650
I like your breasts.

526
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,320
You can keep going if you want to.

527
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,040
I like spending time with you.

528
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,750
I like that you are kind.

529
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,380
I like that you are patient.

530
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,660
I like that you're my girlfriend.

531
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,330
Are you going to break up with me?

532
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,080
No, I am not planning on breaking up with you.

533
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,430
We had a fight.

534
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,750
Couples fight.

535
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,880
But...

536
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,090
I'm worried, Shaun.

537
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm flattered that you want to impress me,

538
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,780
but that is not worth anything

539
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,010
if you feel like you can't talk to me.

540
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,190
You're right.

541
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,440
I have to tell you. Everything.

542
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:32,250
I got very upset in Wyoming.

543
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,110
Lea came in to comfort me

544
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,810
and we hugged and laid down on the bed,

545
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,060
and we fell asleep hugging.

546
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,650
That's everything that happened.

547
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,190
We struggled with lying together for weeks.

548
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,610
And you...

549
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,990
Did it in one night with Lea?

550
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,410
Yes.

551
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,970
But sh... she's a close friend,

552
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,430
and she wanted to be there for me.

553
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,790
Please, just stop talking.

554
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,760
Shaun, I-I just... I need some space.

555
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,090
I can't be around you right now.

556
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,150
Shaun?

557
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,500
I wanted to be honest.

558
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,130
Carly said she wanted me to talk to her.

559
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,210
Lea said not to tell what happened. Lea was right.

560
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,340
Uh, take a breath. Sit down.

561
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,260
I can't. I have surgery in a few minutes

562
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,880
and I can't focus and...

563
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,600
and I feel sick, and is everyone going to leave me?

564
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,890
What? What? What are you talking about?

565
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,500
My dad didn't want me.

566
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,710
My mom chose him over me.

567
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,320
Carly now hates me.

568
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,940
- Shaun. Shaun. - Lea will get tired of me.

569
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,110
- Shaun. - You'll get sick of me.

570
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,280
- I do everything wrong. - What?

571
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,450
- Shaun, Shaun, look at me for a second. - Everyone will go away!

572
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,240
- I make people upset! - Hey, hey, Shaun!

573
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,280
Oh, my God, Shaun!

574
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,740
I make them angry! I make them hate me!

575
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,290
Shaun, look at me, look at me, look at me right here.

576
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,950
Right here. Look at me here.

577
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,830
Don't ever say that about yourself.

578
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,530
Don't ever say that!

579
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,070
You hear me?

580
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,880
You're gonna get through this.

581
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
You're gonna go to surgery, and you're gonna get this done.

582
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
- How? - How?

583
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,550
Because you're an extraordinary doctor.

584
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,580
That's how.

585
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,750
And that's what you do. That's what you do.

586
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,460
I could not be more proud of you.

587
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,920
You hear that?

588
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,090
And I could never get sick of you.

589
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,350
You're not getting rid of me, pal, okay?

590
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,070
I'm right here.

591
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,990
Right... right here.

592
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,030
Okay? I got you.

593
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm going to be late to surgery.

594
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,750
Can you let me go now?

595
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,120
Yeah, okay.

596
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,210
- Okay. - Okay.

597
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,470
Numbing cream applied.

598
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,020
Are you ready?

599
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,010
We were able to remove all the balloons.

600
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,960
So you should be out of here in 24 hours.

601
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,020
It'll likely take another 48 hours

602
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,840
to get the contents tested.

603
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,220
The lab's very busy.

604
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,010
I know I've been a pain in the ass.

605
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,020
I've just gotten used to people screwing me over.

606
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,520
You're the first person that's made me feel,

607
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,320
I don't know, seen.

608
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,570
Maybe one day, I'll find a way to pay it forward, right?

609
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,810
Reamer's in the intramedullary canal.

610
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,790
This will make space for inserting the nail.

611
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,730
You're doing great, Kerry.

612
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,270
Inserting into canal.

613
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,010
Here comes the nail. You ready?

614
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,560
- B.P.'s spiking. - Push beta blockers.

615
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,480
Hang in there.

616
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,870
220/170.

617
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,830
She's having a tachyarrhythmia.

618
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,860
Screw it. We have to push the fentanyl.

619
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,410
- Nurse, help Dr. Murphy. - No.

620
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,880
It's helping distract her.

621
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,890
You sure, Dr. Murphy?

622
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,910
Yes. Please hurry.

623
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,920
It was a good day.

624
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,150
It must be very gratifying, saving lives.

625
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,570
Yeah, I think I might've done a little more than that today.

626
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,480
I... I think I might have changed one.

627
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,080
Last time we met,

628
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,790
you mentioned that your mother

629
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,900
would frequently berate you when you were young.

630
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,200
What kind of things would she say?

631
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,160
Do we have to get into that right now?

632
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,920
Can't I just have a good day?

633
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,850
You know, enjoy feeling okay for once?

634
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,020
Claire, I believe you've fallen into destructive patterns

635
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,890
precisely to avoid confronting your feelings about your mother,

636
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,600
her death.

637
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,310
Feelings that need to be confronted if you hope to get better.

638
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,320
Cardiac care nurse to E.R.

639
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,580
They're reviewing the security video.

640
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,790
Someone faked a seizure, staff responded,

641
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,880
and another person broke into the storage locker.

642
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,890
Do you think Luca...

643
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,880
The only thing missing was his specimen.

644
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,920
Is someone questioning him?

645
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,430
Luca's gone.

646
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,070
What will the police do?

647
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,980
Nothing.

648
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,290
All we have is a fake name and the knowledge

649
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,690
that someone stole some balloons with unknown content.

She's totally irrational.

to see if the tumor margins were in the artery walls.

686
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,750
Yeah.

687
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,480
And you said if I didn't do it right then,

688
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,590
you would toss a rock through my window.

689
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,630
Yes.

690
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,050
I thought it was cute how much you cared.

691
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,730
And when you started working in Path, I realized,

692
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,980
"This guy may be the most genuine person I have ever known."

693
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,860
You told me the truth.

That's why I don't want to lose what we have.

697
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,840

698
