1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,750
I hate to walk in if they are naked.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,070
Yes, that kind of image could haunt someone

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,920
if she tries to sleep even years later.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,140
Oh, relax. I think you are safe.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,460
Or are they?

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,440
so today at the school fair,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,660
a band called the Dad Beats

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,340
is gonna surprise Claire with a power love ballad.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,500
And the lead singer -- you might want to sit down --

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,800
is the one and only --

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,630
get up on your feet! -- this guy!

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,930
She's a pretty sight

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,440
Wise as a buddha

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
But, brother, watch that bite

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,810
Or maybe an existing song.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,570
Thank you.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160
Do you want to get your face painted

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
like a pretty butterfly?

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,070
No. I'm just not in the mood.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,830
Lily, what about you?

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:07,750
You know what?

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,760
Maybe I will have them paint

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,780
"Worst coach ever" on my forehead.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,620
Cam's coaching freshman football,

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,210
and his team's losing,

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,350
and it's making him, uh, a little tense.

27
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,370
Run, run!

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,110
Protect it like it's your baby!

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,710
You dropped your baby!

30
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,480
You dropped your baby!

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,510
They're running away with your baby!

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,760
Go get your baby!

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,280
That's the worst call since

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,140
they cast Russell Crowe in "Les Mis,"

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,240
right there!

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
You see the way everyone's glaring at me?

37
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,330
- No. - Like a big loser coach.

38
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,870
All in your head.

39
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,530
I'm the Hester Prynne of freshman football.

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,070
I may as well have a

41
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,660
scarlet "L" sewn on my shirt.

42
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,300
Well, then, everyone would think you're Laverne.

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,260
Coach Tucker.

44
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,140
That was a tough loss last night.

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,510
Yeah, yeah. Sure was.

46
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,230
I feel your frustration. Sure do.

47
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,530
Uh, Mitchell, this is John. He's Trevor's dad.

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,000
- Sorry. - Star running back.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,300
Well, maybe not for long.

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,070
I'm seriously thinking about pulling him from the team.

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,970
What? Why?

52
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,720
'cause trevor's getting killed out there.

53
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,080
You got no one to block for him.

54
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,730
I-I hear what you're saying, and you're not wrong,

55
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,470
but give me a little time.

56
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,810
You got one week.

57
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,410
Well, that is not appropriate fair behavior at all.

58
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,100
You know what might make you feel better?

59
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,240
Gathering my team and putting the fear of God in them.

60
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,290
I was gonna say a churro.

61
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,300
I can do both!

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
She's a mess.

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,780
Girl...

64
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,540
Hey, hey, lead foot, easy on the turns!

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,040
I worked hours on this cake.

66
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,450
You're sure you want to do this?

67
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm going to win the cake contest,

68
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,620
and then there'll be no stopping me.

69
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,700
From what? A beating?

70
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,730
First-place ribbons earn respect, Jay.

71
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,680
Not if your competition's

72
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,390
a bunch of old ladies and weirdos.

73
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,680
Could you just be nice?

74
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,060
You didn't seem to care

75
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,240
when you were eating all his practice cake.

76
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,260
Finally.

77
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,490
What are you gonna do, pal?!

78
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,060
About to ask you the same thing.

79
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,770
Did you not see my blinker?

80
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,900
- Nope. - Then you're blind, 'cause it's on.

81
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,350
Looking at you, I'm guessing it was on the whole way here.

82
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,370
I got all day and satellite radio.

83
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,900
I don't care if parking here is on your bucket list.

84
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,230
I've got two books on tape, a space blanket,

85
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,200
and a protein bar in the glove box.

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
I will sleep here if I have to.

87
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,590
We're not moving.

88
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,620
Ay, but we are.

89
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,880
Let's go, Manny.

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
- Who are you? - Oh, my god!

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,590
You scared the hell out of me!

92
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,830
Okay, language. There's a baby in the house.

93
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,980
Uh, that baby happens to be my uncle.

94
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,650
Which one are you?

95
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,040
You need to tell Mr. P you broke one of his beers.

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm Alex. Who are you?

97
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,970
Nice try.

98
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,250
I know their Manny, and you look nothing like him.

99
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,110
Oh, you're Haley.

100
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm their male nanny, Andy.

101
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,530
You really need to move.

102
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,910
Okay, well, I'll be out by the pool.

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,410
What? Nope!

104
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,070
No, no, no.

105
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,640
Not without permission, you're not.

106
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,700
- I'm gonna call Mr. and Mrs. P. - Oh, wait!

107
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,200
Um...seriously, Mandy, do you, uh --

108
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,980
do you really have to do that?

109
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,880
I see what you're doing.

110
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,720
Don't bother,

111
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,350
because I have a girlfriend

112
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,760
of eight years back in Utah.

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,140
That's pretty young, but I guess they do things

114
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,080
differently over there.

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,160
She's my age,

116
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,030
and we're engaged... to be engaged.

117
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,870
It's -- it's a pre-engagement.

118
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,900
She's in the coast guard.

119
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,440
- In Utah? - Yeah.

120
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,290
It's the largest salt lake in the western hemisphere.

121
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,270
Oh, good. She's protecting our lake.

122
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,820
I'll be out by the pool.

123
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,760
Your boss is calling you.

124
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,660
Hey! There she is.

125
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,900
Yeah, I'm not giving you any money.

126
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,870
I don't need your money -- I need advice...

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,410
about a girl.

128
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,010
Gross, but I'm intrigued, so talk.

129
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,980
Alex. Hey, Girlita.

130
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,710
Sienna...girl!

131
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,720
Sienna is amazing -- stylish, worldly --

132
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,890
and she's so new to our school, she doesn't even realize

133
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,960
that I'm a full social class below her.

134
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,610
I need to cement the friendship

135
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,690
before she finds out we have a cafeteria.

136
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,770
I've been looking all over for you.

137
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,030
Uh, this is my little brother, Luke.

138
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,570
He wants advice on some lame crush he has.

139
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,420
That's huge.

140
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,620
So huge.

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,830
So, Luke, who is this mystery woman?

142
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,360
Um...just some girl.

143
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,450
And her name is Sienna.

144
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,130
You know, Manny, I'm just gonna say this one last time.

145
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,630
- I doubt that. - Give me that.

146
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,740
You want to fit in?

147
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,300
You're not doing yourself any favors

148
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,650
with this cake contest.

149
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,060
I don't know. Chefs get all the girls.

150
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,930
You're a baker.

151
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,950
Bakers are girls --

152
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,600
Betty Crocker, Mrs. Fields, Little Debbie.

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,250
What about the Pillsbury Doughboy?

154
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,870
That's a good one, Manny!

155
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,940
Well, well, well. Jay Pritchett.

156
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,590
Nice of you to finally show up.

157
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,470
- What's happening? - You're an official fair cop.

158
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,180
- Your wife volunteered you. - Gloria!

159
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,720
I love you! Have fun!

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
- What is this? - It's for charity.

161
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,520
People pay for you to arrest

162
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,330
and throw somebody in jail for 10 minutes.

163
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,700
And here comes your partner.

164
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,550
What's up?

165
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,730
Oh, hell, no. I'm not working with this clown.

166
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,090
Hey, who are you calling a clown, bucket list?

167
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,580
I see you two have already met.

168
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,790
That was my space and you know it.

169
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,110
Tell it to my car. You know where to find it.

170
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,270
Hey, enough of you two squabbling.

171
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,430
I've got the PTA breathing down my neck.

172
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,250
Just pin these on and get to work.

173
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,470
Nope. Can't do the badge. Sorry.

174
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,760
My wife just bought me this shirt,

175
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
and if I ruin it, she'll kill me.

176
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,470
You're afraid you'll ruin your blouse.

177
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,200
It's not a blouse! It's a shirt.

178
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,220
She bought it at the men's department, so it's a shirt.

179
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,060
Here's your first arrest.

180
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,860
She's over at the Dizzy Dragon.

181
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,400
Word on the midway is she's tougher than she looks.

182
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,570
- Think you can handle it? - Why couldn't I handle it?

183
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,200
'Cause she's your daughter.

184
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,610
Hello?

185
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,920
Oh, hi, Mr. Chang. Yeah.

186
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,600
What do you mean you're at the house already?

187
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,460
You're not supposed to be there for another two hours.

188
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,120
I have a long history of giving Phil

189
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,650
bad anniversary gifts,

190
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,370
but this year, I have planned something amazing.

191
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,380
The traditional 20th gift is china,

192
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,740
but what am I gonna do, give him a plate?

193
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,940
I already did that.

194
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,080
Okay, bye.

195
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,710
Honey, um, what do you say we pack it in and go home?

196
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,390
What? No. I mean, we just got here.

197
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,770
I haven't even whacked a mole yet.

198
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,060
I know, but I just got off the Ferris wheel,

199
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,430
and I'm feeling really queasy.

200
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,180
But you're gonna miss the Dad Beats.

201
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,240
No way. Come on.

202
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's get you a fried pickle!

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,270
Phil, I might throw up.

204
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,300
No one throws up until I sing.

205
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Phil, we got to go. We got to go home now.

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,170
Sure. Why not? Nothing keeping you here.

207
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,100
Why are you acting weird?

208
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,670
I'm not acting weird.

209
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,480
Got her.

210
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,110
Ma'am, I am afraid you are under arrest.

211
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,010
Uh, no. Dad, tell him I can't do this right now.

212
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,500
Come on. Please.

213
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,950
Go ahead. Read her the charges.

214
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,170
Can't do this.

215
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,020
All right. Let's see.

216
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,110
You have been charged with unlawful sexiness

217
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,090
and possession of a hot booty.

218
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,960
That is wrong.

219
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,460
- Guilty as charged. - Stop it!

220
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,930
All right, 10 minutes in the slammer.

221
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,780
No, I can't.

222
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,760
I don't have time for this. Phil!

223
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,910
Oh, my god!

224
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,380
What are you doing, perv?!

225
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,540
Getting proof of where the two missing beers went.

226
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,650
You can't drink that out here.

227
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,470
Hmm. Let's see if you're right.

228
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,670
Mm, no.

229
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,540
Okay, well, you're in a pool zone,

230
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,250
and that is glass, so that's not safe.

231
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,080
It's dangerous.

232
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,320
What is with you and your girlfriend protecting water?

233
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,940
Okay, just --

234
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,230
If you just -- no -- no, uh, uh!

235
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,680
Oh! D-- ahh! D-d-- oh, dilly!

236
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,630
Well, now you've done it.

237
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
You're gonna have to climb in there

238
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,100
and get all the glass out of the pool.

239
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,720
Um, I just got my hair straightened,

240
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
so that's not gonna happen.

241
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,370
I hate to go all ballistic,

242
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,600
but it has not been a pleasure meeting you.

243
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,850
Do you kiss your imaginary girlfriend with that mouth?

244
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,920
I do, but she's real. So, she's a real girl.

245
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,280
It all comes down to one thing, gentlemen --

246
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,070
focus...

247
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,050
and teamwork and heart!

248
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
You see this mallet?

249
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,520
Think I can swing this here mallet with one finger?

250
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,820
No! I need my whole team!

251
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,530
Because when you're functioning and working as a team,

252
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,260
gentlemen, look out!

253
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,700
Sassy granny?

254
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,860
Yeah, sassy granny.

255
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,320
Yes, exactly.

256
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,010
Because that is what you all played like last night --

257
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,020
is a bunch of sassy grannies.

258
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,700
But we're gonna bust our humps this week,

259
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,860
and we're gonna get out there,

260
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,880
and we're gonna play like a bunch of...

261
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,580
Girly men. Got it.

262
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,400
Okay, you know what? Is this thing plugged in?

263
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,850
It's not electric.

264
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,090
I think it was made in the 1800s.

265
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,830
Okay, well, that's my point.

266
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,450
This is outdated.

267
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,370
This is offensive,

268
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,330
because girls are athletes, too.

269
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,460
So, in conclusion...

270
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,340
if you want to win football games,

271
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,990
we got to go out there and play like a...

272
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,320
What is daddy doing?

273
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,100
Daddy's smashing his demons.

274
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,170
Oh, like the ones you vacuum up at home?

275
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,570
Yeah, yeah. Like that.

276
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,280
Mm! Damn. Near miss.

277
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,510
Why the hell are you so dressed up for a school fair, anyway?

278
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,910
How is this dressed up?!

279
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,630
I'm -- why?

280
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,260
Because my shirt has buttons?

281
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,840
What's that fabric? Is that silk?

282
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,830
Get your vanilla fingers away from my shirt!

283
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,170
- Blouse. - Okay...

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
You want to talk about clothes? Let's talk about clothes.

285
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,830
Let's go. Let's see.

286
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,450
You look like some kind of old, washed-up golf pro

287
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,050
who drank his way off the tour

288
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,510
and is one step away from writing a suicide note

289
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,140
with one of them little pencils.

290
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,040
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

291
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,860
You wouldn't have said it if you didn't mean it.

292
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,970
I don't have the body to wear the clothes they make today,

293
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,600
so I dress comfortable.

294
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,750
You're in shape, man.

295
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,310
What are you? Late 50s?

296
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,560
Come on. You know I'm not.

297
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I'm serious, man.

298
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,970
Y-you look like you live at the gym.

299
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,420
- I do some walking. - Yeah?

300
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,480
Pritchett, Williams,

301
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,950
got another arrest over by the Ferris wheel.

302
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,790
On it.

303
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,340
Here we go.

304
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,130
Why'd we throw out the ice cream?

305
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,400
We got plenty of time.

306
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,790
Seeing Manny up there

307
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,340
with the misfits and their crazy cakes,

308
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,810
I started to wonder if Jay was right.

309
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,650
Maybe Manny would fit in better

310
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,610
if he was more like the other boys.

311
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,050
And maybe I needed to give him a little push.

312
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,330
I saw you.

313
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,230
All right, young lady.

314
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,410
You're under arrest.

315
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,660
- What? - You have the right to remain silent.

316
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,510
Good luck with that.

317
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,520
Grandpa!

318
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,310
Sorry, honey. Part of the job.

319
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,950
Out of the way!

320
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,710
Let's go.

321
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,430
Who did this?!

322
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,700
Hmm. I guess it's just you and me.

323
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,240
My cake! Somebody ruined it!

324
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Who would do that?!

325
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,290
Ay! Manny, how terrible. All your hard work.

326
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,550
Oh, well. Let's go ride the rides.

327
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,810
No, no, no. Mom, I know who did it.

328
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,730
Oh, you do?

329
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,790
It was Enid.

330
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,450
Ah. Look at her.

331
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,020
You can see the hate in her eyes.

332
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,250
The minute she saw this, she felt threatened.

333
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,700
She's cold as ice.

334
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,080
How about you just let it go

335
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,980
and go play with the other boys?

336
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh, she'd love that.

337
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
Okay, Enid.

338
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,800
You want to dance? Let's dance.

339
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,620
Let me have my cellphone. Come on. I got to make a call.

340
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,450
Sorry. Those are the rules.

341
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,310
What are you smiling at?

342
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,510
I'm six.

343
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,220
Oh, god.

344
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,190
All right. Got another one for you here.

345
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,390
Hi, honey.

346
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,080
Come on.

347
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,160
One count of being an aggravating big sister.

348
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,270
That's 8 to 10 minutes.

349
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,410
Luke did this?! I was just trying to help him.

350
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,410
Help him do what?

351
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,040
My friend Sienna and I were trying to help him

352
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,500
find this girl he has a crush on.

353
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,160
Honey, Sienna is the girl he has a crush on.

354
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,020
Come on, haven't you ever seen the way he looks at her?

355
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,370
It's same way he used to look at Halloween candy.

356
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,950
Oh, my god. He's gonna do something stupid

357
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,650
and ruin it for me.

358
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,840
I have to get out of here.

359
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,170
Okay. All right. I got a plan. I got this.

360
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm gonna create a distraction.

361
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,030
Just got to get that little guard over here.

362
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,820
You're gonna sit down very quietly,

363
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,620
right by the door.

364
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,080
Great plan, mom. Let me know how that works out for you.

365
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,460
It's a fake lock.

366
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,280
How long were you gonna sit on that?

367
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,570
Found another one.

368
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,320
I told you.

369
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,700
Are you gonna do that every time?

370
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,320
You found glass,

371
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,940
not the lost city of Atlanta.

372
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,130
Wow, I'm gonna chalk that one up

373
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,410
to a lot of underage drinking.

374
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,940
- You're bleeding. - What?

375
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,590
I do not like blood. I do not like blood.

376
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,870
- Is it bad? - Here.

377
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,880
- Oh, my god! - What?

378
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,410
Your fingers are so stubby,  like baby carrots.

379
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,640
Sure. Okay.

380
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,570
Make fun...

381
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,270
till you need me to reach into a vending machine,

382
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,360
then I'm everyone's best friend.

383
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,160
Here. Hold still.

384
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,560
Let me put some pressure on it.

385
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,650
So, why are you a manny, anyway?

386
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,120
Saving up for college.

387
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,470
Plus, I like kids.

388
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,080
'Cause they make your hands seem normal?

389
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,230
Okay. Thank you.

390
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,650
I'm good. Thank you.

391
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,060
Luke, I hate to say it,

392
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,590
but maybe this girl left.

393
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
It's probably for the best.

394
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,740
I mean, even if I found her --

395
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,820
ah, forget it. It's embarrassing.

396
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,610
No. Tell me.

397
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,650
I wouldn't know what to do.

398
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
I've never kissed a girl before.

399
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,950
Oh! It's not that hard.

400
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,810
You know what?

401
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,470
I'll kiss you once to show you how it's done.

402
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,480
Really? Okay. Want to go behind the dumpster?

403
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,240
No. Here is fine.

404
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,230
Okay. It's not really how I imagined it, but...

405
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,890
Stop!

406
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,670
What? Ignore her. Where were we?

407
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,340
You're the girl! You're his crush!

408
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,580
He's being a little weirdo! Please don't judge me!

409
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,280
Uh, Luke, is this true?

410
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
She's a nerd! Her friends are books!

411
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,000
You're the best thing that's ever happened to her!

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
- Alex? - Um, I don't know what he's talking about!

413
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,410
Okay, I'm just gonna go catch up with some friends.

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,190
Sienna, wait!

415
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,340
Don't be sad. You're too good for her anyways.

416
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,420
Yeah. Thanks, Alex.

417
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,220
Not you.

418
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,310
I was talking about myself, you little gnome.

419
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,270
There he is.

420
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,950
One more arrest and we can hang up our badges.

421
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,540
I've seen this punk horsing around earlier.

422
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm gonna enjoy this.

423
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,970
Jail time, jean jacket.

424
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,270
- Is it bad? - You're gonna be fine.

425
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,100
Aah! I should have worn a vest.

426
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,120
Why is everyone just standing around?!

427
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,170
Get this man a towel for his blouse!

428
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,720
So cold.

429
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,280
We were almost out.

430
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,760
- I didn't want it to end like this. - Don't you do that!

431
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,940
It's not over!

432
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,790
Listen to me.

433
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,150
I need you to tell my wife what happened.

434
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,320
Tell her it wasn't my fault.

435
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,110
You're gonna tell her yourself.

436
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,260
She's standing right there, and she looks pissed.

437
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,180
Hi, baby.

438
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,590
Phil...

439
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,080
Phil, when I said we needed to go home, I meant it.

440
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.

441
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,320
But you have to stay for just one song.

442
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
Why?

443
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,150
Trust me.

444
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,010
Whoo! How's everybody doing?!

445
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,280
Good!

446
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,450
All right, next up, we have

447
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,510
a very special guest joining us.

448
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,960
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for...

449
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,390
- Harold Grossman! - Wait.

450
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,840
What?

451
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,130
Uh, never really done anything like this before.

452
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,820
Uh, some of the gang down at the pharmacy

453
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,010
talked me into it, so...

454
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,610
Gotta take a little time

455
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,310
A little time to think things over

456
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,710
I'd better read between the lines

457
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,290
In case I need it when I'm older

458
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,630
In my life

459
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,010
Turns out Harold Grossman, our pharmacist,

460
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,040
is a rock star.

461
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,150
His voice is the drug he should be dispensing,

462
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,150
because apparently, it's the cure for everything.

463
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,930
- Time to go. Let's go. - No, no, no, no, no!

464
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,190
Stay, stay, stay, stay! Come on, he's great! Whoo!

465
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,470
I want you to show me

466
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,260
I want to feel what love is

467
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,140
And I know, and I know

468
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,730
I know you can show me

469
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,920
Oh, he's incredible!

470
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,090
- I know. - Incredible!

471
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,910
Harold Grossman, everybody!

472
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,130
Holy cow!

473
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Who knew?!

474
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Let's keep this party going.

475
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,420
Next up, we have one more guest today.

476
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,350
Oh, no.

477
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,480
Harold, yeah.

478
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,790
Harold, Harold!

479
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,100
Okay, now. Okay.

480
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,110
Maybe Harold can come back a little later.

481
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,150
But in the meantime,

482
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,760
the Dad Beats are proud to present...

483
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,200
Phil Dunphy!

484
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,380
Paul who?

485
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,460
Phil?

486
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,580
Phil dunphy.

487
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,900
- Oh, Phil Dunphy. - Oh, boy.

488
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,010
There's a white minivan out in the parking lot

489
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,640
with its lights on -- license plate number TCB-R2D2.

490
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,340
Phil Dunphy, everybody.

491
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey, mom. Check it out.

492
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,030
- I finished my cake. - Oh, good.

493
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,000
It's Los Angeles after an 11.5 earthquake.

494
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,430
I call it earth-cake.

495
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,210
Manny, that's amazing!

496
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,290
You think that's amazing?

497
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,410
Wait till I smash this thing

498
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,760
right on top of Enid's piece of sheet cake.

499
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,920
No, no, no! Wait! Manny, Enid didn't do it.

500
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,480
- I did it. - What?

501
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,670
I was the one who ruined the cake.

502
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,080
I was afraid that all those boys were gonna make fun of you.

503
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,900
I think I care more about you fitting in than you do.

504
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,670
No. I care.

505
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,010
I care a lot.

506
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,060
It's just the stuff I'm good at

507
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,010
isn't the stuff that makes you popular.

508
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,920
Contestants, all cakes

509
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,930
must be at the judges' table in 60 seconds.

510
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,910
Ay, there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.

511
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,990
Like heck we won't. Here.

512
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,780
- What? - Follow my lead.

513
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,550
- Okay. - Ready? Come on.

514
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,580
Oh, well, look who finally put down his mallet.

515
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,170
You done having your little temper tantrum?

516
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,350
It wasn't that bad.

517
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,560
Cam, your behavior was completely juvenile,

518
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
and I don't think that it set a very good example --

519
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,020
Hey, hey! No cutsies --

520
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,320
for Lily.

521
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,460
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.

522
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,990
I-I can't seem to turn this team into a winner.

523
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,160
Oh, why do you let it get you so stressed out?

524
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,590
It's just football.

525
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,220
You know what football was to me?

526
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,160
Football was my salvation.

527
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
Every time I stepped onto that field,

528
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,060
I wasn't the weird gay outsider kid anymore.

529
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,290
I inspired my entire team

530
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,290
because I had something to prove.

531
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,530
Where's my kid that has something to prove?

532
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,430
Come on mom!

533
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
Stay on my hip! Follow my lead!

534
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,830
Move!

535
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,120
That's exactly what I need.

536
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,310
Oh! Come on! Come on, mom.

537
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,610
Cake?

538
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,630
Tell them the good news.

539
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,600
- I won the cake contest! - The other good news.

540
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,950
He made the football team.

541
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,030
They won their first game.

542
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,340
And the guys love my banana bread.

543
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,530
Keep your eyes closed, and before you open them,

544
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,610
remember that for 20 years,

545
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,370
you have given me perfect, creative, thoughtful gifts.

546
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,440
And every year, I have let you down.

547
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,140
You're about to feel really bad, and I know that,

548
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,070
because it's how I have felt every year.

549
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,900
But, honey, it is not my intention,

550
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,890
because I love you.

551
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,800
Happy anniversary.

552
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,430
Oh, my god. Chinese acrobats?!

553
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,310
20 years -- China.

554
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,930
You're brilliant.

555
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,400
- You got it! - Hey, guys! You're my present!

556
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,220
Oh -- oh, what's that?

557
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
That's the helicopter. I should get in there.

558
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,230
No, no, they're -- they're here for you.

559
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,350
They're here for you.

560
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,500
Oh... honey.

561
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,730
Don't worry, it was just a couple of beers,

562
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,080
and if you cleaned it up...

563
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,710
Okay, Haley, I love you, too. Bye.

564
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,870
Excuse me, ma'am.

565
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,260
I hear you're a wanted woman.

566
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,380
What you see can and will be held against you.

567
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,330
You're gonna have to arrest me first.

568
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,810
Bring me some wine.

569
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,950
Mr. P., I have a confession to make.

570
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,810
I'm taking a much more interesting confession upstairs.

571
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,980
After Joe went down,

572
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,650
I had a sip of beer by the pool,

573
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,270
and a bottle broke.

574
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,120
- It was me. I did it. - Don't sweat it.

575
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,380
I popped a cold one after dealing with those kids --

576
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,750
Sometimes during.

577
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,350
Thanks, Mr. P. -- and, hey...

578
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,720
Be careful up there.

579
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,050
We are not that close.
