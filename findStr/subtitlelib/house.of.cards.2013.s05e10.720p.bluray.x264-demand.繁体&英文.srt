但你讓他很難做

我就想看弗蘭西斯·安德伍德當著我的面

24
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,400
宣布提高醫保水平
that there will be an increase in Medicare.

25
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,870
只要他一句話  我就是他鐵哥們
He does that, I'm his friend.

26
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,480
所以我要致力于改善醫保政策

取得成效前  我不會增加一毛錢預算
before I devote one more dime to the program.

他想找幫我們獲勝的人的麻煩

我正坐在這里跟你說話

克萊爾知道了
Claire knows.

41
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,960
沃克公開聲明了
Walker went on record.

42
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,600
告訴他是我發動本黨議員彈劾他
Told him I was the one who whipped the votes for impeachment.

43
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,730
只要我們站出來  他就完了
You and I go on the record, he's done.

44
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,720
不可能在大選之前
There's no way subpoenas get them

45
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,180
傳召他們去委員會作證了
in front of the committee before the election.

There's a rumor the committee's

真相要曝光了
The truth is coming out.

49

一起來揭露吧
Be part of the truth.

我爺爺說  死人不瞑目

They're watching you from the past...

52
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,600
杰姬·夏普
Jackie Sharp.

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,650
羅梅洛一刻都沒浪費
Romero wasted no time.

54
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,750
你有什么用
What good are you?

55
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,990
你們民主黨人真是驚喜不斷
You Democrats are full of surprises.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,960
她的律師不讓我們靠近她
Her lawyers won't let us get anywhere near her.

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
因為他們在商量她的證詞
Because they're negotiating her testimony.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,540
我們到底是怎么到這一步的
How the hell did we get here?

59
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,530
羅梅洛知道消息  黨內有人給他通風報信
Romero was privy to information. Someone from within the party.

60
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,440
他威脅要追究她拉票
He's threatening to go after her for whipping votes

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,970
來換取雷米·丹頓先生的競選經費一事
in exchange for campaign funds from a Mr. Remy Danton,

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,020
令人"震驚"的是她和雷米上過床
who, shockingly, she was sleeping with.

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,110
她不會因為一段婚外情就作證
Well, she's not testifying because of an affair.

64
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,260
她作證是因為她不想進監獄
She's testifying 'cause she doesn't want to go to jail.

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,380
任何人出庭作證都只因為這個
Which is the only reason anyone testifies.

66
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,550
道格  盯住委員會里剩下的民主黨人
Doug, keep at the rest of the Democrats on that committee.

67
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,930
確保他們守規矩
Make sure they stay in line.

68
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,640
我會在我黨這邊發力  但  羅梅洛
I'll keep working my side of the aisle, but... uh, Romero.

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,690
他是個混蛋
He's a prick.

70
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,850
一個依然想當黨鞭的混蛋
Mmm-hmm, prick who still wants whip.

71
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,990
泰瑞·烏麥克一直忠心耿耿
Terry Womack has been very loyal.

72
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,190
是啊  忠誠和厲害是兩碼事
Yeah, well, there's loyal, and then there's good.

73
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,560
烏麥克給了你什么
What has Womack brought you?

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,910
宣戰委員會是他解決的嗎
Did he kill the Declaration of War Committee?

75
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,230
11月時他幫你拿下密蘇里了嗎
Did he deliver Missouri for you in November?

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,380
夠了
That's enough.

77
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,930
滿足他吧
Let's give it to him.

78
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,630
有時你得做出艱難抉擇
Look, sometimes you have to make hard choices.

79
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,130
我會跟泰瑞談的
I'll talk to Terry.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
羅梅洛得給他找個地方落腳
Romero's gonna have to find a place for him to land, and...

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,520
落在哪我是在意的
where that is matters to me.

82
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,040
就這樣吧
That'll be all for now.

83
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
好  先生
Yes, sir.

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,390
我會讓道爾去查
I'm gonna put Doyle on this.

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,100
我們已經審查過羅梅洛了
We already vetted Romero.

86
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,100
不  我是說查厄舍
No, I mean on Usher.

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,960
尸體保存得非常完好
The body is remarkably well-preserved,

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,700
除了手腳  因為都凍傷了
except for the extremities, which frostbite took care of.

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,220
但牙齒是完好的
But dental is intact.

90
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,510
我們在南極的同行正在全力配合
Our counterparts in Antarctica are cooperating fully,

91
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,470
12小時內尸體會到我們手上
and the body will be in our possession within the next 12 hours.

92
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,080
報關后我會派人把它運回來
I'll have it in transit after customs.

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,260
我們希望尸體在運輸中失蹤
We'd like the body to get lost in transit.

94
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,200
女士
Ma'am?

95
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,390
它必須失蹤
It needs to get lost.

96
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,950
好
Yes.

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,950
好  謝謝  助理局長格林
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Director Green.

98
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,520
我們再聯系
Uh, keep in touch.

99
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,880
-我還以為你已經睡了  -還不能睡
- I thought you'd gone to bed. - Can't yet.

100
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
-那是誰  -我們不認識
- Who's that? - No one we know.

101
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,960
湯姆  我說了  我們不認識
Tom, I said it's no one we know.

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,050
你聽說過他們在意大利阿爾卑斯山發現的
You ever hear about the 5,000-year-old man they found

103
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,860
冰凍五千年的干尸嗎
frozen in the Italian Alps?

104
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,770
沒有
No.

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,290
他的頭骨后面被砸出了坑
His skull was caved in... from the back.

106
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,940
他大概根本沒料到
He probably never saw it coming.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,740
被痛打一頓  留下等死
Beaten and left for dead.

108
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,970
留下等死是一個古老的概念
Left for dead is an ancient concept.

109
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,550
當人被凍死的時候
You know, when you freeze to death...

110
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,290
最后會感覺非常熱
the last thing you feel is extreme heat.

111
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,470
疼
That hurts.

112
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,900
抱歉
Sorry.

113
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,670
我剛看到了弗蘭西斯
I saw Francis out there.

114
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,490
他好像很焦躁
He seems on edge.

115
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,970
能怪他嗎
Can you blame him?

116
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,680
好點了嗎
Better?

117
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
最重的罪是入店行竊
Shoplifting is the worst of it.

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,700
近來幾次在街上買毒品  而被法庭強制戒毒
A couple of recent street buys that led to court-mandated rehab.

119
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,320
她就在那里生活  工作  買毒品
That's where she lives, where she works, where she scores...

120
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,750
但依我看就是個二十多的女人  努力想活到三十
But all I see here is a woman in her 20s, trying to get to 30.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,620
-她是個威脅  -我不懂
- She's a concern. - I don't get it.

122
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,700
嘉文·奧爾西去委內瑞拉之前  她和他有聯系
She was in touch with Gavin Orsay before he left for Venezuela.

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,370
-道格  -納森
- Doug... - Nathan!

124
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,190
你的語氣有點急  我們可能得討論下
There's a bite to your tone that we might need to discuss.

125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,120
她是個隱患  是個癮君子
She's a loose end and an addict.

126
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,510
這兩樣合在一起很糟
That's a bad combination.

127
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,060
重新裝修了
It's a clean slate.

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,390
唐納德·布萊斯的品味對我來說太暗了
Donald Blythe's taste was a bit too dark for me,

129
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,090
所以我全拆掉了
so I stripped it all back.

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,790
我選了一副畫  還在路上
I have chosen one painting so far that's on its way, though.

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,020
撒德·彼得森的尸體處理好了
Thad Peterson's body is taken care of.

132
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,370
他叫無名氏
His name is John Doe.

133
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,360
他化成灰我都認識
I'd recognize him anywhere.

134
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,020
這本來會傷害到我國的
This would've been very embarrassing to some interests

135
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,500
一些重要利益
that are important to this country.

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,360
我也不希望他的家人看到他這樣
And I wouldn't want the family to see him this way.

137
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,700
約旦大使館有什么消息
What's the news from the Jordanian Embassy?

138
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,750
艾丹·麥卡倫仍不愿
Aidan Macallan still won't

139
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,900
透露他跟佩特洛夫說了什么  沒說什么
reveal what he did or didn't tell Petrov.

140
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,670
總統希望他立刻從避難地
Well, the president wants him brought back from his asylum

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,190
回到美國
to the United States immediately.

142
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,100
我們應該耐心點兒
I think we should give it a little more time.

143
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,740
我在想讓你插手明不明智
You know, I wonder if it was such a good idea to bring you in on this.

144
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,790
-你承諾了  -我知道  艾哈邁迪...
- You promised-- - I know. Ahmadi...

145
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,290
我們派了特種部隊去當地追蹤
We've got Special Forces on the ground, tracking.

146
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,730
俄羅斯在敘利亞的存在
Russia's presence in Syria

147
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,250
讓此事比我曾經想得要復雜
is making this more difficult than I once thought.

148
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,330
我得知道麥卡倫跟佩特羅夫說了什么
I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.

149
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,430
男人制造爛攤子的天賦
It never ceases to astonish me

150
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,580
總能讓我吃驚
how talented men are at making a mess.

151
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,680
打擊同黨對你來說可沒好處
Uh, it's not gonna serve you to go after your own party.

152
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,260
你從不放棄
You never stop.

153
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,180
杰姬·夏普不會作證的
Jackie Sharp will never testify.

154
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,860
那她就得進監獄
Well, then she'll go to jail.

155
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,320
艾力克斯  你證明不了他們之間有交換條件
You can't prove it, Alex. You can't prove the quid pro quo.

156
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,130
她好像覺得我可以
She seems to think I can.

157
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,370
如果你換種方式
If you play it a little differently,

158
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,570
還有機會實現目標
you have a chance to get what you want.

159
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,880
我們可以給你黨鞭的位子
We're offering you whip.

160
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,310
-我不想要了  -什么
- I don't want it anymore. - What?

161
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,680
天啊
Jesus Christ.

162
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,440
那就財政委員會
Ways and Means, then.

163
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,530
在下次黨代會上做主講
The keynote at the next convention.

164
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,900
我只想讓弗蘭西斯·安德伍德進監獄
What I want is for Francis Underwood to go to jail.

165
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,570
天吶  這對你有什么好處
My God. How is that gonna help you?

166
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,360
真的  這對你有什么好處
Really? How's it gonna help you?

167
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,510
還有別的辦法做到
There's another way to go at it.

168
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,110
你想揚名
Wanna make a name for yourself?

169
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,760
你想讓總統生不如死
You wanna make the president's life a living hell?

170
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,670
那就慢慢來
Draw it out.

171
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,580
讓委員會繼續  但要溫水煮青蛙
Keep the committee going but at a slow burn.

172
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,350
你不是為他工作嗎
Aren't you working for him?

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,260
政府成員  一次找一個人
Members of the administration, you bring 'em in one at a time.

174
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,570
你可以糾纏幾年  一邊穩住自己的地位
You could ride this for a couple of years and secure your place.

175
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,730
而你壓制住總統
While you keep the president in check.

176
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,310
別傳喚杰姬·夏普  否則計劃會胎死腹中
Don't end it before it's begun by calling Jackie Sharp.

177
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,720
你知道我看好你
You know I see good things for you.

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,150
讓我為你規劃接下來的八年
Let me plan out your next eight years.

179
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
與你合作的候選人
The candidates you worked with...

180
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,770
他們中有多少人反復等待
how many of them have waited and waited

181
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,400
誤了時機
and lost their moment?

182
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,410
嗯  沒錯
Yeah, that's right.

183
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,590
我分析當下時局  現在屬于我
I'm reading the moment, and this is mine.

184
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,640
讓我在第三街下車
Let me out on Third Street.

185
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,360
我送你到雷伯恩大樓
I'll drop you at Rayburn.

186
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,420
不  我總是走最后46米
No, I always walk the final 50 yards.

187
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,710
可能有機會做政治交際
Never know when you might get a chance to press some flesh.

188
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,050
是啊
Yeah.

189
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,760
你好  我是艾力克斯·羅梅洛
Hi, I'm Alex Romero.

190
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,060
我代表亞利桑那州第七區
I represent the Seventh District of Arizona.

191
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,430
我想知道你昨晚失眠的原因
I want to know what keeps you up at night,

192
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,450
我今天好解決這一問題
so I can work all day to address it.

193
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,330
未來屬于我們所有人
The future belongs to all of us.

194
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,420
但愿我能得到你的支持
I hope I can count on your support.

195
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,950
你覺得怎么樣  馬克
What do you think, Mark?

196
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,810
你可是專家
I mean, you're the expert.

197
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
就這兒
Right here.

198
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,410
羅梅洛拒絕了  一般的條件他也不感興趣
Romero said no, and the usual offers don't interest him.

199
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,730
他感興趣  你只是恨自己感興趣
Oh, he's interested. He just hates himself for it.

200
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,470
關于委員會的共和黨人  我有了進展
I am making headway with the Republicans on the committee.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,620
他們都有不可告人的過去  大多有目擊證人
They all have pasts, most of them have witnesses.

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,110
無論如何  杰姬·夏普不會作證
One way or another, Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.

203
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,580
那你為什么這么難搞定
So why are you having so much trouble

204
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,370
這位年輕議員
with this one young congressman?

205
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,760
他很固執
He's tenacious.

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,260
他讓我想起了你
He reminds me of you.

207
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,360
我根本看不出來  我們再聯系
Well, I don't see that at all. We'll talk later.

208
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,480
我可以聯系丹頓
I could reach out to Danton--

209
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,700
我們曝光他  他就會曝光我們
We expose him, he'll expose us.

210
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
那你有什么建議
Well, then what do you suggest?

211
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,350
繼續做總統該做的事
That I go on being presidential.

212
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,480
我只有這一個辦法
That's the only way that I can deal with this.

213
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,170
我的就職頭百天啊
It's my first 100 days, for God's sake.

214
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,170
弗蘭西斯
Francis...

215
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,310
我們會捉住艾哈邁迪的
we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.

216
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,440
世界上再多的艾哈邁迪
There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world.

217
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,130
也抵不掉我們做的那些事
Not for all we've done.

218
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
那怎么辦
Then what?

219
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,610
比如毀了羅梅洛  這件事總能辦到吧
Destroy Romero, for one. Can we at least take care of that?

220
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,790
然后毀誰  整個民主黨嗎
And then who? The rest of the Democratic Party?

221
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,290
我知道我在做什么  克萊爾  我當過總統
I know what I'm doing, Claire. I've been president before.

222
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,470
我也當過
So have I.

223
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,150
給我接泰瑞·烏麥克
Get me Terry Womack.

224
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,210
你作為副總統的職責是給我建議
Your job as vice president is to advise.

225
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,570
做決定是我的職責
My job is to make the decisions.

226
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,050
泰瑞  沒錯  我就是問問情況
Terry, yes, I'm just checking in.

227
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,880
我希望你知道我們都支持你
Well, I want you to know that we support you.

228
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,940
那混蛋還想當黨鞭  做夢去吧
That bastard asked for whip, but that's never gonna happen.

229
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,500
只要我在臺上就別想  我把話給你撂這兒
Not while I'm in this office. I wanted to assure you.

230
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,970
我一向在能出力的地方幫忙
I've always tried to help where I can.

231
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,190
你在衛生和人類服務部幫不上忙嗎
And you couldn't help at Health and Human Services?

232
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,890
我們這里做了很多了不起的事
The agency does some amazing work.

233
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,260
你接受采訪時曾說那是你夢寐以求的工作
Well, you were quoted as, uh, calling your position a dream job.

234
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,040
人是可以有多個夢想的
It's possible to have more than one dream.

235
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,610
我可以讓助手帶你逛逛
I can have my assistant give you a tour.

236
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,970
給你看看海地發來的視頻
Uh, show you some of the video from Haiti

237
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,780
拍的是過去幾個月  我們在那邊的
and some of the work that we've been doing there

238
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,750
工作和成績
over the last several months.

239
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440
我一定會把
I will be sure to include

240
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,300
你們組織寫進我的報道
your organization in the piece I'm writing.

241
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,710
-我相信你們的事業  -謝謝
- I believe in the work you're doing here. - Thank you.

242
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,430
和安德伍德政府合作  感覺怎么樣
What was it like, uh, working with the Underwood administration?

243
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,170
他們還行  且這么說吧
They were fine. Let's leave it at that.

244
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,400
我采訪過許多非常棒的組織
You know, I've met with, uh, many wonderful organizations so far.

245
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,090
-弗州兒童守衛基金  -他們的工作很棒
- The Virginia Children's Defense Fund. - They do some great work.

246
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
塔伯特聯盟
The Talbot League?

247
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,500
這個組織也很棒
Another terrific group.

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,530
還有安東尼·莫雷蒂紀念基金
The Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

249
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,320
他們我倒沒什么了解
I don't know anything about them.

250
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,540
他們是器官移植宣傳組織
Organ transplantation awareness.

251
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,500
是嗎
Oh, is that right?

252
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,690
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

253
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,700
太失禮了  但我又太餓了
It's rude, but I was famished.

254
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,570
謝謝你肯來見我  我給你拿菜單
Thank you for meeting me. Let me get you a menu.

255
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,340
謝謝不用了  我隨后還有午餐會
Uh, no, thank you. I have a lunch right after this.

256
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,090
那就好  一定要有個吃午飯的地方
Good. You should always have one on the books.

257
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,560
-戴維斯女士  -你擔心艾丹
- Miss Davis? - You're worried about Aidan.

258
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,670
你稱呼他有什么昵稱嗎
Do you call him anything for short?

259
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,380
為什么問我這個
Why would you ask me that?

260
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,420
我不知道總統或者副總統
I don't know if the president, or vice president,

261
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,640
告沒告訴你  但麥卡挺好的
has informed you, but Mac is fine.

262
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,430
問題在于他知道什么
It's what he knows is the problem,

263
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
他都跟誰說過
and who he may have told it to.

264
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,660
他只想活下去
He wants to stay alive.

265
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,950
沒錯
Yes.

266
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,940
但這種人才得小心
But those are the ones you have to watch out for.

267
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,610
我上次和艾丹說完話他就上了出租車
Last I spoke to Aidan was minutes before he got in a cab.

268
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,260
我不知道他有什么  也不知道他做了什么
I don't know what he has or what he's done.

269
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,040
我只是奉命行事
I only do what I'm told.

270
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,720
我就在胡佛大樓上班
I'm in the Hoover Building.

271
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,840
那真是全城最丑的一棟樓
It's the ugliest building in... in the city.

272
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,050
我每次進去都閉著眼
I close my eyes as I walk in.

273
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,500
有空來坐坐  尤其是你想找人談談的時候
Stop by any time. Especially if you're in the mood to talk.

274
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,210
像你這樣口風緊的人  我們用得上
We could use someone who says as little as you do.

275
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,790
麗薩
Lisa!

276
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,960
-我一直在找她  -我不知道她在哪
- I've been looking for her. - I have no idea where she is.

277
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,950
-我幫你拿吧  -不用了
- Let me help you with that. - No. No, I'm okay.

278
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,780
-我很樂意幫你拿  -你嚇到我了
- I'm happy to carry it for you. - You're scaring me.

279
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,440
我只是擔心她而已
I'm just worried about her. That's all.

280
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,580
我戒了
I'm clean.

281
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,220
很好
Good.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,380
至少我努力在戒  求你別纏著我了
At least I'm trying to get clean. Please leave me alone.

283
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,570
就是
Just...

284
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,360
如果你有瑞秋的消息  請你
If you hear from Rachel, just, uh...

285
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,510
告訴她我全都打點好了
tell her I've taken care of everything.

286
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,680
她可以回來了  不會有事的
She can come home and everything will be fine.

287
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,110
我想她  你知道嗎
I miss her, you know?

288
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,820
你不接嗎
You going to answer that?

290
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,590
我說得對嗎
So, was I right?

291
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,380
你的電話響了
Your phone is ringing.

292
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,550
你按邊上的按鈕就可以直接掛斷
You know, you can just hang it up by pressing the button on the side.

293
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,330
-你不用拒接  -我習慣了
- You don't have to decline-- - I'm a creature of habit.

294
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,540
是的  你是對的
So, yeah, you were right.

295
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,390
這部電話只用過一次  撥打了一個號碼
This phone has only been used once to call one number, once.

296
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,470
我用了生產序列號
I mean, I used the manufacturer's serial number

297
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,910
追蹤到了它的經銷商所在地
and tracked down where it's distributed to.

298
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,820
是在  杜邦環島的一家商店
It was a, um... A shop in Dupont Circle.

299
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,280
打給了誰
And who did it call?

300
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,060
查無此人
Comes up unknown.

301
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,850
不過前幾位數字
But the prefix...

302
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,580
聽著  你得找警察或聯調局談
And, look, you're gonna have to talk to the police or the FBI.

303
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,530
-我不能一直  -別擔心  我擔著
- I just can't keep-- - Don't worry. It's on me.

304
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,780
那個號碼的前幾位  我看著像政府號碼
The prefix on the call, it looks like a government number to me.

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,060
喂
Hello.

306
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,530
他跟蹤你了  什么時候
He followed you? When?

307
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,700
-我得去  -好的
- I've got to... - Yeah.

308
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,970
好的  如果你覺得現在待的地方安全  
Okay. Okay, if you feel safe where you are,

309
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,360
那就待著  我來找你
stay there. I'm coming to you.

310
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,350
有什么不能在電話上告訴我的
So what couldn't you tell me over the phone?

311
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,500
杰姬·夏普
Jackie Sharp.

312
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,300
她怎么了
What about her?

313
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,400
你真不知道嗎
You really don't know?

314
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,010
我還以為這事是白宮傳出來的
I thought this was coming out of the White House.

315
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,120
馬上要爆出來了
The story's about to break

316
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,210
說她拿立法換取競選資金
that she traded legislation for campaign funds.

317
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
消息來源呢
The source?

318
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,810
所以是未經確認的
So, unconfirmed.

319
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,370
一小時內就會上《德拉吉報道》了
It's going to be on Drudge within the hour.

320
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,180
你真沒什么要說的嗎
You really don't have anything to say?

321
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,090
如果是真的  很遺憾看到民主黨
If it's true, it's just sad to see the unexpected fall

322
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,810
一顆曾經的新星這樣出人意料地隕落
of a once rising star in the Democratic Party.

323
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,950
得了吧
Stop it.

324
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,160
夏普本能讓委員會拿下一分
Sharp would've been a get for the committee.

325
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,310
如果你仍愿意作證  我們就仍愿意談
If you're still willing to appear, we're still willing to talk.

326
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,350
回見
See ya.

327
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,150
我們這個政府不是這么辦事的
This is not how we do things in this administration.

328
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,910
你希望她不作證
You wanted her not to testify.

329
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,210
現在羅梅洛不可能逼她就范了
And there's no way Romero can force her to now.

330
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,220
你讓我的新聞發言人
You've put my press secretary

331
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,670
和他的人處于了非常尷尬的境地
and his staff in a very difficult situation.

332
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,950
有人泄密  并不是你
It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.

333
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,410
我真心覺得這樣才能占得先機
I really felt this was the way to get ahead of it.

334
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,560
這叫占得先機
This is getting ahead of it?

335
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,510
我向你們保證  她的律師
I guarantee you her lawyers

336
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,550
現在一定讓她保持沉默  緘口不談
tell her to plead the Fifth now, across the board.

337
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,380
最重要的是  對涉及你們的事閉嘴
Most importantly, where it concerns you.

338
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,960
但這都是在我跟佩特羅夫談判時發生的
But all of this happened while I was negotiating with Petrov.

339
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,870
對大眾而言  你當時是第一夫人
Oh, to the public, you were the First Lady,

340
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,740
正不眠不休地守在丈夫的床邊
sitting vigil by your husband's bed.

341
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,570
所以這都是在唐納德·布萊斯的監管下發生的
So, actually, all of this happened under Donald Blythe's watch.

342
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,110
如果你們覺得我越界了  很抱歉
I'm sorry if you think I overstepped.

343
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,850
我是想保護你們
I was trying to protect you.

344
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,710
他做了正確的事
He did the right thing.

345
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,940
我不介意他做了什么
Oh, I don't mind what he did.

346
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,800
我介意的是他做事的方式
I mind the way he did it.

347
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,590
-莉安  -副總統女士
- LeAnn... - Madam Vice President.

348
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,500
抱歉  我的行程太滿了
I'm sorry my schedule is so full.

349
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,690
沒關系  我非常理解
No, I completely understand,

350
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,270
畢竟你要處理那么多事
with everything that you're dealing with.

351
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,170
抱歉我這么固執
I'm sorry for being so insistent,

352
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,930
但我覺得應該讓你知道
but I thought you should

353
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,880
簡·戴維斯昨天來找我了
know that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.

354
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,090
找你
Came after you?

355
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,600
她想讓我去為她工作  不知你是否知情
She wanted me to work for her. I didn't know if you knew.

356
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,200
為她做哪方面的工作
In what capacity?

357
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,240
這點我還不確定  不過
That, I'm not clear on, but it...

358
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
她想要關于艾丹·麥卡倫的信息
She wanted information about Aidan Macallan.

359
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,990
希望你知道我絕不會透漏一個字
I hope you know I would never say a word.

360
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,260
謝謝你讓我知道這些
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

361
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,730
女士  我希望能討論一下我的前途
Ma'am, I was hoping we could discuss my future.

362
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,360
莉安  我很樂意討論你的前途  但現在不行
Oh, LeAnn, I would love to discuss your future, but not yet.

363
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,030
如果你愿意  女士  艾丹的事我能幫忙
If you would like, ma'am, I can help with Aidan.

364
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,820
你盡管吩咐
Anything that's required.

365
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,400
很高興知道你有這個心
That's good to know.

366
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,130
你覺得莉安·哈維不會告訴我嗎
Did you think LeAnn Harvey wouldn't tell me?

367
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,210
我從不假設人們會做什么或不會做什么
I never assume what people will do or won't do.

368
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,340
-我以為我們在默契合作  -沒錯啊
- I thought we were working well together. - We are.

369
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,990
繞過我套取信息
Well, going around me to get information

370
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,490
只會在你我之間造成嫌隙
will only create discord between us.

371
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,870
我并不想這樣  克萊爾
I wouldn't want that, Claire.

372
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,890
-戴維斯女士  -總統先生
- Miss Davis. - Mr. President.

373
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,080
抱歉我來晚了
I'm sorry I'm late.

374
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,090
副總統告訴我你的聯系人
The vice president has told me that your contacts

375
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,760
再次跟丟了艾哈邁迪
have once again lost track of Ahmadi.

376
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,320
是  我解釋過
Yes, as I explained,

377
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,550
敘利亞局勢每天都在天翻地覆
Syria is like a different country one day to the next.

378
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,800
這你得歸咎于維克多·佩特羅夫
Yes, well, you can thank Viktor Petrov for that.

379
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,180
我是怪他
Oh, I do.

380
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,910
夫人
Ma'am?

381
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,300
我得失陪了  簡
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, Jane.

382
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,460
我現在都快忙瘋了
The schedule is crazy these days.

383
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,620
當然
Oh, of course.

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,120
有沒有搞錯  國務院加國防部
Really? The State Department, the Pentagon,

385
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
連個艾哈邁迪都捉不住
we can't get close to Ahmadi?

386
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,450
我只想要和平
I just want peace.

387
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,540
是啊  和平的利潤最豐厚
Yes, there's nothing that makes profits like peace.

388
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,580
而有利潤的地方最和平
And nothing makes peace like profits.

389
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,970
總統先生  我能有話直說[遲鈍]嗎
Mr. President, may I be blunt?

390
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,130
我可不覺得你是遲鈍的人  戴維斯女士
Well, I would never accuse you of dullness, Miss Davis.

391
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,250
霍姆斯城將會遭受一場毒氣襲擊
There's going to be a gas attack happening in the city of Homs.

392
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,970
而如果說  您劃下紅線
If you were to, let us say, draw a line in the sand...

393
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,170
然后又發生了這樣慘烈的襲擊
and if this tragic attack were to happen...

394
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,950
那美國政府將不得不
the US government would have

395
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,980
加派三萬多名士兵進駐
to send in an additional 30,000 or so soldiers.

396
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,550
以保護石油管線
To protect the oil lines,

397
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,730
阻止佩特羅夫拿下大馬士革
to keep Petrov from getting into Damascus.

398
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,750
當然了  還要保護人民
And, of course, to protect the people.

399
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,630
這么大規模的軍隊幾乎就是全面占領了
That's venturing close to occupation with those kind of numbers.

400
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,830
我只是在說  也許宣戰委員會
All I'm saying is maybe the Declaration of War Committee

401
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,860
終于可以辯論他們該辯論的了
could finally debate what they were mandated to.

402
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,700
開戰
A war.

403
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,150
你認識馬克·厄舍嗎
Do you know Mark Usher?

404
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,790
認識  我們合作過
Yes, we worked together.

405
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,570
當時他在協助一位眾議員
He was handling a congressman.

406
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,300
馬克
Mark.

407
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,680
有人給你拿過什么嗎
Has anyone offered you anything?

408
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,200
沒有  不用  謝謝了
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

409
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,110
你和簡·戴維斯合作過嗎
Have you ever worked with Jane Davis?

410
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,160
戴維斯是她繼父的姓
Davis is the stepfather's name.

411
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,590
一個只干了一任的參議員
A one-term senator.

412
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,470
總之
Uh, anyway, yeah,

413
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,380
她曾對我的一位客戶有點興趣
she was interested in a client I had, at some point.

414
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,210
國會議員候選人
A candidate for Congress.

415
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,100
可憐人  厄舍一意識到他不夠強硬
Poor guy. The minute Usher realized he wasn't formidable enough,

416
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,280
就甩手走人  讓他自生自滅了
he just dumped him. Let him go.

417
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,610
但馬克就這樣
But that's Mark.

418
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,350
他擅長發現人才
He has an eye for talent.

419
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,940
喜歡密切關注你  而他自己卻站得遠遠的
Likes to keep you close while he keeps himself remote.

420
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,780
但是他不同意她在一些問題上的立場
But he disagreed with some of her positions,

421
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,870
于是資金就斷掉了
the money went away.

422
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,630
聽我說  千萬別讓簡騙了你
Listen, don't let Jane fool you.

423
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,480
她看上去可能有點  沒有章法
She can seem a bit... haphazard...

424
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,250
但只要他利用完了你
But once he's done with you...

425
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,020
就會像關上開關那么干脆決絕
it's as if a switch gets turned off.

426
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,020
但她冷酷無情
But she is merciless.

427
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,370
要多專一就有多專一
Single-minded as a single mind can be.

428
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,170
怎么了  我今天忘了吃飯了
What? Forgot to eat today.

429
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,730
你給我查出什么了
What have you got for me?

430
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,140
-不知道  -少跟我"不知道"
- I don't know. - Don't do "I don't know."

431
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,530
我去見了梅瑞迪斯·李
Saw Meredith Lee.

432
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,320
我提到了莫雷蒂基金  器官移植
I mentioned the Moretti Fund, organ transplants, uh...

433
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,300
她看起來有點緊張  可是  我說不好
She got a little tense, but... I don't know.

434
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,500
你怎么沒告訴我你被開除了
Why didn't you tell me you were fired?

435
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,280
-原來是你  -就是我和你女友說了話
- Oh, that was you? - Who talked to your girlfriend? Yeah.

436
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,970
多久了
How long?

437
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,420
有什么區別  我窮途末路了
What's the difference? I'm tapped.

438
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,690
我們在干什么呢
What are we doing here?

439
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,590
我不喜歡有人在我車上吃東西
I don't like eating in my car.

440
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,640
我覺得勞拉·莫雷蒂的丈夫
I think Laura Moretti's husband

441
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,030
在捐贈名單上被插隊了
was jumped on the donor list.

442
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,220
-這你是從哪聽說的  -直覺
- Where the hell did you get that? - My gut.

443
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,460
不信我分析給你聽
I can lay it out for you.

444
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,640
敢這么說話  你最好說到做到
Yeah, you say something like that, you better.

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,560
沙林毒氣  主要襲擊霍姆斯近郊的平民區
Sarin gas. Mostly against civilians in suburban areas of Homs.

446
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,390
-我們在和一幫畜生斗  -太可怕了
- We're dealing with animals here. - It's horrifying.

447
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,230
你知道我過去一直在盡量克制  但是
Now, you know I've always shown restraint in the past, but...

448
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,650
我打算發布行政命令  部署軍事行動了
I'm going to be making an executive order for military action.

449
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,710
先空襲  然后地面部隊進駐
Air strikes followed by ground troops.

450
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,700
你得向聯合國提交報告
You'll need to present to the UN.

451
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,690
這個情報是哪來的
Where is this intelligence coming from?

452
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,560
簡報里都寫了
Well, it's all there in the briefing.

453
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,350
但既然我們知道這事會發生
But if we know this is going to happen,

454
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,100
我們為什么不提前制止呢
well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?

455
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,770
弗蘭西斯還留著你的辭職信
Francis held on to your resignation letter.

456
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,520
他想把它撕掉
And he wants to tear it up.

457
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,100
我知道這幾個月來你多么艱辛
I know how difficult these past few months have been for you.

458
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,830
我們要求你做了很多
We've really asked a lot.

459
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,600
但等我們部署了軍事行動
But once we're on the other side of this military action,

460
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,960
我們會準許你如愿離開政府
you have our blessing to leave the administration if you choose.

461
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,850
但當然  我們更希望你留下
But, of course, we'd prefer if you stay on.

462
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,520
希望這是不言自明的
Hope that goes without saying.

463
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,580
對平民使用
Using weapons of mass destruction

464
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,730
大規模殺傷性武器是戰爭罪
against civilians is a war crime.

465
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,290
我很感激有機會能完成此事
I appreciate the opportunity to see this through to the end.

466
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,370
我們就希望你會這么說
We were hoping you would say that.

467
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,670
謝謝你  凱茜
Thank you, Cathy.

468
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,210
謝謝  總統先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

469
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,060
你擔心她嗎
Are you worried about her?

470
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,010
我們得開始想
We need to start thinking about

471
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,360
我們身邊的人了
the people we surround ourselves with.

472
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,490
這讓我想到了湯姆
Which has made me think of Tom...

473
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,220
他現在已經沒理由留在這里了  是吧
who doesn't really have a reason to be here anymore, does he?

474
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,750
沒有正式理由
Not an official one, no,

475
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,000
但我想或許我們可以給他個顧問之名
but I thought maybe we could bring him on as a consultant.

476
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,090
當然  這取決于你
Well, of course, that's entirely up to you.

477
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,080
只是一天的時間和精力有限
There's just only so much time and energy in a single day,

478
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,710
我覺得我們該不斷自省
and I think we need to constantly be asking ourselves,

479
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,820
"我是否盡可能明智地利用我的時間和精力了"
"Am I spending it as wisely as I can?"

480
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,740
-謝謝  -簡  真抱歉
- Thank you. - Jane, I'm so sorry

481
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,280
-從派對上把你叫走  -沒事
- to pull you away from your party. - No, no, no.

482
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,990
-當我在電話上聽到你的聲音  -我就是
- When I heard your voice on the phone... - I just... I just...

483
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,110
-我不知道該怎么辦  -出什么事了嗎
- I don't know what to do. - Did something happen?

484
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,620
安德伍德夫婦在計劃
The Underwoods are planning

485
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,750
對霍姆斯進行空襲  增派軍隊
air strikes and a troop surge in Homs.

486
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,310
-太可怕了  -你了解這事嗎
- How awful. - Do you know anything about this?

487
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,960
佩特羅夫把那里變成了地獄
Petrov is making the whole region a disaster.

488
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,930
沒有哪個卷入中東局勢的人能得到好處
No one who ever got tangled up in the Middle East came out ahead.

489
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,190
隨佩特羅夫去吧
Let Petrov own it.

490
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,740
有可怕的事將要發生
There's something terrible that is going to happen...

491
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,510
我們可以阻止
that we can prevent.

492
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,570
這樣啊
I see.

493
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,260
我要向聯合國提交我方紅線警告
I'm scheduled to present some kind of red line at the UN.

494
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,770
-但我們還可以退一步的  -我要怎么幫忙
- But we can still pull back. - How can I help?

495
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,890
跟總統和副總統談談
Talk to the president, the vice president.

496
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,740
我會的
I will.

497
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
他們真可怕  是吧
They're terrible, terrible people, aren't they?

498
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,840
簡
Jane...

499
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,320
對他們一定要小心
be very careful with them.

500
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,820
當然
Of course.

501
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
這是老友的忠告
That's from an old friend.

502
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,340
我們還是朋友吧
Are we still friends?

503
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
當然
Of course.

504
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,990
他說總統接受的肝臟
He says the liver the president received

505
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,240
本該是給一個叫安東尼·莫雷蒂的人的
was supposed to go to a man named Anthony Moretti.

506
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,410
他說道格逼迫
And he says that Doug forced

507
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,610
當時的衛生和人類服務部部長
then Secretary of Health and Human Services

508
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,830
把總統排在名單最前
to put the president at the top of the list,

509
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,110
結果莫雷蒂因此死了
which resulted in Moretti's death.

510
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,330
道格還跟他的遺孀發生了關系
Oh, and Doug also has become involved with the man's widow.

511
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,430
干得漂亮
That's a nice touch.

512
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,780
他有證據嗎
And does... does he have proof?

513
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,300
關于戀情嗎  這個簡單
About the relationship? It's easy to prove that.

514
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,440
名單的話  他知道梅瑞迪斯·李有所隱瞞
But the list, he knows that Meredith Lee is hiding something.

515
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,910
他打算再去找她談
And he's ready to go back and talk to her about it.

516
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,050
你信任他嗎
Do you trust him?

517
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,190
我不知道他干嗎要編造這些
I don't know why he'd make any of this up.

518
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,470
我在外面
Hey, I'm outside.

519
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,520
你玩得開心嗎
Did you have a good time?

520
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
我在這種場合已經開心不了了
I never do at those things anymore.

521
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,580
必要之惡
Necessary evils.

522
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,800
不像以前了
It's not like the old days,

523
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,090
你還能結識出人意料的人
when you used to meet surprising people.

524
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,260
是人們不那么出人意料了
Did people get less surprising

525
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
還是我們不容易被打動了
or are we less easily surprised?

526
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,950
是啊
Well, exactly.

527
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,710
-我的車來了  -她跟我問了你
- This is me. - She asked me about you.

528
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,800
-我猜到了  你怎么說的  -你...
- I figured. What'd you say? - That you're...

529
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,940
強大  什么的
formidable, etcetera.

530
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,580
我也這么跟他說你的  什么的
Yeah, I told him the same about you, etcetera.

531
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,990
他可以當個偉大的總統
He could be a great president.

532
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,440
但他想做嗎
But does he want to be?

533
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,670
而且什么算偉大
And what is great?

534
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,390
還有她
And then there's her.

535
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,230
她怎么樣
What about her?

536
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,770
她怎么了
What about her?

537
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,300
如果鮑勃或泰瑞是副主席
Because if Bob or Terry were the ranking member,

538
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,600
我就找他們了
I'd be talking to them.

539
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,160
我要羅梅洛做光桿司令
I want Romero's clerk stripped.

540
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,680
對  他給委員會成員的任何預算
Yeah, whatever budget he's got for his seat on that committee.

541
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,320
不不  我這是為了黨派
No, no, I'm asking for the sake of the party.

542
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,870
杰姬·夏普的事我們躲過一劫  但這事沒完
Look, we survived Jackie Sharp, but it's not gonna end there.

543
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,370
事實上  我在因為
The truth is I'm being punished

544
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,950
為我們選民最在乎的事抗爭而受懲罰
for fighting for the issues that our base cares most about.

545
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,000
對  謝謝
Yes, and thank you.

546
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,740
道爾說幾乎查不到厄舍的任何料
Doyle says there's almost nothing on Usher.

547
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,550
他喜歡賭博  一般能贏
He likes to gamble, usually wins.

548
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,490
但問題是  道爾找過馬歇爾
But here's the thing... Doyle spoke with Marshall,

549
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,210
我們知道他離開康威團隊時并不愉快
who we know did not have a happy exit from the Conway campaign.

550
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,820
他說  厄舍加入我們政府前
Now, he said that before Usher joined our administration,

551
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,440
他還打算培養羅梅洛競選總統
he was grooming Romero for a presidential run.

552
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,690
先生  我認為他在兩頭討好
Sir, I believe he's playing both sides

553
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,540
這個委員會的目標
of whatever this committee is after.

554
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,810
我不是民主黨人  杰弗里
I'm not a Democrat, Jeffrey.

555
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,090
我還是共和黨  只是碰巧在白宮工作
I'm still a Republican, just happen to work for the White House.

556
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,220
我是說  趁現在還行  控制下艾力克斯
All I'm saying is let's rein Alex in while we still can.

557
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,360
等他把自己的黨派攪翻了天
'Cause after he rips through his own party,

558
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,910
就會去折騰我們黨了  不是嗎
he'll come after ours, wouldn't you think?

559
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,050
杰弗  你是主席
Yeah, and Jeff, you're the chair...

560
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,750
不  什么  不  聽我說
No... What? No, listen.

561
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,150
等等  等等
Wait. Wait! Wait.

562
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,770
你欠我的  我們都知道
And you owe me, and we both know it,

563
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,910
這種事我不會大聲說出來
and that's not the kind of thing I like to say out loud.

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,930
什么
What is?

565
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,400
什么時候的事
When did that happen?

566
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,560
確認了嗎
Confirmed?

567
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,320
嗯
Yeah?

568
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,700
好吧
Yes, well...

569
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,100
沃克要作證
just because Walker's gonna take the stand,

570
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,130
不代表他會說什么  是吧
doesn't mean he'll say anything. Right?

571
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,380
你今早對我說的那個詞是什么
What was that word you said to me this morning?

572
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,130
就是現在沒人用了的那個
The one no one uses anymore?

573
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,380
黃昏的
Crepuscular.

574
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,000
對了
Right.

575
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,320
一些我最喜歡的動物就是晨昏性的
Some of my favorite animals are crepuscular.

576
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,380
喂
Yes.

577
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,550
什么
What?

578
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,600
什么時候
When?

579
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,250
天吶  該死
Jesus! God damn it!

580
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
克萊爾
Claire!

581
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,270
-克萊爾  -我在廚房
- Claire! - I'm in the kitchen.

582
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,140
沃克要作證
Walker's gonna testify.

583
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,800
-什么時候  -最早下周
- When? - Early as next week.

584
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,940
他會說他跟漢默施密特說的那些話
He's gonna say the same thing he said to Hammerschmidt.

585
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,240
不會有新傷害
There's not gonna be any new damage.

586
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,520
-我們不能確定  -我們去找厄舍
- We don't know that for sure. - Let's get Usher.

587
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,300
我早上肯定要找他
You bet I'm gonna talk to him in the morning.

588
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,370
你去哪
Where are you going?

589
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,120
在這房子里找塊空蕩的地方
To get some goddamn space in this house!

590
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,890
我可以解決沃克  我們給他開條件
I can take care of Walker. We'll make him an offer.

591
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,130
讓他回到政壇
A place back on the stage,

592
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,270
去哪個資金雄厚的大學當校長  他會接受的
chancellor of some well-endowed university. He'll take it.

593
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,480
他可能會  但首先
He just might. But first,

594
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,670
我要知道你有羅梅洛什么料
I want to know what you have on Romero.

595
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,190
完全沒有
I don't have a thing.

596
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,970
-得了  -道格  別失禮
- Please. - Doug, let's not be rude.

597
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,010
這我難以相信
I find that impossible to believe.

598
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,260
如果我知道  你會知道的
If I did, you would know it.

599
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,060
你和我都是老手了
You and I have been at this a long time.

600
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,870
你愿考慮一個候選人都肯定先審查過他
You wouldn't even consider a candidate without vetting him first.

601
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,010
我覺得艾力克斯很有前途
I thought Alex had a future.

602
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,140
是啊  就我所知可以競選總統
Yeah, a run for the presidency as I understand it.

603
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,570
他像上漿的白襯衫一樣干凈
He's clean and crisp as a starched white shirt.

604
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,860
你得做出決定  馬克
You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.

605
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,940
是為我和克萊爾工作  還是怎么
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?

606
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,670
我已經聯絡了我自己黨派的人
I have already reached out to members of my own party.

607
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,070
我為幫助你動用了我的政治資本
I've used my political capital to help you.

608
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,530
但你還是沒回答我的問題
But you're still not answering my question.

609
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,670
我已經回答了
I think I have.

610
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,560
我不需要讓你或安德伍德夫人相信我的價值
And I don't need to convince you or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.

611
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,030
認識您很榮幸
It's an honor to meet you.

612
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,570
賽斯  杰弗瑞斯先生稍后會去找你
Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up with you momentarily.

613
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,820
我得長話短說了
I'm going to keep this brief.

614
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,140
如果你的說法是真的
If what you're saying is true...

615
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,600
道格·斯坦普救了我丈夫一命
Doug Stamper saved my husband's life.

616
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,060
是的
He did.

617
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,350
還因此害死了別人
And he also cost someone else his.

618
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,920
我猜你是那種有很多欲求的人
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man that wants many things.

619
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,420
但你犯了個錯誤
But you have made a mistake.

620
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,810
職業上講  我只有一樣一直渴求的東西
There's only one thing, professionally, that I've always wanted.

621
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,430
就是進白宮工作
It's to work in the White House.

622
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
賽斯會送你出去
Seth will see you out.

623
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,390
抱歉剛剛不得不走開
Sorry for the interruption.

624
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,210
你說到哪了
You were saying...

625
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,590
凱茜一直是個好人
Cathy was always a very good person.

626
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,260
她內心是的  她有良心
At her core, she has a core.

627
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,320
保佑她
Bless her.

628
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,390
霍姆斯的事對她可能太為難
This whole Homs initiative might be too difficult for her.

629
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,620
你讓人很難讀懂
You know... you're very hard to read.

630
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,080
這也合理
Which makes sense.

631
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,850
這幾年來  你一直左右逢源
For the last several years, you've been a familiar face.

632
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,170
一定很累人
Must get exhausting.

633
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,080
你能跟他一起歡笑的人都很少吧
Must be hardly any people you can even share a laugh with.

634
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,350
你該想想該怎么好好利用我
You should figure out how to take full advantage of me.

635
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,990
我可以幫你如愿
I can help you get what you want.

636
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,570
如果你告訴我你的愿望
If you tell me what it is.

637
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,270
我喜歡幫助他人
I enjoy helping others.

638
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,320
我覺得你知道我的愿望
I think you know what I want.

639
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,180
是啊
Yes...

640
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,790
但你是現在想要  還是四年后要
But do you want it now or in four years?

641
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,100
我要全世界看到艾哈邁迪被逮捕
I want the whole world to see Ahmadi's capture...

642
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,080
鋪天蓋地的報道
on every news outlet and every screen.

643
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,060
為了黨派利益  我更希望沃克先生不要作證
For the good of the party, I'd prefer Mr. Walker not testify.

644
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,150
我在考慮離開宣戰委員會
I'm considering taking myself off the Declaration of War Committee.

645
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,350
艾力克斯  你不用那么做
Alex, you don't have to do that.

646
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,540
你可以隨意怎么處置它
And you can do what you will with it.

647
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,700
但條件是總統要做正確的事
But that's conditional on the president doing the right thing.

648
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,300
是什么
And what is that?

649
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,880
辭職
Resigning.

650
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,510
再說一遍  我只是為黨派考慮
Again, I'm only thinking of the party.

651
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,870
嗯
Yeah...

652
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,030
你他媽以為你是誰啊
Who the fuck do you think you are?

653
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,680
-別對我說粗話  -閉上臭嘴
- Oh, don't use that language with me... - Shut the fuck up.

654
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,800
你根本不知道你在做什么
You have no idea, none, about what you're doing.

655
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,630
請你離開我的辦公室
I'd like you to leave my office.

656
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,970
你給我聽好
Now you listen carefully to me.

657
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,710
-我說  -閉嘴  艾力克斯
- I said... - Shut up, Alex!

658
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
聽聽這個頭條
Here's a headline for you.

659
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,300
"艾力克斯·羅梅洛勾結康威州長
"Alex Romero colluded with Governor Conway

660
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,290
利用宣戰委員會
to use the Declaration of War Committee

661
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,700
幫他贏得大選"
to help him win an election."

662
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,560
-沒有  -得了  你清楚你做了什么
- No. - Please, you know you did.

663
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,860
-看這多簡單  -滾出去
- See how easy that is? - Get out!

664
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,000
聽證會上只會有你一個人  我剛見過沃克
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing. I just left Walker.

665
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,560
他打算保持沉默  你會出丑的
He's gonna plead the Fifth. You'll look like a fool.

666
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,240
你想出頭  沒人介意
You want to be out front? No one has a problem with that.

667
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,630
他們希望你出頭  因為你也會倒得最快
They want you there, because you'll be the first to fall.

668
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,500
"為了黨派"
"For the good of the party."

669
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,800
做個好夢  議員
Sleep tight, Congressman.

670
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,560
-誰知道威爾的事  -暫時還沒人
- Who knows about Will? - No one, not yet.

671
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,160
還有呢
What else?

672
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,430
我現在為什么還要保護你
Why I'm still protecting you at this point...

673
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,840
我自己都不明白
I don't even understand myself.

674
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,980
沃克打算保持沉默
Walker's gonna plead the Fifth.

675
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,880
羅梅洛也不會折騰
And Romero won't rock the boat.

676
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,860
多謝了  馬克
Thank you, Mark, I appreciate that.

677
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,240
我建議你安排新聞發布會
I would suggest you schedule a press conference

678
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,640
就在聽證會之后
for right after the hearing.

679
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,770
好
All right.

680
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,120
告訴我你做過的最惡劣的事
Tell me the worst thing you've ever done.

681
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,340
不好選
It's hard to pick.

682
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,500
-我說真的  -我也是
- I'm serious. - So am I.

683
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,000
假裝愛一個我并不愛的人
Pretended to love someone when I didn't.

684
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,680
可以說  那是最糟的
In a way, that was the worst.

685
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,330
那人知道嗎
Did the person know?

686
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,240
她假裝不知道
She pretended not to know...

687
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,220
但她知道
but she knew.

688
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,210
她很難受
It was awful for her.

689
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,180
但我為那個錯誤付出了代價
But I paid for that mistake, too.

690
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,650
那種事  會傷害一個人
Those types of things, they take a toll.

691
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,050
真是奇妙  有些選擇毫無意義
It's strange how some choices mean nothing

692
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,620
也有一些會決定你的余生
and others govern the rest of your life.

693
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,470
我做過一些可怕的事
I've done some terrible things.

694
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,900
你不用告訴我
You don't have to tell me.

695
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,950
弗蘭西斯殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
Francis killed Zoe Barnes.

696
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,940
克萊爾
Claire.

697
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,830
弗蘭西斯殺了彼得
Francis killed Peter.

698
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,740
別說了
Stop.

699
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,750
還會再死許多人
And so many more are gonna die.

700
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,830
別說了
Stop.

701
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,130
我不怕你
You don't scare me.

702
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,640
你該怕
I should.

703
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,600
艾丹
Aidan.

704
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,110
我不叫艾丹了
Not anymore.

705
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,470
你怎么到這兒來的
How did you get here?

706
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,740
有扇門開了  我就出來了
A door opened, I walked out.

707
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,440
聽著不太對勁
That doesn't sound right.

708
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,530
我拿到了簽證  和今晚的機票  我只是
I got a visa and a flight tonight. I just...

709
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,710
我只是想最后再來看看你
I just wanted to see you one last time.

710
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,670
等等  誰要送你走
Wait. Who's getting you out?

711
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,960
無所謂了
That doesn't matter.

712
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,010
-你說什么了  -其實什么都沒說
- What did you say? - Honestly, nothing.

713
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,060
我們必須和安德伍德夫婦談談
We have to talk to the Underwoods.

714
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,950
-還是算了吧  -這根本說不通
- Nah, I don't think so. - This does not make sense.

715
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,990
你總是喜歡開好車
Well, you always liked to drive a nice car.

716
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,030
艾丹  跟我來吧  我來解決
Aidan, come with me. I'll fix this.

717
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,400
我還想讓你跟我走呢  我也給你備了條出路
You come with me. I've a way for you to get out.

718
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,580
那好吧
Well, all right, then.

719
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,940
等到明天早上再告訴別人你見到了我
Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me until the morning.

720
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,080
我為什么還要告訴別人我見到了你
Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?

721
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,190
不是吧
Really?

722
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,030
等等
Wait.

723
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,190
-給  拿上這個  -不行
- Here, take this. - No.

724
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,920
拿著  至少上飛機之前要拿著  好嗎
Come on. At least until you get on the flight, all right?

725
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,730
我撤了
I'm out.

726
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,690
睡不著
Can't sleep?

727
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,870
外面這么冷  你該披上外套
It's freezing out here. You should have a coat on.

728
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,130
我喜歡
I like it.

729
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,820
別去見沃克
Don't meet with Walker.

730
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,940
我覺得這不是個好主意
I think it's a bad idea.

731
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,840
這會提醒他  他最好該怎么做
It'll remind him of his best course of action.

732
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,420
你錯了  我很抱歉  但是你錯了
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

733
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
厄舍已經打點好了
Usher has it under control.

734
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,800
你總是想做什么就做什么
You always do what you want.

735
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,780
湯姆不想走
Tom doesn't want to leave.

736
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,360
湯姆沒資格選
Tom doesn't get to choose.

737
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,950
外面冷  你進去吧
It's cold. You should go in.

738
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,720
能麻煩你把道格·斯坦普過去三年
If you could get me Doug Stamper's addresses

739
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,070
住過的所有地址給我...
for the last three years...

740
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,320
你知道瑞秋和麗薩的照片條
And do you know what happened to the photo strip

741
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,680
去哪了嗎
of Rachel and Lisa?

742
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,640
不見了
It's gone.

743
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,650
我們得自己表明我們的立場
We need to lay out our positions ourselves.

744
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,130
我已經在去紐約的路上了
I'm already on my way to New York.

745
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,990
我不希望你說或者做什么
I don't want you to say or do anything

746
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,290
讓你感到不舒服的事
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

747
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,340
我不會和政府立場相左的  我不希望這樣
I won't contradict the administration. That's not my wish.

748
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,340
我們需要劃下紅線
We need to draw a line in the sand.

749
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,320
當然  我還上飛機嗎
Yes, of course. Should I get on my flight?

750
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,390
我覺得你最好還是調頭回來吧
I think it might be best if you turn around and come back.

751
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,230
聽你的
Whatever you think.

752
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,990
就讓沃克保持沉默吧
We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.

753
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,090
然后我們再碰頭協調立場
Then we'll regroup and make sure we're on the same page.

754
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,740
好吧  調頭回去吧
Okay. We need to head back.

755
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,100
"當心糾纏不清的聯盟"  總統先生
"Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.

756
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,980
通常都認為這句話出自華盛頓
You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington,

757
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,280
但其實是杰斐遜說的
but it was actually Jefferson who said it.

758
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,050
總之我想先來見見你
Anyway, I wanted to catch you before,

759
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,310
趕在馬克和你的律師來之前
Mark and your lawyer got here.

760
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,530
總統先生
Mr. President.

761
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,840
我知道這對你并不輕松
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

762
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,230
其實一個人的適應能力幾乎不可限量
Well, the truth is, one can get used to almost anything.

763
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,690
總之  恭喜你
Well, at any rate, congratulations.

764
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,730
你就要擔任國內
You're about to become the chancellor

765
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,360
頂尖大學的校長了
of one of our finest universities.

766
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,860
我們為名譽付出的代價高昂
It's a high price we pay for respectability.

767
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,480
總之  我就是來打個招呼
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello.

768
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,690
并且感謝你所做的一切
And to thank you for all you're doing.

769
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,650
用不了多久
In not too long,

770
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,170
你就會和那些前總統一樣
you're going to become one of those ex-presidents

771
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,200
你的成就會讓大家
whose work will make everyone...

772
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,840
忘記過去
forget the past.

773
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,410
我也曾是美國總統
I was once the President of the United States.

774
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,160
沒錯  你的確是
Yes, you were.

775
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,740
然后總統之位被你偷走了  弗蘭克
You stole the presidency, Frank.

776
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,870
別這么說  加勒特
Now, Garrett...

777
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,550
都是好久以前的事了
This is ancient history,

778
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,580
但以現代政治的標準來看
but by modern political standards,

779
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,820
我是以壓倒性優勢當選的
my election was a landslide.

780
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,470
我原本打算改變這個國家
I was gonna change this country.

781
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:58,050
但后來  發生了一些事
But then... uh, things happen.

782
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,330
人們說謊
People lie...

783
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,680
為與他們同步你只好也撒謊
You lie to keep up.

784
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,670
你一直以來被稱贊的優點
The things that you've been lauded for all your life,

785
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,460
突然都成了致命缺陷
those are suddenly fatal flaws.

786
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,770
曾經和你風雨同舟的人
People who've been with you through thick and thin,

787
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,630
你以為永遠不會辜負你的人  還是辜負你了
who you thought would never fail you, they fail you.

788
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,970
你會和討厭的人結成別扭的同盟
You make strange alliances with unsavory people.

789
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,050
當一切清晰起來時  已經太晚
And it all becomes clear way too late.

790
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,450
其他任何人都不會真正明白
And no one else truly understands.

791
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,870
除了就任過的人
Except someone who's been in the office...

792
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,660
你不能指望這個職位
You can't expect the office

793
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,210
能放大你的能力
to do anything more than what you bring to it.

794
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,380
-我這么做是為黨的利益  -我知道
- I'm doing this for the party. - I know.

795
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,610
這令人欽佩
And it's admirable.

796
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,460
特莉莎怎么樣
How's Tricia?

797
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,970
我們挺好  雖然花了些時間
Well, it's taken time, but we are good.

798
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,650
孩子們也都很好
The kids are doing well.

799
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,420
這只是開始
Well, this is just the beginning.

800
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,980
今后  你我會有更多的合作
You and I are gonna be working a lot more together from now on.

801
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,060
真的嗎
Is that so?

802
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,430
道格
Doug.

803
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,450
湯姆  今天上午很忙
Tom, it's a busy morning.

804
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,320
我現在不能提供任何引述
I don't have any quotes right now.

805
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,500
等你有時間  我想坐下來
When you have a moment, i'd like to sit down

806
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,800
問你幾個關于麗薩·威廉姆斯的問題
and ask you some questions about Lisa Williams.

807
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,230
不好意思  你在說什么
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

808
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,700
等你有時間  和我說一聲  道格
Let me know when you're free, Doug.

809
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,540
如果你想要一個聲明
If you'd like a statement,

810
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,550
賽斯·格雷森的辦公室很快會發一篇新聞稿
Seth Grayson's office will be issuing a press release shortly.

811
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,380
你住在杜邦環島附近  對吧
You live near Dupont Circle, don't you?

812
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,030
我可以正式宣稱  是的  我住那附近
I will go on the record and say yes, I do.

813
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,700
沃克總統
President Walker,

814
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,390
希瑟·鄧巴的
it's been established in

815
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,190
特別檢察官報告中明確稱
Heather Dunbar's special prosecutor's report

816
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:25,870
我們有理由...
that we have reason to--

817
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,090
議員  我已向主席
Congressman, as I mentioned to the chair

818
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,360
和委員會的其他成員提過
and the other distinguished members of the committee,

819
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,080
我建議我的委托人
I am advising my client

820
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,880
目前對關于他就任美國總統期間的所有問題
to plead the Fifth at this time for all questions regarding his tenure

821
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,320
行使第五修正案的權利
as President of the United States of America.

822
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,420
同為民主黨人  我得說
I must say, uh, that as a fellow Democrat,

823
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,480
這很不尋常
this is highly irregular.

824
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,800
是的  議員  的確
Yes, Congressman, yes.

825
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,290
但鑒于目前進行的調查...
But in light of ongoing investigations--

826
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,570
其實  我愿意回答議員的問題
Actually, I will answer the congressman's questions.

827
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,360
請提問吧
Please, ask your question.

828
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,640
你任總統期間
Under your administration,

829
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,450
有來自中國商人的數百萬美元資金
millions of dollars were illegally laundered

830
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,320
經非法洗錢  影響了美國大選
from Chinese businessmen to affect American elections.

831
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,990
是真的嗎
Is this true?

832
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,550
對  是真的
Yes. That's true.

833
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,970
你能否告訴我們
And can you tell us what, if any,

834
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,720
時任副總統弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
was then Vice President Francis Underwood's

835
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,750
在其中的參與情況  如果有的話
involvement in this scheme?

836
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,500
他似乎是其中一名總設計師
Well, it appeared to me, he was one of its chief architects.

837
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,880
你這話是什么意思  先生
And, uh, what exactly do you mean by that, sir?

838
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,630
那是他的主意
It was his idea.

839
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,830
馬克  你還是去別的地方吧
Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.

840
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,740
我們要對此采取回避態度嗎
Are we gonna bury our heads in the sand with this?

841
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,340
不是  你要離開
No, you're going to leave,

842
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,350
副總統和我來決定怎么做
and the vice president and I are going to decide what to do.

843
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,960
沃克食言了  我們說好了的
Walker reneged. We had a deal.

844
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,790
如果需要你  我們會告訴你的
We will let you know if you are needed.

845
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,890
-先生  -這不是請求
- Sir... - That was not a request.

846
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,080
你為什么非要去和他談
Why did you have to go talk to him?

847
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,700
一定會有出路的  弗蘭西斯
There has to be a way out, Francis.

848
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,850
是嗎  有嗎
Does there? Is there?

849
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,940
這就是我的總統任期嗎
Or is this my presidency?

850
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,300
永遠是攻擊目標
Forever with a target on my back.

851
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,900
被糾纏  被追捕
Haunted and hunted.

852
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,960
莉安  如果你聽到這個  說明我死了
LeAnn, if you're hearing this, it means that I'm dead.

854
00:54:38,900 --> 00:55:18,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}1958年以前  美國總統是沒有退休金的
所以杜魯門退休離開華盛頓時  生活極度窘迫
自己開著車回到老家密蘇里  買不起房子  只好去親戚家住
同年的《前總統法案》規定給退休總統發放等額于內閣部長工資的退休金
總統們的退休生活才有了基本保障  
克林頓退休時正當壯年  閑不住的他成立了克林頓基金會  到處做慈善
一度成為世界上最影響力的基金會之一
但在2016年大選中  克林頓基金會的募資受到了廣泛質疑
一些人指出  許多外國政府和團體可能是因為希拉里做了國務卿才會捐款

856
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:48,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}大小布什兩父子總統  退休后基本上都選擇了不問世事的隱居生活
兩個人都回到了德州  老布什落戶休斯頓  小布什選擇了達拉斯
老布什相對更活躍一些  會出席一些公開活動
任上毀多譽少的小布什則更加低調  除了一些必須參加的活動
更多把精力放在了為非洲做慈善  以及支持老兵權益的一些活動中  
為打發時間  他還開始學習繪畫  而且現在油畫作品頗有成就
2016年出版了一本畫冊  銷量非常好

858
00:55:48,900 --> 00:56:28,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}剛退休不到半年的奧巴馬  花了很多時間去歐洲和加勒比海度假
隨行的都是富商名流  出入都是噴氣飛機  豪華游艇
但豪華假日只是表象  奧巴馬的手下在華盛頓租了一間辦公室
同政府的現任官員聯系緊密
現總統特朗普遭遇一連串丑聞后  其支持者指責奧巴馬
在背后暗中支持反對特朗普的政治力量
按慣例退休總統都會離開華盛頓
但奧巴馬以想保證女兒讀完高中為由  退休后在華盛頓租了一間豪宅
不久前  媒體報道他出資八百萬美元把這棟豪宅買了下來
看來短期內他是不會離開美國的政治中心了
