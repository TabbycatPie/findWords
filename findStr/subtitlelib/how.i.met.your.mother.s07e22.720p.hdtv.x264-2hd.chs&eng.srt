老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第二十二集

10
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,990
<i>2012年5月  马修和莉莉</i>
<i>In May of 2012, Marshall and Lily</i>

11
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,190
<i>在家举办新生儿送礼会</i>
<i>hosted a baby shower in the apartment.</i>

12
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,850
<i>他们所有朋友都来了</i>
<i>All their friends were there.</i>

13
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,620
<i>我也确保自己准时在...</i>
<i>So of course I made sure to show up exactly...</i>

14
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,760
<i>3小时之后出现</i>
<i>...three hours late.</i>

15
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,680
-我来晚了吗  -有点
- Oh, no! Am I late? - Little bit.

16
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,270
对不起  我是想早点到的
Ah, I'm sorry, I would've gotten here earlier;

17
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,180
-只是...  -你不想碰见罗宾
- it's just, um... - You didn't want to see Robin.

18
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,480
我不想碰见罗宾
I didn't want to see Robin.

19
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,630
我知道这样很幼稚
I know, it's childish.

20
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,130
她现在不在吧
She's not here, is she?

21
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,470
其实...
Actually...

22
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,650
我来早了吗
Oh, no! Am I early?

23
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,160
有点
Little bit.

24
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,940
她送的是红色婴儿车
Whoa, she got you the red stroller?

25
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,670
看来我的车青出于"蓝"胜于"蓝"啊
Looks like I just blew her out of the water.

26
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,770
反正她在派对开始前就走了
Anyway, she left before the party started.

27
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,000
真是不好意思
Ah, I'm really sorry, I...

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,520
我只是觉得我和罗宾
I just think it's best if Robin and I

29
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,950
这阵子最好先不要见面
don't see each other for a while.

30
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,820
泰德  我无所谓
Ted, it's fine;

31
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,620
我在离异家庭中长大
I'm a child of divorce.

32
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,700
你们爱怎么吵就怎么吵
You guys keep fighting all you want,

33
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,200
只要贵重礼物不间断就好
as long as the expensive gifts keep coming.

34
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,940
送礼会怎么样
Uh, so how was the shower?

35
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,900
挺好的
It was good,

36
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,660
虽然巴尼的脱衣舞娘女友
although there was one weird moment

37
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,080
有一度害气氛变得很尴尬
with Barney's new stripper girlfriend.

38
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,130
一天50个
50 laps a day?

39
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,740
天啊  小姑娘  那可真是太多了
Oh, my goodness, young lady. That is a lot.

40
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,980
是吗
Oh, is it?

41
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,160
有很多吗  路易丝奶奶
Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,300
没错  我女朋友靠脱衣服
Yes, my girlfriend gets naked

43
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,080
坐在男人腿上跳舞挣钱
and sits on guys' laps for money.

44
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,520
没错  有时候一天她能坐50个大腿
And, yes, sometimes it's as many as 50 laps in one day.

45
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
也许社会会觉得她的工作
And maybe society considers what she does

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,820
很"恶心"
to be "disgusting,"

47
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,370
很"淫荡"
or "sutty,"

48
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,390
跟"做鸡"没区别
or verging on "prostitution,"

49
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,350
或就是"做鸡"
or actual "prostitution."

50
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,880
但我接受她
But you know what, I accept her.

51
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,320
如果你不能接受她
And if you can't do the same,

52
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,220
那我真为你感到羞耻
well, then shame on you.

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,790
为你
Shame...

54
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,630
感到
on...

55
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,520
羞耻
you.

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,670
我们其实在说游泳
We were, um, talking about swimming.

57
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,130
说我一天能游50个来回
How I sometimes swim 50 laps a day.

58
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,720
挺好的有氧运动啊
Well, it's great cardio.

59
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,870
奶奶  我帮您加点香槟吧
Lois, can I top off your champagne?

60
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,020
说来也好笑
You know, it's funny,

61
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,390
你告诉普通男人  你和脱衣舞女约会
you tell the average guy you're dating a stripper,

62
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,750
他会觉得超级棒
he thinks it's awesome.

63
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,200
你告诉妈妈  她会兴奋地跟你击掌
Heck, you tell your mom, she high-fives you so fast,

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
甚至连烤箱手套都来不及摘
she doesn't even take off her oven mitts.

65
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,730
个中滋味若有人懂
But if they had any idea how difficult it is:

66
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,000
醋海里翻波  不安里浮沉
the jealousy, the insecurity,

67
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,830
连击掌都变成慰问击掌
those high-fives would be high-fives of condolence.

68
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,650
巴尼  根本没有所谓的慰问击掌
Barney, condolence high-fives are not a thing.

69
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,900
当然有
They're a thing.

70
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,030
当天早些时候...

71
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,390
不好意思  我们不得不辞退你
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go.

72
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,090
来  击掌
Up top.

73
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,950
别光听我说我这些无聊的情侣问题了
Ah, listen to me and my boring couples' problems.

74
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,210
你怎么样
How are you?

75
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,550
单身生活过得好吗
How's the single life?

76
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,790
没什么感觉  自从罗宾这事后
I wouldn't know. After this whole Robin thing,

77
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,880
目前的我  比较低调
for the time being, I'm laying low.

78
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,070
你是说...
Laying low as in

79
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,310
标准低到跟很矮的妞上床吗
sleeping with a really short chick?

80
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,040
你们有玩39式吗
You guys doing 39?

81
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,130
我是说我没出去约会
I mean, I'm not seeing anyone.

82
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,580
我要努力忘记罗宾
I'm just, you know, trying to get Robin out of my head.

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,750
你该"换换口味"
You need a palate cleanser.

84
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,040
巴尼  求你了  千万别撮合
Barney, please, don't try to set me up

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
我和昆茵的脱衣舞女同事
with Quinn's stripper friends.

86
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,150
我才不会呢
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

87
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,540
为什么不  我暗示得还不够多吗
Why not, how many hints do I have to drop?!

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,520
不是  我想的是比较传统的方式
No, I'm thinking of something much more traditional.

89
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,180
-如网络交友  -不用了  谢谢
- Online dating. - Yeah, no thanks.

90
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,460
拜托  泰德  都2012了
Come on, Ted! It's 2012.

91
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,240
你还指望在书店看报纸的时候
What do you expect, to meet some cute travel agent

92
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,880
邂逅漂亮的旅游中介吗
when you're reading a newspaper at a bookstore?

93
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
现在没这种事了
None of those things exist anymore.

94
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,040
巴尼  我是绝对不可能
Barney, I will never, ever, ever,

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,620
去尝试网络交友的
try online dating.

<i>那天晚上我试了网络交友</i>

105
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,590

Did you really think you could start dating online,

可这个女孩  她是...

靠  马修因为宝宝的到来神经紧张
Man, Marshall's really stressing out about this baby.

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,700
他读各种孕妇书
He's reading every book,

141
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
看哺乳记录片
watching breast-feeding documentaries.

142
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,620
某天早上我醒来  他把我裹的像个婴儿
I woke up the other day, he had swaddled me.

143
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,560
虽然那确实是几个月来  我睡的最香的一觉
Sure, it was the best night's sleep I had had in months,

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,670
但还是...
but still...

145
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,950
你知道他现在又搞什么吗
You know what his latest thing is?

146
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,830
什么鬼东西在响
What the hell is that?

147
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,600
马修  你搞什么啊
Marshall, what is that?

148
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,550
我定了闹铃  每3小时响一次
I rigged this alarm to go off every three hours.

149

Now, if you'll excuse me,

152
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,990
我要哄我的演练宝宝睡觉了
I have a practice-baby to soothe.

153
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,530
你得跟他谈谈
You got to talk to him.

154
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,910
好吧  我晚上跟他说
Yeah, I'll talk to him tonight.

155
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,470
还是明早再说吧
Maybe tomorrow morning.

156
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,400
-还想再被裹一晚吗  -真的睡得好香
- One last swaddle? - It's just so cozy.

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,640
感觉像睡在热乎乎的墨西哥卷饼里
It's like sleeping in a warm burrito.

158
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,190
<i>与此同时  巴尼准备面对</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Barney was about to have</i>

159
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,480
<i>脱衣舞女男友的最糟的噩梦</i>
<i>a stripper's boyfriend's worst nightmare.</i>

160
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,540
卡玛
Karma?

161
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,890
天啊  你的腿没绕到脖子后面
Oh, my gosh, I didn't recognize you

162
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,350
我都没认出来是你
without your legs behind your head.

163
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,650
达瑞尔  你没穿那件难看的风衣
Darryl, I didn't recognize you

164
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,160
我也没认出来是你
without your creepy trench coat.

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,950
你怎么样
How are you?

166
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,170
-挺好的  你明天上班吗  -你知道的
- Great, you working tomorrow? - You know it.

167
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,830
那就好  明天我一定穿戴好装备去
Great. I'll be there with bells on.

168
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,310
装备就是超薄运动裤
And by bells, I mean super thin sweatpants.

169
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,800
真恶心
Gross.

170
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,260
他这个人其实挺好的
He's actually a nice guy.

171
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,780
虽然当副市长很忙
he's so busy as deputy mayor,

172
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,750
但总记得在我生日送卡片
but I always get a card on my birthday.

173
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,330
昆茵  我爱你是个脱衣舞女
Quinn, I love the fact that you're a stripper,

174
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,780
但同时  我又很你是个脱衣舞女
but I hate the fact that you're a stripper.

175
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,540
巴尼  我喜欢我的工作
Barney, I like my job.

176
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,670
我不需要被谁拯救
And I do not need to be rescued.

177
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,470
所以  别当我的英雄
So, don't be that guy.

178
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,910
你说得对  你说得对
You're right, you're right.

179
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,540
我明白  当我没说过
I got it. Forget I said anything.

180
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,640
晚上去捧你的场  卡玛
I'll see you tonight, Karma.

181
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,960
没问题  淫贱拉里
You got it, Dirty Larry.

182
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,630
你必须辞了这个工作
You have to quit your job!

183
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,090
<i>那晚  我和巴尼挑的第一个女孩约会</i>
<i>That night, I went out with the first girl Barnrn picked for me.</i>

184
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,670
<i>只是有个问题</i>
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

185
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,400
你叫罗宾
Your name is Robin?

186
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,570
对  后鼻音
Yeah, with a Y.

187
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,040
是朗宾啊
Oh, Yobin.

188
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,020
不  是罗冰
No, Robyn.

189
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,770
我的网上资料写着"威士忌与枪支"
I go by scotch and gun lover in my online profile,

190
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,740
那是因为我最喜欢这两样东西
'cause those are my two favorite things.

191
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,140
还有就是加拿大  我的家乡和祖国
Well, next to Canada, my home and native land.

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,210
加拿大
Oh. Canada.

193
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,790
<i>就这样</i>
<i>And just like that,</i>

194
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,410
<i>罗冰成了罗宾</i>
<i>Robyn became Robin.</i>

195
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,990
近来好吗  泰德
How's it going, Ted?

196
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,900
太好了
Oh, good.

197
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,450
瞧  你老妈舍得从酒吧回来了
Hey, look, mommy's back from the bar!

198
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,930
老爸终于可以去洗澡了
Now I can finally take a shower.

199
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,760
这尿布真臭
This diaper smells.

200
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,370
别告诉我怎么弄的
I don't want to know.

201
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,030
好了  马修
Okay, Marshall,

202
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,230
快坐下  我们得谈谈
sit down; we need to talk.

203
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,690
听着  我知道你也是一片好心
Look, I know you mean well,

204
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,230
可我们离预产期还有五周
but we have five weeks till the due date.

205
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,130
我们不能利用这段时间放松下吗
Can't we use this time to just relax?

206
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,060
等宝宝出生后
We'll figure out how all this stuff

207
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,990
这些事情自然就懂了嘛
works after the baby comes.

208
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,430
等宝宝出生后
After the baby comes?

209
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,250
对  我们可以边做边学
Yeah, we'll learn on the job.

210
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,820
边做边...真逗
Learn on the j... Huh.

211
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,690
莉莉
Wow, you know, Lily,

212
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,580
或许现在的燃眉之急
maybe the crisis here

213
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,600
不是我没准备好当爹
isn't that I'm not ready to be a dad;

214
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,750
而是你没准备好当妈
maybe it's that you're not ready to be a mom!

215
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,800
-你说什么  -对
- Excuse me?! - Yeah.

216
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,590
<i>就这样  他俩吵了起来</i>
<i>With that, an argument began,</i>

217
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,470
<i>个中细节至今仍存在很大的争议</i>
<i>the details of which are still hotly debated to this day.</i>

218
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,960
<i>比如说  马修叔叔发誓说绝没说过这句</i>
<i>For instance, Uncle Marshall swears he never said:</i>

219
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,090
-我是唯一为这孩子做出牺牲的人  -什么
- I'm the only one making sacrifices for this baby! - What?!

220
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,170
<i>同时他也声称自己所说  句句属实</i>
<i>And he claims he never actually altered the words:</i>

221
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,190
你就像连自己怀孕了都不知道一样
It's like you don't even know that you're pregnant!

222
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,620
<i>同时  莉莉坚称这一段被夸大其词</i>
<i>While Lily insists this part was exaggerated:</i>

223
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,700
宝宝很好弄
Baby's are easy;

224
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,830
只要看着他们买萌  然后喂意大利面就好了
you just watch them be cute and feed them spaghetti!

225
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,460
<i>不过大家都对收场意见一致</i>
<i>But everyone agrees this is how the argument ended:</i>

226
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,080
马修  我要的不过是一点点清静
Marshall, what I need now is some peace, some quiet,

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,040
不过现在我要的是  吃点意大利面
and now that it's out there, some spaghetti.

228
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,890
帮忙拉我起来  好让我夺门而出
Now, please help me off the couch so I can storm out.

229
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,660
<i>第二天  我告诉巴尼我的约会经过</i>
<i>The next day, I filled Barney in on my date.</i>

230
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,040
朗宾
Oh, Yobin.

231
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,930
不  是罗冰
No, Robyn.

232
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,320
而之后的整晚
And for the rest of the night,

233
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,470
只要我一看她  就会想到罗宾
every time I looked at her, I just saw Robin's face.

234
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,240
-那是应该的啊  -不  是我们的罗宾
- Well, I should hope so. - No, our Robin.

235
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,380
有个I[眼睛]
Robin with an I.

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,840
I和eye[眼睛]同音

237
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,840
我们的罗宾有两只眼睛  朋友
Uh, our Robin has two eyes, my friend.

238
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,790
不过也不错  你已经开始忘记她的长相了
But that's good. You're forgetting what she looks like.

239
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,190
我理解  这过程一定很艰难
I'm sorry, that must have been tough.

240
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,580
如果有人能感同身受  那一定是我
If anyone knows what that feels like, it's me.

241
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,490
请接受我的慰问
My condolence.

242
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,900
好了  向前看吧
Okay. Moving on.

243
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,750
下一个女孩  味道大不同
The next girl: perfect palate cleanser.

244
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,270
和罗宾完全不同
Nothing like Robin.

245
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,550
怎么个不同
How nothing?

246
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
我放眼望向世界
I gaze out into the world and all I see

247
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,690
只看到葬送梦想的冰冷之地
is an icy place where dreams die.

248
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,820
哇  千层面
Ooh, lasagna.

249
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,490
近来好吗  泰德
How's it going, Ted?

250
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,120
什么  不  怎么会这样
What? No. What? Wh-Why?

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,050
记得吗  我有次做了千层面
Remember, I made lasagna that one time.

252
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,340
这样你就来啦
That's all it takes?

253
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,030
那都算不上千层面  你是往做坏的犹太面上
It wasn't even lasagna; you took your botched kugle

254
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,560
倒了番茄酱
and poured tomato sauce on it.

255
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,740
我可没说那千层面做得好
I didn't say it was good lasagna.

256
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,720
对了  你没事干嘛勾搭这种女的呢
By the way, what are you doing with this girl?

257
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,700
手臂上满是纹身  而且...
With tattoos all up and down her arms and...

258
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,990
其他地方也不放过
everywhere else.

259
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,590
瞧啊  我的妈呀
Hello... good gravy.

260
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,790
那条龙尾巴是不是一直延伸到她的...
Does that dragons tail go all the way down to her...

261
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,130
没错  我猜对了
Ohh, yes, it does.

262
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,360
你还想我怎么样  罗宾
Well, what do you want me to do, Robin?

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,050
我总得设法忘掉你
I have to get over you somehow,

264
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,980
而且如果非得这样...
and if this is what it takes...

265
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
你没事吧
Are you okay?

266
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,400
没事  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

267
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,840
你有点魂不守舍
You kind of spaced out there.

268
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,340
怪胎
Weirdo.

269
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,760
"所以  总的来说
"So, in summation,

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,510
我非常非常抱歉"
I'm very, very sorry."

271
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,710
"我猜我只是太想独占你
"I guess I just wanted you all to myself,

272
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,990
而我想到这些怪人打量你的..."
and then I thought of all the creepy guys groping at your..."

273
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,470
"好吧  我又要生气了
"Okay, I'm getting mad again,

274
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,800
所以我在此搁笔了"
so I'm going to stop writing now."

275
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,540
"请享用这些巧克力  可能含花生[鸡鸡]哟"
"Please enjoy these chocolates, may contain peanuts."

276
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,540
peanuts与penis谐音

277
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,890
亲一个就和好吧
Kiss and make up?

278
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,930
在窗前打一炮就和好吧
Have sex up against the window and make up?

279
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,680
你这里风景还真不错
You do have a great view.

280
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,910
你这么说还真有意思
Well, funny you should mention that.

281
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,350
因为这是你的风景
It's your view.

282
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,050
兄台  再说一次
Come again for Big Fudge?

283
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,400
恭喜你  你被录用了
Congratulations. You're hired.

284
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,230
你是巨人国家银行
You are Goliath National Bank's

285
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,240
新任执行战略协调员
newest executive strategy coordinator.

286
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,110
执行战略协调员是什么啊
What is an executive strategy coordinator?

287
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,070
是几个感觉跟企业有关的词
It's three corporate-sounding words

288
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,460
合起来造就的一个假职位
which, when added together, equal a fake job

289
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,760
但你可以得到一份实打实的薪水
for which you get a real paycheck

290
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,180
和你做脱衣舞娘赚的钱一样多呢
in the amount of exactly what you'd make stripping.

291
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,230
还有牙科保险  不客气
Plus dental. You're welcs.

292
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,600
现在该靠窗打炮了...
Now, about that up-against-the-window sex...

293
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
兄台  我不想在银行工作
Dude, I don't want to work for a bank.

294
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,150
为什么
Why not?

295
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,080
因为我不是无下限的
Because I have standards.

296
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,690
你们这些人就是妓女
You people are whores.

297
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,650
为了钱  任人摆布
The things you're willing to do just for some money,

298
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,190
不知廉耻
it's shameful.

299
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,540
你可是在脱衣舞厅工作呢
You work in a strip club.

300
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,740
对  我喜欢我的工作
Yeah, and I like it.

301
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,220
而且我是行内高手
And I'm good at it.

302
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,040
巴尼
Barney,

303
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,940
如果我接受这份工作  那我就成了你的人
if I took this job, you would own me.

304
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,920
我将得乖乖步入牢笼
I would be willingly stepping into a cage,

305
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,730
这不是我想要的生活
which is something I don't do.

306
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,640
除了周四
Except on Thursdays,

307
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,200
"情欲小野猫"的牢笼夜
when it's cage night at the Lusty Leopard,

308
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,390
可那是个纸板箱牢笼
but that's a cardboard cage,

309
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,510
我随时都可以出笼
and I can get out of it any time I want.

310
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,860
是吗
You can?

311
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,060
牢笼夜的惊险都被你拆穿了
Wow, thanks for ruining cage night.

312
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,700
-别这样  昆茵  -不
- Come on, Quinn. - No.

313
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,690
-我不会...  -不
- I wouldn't... - Nope.

314
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,140
别说了
Don't.

315
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,160
我想要回去好好想想
I think I have some thinking to do.

316
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,550
我...
I...

317
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,120
斯丁森先生
Mr. Stinson?

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,180
现在我是不是不用离职了
Does this mean I get to keep my job?

319
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,230
对  赫姆  你可以留下
Yeah, Herm, you can stay.

320
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,490
宝贝  听着
Hey, baby, listen.

321
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,280
我很抱歉  我刚才太激动了
I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.

322
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,580
没关系
Oh, that's okay.

323
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,570
说实在的  或许错在我
To be fair, maybe I'm at fault

324
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,900
太爱我们的孩子了
for loving our child too much,

325
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,100
尽管这就是为人父母的定义  所以...
although that is the definition of parenting, so...

326
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,600
好吧  算和好了吧
All right, good make up.

327
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,140
听着  我刚才上网
Hey, listen, I went online,

328
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,270
发现了一个"宝宝训练营"
and I found this Baby Boot Camp thing

329
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,880
这周末会在帕拉默斯的一家酒店举办培训
that they're doing at a hotel in Paramus this weekend.

330
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,350
"宝宝训练营"
Baby Boot Camp?

331
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,350
听起来不错
That sounds great.

332
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,420
是啊  这是个两天的项目
Yeah, it's a two-day event...

333
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,230
我们要去
We're going.

334
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,610
...还有很多研讨会和课程
...and there's lots of seminars and classes.

335
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,880
咱们一定要参加
You've already made the sale.

336
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,130
我已经给我们俩报了名
Anyway, I signed us up.

337
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,260
完全听不进去  我的心已经开始打包行李了
Not even listening anymore; mentally packing.

338
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,020
我在想绕过收费口去帕拉默斯的
I'm trying to figure out the best way to get to Paramus

339
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,150
最佳路线
without hitting any tolls.

340
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,830
这训练营一定很棒
This is gonna be great.

341
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,720
那就是我最后一次
And that was the last time

342
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,590
和留胡子的人约会
I'll ever go out with a guy with a mustache.

343
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,980
这次不错
This is good.

344
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,450
不错  我没在想那个谁
This is nice, not thinking about you-know-who.

345
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,210
只陶醉其中
Just having a good time

346
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
感谢上帝  我没留胡子
and thanking God I didn't grow that mustache.

347
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,050
而你
And you,

348
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,070
你真有礼貌
you're so polite.

我的前未婚夫  韦恩  他一点礼貌都没
My ex-fiancé, Wayne, he had no manners.

350
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,620
韦恩没礼貌
Wayne had no manners.

351
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,530
韦恩...礼貌...
Wayne... manners...

352
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,640
韦恩庄园  布鲁斯・韦恩的家

在夜晚会在穿上"神奇小子"彩色制服
who at night would don the colorful vestments

356
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,460
人们又叫他为

357
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,070
"罗宾"
Robin.

358
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,060
你喝一口饮料能编这么多啊  泰德
Holy long walk for a short drink of water, Ted.

359
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,830
闭嘴
Stop this.

360
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,240
我要你离开我的世界
I need you out of my life for real.

361
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,510
-你才不要呢  -我就要
- You don't mean that. - Yes, I do.

362
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,700
不  你不要
No, you don't.

363
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,590
泰德  今非昔比啊
Look how much is changing right now.

364

你的整个世界  发生了翻天覆地的变化
With your whole world turning upside down,

367
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,430
你难道不想死死守住
isn't a friendship like this one

368
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,160
我们这样的一段友谊吗
something you want to hold on to as tightly as possible?

369
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,830
每看你一眼  我的心就多痛一分
And every time I look at you, it hurts.

370
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,750
这就是我唯一一次的当拉拉的经历
...and that's the story of my only lesbian experience.

371
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,790
抱歉  细节部分说太多了
I'm sorry for going into so much detail.

372
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,930
我以后再也不讲这事了
I'll never tell that story again.

373
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,850
对了  饭菜还合胃口吗
Anyway, how's your meal?

374
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,910
霍莉  听我说  或许我该坦白
Holly, listen, I should probably tell you,

375
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,780
其实  我对某人仍余情未了
um, I'm kind of getting over someone right now.

376
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,620
很高兴听到你这么说
I am so glad you said that.

377
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,070
我对韦恩也还念念不忘
I guess I'm still getting over Wayne.

378
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,150
要走出一段感情实在太难
It's been really hard.

379
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,430
两位要来份果汁冰糕吗
Can I interest you in some sorbet?

380
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,210
你俩看起来都该"换换口味"了
You two look like you could both use a palate cleanser.

381
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,840
我这顿饭菜合你胃口吗  泰德
How's your palate, Ted?

382
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,750
焕然一新
Pretty cleansed.

383
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,610
在研讨会上
You know, at this seminar,

384
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,070
将会有某位自许"育儿专家"的人
there's gonna be the one guy who's, like, Mr. Parenting Expert,

385
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,430
时不时用自己的"重要观点"  打断讲师的话
keeps interrupting the speakers with his own "important facts."

386
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,510
而那个人  就坐在你旁边
And you're gonna be sitting right next to him,

387
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,660
准备大开眼界吧
so get ready for that.

388
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,770
亲爱的  你最近有点睡眠不足
Baby, you've been a little sleep deprived lately.

389
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,140
不如让我开车吧
Why don't you let me drive?

390
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,430
这个主意倒是不坏
You know what, that's not such a bad idea.

391
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,120
可我们都不希望看到
I mean, the last thing we want is

392
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,400
我一坐上驾驶座就...
for me to get behind the wheel and just...

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,050
亲爱的  你可真香
Oh, baby, you smell good.

394
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,350
等我们到了酒店
When we get to that hotel,

395
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,650
我要与你颠鸾倒凤  缠绵不休
I'm gonna wear your pregnant belly like a hat.

396
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,260
那你可得先把我灌醉哟
You'll have to buy me a couple of cocktails first.

397
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,750
巴  巴尼
Bar-Barney!

398
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,910
我们这是在哪儿
Where are we?

399
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,050
大西洋城啊  宝贝
Atlantic City, baby!

400
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,110
其实还有14英里才到
Well, in 14 miles.

401
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,610
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

402
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,030
莉莉人呢
And where is Lily?

403
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,850
你对我的"演练宝宝"做了什么
And what did you do to the practice baby?

404
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,050
宝宝还有剩吗
And is there any left?

405
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,460
莉莉很担心你
Lily was worried about you.

406
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,060
她认为你该放松一下  所以...
She thought you needed to unwind, so...

407
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,040
我们都不希望看到
I mean, the last thing we want is for me to

408
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,170
我一坐上驾驶座就...
get behind the wheel and just...

409
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,000
她在棕榈泉订了两间豪华套房
She made reservations for two deluxe rooms,

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,560
按摩  还有晚餐
massages, and dinner at the Palm,

411
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,360
作为交换  我烤了饼干给她
and in return, I made her cookies.

412
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,380
所以华尔道夫酒店的宝宝预热营是假的咯
So, there's no Baby Boot Camp at the Paramus Waldorf?

413
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,940
话说帕拉默斯有华尔道夫酒店吗
Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?

414
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,310
老弟
Bro...

415
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,390
莉莉这是要气死我呀
I am so mad at Lily right now.

416
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,370
她早料到你会这样
She knew you would be;

417
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,160
所以她准备了这个
that's why she packed this.

418
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,200
我的"气死莉莉"T恤
My Mad-at-Lily shirt.

419
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,300
这是我为我的
I had this made for me

420
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,560
高中女友史戴芙专门订做的衣服
and my high school girlfriend, Steph.

421
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,840
实际上  "马修和史戴芙  天长地久"
In reality, "Marshall and Steph 4-eva"

422
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,930
结果却成了
turned out to be

423
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,560
"马修和史戴芙  两天分手
"Marshall and Steph for two days

424
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,910
因为史戴芙的男友提前一周出了少管所"
until Steph's boyfriend got out of juvie a week early."

425
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,810
每次穿这个  莉莉都气得要死
Drives Lily crazy when I wear it.

426
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,940
希望没了我  她孤苦凄惨
I hope she's miserable without me.

427
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,590
泰德  最近如何啊
Hey, Ted, how's tricks?

428
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,200
相当不错  卢
Tricks are pretty good, Lou.

429
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,120
前几天遇到了点感情上的麻烦  不过
Had some girl trouble earlier in the week, but, uh,

430
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,560
我感觉从今往后  事情会越来越...
I got a feeling from here on out, things are gonna be A...

431
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,980
靠  你有完没完啊
O-Oh, you son of a bitch.

432
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,210
你好呀
Hello.

433
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,210
莉莉说得对
Lily's right.

434
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,740
我最近太不正常了
I've been acting crazy.

435
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,980
没关系  老弟
No, it's okay, bro.

436
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,490
我是说  你最近是有点不正常
I mean, yeah, you've been a little crazy,

437
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,930
可那都是因为爱
but it comes from love.

438
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,200
这种不正常  就和某男愿意
It's the same kind of crazy that makes a man

439
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,320
从政府援助金里拿出50万大洋
offer his stripper girlfriend over half a million dollars

440
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,670
付给他的脱衣舞娘女友
of government bailout money,

441
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,530
只要她别在男人的老二上蹭来蹭去一样
not to rub up on other guys' junk.

442
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,170
我们都是出于善意
It's good crazy.

443
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,410
希望莉莉没事
I hope Lily's okay.

444
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,940
够了  老弟
Okay, you know, that's it, bro.

445
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,900
我们俩都关掉手机一小时
We're both turning off our phones for one hour.

446
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,270
动议被否决
Motion denied.

447
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,990
好吧  你让我别无选择
Okay, you leave me no choice.

448
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,910
我提议  我们关机1小时享受兄弟时间
Proposal: you give me one hour of phone-free bro time,

449
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,630
在此期间我们  也就是你自己
during which we, and by we I mean you,

450
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,600
来个前无古人  后无来者的酩酊大醉
get magnificently, mythologically drunk.

451
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,170
我是指"醉得说话都得带字幕"的那种
I'm talking needing-subtitles- when-you-speak drunk.

452
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,920
如果你能做到
If you can give me that,

453
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,160
我就系上这个
I will wear this.

454
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,100
小鸭领带
The ducky tie?

455
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,780
我以为你早把它扔了呢
I thought you threw that thing away.

456
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,130
我是扔了
I did.

457
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,800
它自己回来了
It came back.

458
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,760
好吧  巴尼
All right, Barney,

459
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,530
你成功打动我了
you got yourself a deal.

460
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,050
不好意思  小姐
Um, excuse me, miss.

461
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,620
你有空的话
Um, when you get a chance,

462
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,630
能请你端来100杯龙舌兰酒吗
could you bring over a hundred shots of tequila, please?

463
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,520
也给我来一份
I'll have the same.

464
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,930
你为什么就不能放过我呢
Why are you still here?

465
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,820
你觉得呢
Why do you think I'm still here?

466
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,010
我猜是因为我还爱着你吧
I guess because I'm in love with you.

467
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,820
不然怎么会走到哪里  都能看到你的脸
Why else would I be seeing your face everywhere I look?

468
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,600
那是因为你心里难过
Because you feel bad.

469
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,890
我当然难过
Of course I feel bad.

470
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,340
我告诉你  我爱你
I told you I love you,

471
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,830
而显然
which is apparently

472
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,840
这是最不应该说出口的一句话
the worst thing you can say to someone.

473
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,740
这不是你难过的原因
That's not why you feel bad.

474
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,020
你难过是因为  你说了这句话
You feel bad because after you said it,

475
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,930
却还是放手让我走掉
you let me go away.

476
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,910
我明白我们的关系
I know our relationship

477
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,630
和你期望的不太一样
isn't exactly what you want it to be,

478
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,460
我也知道  或许我不如你爱我那般深
and I know I may not love you the way you love me,

479
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,790
但  我是爱你的
but I do love you.

480
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,240
这难道不值得死死守住吗
Isn't that worth hanging on to?

481
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,560
我好想你
I miss you.

482
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,730

Robin?

泰德
Ted.

486
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,750
能见到你真人太好了
It's good to really see you.

487
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,520
我是说  能见到你真太好了
I mean, it's really good to see you.

488
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,870
我们应该好好谈谈
Look, I think we need to talk.

489
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,110
我也这么想  可现在不是时候
Uh, me, too, but now's not a good time.

490
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,290
为什么
Why not?

491
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,170
为你骄傲  老弟
I am proud of you, bro.

492
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,440
你不但关机1小时
You turned off your phone for one hour,

493
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,770
还喝得酩酊大醉
and you got so drunk...

494
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,450
现在我说话都得挂上字幕

495
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,290
要的就是这效果
Exactly.

496
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,270
我说  巴尼

497
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,120
干嘛  马修
Yes, Marshall?

498
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,200
咱现在能把手机打开了不

499
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,370
当然可以
Well, I don't see why not.

500
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,730
哎哟  我有17条语音留言呢
Whoa! I've got 17 new voicemails.

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
巴尼  我是莉莉
Barney, it's Lily.

502
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,510
你俩最好赶紧滚回纽约
You guys need to get back to New York right away.

503
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,040
我快生了
I'm in labor.

504

We should do this every weekend.

513
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,630
这次是真的
Okay, this is real.

514
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,850
不是在玩狼来了
It's not a false alarm.

515
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,170
我真的要生了
This is real; I'm in labor.

516

我要你赶快回我电话
I kind of need you to call me back now.

517
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,680
你说你如此娇小
How does somebody so little

518
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,080
手指怎么会如此有力呢
have such strong fingers?

519
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,380
你在哪里
Where are you?

520
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,610
回我电话
Call me!

这位兄弟是帕拉默斯的华尔道夫酒店经理

你要是来帕拉默斯玩  我们罩着你
You come to Paramus, we will hook you up.

523
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,240
如果你是想要借机报复我
If you're trying to get back at me,

524
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,770
那你这招可真是他妈的大错特错了
you have chosen a wildly inappropriate way of doing so!

525
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,600
爽哉  美哉
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah.
