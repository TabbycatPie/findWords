1
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:16,885
<i>Formula One is a very</i>
<i>dangerous sport, and it will always be.</i>

2
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,925
<i>Incredibly,</i>
<i>both drivers were okay.</i>

3
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,885
<i> Safety is always</i>
<i>on the agenda in Formula One.</i>

4
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,405
<i>A lot of work has been done</i>
<i>behind the scenes.</i>

5
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,925
<i>But you see a lot of accidents now</i>

6
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,005
<i>where you don't necessarily expect drivers</i>
<i>to walk away.</i>

7
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:35,685
<i>Prior to twenty years ago,</i>
<i>they wouldn't necessarily have done so.</i>

8
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,485
<i>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief</i>

9
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,885
<i>when the Scot got out</i>
<i>relatively unscathed.</i>

10
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,845
<i>Amazingly, no one is seriously injured.</i>

11
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,845
<i> I'm okay, but, yeah, it was,</i>
<i>it was quite-- quite a big one.</i>

12
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,005
<i>Ayrton Senna was widely regarded</i>

13
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:15,205
<i>as one of, if not the greatest</i>
<i>racing driver that ever lived.</i>

14
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,925
<i>And when he was killed,</i>
<i>we hoped it would be the last fatality</i>

15
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,365
<i>we ever saw in Formula One.</i>

16
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,405
<i>But in 2014, we lost Jules Bianchi.</i>

17
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,725
Formula One driver,
Jules Bianchi, has died.

18
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:33,205
He left such a mark in the sport
and will be remembered forever.

19
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:35,725
He was very close to Ferrari.

20
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:39,045
Maybe he should drive
for Ferrari one day...

21
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,285
<i> This year,</i>
<i>his godson, Charles Leclerc,</i>

22
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>made his Formula One debut.</i>

23
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:52,525
<i>What Charles is doing</i>
<i>is a continuation of Jules' legacy.</i>

24
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:54,845
<i>Charles has a mission...</i>

25
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,565
<i>a mission to do</i>
<i>what Jules should have done.</i>

26
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,205
<i>My name is Beat Zehnder.</i>

27
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:37,525
I'm the team manager
of Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.

28
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,605
<i>We are based in Switzerland.</i>

29
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,845
<i>We're very punctual, very precise.</i>

30
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,805
<i>We're very honest, sometimes too honest.</i>

31
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:49,125
<i>Pretty sure if we would be</i>
<i>a little more dishonest,</i>

32
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:51,725
<i>probably we could have more success.</i>

33
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,285
<i>We are talent spotters.</i>

34
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,125
<i>Very successful drivers</i>
<i>started with Sauber.</i>

35
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,445
<i>Michael Schumacher.</i>

36
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:06,605
<i>Sebastian Vettel.</i>

37
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:12,445
<i>Then we had Kimi Räikkönen.</i>

38
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,005
<i>He's won the championship with Ferrari.</i>

39
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,485
<i>In total we've got something, like,</i>
<i>12 World Championship titles</i>

40
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,765
<i>from a driver which came from Sauber.</i>

41
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:29,885
<i>But last year we finished bottom</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship.</i>

42
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,045
<i>Over the last year,</i>
<i>we have improved a lot.</i>

43
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:39,485
<i>The difference is the involvement of Fred,</i>
<i>who restructured the company.</i>

44
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:44,685
<i>Fred is the boss.</i>

45
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:50,005
<i>He looks a bit grumpy from time to time,</i>
<i>but he's a very funny guy.</i>

46
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:55,685
<i>I am Frederic Vasseur.</i>
<i>I am the CEO and Team Principal of Sauber.</i>

47
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:59,645
<i>Two years ago, Sauber was in big trouble.</i>

48
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,005
<i>We have a fantastic wind tunnel,</i>

49
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,205
<i>which we didn't use</i>
<i>for two consecutive years</i>

50
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,845
<i>because we didn't even have</i>
<i>the money to pay the power.</i>

51
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,605
<i>And now we're back to good times again.</i>

52
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:15,005
<i>I think the last</i>
<i>six or eight months, we are improving.</i>

53
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,805
<i>But the next races</i>
<i>will be very important for Sauber.</i>

54
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:25,045
<i>And then we will see what are</i>
<i>the driver option for '19.</i>

55
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,845
<i>This year,</i>
<i>we've got two great drivers.</i>

56
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:34,045
I think the potential was there,
but it was just, uh... unfortunate.

57
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,365
<i> Marcus is five years</i>
<i>in Formula One.</i>

58
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,245
<i>He's a very hard worker</i>
<i>and he has improved a lot.</i>

59
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:46,645
But yeah, our race pace
was quite strong, actually.

60
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:51,045
<i>Charles, very young, very motivated.</i>

61
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,405
One of the biggest talents
I've ever worked with.

62
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,005
<i>He's 20 years old.</i>

63
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,805
<i>Probably one of the best newcomers</i>
<i>in the last two decades.</i>

64
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:03,165
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>Charles is achieving better results.</i>

65
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:06,085
<i>Of course, for Marcus,</i>
<i> it's a little hard to take.</i>

66
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,685
I drove there in 2010.

67
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:10,925
You drove there?

68
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,725
You were probably
in go-karts or something.

69
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,085
A kid.

70
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:16,245
What were you, ten years old?

71
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,685
No, I was twelve.

72
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,045
My name is Charles Leclerc

73
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,885
and I'm driving
for Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.

74
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,885
<i> I'm driving in Formula One</i>
<i>for the first time this year.</i>

75
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,085
<i>I am from Monaco.</i>

76
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:37,165
<i>I remember watching the Grand Prix</i>
<i>at four years old</i>

77
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:40,525
<i>in my best friend's apartment,</i>
<i>in the exit of the first corner.</i>

78
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,845
<i>And, yeah, I was always searching</i>
<i>for the Ferrari cars, to be honest.</i>

79
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,885
It's-- It's a childhood dream.

80
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:54,165
I've always dreamed
to be a part of Ferrari.

81
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:58,405
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>Ferrari is such a big thing.</i>

82
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:05,965
<i>You can't imagine to be one</i>
<i>of the two drivers that is in this team.</i>

83
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,725
<i>It's a team that is so mythical.</i>

84
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,125
<i>This will be the target next year.</i>

85
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:25,685
<i>Whether I will achieve it or not,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

86
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,205
<i>I always think the thing</i>
<i>that I just need to do</i>

87
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,965
<i>the best job possible in the car</i>
<i>and then the rest will come.</i>

88
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,445
Kimi Räikkönen!

89
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,605
Kimi! Kimi!

90
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:54,525
Kimi Räikkönen's had a glittering
and glorious career here at Ferrari.

91
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:57,565
<i>But, of course, he's no longer</i>
<i>the spring chicken he once was.</i>

92
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:01,285
Kimi, coming to you.
When will we know more about your future?

93
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:05,005
It's not up to me. Uh... that's about it.

94
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,085
Not my decision in the end so...

95
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:11,645
<i>For a long time,</i>
<i>people have expected Kimi to move on.</i>

96
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,205
If Kimi is on his way out...

97
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:16,245
that frees up one of
the most coveted seats in Formula One.

98
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:21,285
<i>Can Charles Leclerc be a Ferrari driver</i>
<i>after just one year in Formula One?</i>

99
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:25,405
Um... it's not normally
a decision Ferrari makes,

100
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:28,605
to go for youth,
and so it's pretty unlikely.

101
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,885
<i>I think we've had</i>
<i>an incredible first part of the season.</i>

102
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,885
<i>Leclerc is driving</i>
<i>a brilliant race</i>

103
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,165
<i>with so little experience in Formula One.</i>

104
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,045
The thing that's been really impressive
about Charles Leclerc

105
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,925
is that he went into a car
that wasn't all that competitive

106
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,885
at the start of the year.

107
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,085
<i>And he's been getting</i>
<i>the best out of it so regularly.</i>

108
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,045
Yes, yes, yes!

109
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,565
<i>Great race, Charles.</i>
<i>P-6 at the end. Fantastic drive. Good job.</i>

110
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,445
<i>Charles Leclerc around</i>
<i>the outside! Wow, look at that!</i>

111
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,685
And he's still so young.

112
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:04,845
<i> Ah, fuck!</i>

113
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,965
<i>Sorry. Sorry for the bad word.</i>

114
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,765
<i> One moment stands out for me,</i>

115
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:12,685
which was in Formula Two
when he got to Baku,

116
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,205
and he'd lost his father earlier
in the week.

117
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:20,125
<i>And we're talking literally</i>
<i>48 hours later, he was in the car.</i>

118
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:24,725
<i>He then went out, fell to last place,</i>
<i>fought his way through, and won the race.</i>

119
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:29,965
<i>This was a kid who'd just lost his father.</i>
<i>And he was a kid at the time.</i>

120
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,125
<i>He's a teenager.</i>

121
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:37,845
<i>To have that kind of mental strength,</i>
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

122
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:45,125
<i> Welcome to Round 13</i>
<i>of the Formula One world championship.</i>

123
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,365
<i>It is the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

124
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,565
<i>Radio check.</i>

125
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,365
<i>Radio check, Charles.</i>

126
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,485
<i>Copy. Loud and clear.</i>

127
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,205
<i>And it's locking up and a crash!</i>

128
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:17,205
<i>And Fernando Alonso goes over the top</i>
<i>there of Charles Leclerc's Sauber!</i>

129
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,165
<i>Whoa. An aerial accident there!</i>

130
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:45,405
<i>And Charles Leclerc makes his way</i>
<i>back to the pit.</i>

131
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:48,405
<i>He was an innocent bystander in that.</i>

132
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,485
<i>Leclerc, very well protected</i>

133
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,925
<i>from what could've been</i>
<i>a very nasty incident.</i>

134
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:10,805
<i>Formula One is a very</i>
<i>dangerous sport, and it will always be.</i>

135
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,605
<i>Crashes happen,</i>
<i>and they will always happen.</i>

136
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:18,525
Glad it's nice weather.
It wouldn't have been the same otherwise.

137
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>In Spa,</i>
<i>it was quite impressive</i>

138
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,125
<i>from the outside, from the images.</i>

139
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,485
<i>But inside the car,</i>
<i>it wasn't that big of a shock.</i>

140
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,365
<i>I just don't think about it</i>
<i>once I'm in the car.</i>

141
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,925
<i>Everything that is danger I forget it.</i>

142
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,365
A bit more difficult to put
than a Formula One suit.

143
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,925
At least we are warm.

144
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,405
<i> The situation I was in,</i>
<i>in the last three years</i>

145
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:49,645
<i>with the loss of my father</i>
<i>and my godfather, Jules,</i>

146
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,005
<i>it was very difficult to take,</i>

147
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,845
<i>and I think it has made me</i>
<i>a lot stronger as a person.</i>

148
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:23,565
<i>I remember Jules</i>
<i>coming to my first international race.</i>

149
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,925
<i>He gave me a lot of advice</i>
<i>through the years.</i>

150
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,565
<i>I've had some very good times with him.</i>

151
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:37,525
<i>He had proved himself,</i>
<i>and I think it was just a matter of time</i>

152
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,085
<i>of him being in Ferrari.</i>

153
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:50,045
<i>I can remember at the moment</i>
<i>of the crash of Jules.</i>

154
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:56,725
<i>And I could see in my father's eyes</i>
<i>that there was something wrong.</i>

155
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:03,405
<i>Towards the end of the race,</i>
<i>the conditions were very wet.</i>

156
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:08,205
<i>Lap 42, Sutil lost control on turn seven.</i>

157
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,005
<i>A recovery vehicle was dispatched.</i>

158
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:14,085
<i>Bianchi lost control of his car</i>
<i>and hit the back of the tractor.</i>

159
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:24,205
<i>I went to see</i>
<i>Jules at the hospital.</i>

160
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:26,925
<i>And saw how serious it was.</i>

161
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,685
<i>At that moment, we all had</i>
<i>the hope to see him back at one point,</i>

162
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:36,245
<i>but unfortunately,</i>
<i>this moment didn't happen.</i>

163
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,925
<i>When Jules and my father passed away,</i>

164
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:52,165
<i>there's not one race going by</i>
<i>without me thinking of them.</i>

165
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,605
<i>They made me the guy that I am now</i>
<i>and also the driver that I am now.</i>

166
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,845
<i>Jules deserves that Ferrari seat.</i>

167
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:16,325
<i>So that's why</i>
<i>I really want to achieve that.</i>

168
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:20,125
<i>To just thank him for everything</i>
<i> he has done for me.</i>

169
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,365
- Where is it?
- The car is in the truck.

170
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:28,405
- Really?
- Yes.

171
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:30,645
Nice. Really cool.

172
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:35,325
I'm Pierre Gasly.
I'm 22 years old from France.

173
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:40,525
<i>I'm driving for Toro Rosso Honda.</i>
<i>It's my first full season in Formula One.</i>

174
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,205
A number of the bigger teams are now
putting their faith in younger drivers.

175
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:53,405
<i>I think the example of Max Verstappen</i>
<i>has really convinced teams</i>

176
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:55,805
that drivers are good enough
at a much younger age

177
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,325
than perhaps in the past.

178
00:13:57,405 --> 00:14:02,085
<i>Pierre Gasly is Red Bull's choice</i>
<i>of driver to replace Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

179
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:05,045
He's been so impressive
for Toro Rosso this year.

180
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,565
<i>Pierre Gasly doing</i>
<i>a sensational job for Toro Rosso.</i>

181
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:13,445
<i>His first full season with the team.</i>

182
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,565
<i>Gasly going past Leclerc.</i>

183
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,005
<i>Okay, Pierre. P-6.</i>

184
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:24,965
<i>Whoo hoo!</i>

185
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:26,565
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

186
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:31,845
Bahrain stands as, I think, one of
the biggest shocks of the season.

187
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:35,805
<i>P-4. P-4. Fantastic.</i>
<i>This is amazing.</i>

188
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:38,765
<i>Unbelievable! Unbelievable.</i>

189
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,605
Stand up
<i>and applaud the Frenchman!</i>

190
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,325
Pierre, you'll be promoted
to Red Bull next year.

191
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,605
Can you believe the progress
and how quick it's been for you?

192
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:54,885
Yeah. I'm just super excited about it.
It's a massive step.

193
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:58,725
<i> There's a sort of moment</i>
<i>you get only once in your life,</i>

194
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:02,445
and, um, it was
really, really something crazy.

195
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,285
<i>I'm extremely happy for Pierre.</i>

196
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,725
<i>And I think he deserves a Red Bull seat.</i>

197
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,565
<i>And this is very good to see that</i>
<i>the big teams trust the young drivers.</i>

198
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,645
I know Pierre since such a long time.

199
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,325
<i>We started our karting careers together.</i>

200
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:22,845
<i>We go in holidays together, and I think</i>
<i>he's probably one of the only drivers</i>

201
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:25,165
<i>that I can call a good friend</i>
<i>out of racing,</i>

202
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,925
<i>which is very rare in this sport.</i>

203
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:32,685
<i> Our first race with Charles</i>
<i>was probably 2005,</i>

204
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,685
<i>when we were really small, sort of</i>
<i>eight, nine years old, racing together.</i>

205
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,805
<i>And I remember,</i>
<i>like, we got on really well straight away.</i>

206
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:44,205
<i>In my opinion, you can have</i>
<i>good friends in Formula One.</i>

207
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:47,645
You just need to know how to separate
what happens on track and off track.

208
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:52,245
<i>It's something we dreamed about,</i>
<i>and finally ten, twelve years later,</i>

209
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,245
<i>everything is happening and we are there.</i>

210
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,525
<i>Highest level in motorsport</i>
<i>in Formula One.</i>

211
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,645
My name is Marcus Ericsson,

212
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,645
and I'm a driver
of Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.

213
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:11,045
<i>I'm from Sweden.</i>
<i>I've just turned 28.</i>

214
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,405
<i>I see myself in my prime of my career,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

215
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,165
But I don't have a contract
for next year yet.

216
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,805
It's no secret I want
to stay in Sauber.

217
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:25,725
I think that's been part of that team
for a long time now,

218
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:28,165
and we've made
some great progress this year.

219
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:31,725
<i> It feels like I'm continuing</i>
<i>to prove myself, what I can do.</i>

220
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,125
<i>Super performance</i>
<i>by Marcus Ericsson.</i>

221
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:42,645
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Ericsson against Hartley, up the inside...</i>

222
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,725
<i>And Ericsson is back in the points.</i>

223
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,725
<i>Top ten Marcus Ericsson.</i>
<i>Good session for him.</i>

224
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:51,205
<i>Whoo hoo.</i>

225
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,525
<i>P-9. Well bloody well done.</i>

226
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:56,245
<i>Thanks.</i>

227
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:00,605
<i>And I can't wait to get in the car again</i>
<i>and have a strong weekend.</i>

228
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>Welcome along then</i>

229
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:13,085
<i>on a Friday afternoon</i>
<i>in this glorious part of Italy.</i>

230
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,485
<i>We have arrived in Monza.</i>

231
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:20,365
<i>We have come for the Italian Grand Prix.</i>

232
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,885
<i>It is the temple of speed.</i>

233
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,525
<i>It is time for second practice.</i>

234
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,565
<i>A lot of drivers</i>
<i>have sorted out their future.</i>

235
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>I don't think Marcus Ericsson</i>
<i>is one of them at the moment.</i>

236
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,605
<i>Okay, Marcus,</i>
<i>we should have the green light</i>

237
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:43,765
<i>in five seconds.</i>

238
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,605
<i>And green light, green light.</i>
<i>Straight out.</i>

239
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,325
<i>Okay, Marcus. Radio check.</i>

240
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,445
<i>Yeah. Right here.</i>

241
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,605
<i>Okay.</i>

242
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:08,805
<i>Okay, that's plus seven all around.</i>

243
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,125
<i>You have nobody behind at the moment.</i>
<i>Go for it.</i>

244
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,605
- <i>Oh. Something's off.</i>
<i>- Ooh. That's a big crash.</i>

245
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,845
<i>And that's the Sauber</i>
<i>of Marcus Ericcson.</i>

246
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,685
<i>That's massive.</i>

247
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,445
<i> You okay?</i>

248
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:44,685
<i> If you see a car</i>
<i>spinning and turning like he did...</i>

249
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,445
<i>and him travelling at 340 kph...</i>

250
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:52,925
<i>the first thought you have</i>
<i>is obviously the safety of the driver.</i>

251
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:02,405
<i> Marcus Ericsson's Sauber</i>
<i>lying by the side of the track.</i>

252
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:12,045
<i>You okay?</i>

253
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,005
<i>No idea what happened.</i>

254
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,765
<i>- </i><i>Okay. Are you okay?</i>
<i>-  Yeah, I am okay.</i>

255
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:35,365
<i>Marcus is okay.</i>
<i>He went to the medical center.</i>

256
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:40,885
<i>For sure he was, first, a bit</i>
<i>disappointed and also bit shocked.</i>

257
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,965
<i>The accident was</i>
<i>a technical problem on the car.</i>

258
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,645
<i>He was a victim,</i>
<i>nothing he could do to avoid the crash.</i>

259
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,685
<i>In the end of the day,</i>
<i>you know, it was incredible</i>

260
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,005
<i>to be able to walk away</i>
<i>from an accident like that.</i>

261
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:05,525
<i>Ten, fifteen years ago</i>
<i>a similar incident could have been fatal.</i>

262
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,005
<i>Monza,</i>
<i>I was feeling confident going there.</i>

263
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:24,365
<i>I was feeling confident in the car,</i>
<i>and then I had that massive crash.</i>

264
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,485
<i>It's obviously quite a scary thing</i>
<i>to have, you know?</i>

265
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:33,645
<i>It came out of nowhere,</i>
<i>doing 200 miles an hour.</i>

266
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,325
<i>And I was a passenger.</i>

267
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,445
<i>It happened so fast.</i>

268
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:49,325
<i>But whilst the crash was happening,</i>

269
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,525
<i>the time went a bit slower.</i>

270
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:00,285
<i>I remember just thinking,</i>
<i>"What's going on?"</i>

271
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,885
<i>I was so confused why I was flying</i>
<i>around in the air...</i>

272
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,845
<i>My confidence level and everything goes</i>
<i>down when you have a crash like that.</i>

273
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:25,045
<i>And you have to sort of</i>
<i>start building yourself up again.</i>

274
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,965
<i>Going to Singapore now and...</i>

275
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,245
Okay. Again.

276
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,645
On top. There. That's all.

277
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:36,005
<i>Singapore is, in my opinion,</i>
<i>the toughest race of the year.</i>

278
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:39,725
<i>It's key for my future in Formula One.</i>

279
00:21:57,205 --> 00:22:00,685
<i>Significant changes are afoot</i>
<i>at Ferrari for next season.</i>

280
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:09,725
<i>After five years, in his second stint</i>
<i>with Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen is leaving.</i>

281
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:21,005
<i>Räikkönen will stay</i>
<i>in Formula One though... but with Sauber.</i>

282
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,845
Well, Kimi,
if we could start with you, please.

283
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,285
You say it wasn't your decision
to leave Ferrari,

284
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,845
but it was your decision
to go back to Sauber.

285
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:38,085
So just talk us through
why you're doing that.

286
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,485
Why not?

287
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,085
Because I want to go.

288
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,925
And you're still passionate
about racing? The fire is still--

289
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,245
No, I-- I'm not, actually, you know?

290
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:58,165
I'm just by pure, uh... head games
for you guys out there, yeah.

291
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:01,005
Well, Kimi, thanks for the insight.

292
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,125
-Let's move on.
-No worries.

293
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:06,765
When we had the chance
to get Kimi onboard,

294
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,685
<i>we did everything to make it happen.</i>

295
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,085
Kimi Räikkönen coming next year,
probably another driver,

296
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:15,565
which is gonna give Kimi
a really hard time.

297
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,245
Any news on who that might be?

298
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,205
For sure, we have to sit down next week,

299
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,085
-and we'll take a decision quite soon.
-Yeah.

300
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,165
But, uh... for sure,
it's important, the lineup.

301
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,365
So, strategy at Singapore

302
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:32,285
um, is dominated by two things,
safety cars and track position.

303
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,205
<i>We haven't made</i>
<i>a decision of the second seat.</i>

304
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:39,365
<i>It is important for the team</i>
<i>to make sure that we have the best driver</i>

305
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,685
<i>alongside Kimi.</i>

306
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:44,325
<i>When he comes to this side</i>
<i>of the driver lineup,</i>

307
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:47,485
there is always one party
who is not happy with the decision.

308
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:52,005
<i>Fred deals with such situations</i>
<i>in the best possible way.</i>

309
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:04,325
<i>Kimi going to Sauber, it's big, big news.</i>

310
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:08,285
<i>Didn't really see that coming.</i>

311
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:15,125
<i>It means that, you know,</i>
<i>it's one seat less in Sauber, so...</i>

312
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:22,645
<i>I know there's a lot of drivers</i>
<i>that want that final seat,</i>

313
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,245
<i>including myself.</i>

314
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:27,405
<i>So in Singapore,</i>
<i>I need to deliver for sure.</i>

315
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,245
It's my last chance to do it.

316
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,285
We have the best view in Singapore.

317
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:42,205
Yeah.

318
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,125
You can see about 70 percent
of the track.

319
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:46,285
<i>I don't know Singapore at all.</i>

320
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,325
<i>It will be my first time here...</i>

321
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:52,805
<i>and my first night race in Formula One.</i>

322
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,805
<i>It's a very important weekend.</i>

323
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:58,605
<i>So, I can't wait to discover the track.</i>

324
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,725
<i>So, Singapore</i>
<i> is gonna be a first for me.</i>

325
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:15,325
<i>Only driven this track in the simulator</i>
<i>and on my Playstation, so...</i>

326
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:20,965
So... the target is that next year,
I'm the one in the middle.

327
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,605
I'll be good.
I'm not gonna take the Red Bull yet.

328
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:31,245
No, actually, I'm gonna take it.
Fuck it. I always take it.

329
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:36,685
<i> Looks like a really exciting,</i>
<i>challenging track.</i>

330
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:42,085
<i>Very technical, so exactly</i>
<i>the sort of track I like.</i>

331
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,445
Wow. That was a nice one.

332
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,885
<i>Everyone's talking about 2019,</i>

333
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:49,765
<i>but I still have races</i>
<i>to go with Toro Rosso,</i>

334
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:52,045
<i>and really want to make</i>
<i>the best out of them.</i>

335
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:12,005
<i>The 15th round of the 2018</i>
<i>Formula One World Championship.</i>

336
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:17,605
<i>Arguably the most spectacular,</i>
<i>it's the Singapore Grand Prix.</i>

337
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:27,925
<i>This spectacular city is taken over by</i>
<i>a 3.14 mile circuit on the city streets.</i>

338
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,285
<i>There are 23 corners</i>
<i>to make up a lap,</i>

339
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,885
<i>more than any other race</i>
<i>on the current calendar.</i>

340
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:37,325
<i>One thousand seven hundred and seventy-one</i>
<i>light projectors</i>

341
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,245
<i>make sure the drivers</i>
<i>can see where they're going at night.</i>

342
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,285
<i>It's a very special event.</i>

343
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:52,285
<i>Singapore, because of being</i>
<i>at the equator,</i>

344
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:55,205
<i>is very hot. It's very humid.</i>

345
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:58,925
<i>The humidity is 85 plus percent.</i>

346
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,925
<i>So it's very demanding</i>
<i>for the whole team.</i>

347
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:09,005
<i>For the pit stop crew,</i>
<i>they're wearing their race suit.</i>

348
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,485
<i>And, obviously,</i>
<i>especially for the drivers.</i>

349
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:28,285
<i> It's physically</i>
<i>the hardest they'll push all year.</i>

350
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,525
<i>So when they're training</i>
<i>at the start of the season to be fit,</i>

351
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:35,365
<i>the race they're thinking of</i>
<i>that they have to hit the level</i>

352
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,045
<i>is the Singapore Grand Prix.</i>

353
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,725
<i>If we were to work out</i>

354
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:47,085
<i>the difference of balance</i>
<i>in the short run...</i>

355
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:51,805
<i>It's really hot in the cockpit,</i>
<i>up to sixty degrees in the race.</i>

356
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:54,805
<i>One of the longest races of the season</i>
<i>as well, two hours.</i>

357
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:56,845
Let's go for bath.

358
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:12,005
<i> During the weekend, we have</i>
<i>this ice bath, as well, after each session.</i>

359
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:14,525
It might look a bit silly, you know,
on camera, but....

360
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,325
<i>I just know it's good for my body</i>

361
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,525
It's so cold in the thing.

362
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,685
Just like Sweden,
winter ice bath.

363
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,845
Jumping in the frozen lake.

364
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,645
And when I go up from the bath,

365
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:32,805
make sure the cameras are focusing
on the right, uh, areas, yeah?

366
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:35,485
I'll keep it here.

367
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,885
The weapon
is not very big at the moment.

368
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,165
The race is going to be
tough on everyone.

369
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,685
Everyone will overheat, cars and bodies.

370
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:12,245
I think I started the weekend
two kilos heavier than I am now already.

371
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,845
So, I will lose quite a bit again
for the race.

372
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,765
Find the limit, stay at the limit,
you can do it.

373
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,445
<i> I think</i>
<i>before you jump in the car,</i>

374
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:24,725
there's a lot of things
spinning around in your head.

375
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:31,165
Charles Leclerc will need to show
that he's worthy of a Ferrari seat.

376
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:34,365
<i>Charles has added pressure</i>
<i>in that sense.</i>

377
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:37,645
You want to perform. You want
to do well for yourself, for your team.

378
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:41,005
Marcus needs to make sure he's scoring
points and finishing in the top ten

379
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,645
if he wants to be
in Formula One next year.

380
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,685
<i>Singapore is a race that could make</i>
<i>or break Marcus' Formula One career.</i>

381
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,085
There's all these emotions,
and then you sort of jump in the car

382
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,605
and all that sort of just goes away.

383
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,885
<i>Then you just go into your bubble</i>
<i>and you just focus on the job.</i>

384
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:16,165
<i>And they all thread their way</i>
<i>through the first three corners.</i>

385
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:20,165
<i>Esteban Ocon going into the wall!</i>

386
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:28,485
That's what teammates are about.

387
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,885
<i>We have</i>
<i>another first lap accident.</i>

388
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:38,325
<i>Wheel to wheel, Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>ahead of Max Verstappen.</i>

389
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,325
<i>Yeah, I got overtaken.</i>

390
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:54,125
<i>Yeah, Gasly ahead.</i>

391
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,325
<i>Good job, Pierre. Good job.</i>
<i>Keep going.</i>

392
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:01,205
<i>Behind you, there is Leclerc and Ericsson.</i>

393
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,405
<i>Okay, Marcus,</i>
<i>you're doing good. Keep pushing.</i>

394
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:10,525
<i>Push more if you can,</i>
<i>put some pressure on Gasly ahead.</i>

395
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:14,445
<i>Great battle here.</i>

396
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:18,165
<i>Charles Leclerc, trying to get past</i>
<i>the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly.</i>

397
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,645
<i>We are really good friends,</i>
<i>but, of course,</i>

398
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:28,405
<i>you race each single guy</i>
<i>on track the same way.</i>

399
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:34,645
<i>We've raced since we were kids</i>
<i>in mini karts against each other.</i>

400
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,405
<i>Gasly ahead</i>
<i>seems to struggle with the tires.</i>

401
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,805
<i> We had some exciting</i>
<i>and tight battles.</i>

402
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,085
- <i>Struggling so much, guys.</i>
<i>- Push, Pierre. Push.</i>

403
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,805
<i>Ooh. Big lock-up</i>
<i>for Pierre Gasly there.</i>

404
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,245
<i>And that's gonna cost him a little bit.</i>

405
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:02,965
<i>Charles Leclerc is right on his tail now.</i>

406
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:06,605
<i>Of course, when I finish</i>
<i>in front of him, I'm happy,</i>

407
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,045
<i>like he is</i>
<i>when he's finishing in front of me.</i>

408
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,405
<i> Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>almost shoving him around the corners</i>

409
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,365
<i>as they go over the Anderson Bridge.</i>

410
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:19,725
<i>Leclerc does the old switch-a-roo.</i>

411
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:24,765
<i>The rivalry's there.</i>

412
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,125
<i>We both wanna be the best.</i>

413
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,365
Come on!

414
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,005
<i>Winning races,</i>
<i>fighting for the championship.</i>

415
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:34,565
Come on!

416
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:44,085
<i> That puts Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>ahead of Pierre Gasly.</i>

417
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:52,965
<i>Well done, Charles, good job.</i>

418
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,445
<i>Tires are completely gone.</i>

419
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:57,885
<i>Box, box, Pierre.</i>

420
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,365
The race is super, super tough.

421
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:15,565
Pure pain, you know,
you're dehydrated, getting headaches,

422
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,925
you're really, really tired,
you're struggling with concentration.

423
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,805
<i> Feels like an eternity.</i>

424
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,005
You're a bit like in a tunnel.

425
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:33,165
It's extremely intense.

426
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,445
<i>Okay, Marcus, you're doing well.</i>

427
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,285
<i>We are P-8 at the moment.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>

428
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:50,805
<i>Marcus Ericsson still is</i>
<i>the only driver out there</i>

429
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,445
<i>who hasn't pitted.</i>

430
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:56,605
<i> Ericsson must have all the grip</i>
<i>of an eel swimming in olive oil.</i>

431
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:03,205
<i>And Sainz gets past Ericsson.</i>

432
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:04,845
<i>My tires are gone.</i>

433
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:07,325
<i>Box, box, box.</i>

434
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:16,365
<i>Okay, Marcus,</i>
<i>the situation, you are P-11.</i>

435
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:21,045
<i>Ahead of you is Hülkenberg.</i>
<i>Hülkenberg is now ten seconds ahead.</i>

436
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:24,965
<i>Sixteen laps to go. Go for it.</i>

437
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,005
Go, Marcus!

438
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,285
<i>That's eight seconds</i>
<i>to Hülkenberg, eight seconds.</i>

439
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:39,845
<i>Okay, Marcus, Hülkenberg</i>
<i>is now seven seconds ahead.</i>

440
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:42,285
<i>Push.</i>

441
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:45,165
<i>You are a second a lap quicker</i>
<i>than Hülkenberg.</i>

442
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:46,405
<i>You can do it.</i>

443
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,445
<i>Copy.</i>

444
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:51,325
<i>Hülkenberg is now six second ahead.</i>

445
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:52,965
-We're on him.
-Ah, we catch him.

446
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:54,085
There.

447
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:56,205
<i>Okay, Hülkenberg, five seconds ahead.</i>

448
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:57,805
<i>Copy. Push.</i>

449
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,525
<i>Seven laps to go. Push, push, push.</i>

450
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:03,685
<i>Five laps to go.</i>

451
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:06,325
<i>Four laps to go.</i>

452
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,125
<i>Three laps to go.</i>

453
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,165
<i>Two laps to go. Keep pushing.</i>

454
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:17,765
<i>Last lap, last lap.</i>
<i>Maximum attack now.</i>

455
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:23,525
<i> Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>wins the Singapore Grand Prix!</i>

456
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:30,565
<i>Okay, Marcus, that's it.</i>

457
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,165
<i>P-11.</i>

458
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:41,205
- <i>Yeah, thank you.</i>
<i>-  Thank you, buddy.</i>

459
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:45,645
<i>Ericsson once again finishes</i>
<i>just outside the points.</i>

460
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,405
<i>Okay, Charles, that's it.</i>
<i>P-9 at the end.</i>

461
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:50,085
<i>Excellent race again.</i>

462
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,165
<i>Ah.</i>

463
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,485
<i>Thank you. Very good race.</i>

464
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:57,805
<i>Okay, Pierre. P-13, P-13</i>

465
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:58,885
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

466
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:24,165
<i> You've got so much adrenaline</i>
<i>and concentration when you drive.</i>

467
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:27,525
<i>And suddenly, your body</i>
<i>feels completely different.</i>

468
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:29,725
<i>You really feel exhausted</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

469
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:39,485
<i> I think that was the toughest</i>
<i>eleventh place of my career.</i>

470
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,005
<i>You work so hard for two hours</i>

471
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:46,285
<i>to not get rewarded with points</i>
<i>when you're so close.</i>

472
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,085
<i>It was very hard to accept.</i>

473
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:04,165
Marcus?

474
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,645
Hey?

475
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:09,085
How do you feel?

476
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:10,765
-Pretty good.
-Yeah?

477
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:15,285
-It's a pity, huh?
-Yeah. It was close.

478
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,525
It was close.

479
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:28,045
So close. So far away.

480
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:31,405
I do deserve a sandwich, though.

481
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,645
And maybe a drink later,
but don't tell anyone.

482

483
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:56,085

484
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:03,085

<i>It's incredible.</i>

485
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,485
Selfie, selfie.
Ferrari driver. Ferrari driver.

486
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:08,205
Oh. I was really believing it.

487
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:10,285
-I know.
-All right.

488
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:11,765
Congratulations. Well done, mate.

489
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:13,405
Thank you. Hello. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

490
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:17,645
<i> Charles Leclerc will be</i>
<i>the second youngest Ferrari driver</i>

491
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,405
<i>in history.</i>

492
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:21,165
Yeah, it feels incredible.

493
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:23,965
<i>They just told me that</i>
<i>we have chosen you as the race driver</i>

494
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,605
<i>for Scuderia Ferrari next year.</i>

495
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:28,005
<i>And I was just,</i>
<i>"Are you joking or..."</i>

496
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,965
<i>And he was like,</i>
<i>"No, no. Of course, not.</i>

497
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:33,165
<i>We have chosen you."</i>
<i>And it just felt unbelievable.</i>

498
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:35,525
-Hey, man, congrats.
-Thank you, man.

499
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:46,045
Jules probably deserved this place
more than I do,

500
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,085
and I'm extremely happy to be the one.

501
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:51,405
And I'll try to honor him
the way he deserves,

502
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:54,965
and bring him the success
he deserves to have.

503
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:27,285
<i> Are you okay, Nico?</i>

504
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:30,085
<i>Get me out. There's fire.</i>

505
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:31,445
- <i> Yeah.</i>
<i>- There's fire.</i>
