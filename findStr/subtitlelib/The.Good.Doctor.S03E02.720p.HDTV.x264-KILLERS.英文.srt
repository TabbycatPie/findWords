20
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,870
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,410
We had the clinic at the hospital.

22
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,680
Come back as President, and-and we'll re-open it.

23
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,580
We need to go to HR and break up.

24
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,070
I have accepted your explanation and report.

25
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,950
Thank you.

26
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,430
But I don't believe it.

27
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,380
Traditionally, you don't get to lead surgeries until fourth year.

28
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,350
That will be changing.

29
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,820
When the right surgery comes along, it'll be yours.

30
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,360
I want you to meet our new attending,

31
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,410
Dr. Marcus Andrews.

32
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,580
Pleasure to meet you.

33
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,100
You had a date last night, didn't you?

34
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,730
It was hard, uncomfortable, unpleasant,

35
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,730
and I have no idea if she was happy,

36
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,630
and I know I wasn't happy.

37
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,180
I don't like when you do that.

38
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,910
I know.

39
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,310
But I did it anyway

40
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,160
because you need to snap out of it.

41
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,020
The moping...it accomplishes nothing.

42
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,970
I'm not moping. I'm eating.

43
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,390
Which is the only thing

44
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,310
you're doing outside your room now.

45
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,510
You didn't even come out to tell me

46
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,930
to turn down the Talking Heads.

47
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,180
It...didn't bother me.

48
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,690
The walls were shaking.

49
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,750
I'm surprised the cops didn't show up.

50
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,810
You like Carly.

51
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,250
You need to get back in the saddle.

52
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,450
And luckily, you have a totally awesome roomie

53
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,550
who's here to help you.

54
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,550
I'm not going on any more dates.

55
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,870
Shaun... everyone gets it.

56
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,260
Dating is stressful.

57
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,640
But being alone is worse.

58
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,890
I'm not alone.

59
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,140
I have you. I have Dr. Glassman.

60
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,320
Yeah, friends are great,

61
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,360
but everyone needs a special friend.

62
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,420
I don't.

63
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,150
- Shaun... - I'm not like everyone!

64
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,100
No one is like everyone.

65
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,140
We're all unique.

66
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,450
But we're also the same.

67
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,710
I had rent control.

68
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,150
The only way for them to jack the rent is to get me out,

69
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,670
so they just make up a reason.

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,330
Said that I was playing my music too loud.

71
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,070
And the all-night parties, the fighting with the neighbors,

72
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,510
the wandering around the parking lot without any clothes on?

73
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,640
I had a robe on!

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,830
And I wasn't wandering.

75
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,530
I was trying to take the trash out,

76
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,110
but they moved the damn bins.

77
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,490
It was windy.

78
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,030
Mom, you were clearly off your meds and drinking.

79
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,950
Okay.

80
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,380
"Was."

81
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,000
It was a temporary setback.

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,030
Okay, nobody's perfect, but it is all under control now.

83
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,040
People with things under control

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,180
don't show up at their daughter's at 1:00 a.m.

85
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,430
looking for a place to stay.

86
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,830
I will be out of your hair before you even know.

87
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,330
Two weeks.

88
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,820
Three...tops.

89
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,750
One!

90
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,380
I don't have time to babysit a grown woman.

91
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,260
Well, it's three weeks until the end of the month.

92
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,520
You at least owe me that.

93
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,830
No, I don't, actually.

94
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,830
One week.

95
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,240
We need some help over here!

96
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,510
Male, 30s, gaping 10-centimeter laceration to his left cheek.

97
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,810
Probable fractured temporal bone, maxilla,

98
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,820
- definitely shattered mandible. - What happened?

99
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,580
He tried to stop some creeper

100
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,980
from groping a woman on the subway.

101
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,310
Maniac ended up bashing his skull in

102
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
with some kid's skateboard.

103
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,780
Wheels broke off, and the metal axle...

104
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,980
did that.

105
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,320
Okay, we need to secure his airway.

106
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,500
His mouth is filling up with blood.

107
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,490
Intubation cart.

108
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,750
He has a through-and-through oral defect,

109
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,390
and the mandible is crushed.

110
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,490
We need hemostats.

111
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,570
The woman?

112
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,430
She's fine.

113
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,370
Cops arrived, tased the dude, took him away in cuffs.

114
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,310
Everybody's fine except for the hero.

115
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,900
We're gonna need to intubate through the neck.

116
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,350
Betadine, scalpel, 6-0 tube to place surgical cric.

117
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,830
Could you do me a huge favor and take this up to Lim's office?

118
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,620
- Sure. - I'm running late.

119
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,580
No problem.

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,820
Melendez is waiting.

121
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,880
Sorry, I had to help Kellan

122
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,580
with a biology project this morning.

123
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,680
What's in the box?

124
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,230
Ducati throw pillow.

125
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,990
You really think you can bribe Lim with a pillow?

126
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,430
I'm not bribing her. I'm being nice.

127
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,250
She's starting a new job in a new office.

128
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,440
Where she'll decide who gets the first lead surgery.

129
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm not stupid enough to think

130
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,800
I can influence her decision with a gift.

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,380
But it never hurts

132
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,150
to have a good relationship with your boss.

133
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,570
And it's a damn cool pillow.

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,710
No signs of any post-op infection.

135
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,910
There's also no sign your surgery did any good.

136
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,850
Tom.

137
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,270
How often is he vomiting?

138
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,570
After every feeding.

139
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,410
Okay.

140
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,470
This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for,

141
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,460
but a pyloric stenosis requires a cautious approach.

142
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,890
If we're too aggressive --

143
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,160
It's okay, buddy. I got you.

144
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,890
Our baby is in pain. He can't eat.

145
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,840
And you don't seem to have any clue why.

146
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,640
I would be upset, too, if I were in your position.

147
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,800
But you're wrong.

148
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,760
We need to conduct some tests to confirm, but I am confident

149
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,500
it's just a matter of going back in

150
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,160
and making a tiny adjustment.

151
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,240
Your son's in good hands.

152
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,860
Thank you.

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,690
I'm sorry. I'm just --

154
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,160
A father who loves his son.

155
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,990
You've got nothing to apologize for.

156
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,450
That was impressive.

157
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,510
Get an abdominal ultrasound to confirm

158
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,720
it's just an incomplete pyloromyotomy.

159
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,430
You're wasting your ass-kissing.

160
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,590
First surgery isn't his decision.

161
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,470
No. He's just the one sleeping with the one making that decision.

162
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,190
Pupils are equal and reactive.

163
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,350
Do you know where you are?

164
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,470
And do you know how you ended up here?

165
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,760
Josh, you have multiple fractures

166
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,420
in your cheek and jaw,

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,470
and a large piece of your cheek tissue, skin,

168
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,180
and underlying muscle was torn off.

169
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,140
You're going to need extensive reconstructive surgery

170
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,700
to save your jaw function.

171
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,100
You need to read these consent forms.

172
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,570
And if you have any questions, write them on this pad.

173
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,450
Was the woman on the subway a friend of yours?

174
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,880
He's a fool.

175
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,800
Trying to prove how macho you are

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,990
can get you killed.

177
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,770
Clamp the branch of the inferior alveolar.

178
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,070
So, you would just stand by?

179
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,750
Let a woman get groped?

180
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,530
Apply manual compression. Try and close the fracture gap.

181
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,490
You help every homeless drug addict

182
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,690
you see on the subway?

183
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,750
I don't.

184
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,300
And neither does Browne,

185
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,970
which is why she ought not get so self-righteous.

186
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,200
Yes.

187
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,110
I help my patients to the best of my ability

188
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,610
because it's meaningful,

189
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,990
and to me, the downside is purely financial.

190
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,470
For friends, I'll risk a little bit more,

191
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,860
but the only people I'm risking life and limb for

192
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,320
are my family.

193
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,250
Someone gropes my wife on the subway,

194
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,520
they're gonna get whupped.

195
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,130
This isn't gonna work.

196
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,970
The mandibular ramus is just too shattered,

197
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,870
and I can't get adequate stabilization.

198
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,110
We can't do any skin or muscle grafts

199
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,120
if we can't fix the skeletal structures.

200
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,200
Alloplastic augmentation to bridge the gap?

201
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,860
The span is too wide.

202
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,060
We're gonna have to wire him shut.

203
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Wake him up.

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,630
He should know he's never gonna talk

205
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,970
or eat solid food again.

207
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,620
Forever.

208
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,240
Do you have any questions?

209
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,410
I'm sorry.

211
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,990
The Cantrells want a new surgeon.

212
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,700
What can you tell me about the first surgery?

213
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,760
Is this an M&M review?

214
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,020
Not yet.

215
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,060
Is it possible...

216
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,720
you may have been a little too aggressive?

217
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,010
Cut too deeply?

218
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,540
Are you really asking me that?

219
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,050
I need to know.

220
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,190
I definitely didn't go too deep.

221
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,860
Great.

222
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,860
We'll talk to the Cantrells.

223
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,850
Audrey.

224
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,420
Is this weird for you?

225
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,440
A little. You?

226
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,310
I'm trying not to let it be.

227
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,160
Good.

228
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,520
Me too.

229
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,180
Hello. I'm here to pick up artificial dermal regeneration templates.

230
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,470
Let me get it.

231
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,370
Hey, Shaun.

232
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,580
I heard what happened to the guy.

233
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,990
Sounds horrible.

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,190
Is he gonna be okay?

235
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,180
He won't be able to eat or speak normally ever again.

236
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,900
Thank you.

237
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,610
Shaun.

238
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,740
You seem a bit uncomfortable.

239
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,900
If it has anything to do with our date,

240
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,620
I just want you to know, I had a really good time --

241
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,830
and hope we can do it again.

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,280
I had... a horrible time...

243
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,040
and...don't want to do that ever again.

244
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,000
Extensive swelling.

245
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,790
But within the acceptable range of post-op edema.

246
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,590
The very top of the range.

247
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,290
I think maybe Melendez did go too deep,

248
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,570
injured the pylorus.

249
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,560
Well?

250
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,230
The swelling is within the acceptable range

251
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,590
for a post-op edema.

252
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,590
Got your muffins. Delicious.

253
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm glad you liked them.

254
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,710
I did.

255
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
Just kinda surprised

256
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,670
you thought I could be bought with baked goods.

257
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,480
We're not trying to buy you off with muffins or a pillow.

258
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,760
Someone got me a pillow?

259
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,870
No. I wanted to show you my support for your promotion.

260
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,640
You're all gonna lead surgeries -- hundreds of them.

261
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,770
So it doesn't matter who does anything first.

262
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,040
The only thing that matters is that you do it right.

263
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,790
So, what was in the box?

264
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,690
Sample marketing pamphlets.

265
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,030
My buddy owns a print shop,

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,930
asked me to give Lim some samples.

267
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,870
Well played.

268
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,620
But it's all moot anyway.

269
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,110
It doesn't matter who goes first.

270
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,170
Right.

271
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,300
Just so I'm clear,

272
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,960
that "Right" was sarcastic, right?

273
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,620
Right.

274
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,430
Since when does the President

275
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,360
need to stock his own shelves?

276
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,480
When it's a free clinic and you want it done right.

277
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,780
Thank you.

278
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,120
Have you ever had sex in the office?

279
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm not gonna answer that.

280
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,990
First of all, it's embarrassing if I say yes,

281
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,570
and it's even more embarrassing if I say no.

282
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,780
I take the fifth.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,110
If we're gonna get married,

284
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,820
I need to know all your naughty --

285
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,580
I brought us lunch.

286
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,330
I know what you each like.

287
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,950
Dr. Melendez is not just our best surgeon.

288
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,050
He's one of the tops in the entire country,

289
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,310
with the expertise to know that the best way

290
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,630
to avoid a truly bad outcome in this procedure

291
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,310
is to err on the side of caution.

292
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,610
- W-we hear all that. - We do.

293
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,470
And we really appreciate you taking the time

294
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,820
to explain everything.

295
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,530
But we would just be more comfortable

296
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,770
having someone else take over from here.

297
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,110
You do understand?

298
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,070
Of course.

299
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,580
I assume you'd be okay

300
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,770
if I perform Braden's second surgery?

301
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,300
The Chief of the department?

302
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,270
Absolutely.

303
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,800
Thank you, Doctor.

304
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,660
Of course.

305
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,640
Nobody likes dating.

306
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,530
It's awkward and uncomfortable.

307
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,630
It's expensive.

308
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,780
Ah. That's why you proposed after two dates?

309
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
To save money?

310
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,020
I proposed after two dates because after one date,

311
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,600
I realized how much I loved being around you

312
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,080
and how much fun we'd have together.

313
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,700
He's right, Shaun, 'cause the fun can be so fun.

314
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,740
That didn't happen to me.

315
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,400
I have to go to surgery.

316
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,680
Shaun.

317
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,360
Whenever you're ready, you'll try again.

318
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,570
What?

319
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,180
Whenever he's ready?

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,940
He's got to go at his own pace.

321
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,440
He needs to be pushed.

322
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,430
I'm not gonna push him.

323
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,650
A man doesn't push another man into a date.

324
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,940
He pushed you.

325
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,480
Shaun doesn't know any better.

326
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,090
If you want him to find love,

327
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,970
he literally needs to be pushed into it.

328
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,940
Literally?

329
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,100
Shaun's not like other men.

330
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,250
Oh, he easily admits he's wrong?

331
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,400
He easily changes course?

332
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,420
If you don't talk to him, is anything gonna change?

333
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,140
No good deed goes unpunished.

334
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,490
Why does it always work out that way?

335
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,580
It doesn't.

336
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,480
Most good deeds get rewarded.

337
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,910
And what do you base that on, Murphy?

338
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,470
Certainly not the news or the Forbes 500.

339
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,430
Or the Bible.

340
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,580
I base it on neuroscience.

341
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,540
Bad outcomes just implant deeper in our cerebral cortex.

342
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,270
So, evolution agrees with me.

343
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,890
Our brains encourage us to be selfish.

344
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes.

345
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,120
Which makes it strange

346
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,480
that people keep being unselfish.

347
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,670
You were.

348
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,930
You saved my job.

349
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,370
And now you're an attending instead of the President.

350
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,570
Screws and wire ligature.

351
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,960
We're not doing this.

352
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,610
We can do better.

353
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,850
There is no other procedure.

354
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,440
We'll invent one.

355
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,290
Truce during surgery.

356
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,950
Fair. What about procedures?

357
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,330
Imaging is fair game.

358
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,870
Anything invasive, we go to our corners.

359
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,780
Crap. I left my keys in my locker.

360
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,720
Losing my mind.

361
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,020
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Night.

362
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,800
What about a muscle graft from the temporalis?

363
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,580
That wouldn't address deep mucosa or bone.

364
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,770
Unless we took an osseocutaneous free flap

365
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,600
from the radial forearm.

366
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,390
We'd need approximately 2 inches

367
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,400
and could use the natural concavity of --

368
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,270
And he could lose the use of his hand.

369
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,530
That seems like a reasonable trade-off.

370
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,850
I'm not telling this guy that we can restore his speech

371
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,910
and all it'll cost is his hand.

372
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,420
Because he's a hero?

373
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,080
What he did has nothing to do with it.

374
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,390
It's what we can do that matters.

375
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,960
What we can do is what we were doing.

376
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,350
That's the protocol.

377
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,570
Aren't we risking more damage by leaving him in an ICU bed

378
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,960
while we try to invent a new treatment?

379
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,700
How about attaching two free flaps

380
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,270
on vessels on either side of his neck?

381
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,820
Heard from Claire you're having an all-hands-on-deck sesh.

382
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,840
Happy to join.

383
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,510
Good. How about Park?

384
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,710
He left.

385
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,150
Said he had a thing with his son.

386
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,700
Thankfully, I don't have kids, so extra hours not a problem.

387
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Have you considered an allograft augmentation or a --

388
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,690
Heard y'all were working late, so I got some coffee.

389
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,010
Any way I can help?

390
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,300
I want to talk about our meeting with the Cantrells.

391
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,630
On date night?

392
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,070
Can it wait... 10 1/2 hours?

393
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,910
I guess.

394
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,850
Thank you.

395
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,620
Have you ever been to The French Laundry?

396
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,720
No.

397
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,690
We should do a weekend in Napa.

398
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,810
I know this great little B&B just south of St. Helena --

399
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,220
It's not about the Cantrells.

400
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,060
It's about what you said to them.

401
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,230
Has it been 10 1/2 hours already?

402
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,660
I "Erred on the side of caution."

403
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,960
Caution is a good thing.

404
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,480
Err isn't.

405
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,140
I didn't err -- not at all.

406
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,770
I was going to bat for you.

407
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,220
I think that maybe you're so afraid

408
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,770
of appearing to favor your boyfriend

409
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,180
that you're overcompensating.

410
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,180
Given I think you may have erred,

411
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,960
I'd say I was incredibly supportive.

412
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,970
In which case, you went against your better professional judgment

413
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,210
to favor your boyfriend.

414
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,950
So, I'm too supportive or not supportive enough?

415
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,610
Should I change the reservation to two tables for one?

416
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,540
I've had plenty of first dates that were actual disasters.

417
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,800
Took one woman to a Coyotes game,

418
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,460
saw four minutes of it,

419
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,930
spent the rest of the night in the ER

420
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,670
while she got 17 stitches after being hit by a puck.

421
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,280
We got married eight months later.

422
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,500
Then you divorced her.

423
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,280
It was worth it.

424
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,690
We don't have a choice.

425
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,400
Evolution needs us to propagate,

426
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,630
so it gives us a shot of happiness

427
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,610
every now and again to suck us in like idiots.

428
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,550
To keep us in a game

429
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,920
that we know we're gonna lose almost every time.

430
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,480
Because the upside's like...

431
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,610
nothing else.

432
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,050
Love.

433
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,400
But if Shaun really doesn't need to play, then...

434
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,990
good for him.

435
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,160
We've officially turned into an episode of "The Bachelor."

436
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,050
Everyone go home.

437
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,790
I'm not tired.

438
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,880
I am.

439
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,350
No.

440
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,010
There are still a number of possibilities.

441
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,830
Murphy, you are smart and you're creative,

442
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,310
but there are things you can't do.

443
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,170
You can't do miracles. You can't fix the unfixable.

444
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,780
Hey, baby.

445
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,270
You work way too hard.

446
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,810
Yes, I do.

447
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,980
Let me get you something to eat,

448
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,440
'cause I made some pulled pork and some peanut coleslaw.

449
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,500
No, thanks, Mom.

450
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,820
Did you find a place?

451
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,320
I saw one, but it was nasty.

452
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,540
Y-you must be hungry.

453
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,120
You saw one,

454
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,150
and then you came home and cooked?

455
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,550
Yes.

456
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,070
I came home and cooked dinner for my daughter.

457
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,730
I'm trying, Claire.

458
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,410
Okay, I'm taking my meds.

459
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,200
I'm seeing Dr. Donovan.

460
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,630
I am doing my best.

461
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,170
I've heard that before.

462
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,210
You got six days.

463
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,130
Shaun, you need sleep.

464
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,570
Your neurons will be sparkier in the morning.

465
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,830
There are 640 muscles and 206 bones in the body,

466
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,290
but only 284 and 72 of those

467
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,830
are of sufficient size for our grafts,

468
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,110
but that still leaves 20,448 possible permutations.

469
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,460
It's not unfixable until I rule out every --

470
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,340
So, some anatomy problem, you won't give up on,

471
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,800
but after one date,

472
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,300
you think you've explored

473
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,500
all the possible permutations?

474
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,230
Stop distracting me.

475
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,590
I'm distracting you?

476
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,980
By talking about you? By talking about love?

477
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,730
Yes.

478
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,390
I -- I need to concentrate.

479
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Okay.

480
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,320
I'll shut up.

481
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,450
You're still talking.

482
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,030
Good night, Shaun.

483
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,450
You're still --

484
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,540
We only have 206 bones?

485
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,810
Still talking. 

486
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,860
Yes.

487
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,430
Shaun?

488
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,970
I think we should talk.

489
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,660
So did Lea.

490
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,740
But I have to find a solution for an oromandibular defect

491
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,410
that doesn't involve titanium plates,

492
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,720
356 of our muscles,

493
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,400
or 134 of our bones.

494
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,400
I don't think you never want to see me again.

495
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,090
I have to find a solution for an oromandibular --

496
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,570
We have to talk.

497
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,370
You owe me that much.

498
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,170
Why do I owe you that much?

499
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,220
Because I thought we had a nice time.

500
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,430
And I thought you were a nice guy --

501
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,780
an honest guy and I still think you are,

502
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,740
and I'm confused about how you feel

503
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,660
and about how I feel about how you feel,

504
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,480
and I just need to talk about it.

505
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,460
So, if you have any feelings for me at all,

506
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,990
you'll help me understand.

507
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,330
Okay.

508
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,040
My little sister, Andie, has autism.

509
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,630
We're not all the same.

510
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,420
I know.

511
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,260
I think growing up with Andie helps me understand you.

512
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,730
But it also makes me wonder about myself.

513
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,060
And did I date you to prove something?

514
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,110
Did I date you to...

515
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,780
somehow make things better for Andie?

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,950
I don't think I did, but...

517
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,790
My point is...

518
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,790
I have questions, too, Shaun.

519
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,890
Trying to figure out what we want

520
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,600
and why we want it and is it good for us

521
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,220
are good questions.

522
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,590
And they can't all be answered over one dinner.

523
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,100
I have to go.

524
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,930
Murphy...

525
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,720
I've -- I've got it!

526
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,810
I've got it!

527
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,990
We take a vascularized free flap

528
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,500
and suture it to the facial artery and vein,

529
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,730
then flip up the pectoralis.

530
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,820
It's a great idea.

531
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,990
We're not doing it.

532
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,780
It's never been tried before.

533
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Risk 1 -- graft failure brings infection

534
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,140
and he loses the other half of his face.

535
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,640
Risk 2 -- sepsis and he dies.

536
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,770
- Risk 3 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, risk whatever.

537
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,770
We do the standard procedure,

538
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,460
the guy never speaks or eats again.

539
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,170
Dr. Murphy, could you please give us a minute?

540
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,270
Why do you want to do this?

541
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,960
You've been my boss for a few hours,

542
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,790
and you're already questioning my motivations?

543
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,380
You fell on your sword for Shaun,

544
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,170
and your reward for your act of heroism

545
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,660
was getting fired.

546
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,450
And now you're back here, answerable to me.

547
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,890
I imagine you've been asking yourself

548
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,120
if it was worth it.

549
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,270
Your issues with the procedure are valid,

550
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,610
but at least let me put them before the patient.

551
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,860
He'll say yes.

552
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,530
I won't sugarcoat the risks.

553
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,010
He'll say yes anyway.

554
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,640
He wants to believe things will work out.

555
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,430
That's why he's a hero.

556
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,810
Sometimes the hero loses.

557
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,560
Which is why he's got to learn when to stand back

558
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,940
when there's nothing he can do to help.

559
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,570
Are you going to order me to stand back?

560
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,040
No.

561
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,290
Hey, Shaun?

562
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,750
You got a minute?

563
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,300
Okay.

564
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,260
Debbie wanted me to talk to you.

565
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,470
To tell you...

566
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,760
not to give up on love.

567
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,440
Don't give up on love.

568
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,250
Okay.

569
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,040
Do you want me to let her know you told me?

570
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,110
Yes, please.

571
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,740
Hey, Shaun?

572
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,300
I know this, uh, dating thing can be scary.

573
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,870
You're good at dating.

574
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,260
Well, before Debbie, the last time I went on a date,

576
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,250
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" was the big hit.

577
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,350
'Cause a-a-after Maddie and the divorce,

578
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,710
I kind of shut down for a while.

579
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,980
Yeah, I -- and it felt better

580
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,800
to be in a place where I couldn't get hurt.

581
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,700
But then, last year, I got my diagnosis,

582
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,990
I thought I was gonna die,

583
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,680
and Debbie came into my life, and I said to myself,

584
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,140
"I-I-I don't want to be safe anymore."

585
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,900
You know? I want to -- I want to -- I want to feel alive.

586
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,110
And -- and if I get hurt, I get hurt.

587
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,570
That's part of the deal.

588
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,240
Morgan says it's biological,

589
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,990
that it doesn't make sense.

590
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,240
Morgan's right.

591
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,250
So I'm right?

592
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,250
No. No.

593
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,210
Look, i--

594
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,790
it's wonderful, this love thing.

595
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,670
Why should it make any sense?

596
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,730
When I think about the reasons I-I'm in love with Debbie,

597
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,260
okay, she's -- she's kind, she's funny,

598
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,110
she's -- she's loving.

599
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,140
But that's not it. Not really.

600
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,740
Don't tell her this, but there are other people in the world

601
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,040
that are kinder, that are funnier,

602
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,210
that are more loving than she is,

603
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,540
but she makes me happy -- just being around her.

604
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,900
It makes absolutely no sense,

605
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,200
but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

606
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,380
Okay.

607
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,090
I have an ethical dilemma.

608
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,360
I was going through state regulations

609
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,740
for medical staff --

610
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,600
specifically, residents --

611
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,230
and their new guidelines have raised an issue for me.

612
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,790
The state caps residents at 80 hours a week,

613
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,230
but I don't think that's nearly enough.

614
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,750
I work over 100, and I don't plan on cutting back,

615
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,420
so I'm wondering how I should be reporting my hours.

616
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,990
Park offered to co-write a paper with me.

617
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,550
What a suck-up.

618
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,640
I said yes.

619
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,760
It's an interesting case. It should be written up.

620
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
So he's --

621
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,560
Gonna do a lot of work for nothing.

622
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,540
Except for the good of the medical community.

623
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,600
And I'm gonna tell you what I told him --

624
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,440
if you come to me with one more favor,

625
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,520
one more humblebrag,

626
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,590
if I suspect either of you have your lips puckered,

627
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,430
you're going to the bottom of the list.

628
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,680
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,350
Dr. Lim?

630
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,710
Do you ever think about what it means,

631
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,980
me doing all this?

632
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,150
Means you've underestimated me.

633
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,700
Maybe.

634
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,320
But it also means that I care.

635
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,830
That getting the first surgery means something to me --

636
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
enough for me to go out

637
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,890
and really overspend on designer desserts

638
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,850
and then to spend even more time

639
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,710
trying to make them look homemade.

640
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,520
If I'm putting that much effort into muffins,

641
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,850
imagine how hard I'll work

642
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,590
to make the most of this opportunity if it's given to me.

643
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,830
With considerable physio and speech therapy,

644
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,080
this graft would allow you

645
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,450
to not only chew and swallow whole foods,

646
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,610
but it would enable you to talk again.

648
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,340
It's an untested procedure with not-insignificant risks.

649
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,670
If the graft doesn't take,

650
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,580
more skin and bone could become infected,

651
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,410
possibly necrotic.

653
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,730
We need to know you understand.

654
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,810
It's an experimental procedure.

655
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,400
In addition to all of the usual surgical risks,

656
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,630
there are all of the unknowns --

657
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,400
bleeding out, permanent graft loss,

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
stroke...

659
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,350
death.

662
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,910
Good for you, Josh.

663
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,210
Get him prepped.

664
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,670
Okay.

665
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,840
Infuse carbon dioxide.

666
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,100
Grasping duodenum just distal of the pylorus.

667
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,270
Look at that.

668
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,100
That's not good.

669
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,940
Page Dr. Melendez.

670
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,820
An intussusception.

671
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,280
The telescoped bowel is causing a blockage.

672
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,960
The baby had two unrelated conditions

673
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,660
causing the same symptom.

674
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,210
We only know about the second condition

675
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,780
because of the first surgery.

676
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,330
Treatment protocol is a barium enema,

677
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,250
but not for someone Braden's age.

678
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,970
An air enema might work.

679
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,580
Unless the intestine's torn.

680
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,390
Morgan, reposition the scope

681
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,310
to get a better look at the intestinal wall

682
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,090
around the intussusception site.

683
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,530
There's too much swelling and edema to be sure.

684
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,700
With the risk of infection, we don't have time to find out.

685
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,140
You're gonna have to open him up.

686
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,560
You should.

687
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,270
The Cantrells made their wishes clear.

688
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,400
Well, that's when I made them think you'd erred,

689
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,790
which you did not --

690
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,320
not on the side of caution...

691
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
not at all.

692
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,150
We do the surgery together.

693
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,030
Who's the lead?

694
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,370
I think you know.

695
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,800
Pulling rank?

696
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,830
Absolutely.

697
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,500
As Chief of Surgery, I designate you.

698
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,640
It's like a puzzle.

699
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,140
You secure to the artery,

700
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,050
then the vessel just won't quite stretch to the vein.

701
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,090
You could mobilize the recipient vessel.

702
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,630
Repeat that, Dr. Browne.

703
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,930
Mobilize the recipient vessel to create more slack.

704
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,290
You saw Carly again.

705
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,270
How was it?

706
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,940
Inconvenient.

707
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,210
But despite her intrusion,

708
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,090
I was still able to concentrate on medicine.

709
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,150
That wasn't an intrusion. That was a date.

710
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,800
It was walking.

711
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,630
Walking with someone you like who likes you, too,

712
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,090
is a non-date date.

713
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,970
Some of the best dates that I have had

714
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,290
did not involve flowers and restaurant reservations. Just...

715
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,880
sharing a bag of chips and sitting on a couch.

716
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,800
Secured.

717
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,340
Remove clamps.

718
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,190
Blood flow to and from graft.

719
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,680
Let's move on to the pectoralis flap.

720
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,530
Blood pressure's dropping.

721
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,780
Okay. Heart rate is up.

722
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,700
Push IV fluids, give epinephrine 1 milligram,

723
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,690
then start a drip.

724
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,290
There's intestinal wall perforation.

725
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,190
Repairable?

726
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,700
There's too much tissue damage.

727
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,920
Infection?

728
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,130
No sign of peritonitis,

729
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,450
but we'll need to remove this section of bowel.

730
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,410
- He's tachy. - Hypotensive.

731
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,500
Push vasopressors and antibiotics.

732
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,480
Check an iSTAT hematocrit,

733
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
ABG. Give two units PRBCs.

734
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,650
I don't see any major bleeding.

735
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,930
Push more fluids, start an inotrope.

736
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,510
Check all vessels we worked on for clots with the Doppler.

737
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,760
Okay.

738
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,870
Large clot in the carotid.

739
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,410
Clamps back on,

740
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,170
performing carotid arteriotomy.

741
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,880
Will try to aspirate out the clot.

742
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,360
Stand by with heparin.

743
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,540
Carotid clot removed.

744
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,210
EEG looking good.

745
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,340
Resuming pectoralis flap dissection.

746
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,670
Good work, everybody.

747
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,000
Go ahead, say something.

748
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,480
Yeah, you can talk.

749
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,100
Maybe not too much at first...

750
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,800
give the jaw a chance to heal.

751
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,550
Thank you.

752
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,390
On behalf of all of us, you're very welcome.

753
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,980
The woman who was being accosted when you intervened is here.

754
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,960
Is she all right?

755
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,500
She's not here as a patient.

756
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,070
She's been... waiting to see you.

757
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,700
Okay?

758
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,040
Hello.

759
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,300
I am so sorry this happened.

760
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,380
Me too.

761
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,010
You look...

762
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,930
When the swelling goes down, he'll look a lot better.

763
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,220
It's okay.

764
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,640
My face was never my fortune.

765
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,810
What made you do it?

766
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,820
Why did you step in?

767
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,440
I don't know.

768
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,910
You needed help.

769
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,790
Olivia, by the way.

770
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,140
Josh.

771
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,920
We'll let you two get acquainted.

772
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,600
It didn't matter who got the first lead surgery -- to me.

773
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,530
But it's recently been brought to my attention

774
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,240
how much it might mean to some of you.

775
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,040
Seems I'd forgotten how important this decision is

776
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,070
when you've been dreaming about it for years.

777
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,540
You're all excellent candidates, each deserving,

778
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,360
and will all get your turn.

779
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,760
Starting with Dr. Browne.

780
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,740
Yes!

781
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,200
Thank you.

782
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,750
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

783
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,420
What the hell was that?

784
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,090
I was happy for a colleague.

785
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,780
You weren't campaigning for you to win.

786
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,890
You were campaigning for me to lose.

787
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,470
Do you dislike me that much?

788
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,480
I just wouldn't want you supervising me as Chief Resident.

789
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,400
You'd be a nightmare of a boss.

790
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,450
Shaun.

791
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,140
Dr. Lim thought my motives for fighting this hard

792
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,700
for this patient were miscalculated.

793
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,000
She was right.

794
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,880
We shouldn't have saved his face?

795
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,900
We have limited resources, and we're even more limited

796
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,440
in our personal capacity to determine who is deserving,

797
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,300
so we make a choice to treat everyone the same.

798
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,760
So why did you treat this patient differently?

799
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,680
Because I was angry.

800
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,770
I made a sacrifice to save you.

801
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,870
I lost my job, I took a substantial demotion.

802
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,880
And I thought I was a fool.

803
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,240
The cost was way too high.

804
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,950
I resented you, and I...

805
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,910
kind of resented the universe.

806
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,290
But today...

807
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,250
...you made me proud of my sacrifice.

808
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,130
Thank you.

809
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,880
You're welcome.

810
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,530
Very few things that are worthwhile in life

811
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,890
come without a cost, Shaun.

812
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,080
This is tricky.

813
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,750
I feel like we were just tested and both of us failed.

814
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,290
But...

815
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,090
we'll get better at this.

816
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,410
Hey, honey.

817
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,690
I'll make you a plate, and you can take it to your room.

818
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,610
Thanks.

819
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,960
I saw three more apartments today.

820
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,290
One was kind of nice,

821
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,880
but it's not ready until a week from this Tuesday,

822
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,490
which puts me over your deadline by three days.

823
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,450
No.

824
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Three days? Come on.

825
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,630
You can stay here.

826
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,670
For a little while, until you're a bit better.

827
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,630
But you have to stay on your meds.

828
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,440
And keep away from other drugs and alcohol.

829
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
I'm testing your urine every two days.

830
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,970
Don't miss any appointments with Dr. Donovan.

831
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,640
Can you live with that?

832
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,240
Do you have a couch?

833
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:48,000
