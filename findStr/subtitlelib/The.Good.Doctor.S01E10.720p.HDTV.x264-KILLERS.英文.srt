22
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,570
Good news. I have a VIP who needs a multiple ligament

23
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,950
reconstruction on his elbow,

24
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,720
and I've got room for a couple residents to assist me and Dr. Melendez.

25
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,550
Awesome.

26
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,340
I've never assisted on one of those before.

27
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,460
Dr. Andrews knows that.

28
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,000
That's why he's acting like it's Christmas morning.

29
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,830
I'm guessing you've never operated on a pro athlete, either.

30
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,540
Um, last time I checked,

31
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,000
a "Couple" means "Two," and there's three of us.

32
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,460
More good news.

33
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,900
Whoever isn't with us will be assisting Dr. Coyle

34
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,990
on a double-leg fasciotomy.

35
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,280
Feeling lucky?

36
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,000
Murphy.

37
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,110
VIP elbow. Sweet.

38
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,510
Fasciotomy.

39
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,980
Bobby Ato? Don't think I've heard of him.

40
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,260
He's a pro athlete?

41
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,060
He's a pro. I don't know if I'd call him in athlete.

42
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,140
E-sports.

43
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,210
Video games?

44
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,190
He's one of the best in the world.

45
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,430
Last year, he won enough prize money

46
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,500
to buy his mom a beach house in Monterey.

47
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,000
Paid cash.

48
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,770
Is he considered a very important person

49
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,850
because he's an athlete or because he has a lot of money?

50
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,710
- Both. - Both.

51
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,840
I have to go.

52
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,040
Morning, Shaun.

53
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,710
This is Melissa Bourne,

54
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,030
the therapist that we talked about.

55
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,450
That you agreed to meet with, right, Shaun?

56
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,200
Hi, Shaun. It's nice to meet you.

57
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,210
H-H-Hi.

58
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,230
Dr. Glassman thought it would be a good idea for us to meet

59
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,180
before our first in-home session.

60
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,950
Just to make sure you're comfortable.

61
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,490
I am not comfortable.

62
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,560
Shaun.

63
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,170
It's gonna be fine.

64
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,160
You two are going to like each other.

65
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,690
Dr. Bourne has a PhD in cognitive psychology.

66
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,660
She can really help you, but you have to give her a chance.

67
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,290
Okay?

68
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,790
'Kay. Okay.

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,910
I'm proud of you, Shaun.

70
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm already proud of you.

71
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,010
Notice the separation at zero degrees.

72
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,930
It's indicative of complete tears of the LCL and the UCL.

73
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,040
A perfect candidate for surgery.

74
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,940
How's your mom? Still beating cancer?

75
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,370
She's good, bro.

76
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,250
She said she gets checked out at the beach all the time

77
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,150
ever since you did her breast reconstruction.

78
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,660
So, uh, thanks. I guess.

79
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,560
We're gonna take good care of you.

80
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,340
- See you in the O.R. - Thank you.

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,930
Which part of the UCL is the principal secondary

82
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,270
to excessive valgus movement?

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,100
- Anterior. - Everything okay?

84
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,220
Yes, I'm fine.

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,060
I'm fine.

86
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,630
Squeeze my hands.

88
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,310
There is a paradoxical loss of grip strength on the left.

89
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,310
There are many possible explanations for that,

90
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,330
- one of which I-- - One of which is...

91
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,950
he has ligament tears in his left arm.

92
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,100
The anesthesiologist will be up in a few

93
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,500
to get you ready for surgery.

94
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,680
Dope. Thank you.

95
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,810
Dr. Murphy.

96
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,990
- What's wrong with you? - N-nothing.

97
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,600
I have a condition called --

98
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,780
You're autistic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, I get it.

99
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,430
But what is wrong with you, bro?

100
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,970
You gotta be legit smart to land a gig as a surgeon

101
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,820
and he just shut you down like a noob.

102
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,940
I'll bring the idea up again. I do that.

103
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,230
They don't respect you.

104
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,930
And they should listen to you the first time.

105
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,760
- I can't control what they do. - Of course you can.

106
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,240
That's what playing the game is all about.

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,000
It's about controlling your opponent.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
You gotta find the right strategy.

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
It is not a game.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,680
Everything's a game, man. Everything's a game.

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,370
Just sometimes the stakes are higher,

112
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,840
and this time it's my arm.

113
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,180
So, I'm guessing you drew the short straw.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,410
- I beg your pardon? - Well, you're here

115
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,760
and your co-residents are on the VIP case.

116
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,660
I'm awesome and I'd still rather be with Melendez and Andrews.

117
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,780
- No, it's fine -- - Relax. It's cool.

118
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,280
Tell me about our patient.

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,350
Uh, 34-year-old female, software engineer and entrepreneur

120
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,390
presenting with Compartment Syndrome caused by extreme overexertion at a spin class.

121
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,370
The condition has caused the muscles in her legs to --

122
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,420
- Okay. Great. - I wasn't finished.

123
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,580
Finished enough to show me you're smart and thorough.

124
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,640
You know the treatment plan?

125
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,390
- We need to make incisions on -- - Good.

126
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,300
You take lead.

127
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,810
We need to make a number of long incisions

128
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,930
down both sides of each leg to relieve the tension

129
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,920
and return healthy circulation.

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,130
It's important we act quickly.

131
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,150
If we don't get the swelling under control,

132
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,040
the damage could be irreparable.

133
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,680
What does that mean? I could lose my legs?

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,730
From working out too hard in a spin class?

135
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,910
No, don't worry. Your sister's gonna be just fine.

136
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,200
Look, I'm very confident we caught this in time.

137
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,360
If you could lean forward?

138
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,930
I just need to check your kidneys haven't been affected.

139
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,200
Let me know if you have any tenderness.

140
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,490
Extracting the palmaris now.

141
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,410
Dr. Andrews, I read your op-ed in Gen Surge News.

142
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,580
Brilliant piece.

143
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,500
Never realized the lack of continuity of care

144
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
was such a severe problem.

145
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,970
Dr. Melendez...

146
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,740
you have very beautiful hair.

147
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,170
Thank you.

148
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,490
Given the patient's grip weakness,

149
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,670
we could do a nerve conduction test

150
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,860
to rule out any concurrent nerve damage.

151
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,590
No.

152
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,810
Okay, that looks like a good stopping point.

153
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,070
Dr. Kalu...step in.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,020
- Something wrong? -No, it looks good.

155
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,920
I just want to give Dr. Kalu an opportunity

156
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
to show us what he can do.

157
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,000
As long as that's okay with you.

158
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Sure.

159
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,510
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,880
All right, looking good.

161
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,630
Let's move to the lateral side.

162
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,600
So, what are we doing tonight, ladies?

163
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,120
How about we go to Viva's?

164
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,390
Sounds good.

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,660
Bovie.

166
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,630
You're awfully quiet over there, Dr. Browne.

167
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,230
I'm just focused.

168
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,990
I know you're used to operating with Melendez,

169
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,220
but we have fun here.

170
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,930
I feel like when it's less tense,

171
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,470
people make fewer mistakes.

172
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,570
Okay.

173
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,270
You wanna take the other leg?

174
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,440
Really?

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,470
Yeah, best way to learn is by doing it, right?

176
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,330
Definitely.

177
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,390
So go for it.

178

Shaun, good morning.

191
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,150
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

192
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,130
How'd it go with Melissa?

193
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,740
She was...

194
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,500
very helpful.

195
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,490
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday, Shaun.

196
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,250
After you.

197
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,460
Apparently we are at an impasse.

198
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,080
I feel strongly that Melissa can be very helpful to you.

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,650
You feel so strongly that she can't

200
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,230
that you're willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep and hygiene.

201
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,600
Shaun, you smell.

202
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,080
I will shower in the doctor's lounge.

203
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,500
Well, great.

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,560
That solves one problem.

205
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,710
You stayed here all night just to avoid a confrontation.

206
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,440
Just say "No," Shaun.

207
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,650
You know? Just say "No."

208
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,490
No!

209
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,340
No.

210
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,300
Great. That's just great.

211
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,360
I don't have to see Melissa?

212
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,920
No, you don't have to see Melissa.

213
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,210
You're a grown man. You can make your own decisions.

214
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,760
I just happen to feel that she could be of great help to you.

215
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
That...

216
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,490
I'll tell you what.

217
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,170
You see Melissa three times

218
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,570
and I will buy you the surround-sound system you want for your television.

219
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you bribing me?

220
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,170
I suppose I am.

221
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,290
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,710
And I promise I will never say another word about it.

223
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,490
That's a pretty good deal.

224
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,460
Okay.

225
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,010
Okay.

226
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,890
I will meet with her tonight.

227
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,350
That's good, Shaun.

228
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,990
Saline? I've never seen it done quite like that.

229
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,220
Yeah, I had a professor from Portugal.

230
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,190
Apparently it's how they do it over there.

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,390
It's supposed to lessen the pain.

232
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,340
Well, the good news is your tissue is nice and pink,

233
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,640
which means it's healthy.

234
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,790
Unfortunately, the swelling is not coming down like we'd hoped.

235
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,120
Does this mean you're going to have to amputate?

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,300
No, no. Sometimes it just takes time.

237
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,740
We'll take care of you.

238
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,190
Very nice work, Dr. Browne.

239
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,350
Can you do me a solid and trade patients?

240
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,720
No, not a chance. Andrews let me take lead.

241
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,180
Coyle let me take lead, too.

242
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,750
So what is the problem?

243
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,860
He's a little too friendly.

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,140
He patted my back in a weird way.

245
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,850
I don't know. It was -- It was awkward.

246
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,870
I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.

247
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,610
Maybe?

248
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,860
I don't...

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,980
Shaun? Switch?

250
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,770
No.

251
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,490
I like Bobby.

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,080
He has very good advice.

253
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,100
So, who did what?

254
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,200
Well, I did, uh, most of the surgery along with Dr. Andrews

255
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,140
and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing one of your torn ligaments.

256
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,480
You should be back in competition shape in a few weeks time.

257
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,890
Word.

258
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,020
What about you? What'd you do?

259
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,210
I helped to clean the grafted tendons.

260
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,910
That's it.

261
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,730
Yes.

262
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,370
Come on. You didn't get up in there?

263
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,100
Y-Your muscle weakness

264
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,320
along with the high body temperature

265
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,010
could be an early indicator of multiple sclerosis.

266
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,860
We should order an MRI.

267
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,170
We have talked about this countless times.

268
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,210
Yes. We should order an MRI.

269
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,600
We are not ordering an MRI.

270
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,940
You don't respect me.

271
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,420
Not right now, I don't.

272
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,250
Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez.

273
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,980
Given the fact we're dealing with a pro athlete,

274
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,080
even the slightest hiccup could be problematic.

275
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,890
I think Bobby would be impressed by our being extra attentive.

276
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,790
Kalu is right.

277
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,530
he is a pro athlete in his prime earning years.

278
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,810
We should make sure we leave him 100%.

279
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,370
Do the MRI.

280
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,640
Nice score. You got 'em to listen.

281
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,060
Do the MRI.

282
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,450
No, Jared did.

283
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,790
How did he get there when you couldn't?

284
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,370
He asked nicely.

285
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,350
Okay, you asked nicely.

286
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,650
Yes. Yes, I did.

287
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,160
You gotta be fierce if you want the glory, bro.

288
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,490
Oh, no.

289
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,000
I do not want the glory, bro.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,910
I just want to be a good surgeon.

291
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,140
Everyone wants glory.

292
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,890
It -- It's how you get what you want.

293
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,470
And everybody's got wants.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,660
I want a surround-sound speaker system.

295
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,080
To get it, I have to see a therapist.

296
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,190
I don't want to have to see a therapist.

297
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,980
Okay, yeah, that's -- that's how I got my first PS2.

298
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,750
Yeah, my parents bribed me to go to therapy after they split up.

299
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,700
What was therapy like?

300
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,580
Pretty basic, bro.

301
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,660
She'd tell me what to do,

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,890
how to deal with my parents.

303
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,930
Was it helpful?

304
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,110
I don't know.

305
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,510
I never did anything she told me to do.

306
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,670
Is that an option?

307
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,720
Doing whatever the hell you feel like doing is always an option.

308
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,910
Just a gentle reminder --

309
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,430
dinner with my dad tonight at 8:00.

310
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,810
It is on my calendar.

311
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,270
So was the Gypsy Kings concert,

312
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,230
and I -- I seem to remember...

313
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,450
Fair enough.

314
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,850
How is the VIP case?

315
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,410
Shaun seems off about something.

316
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,210
Did you talk to him?

317
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,660
Yes. Because talking to Shaun solves problems.

318
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,110
And Andrews is...

319
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,780
He's a pain in your ass.

320
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,270
No. He's actually too friendly.

321
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,790
Jared kisses his ass and suddenly he's cutting.

322
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,130
Well, ass kissing is a useful skill for a surgeon.

323
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,050
That's a very beautiful blouse.

324
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,260
Do I still have to go to dinner?

325
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes. It'll be nice.

326
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,190
You'll have some nice wine and my dad will pay.

327
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,950
He'll push us to set a wedding date.

328
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,140
April 25th.

329
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,250
Did you book something?

330
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,060
No.

331
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,420
But my dad doesn't need to know that.

332
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,860
What do you got?

333
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,540
Looks like the surgically repaired elbow is fine.

334
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,270
As I suspected.

335
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,410
But Murphy noticed something in the periphery,

336
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,160
a little higher up, just above the bicep.

337
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,170
It was my idea.

338
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,920
Yes, I just said that.

339
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,600
So, we took an image from higher up and noticed this.

340
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,780
It's encasing the entirety of his brachial plexus.

341
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,620
This thing is massive.

342
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,280
Biopsy indicated it's definitely a schwannoma.

343
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,410
And it's definitely malignant.

344
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,810
It's in a tricky spot, but you might be able to remove it.

345
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,850
Follow it up with a combo of radiotherapy and chemo to finish it o...

346
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,900
What? What's the problem?

347
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,280
Robert Ato. Bobby Ato. Pro-gamer Bobby Ato?

348
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,150
You a fan?

349
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,510
I met him three years ago.

350
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,000
Oncology consult for SF Muni.

351
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,850
He had cancer three years ago?

352
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,590
Why the hell wouldn't you tell us that you had already had cancer?

353
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,460
It was in my lower leg three years ago.

354
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,250
How's that gonna change how you fix my elbow?

355
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,790
It would have a huge effect on how I viewed the symptoms that Dr. Murphy noticed.

356
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,580
You didn't listen to Dr. Murphy

357
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,090
because you don't respect him.

358
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,460
'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.

359
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,590
I respect him.

360
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,530
He has good ideas, and he has bad ideas.

361
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,570
Turns out this was a good one. That you shot down.

362
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,410
Why did you hide the truth?

363
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,450
A previous cancer diagnosis isn't shameful.

364
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,630
After the first diagnosis, all I was thinking was,

365
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,820
"Will it come back? How bad will it be?"

366
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,180
I was distracted, man.

367
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,640
I couldn't focus, and I hit a slump --

368
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,930
Wait, you were worried that cancer was messing with your gaming?

369
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,100
Yeah, man!

370
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,860
It cost me a championship.

371
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,460
I decided to block it out along with all the thoughts

372
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,340
of negativity and physical weakness,

373
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,350
and like that, I became the best in the world.

374
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,960
We need to do a full-body scan

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,180
to make sure the cancer has not already metastasized.

376
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,870
What he said.

377
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,470
What I said.

378
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,030
This looks great.

379
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,620
The swelling is starting to reduce.

380
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,580
We can start tightening the sutures.

381
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,540
Finally some good news.

382
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,560
You look like you're doing better, too...

383
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,090
now your boss is gone.

384
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,840
Dr. Coyle? He's fine.

385
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,180
You don't have to toe the party line with me.

386
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,200
Trust me. I get it.

387
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,560
I almost rode myself to death in a spin class

388
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,350
because I overheard a couple of investors say

389
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,110
that they "liked the concept just fine,"

390
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,970
but that my cankles were "too distracting."

391
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,930
What? Your idea is brilliant.

392
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,800
And you're beautiful. Screw those jackasses.

393
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,430
Grace, you don't get it.

394
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,480
You got the face, perfect little hip-to-waist ratio,

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,090
and most VC firms are run by a bunch of bros,

396
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,230
so there is an inverse relationship between the size of my ass

397
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,840
and how much money I can raise.

398
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,080
Then you should do something else

399
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,060
where you don't have to deal with bros.

400
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,640
Like what, become a nun?

401
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
- Sorry. - You agree with her?

402
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,860
She nearly worked herself to death

403
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,990
trying to please some pigs with money?

404
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,130
She shouldn't have to.

405
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,080
Great. Let me know when you find utopia.

406
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,530
But until then, I love what I do.

407
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,750
So I got to play the game 'cause if I call them out,

408
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,050
I just get labeled a "Bitch," or even worse.

409
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,380
Your heart rate's going up.

410
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,030
Hazel?

411
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,690
Hazel?

412
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,580
She's barely moving any air.

413
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,200
Hazel, can you hear me?

414
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,810
Code blue! I need to intubate her.

415
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,540
Give me a laryngoscope and an ET tube.

416
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,820
Let's get her on 100% oxygen.

417
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,870
Code blue. 4 North, room 407.

418
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,830
Talk to me.

419
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,840
Her lungs --

420
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,980
I think it's a reperfusion injury.

421
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,360
There's no room in here.

422
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,060
Mallampati 3, maybe 4. You should take over.

423
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,450
You're doing fine. Here, use the bougie.

424
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,330
- You feel the epiglottis? - I think so.

425
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,200
Okay, go a bit further, you should feel it stop.

426
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,000
If it keeps going, you're in the esophagus.

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,970
It stopped, got it. ET tube?

428
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,230
It's gonna be okay.

429
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,190
Strong work, Doctor.

430
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,650
Best in the world or not, this guy's insane.

431
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,470
Hiding from a diagnosis?

432
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,000
Doesn't work -- it'll find you.

433
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,430
Bobby wanted to be the best. He is the best.

434
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,820
I don't think he was trying to be the best.

435
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,920
I think he was just scared.

436
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,930
What's that? Next to the brain stem.

437
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,990
Another schwannoma.

438
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,270
So much for the power of positive thinking.

439
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,100
He's a strange kid. He had cancer.

440
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,800
Stopped going to follow-ups because he started losing.

441
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,790
What's so strange?

442
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,740
Sounds like a classic case of denial.

443
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,530
I was thinking we could try something new.

444
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,600
Maybe gamma knife?

445
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,510
I don't think so. Wrong type of tumor for that.

446
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,500
What if I told you every few months

447
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,860
that you had a real possibility you were gonna die?

448
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,500
I'd be scared. And I'd listen.

449
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,530
Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't.

450
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,530
Personally, I think he's right --

451
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,000
shut down those voices of doom,

452
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,070
spend your days living instead of dying.

453
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,230
But he may also be crazy.

454
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,990
Short of making him a vegetable,

455
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,970
I don't know if there's anything we can do.

456
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,470
Is -- Is Shaun okay?

457
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,880
Is his work okay?

458
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,040
Yes, I just, um --

459
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,180
Then he's fine.

460
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,900
Damn.

461
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,340
Horse walks into a bar.

462
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,830
Bartender says...

463
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,450
We found another mass.

464
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,110
That's not how it goes, but cool.

465
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,150
Let's knock it out, too.

466
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,480
The mass is located on your brain stem.

467
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,270
Which controls your autonomic nervous system --

468
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,900
your heart, respiration.

469
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,400
Its positioning makes it inoperable.

470
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,880
I...had a good run.

471
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,470
Wish it was longer, but...

472
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,050
I'm gonna go out on top.

473
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,810
If you went out today,

474
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,290
could you say the same thing?

475
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,240
She's lucky you were there.

476
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,770
Me? You're the one who saved her.

477
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,790
With your help. A lot of it.

478
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,030
So, thank you.

479
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,970
Hey, look, you wanna -- you wanna get a drink?

480
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,180
Maybe take the edge off?

481
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,090
No. But thank you, though.

482
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,520
Are you sure? I promise you'll have fun.

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,370
I give great massages.

484
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.

485
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,650
That's really inappropriate.

486
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,060
I said no.

487
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm sorry. W-W-- Where's this coming from?

488
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,490
You were -- You were clearly giving me signals.

489
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,600
No, the only "Signal" I gave you

490
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,090
was that I wasn't interested in the slightest.

491
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,720
Okay, see, I just -- I heard about you and Kalu

492
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,210
banging in the call room, so I figured --

493
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,030
This conversation is over. You're an ass.

494
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm pretty easygoing,

495
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,250
but you're approaching insubordination.

496
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,590
You're gonna report me?

497
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,180
I'm not gonna report anybody.

498
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
But maybe next time,

499
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,770
try not to have such a stick up your ass about being asked out.

500
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,000
Come on.

501
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,040
I always thought Bunny was the cutest nickname.

502
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,620
Of course you did, but you could've stopped calling me that

503
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,770
when I was 12 or -- or 20.

504
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,100
Rough day?

505
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,250
Yeah. Yeah, it was something.

506
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,200
Well, this should make you a little happier.

507
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,320
I have decided to take care of your entire wedding.

508
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,830
We don't need it.

509
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,260
You're welcome.

510
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,460
We're not 21.

511
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,450
We're more than capable of paying for our own wedding.

512
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,740
We make good money.

513
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,000
But you won't once you start having kids, Bunny.

514
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,750
What are you doing in here?

515
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,900
I'm hiding from my therapist.

516
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,880
I am not going to get a surround-sound speaker system.

517
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,000
But I am doing whatever the hell I feel like doing.

518
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,730
Can you hand me that mop?

519
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,750
Okay.

520
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,460
Are you satisfied with what you've done with your life?

521
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,580
Would you be happy if you died tomorrow?

522
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,000
Satisfied?

523
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,390
Happy?

524
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,900
I mean, I clean up a building, uh...

525
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,780
But I -- I married the love of my life.

526
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,040
Uh, we raised three beautiful kids.

527
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,890
One of them had some troubles, but she's doing great now.

528
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,890
The other two are doing all right for themselves.

529
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,640
And I was good to people.

530
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,640
At least I think I was.

531
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,070
That's a very good answer.

532
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,340
I got pictures of the girls if you want see --

533
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,180
No.

534
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,940
So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?

535
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,210
Agreed.

536
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,520
She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.

537
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,120
Yes, she can, but why?

538
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,930
W-Why waste your time working?

539
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,170
You should be enjoying life, like me.

540
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,730
There's plenty in the family trust.

541
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,290
Dad, my work is important. I'm helping people --

542
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,810
Bunny... you're pushing papers.

543
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,270
How -- How is that really helping anyone?

544
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,080
And maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't get it.

545
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,960
I-I thought you were smarter than that.

546
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,060
You'd prefer her to be a lazy parasite

547
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,100
living off a trust fund

548
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
as opposed to actually contributing to society?

549
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,950
Parasite?

550
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,700
My father made a lot of money.

551
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,260
I'm not going to apologize for that.

552
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,310
He made sure his children and his grandchildren could enjoy their lives.

553
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,430
I'm not hurting anyone.

554
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,520
In fact, I go out of my way to help people.

555
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,160
So I'm sorry if that doesn't qualify me as a worthwhile person in your book.

556
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,950
I'll get the check on my way out.

557
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,910
Dad, you don't have to...

558
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,420
What am I doing wrong, Shaun?

559
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,220
I don't know.

560
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,900
I tried...

561
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,270
encouraging, I've tried being supportive,

562
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,510
I've tried bribing you.

563
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,520
I don't need a therapist. No.

564
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,640
Look around you. What -- You're sleeping --

565
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,560
What is this, a broom closet?

566
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,310
Look at the sacrifices you're willing to make

567
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,820
just to avoid...

568
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,910
We're gonna pick this up later.

569
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,740
You have to file a complaint with HR.

570
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,140
I do that and I get labeled "Hostile" and "Difficult,"

571
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,570
neither of which work with my complexion or gender.

572
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,970
All the more reason to take a stand.

573
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,530
Claire, this situation is exactly what HR is for.

574
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,080
I didn't say it was easy.

575
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,350
Yeah, you did.

576
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,230
Look, it's scary and it takes courage,

577
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,350
but it's the right thing to do.

578
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,730
It's a pointless thing to do.

579
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,360
- They'll listen to you. - They will shift the blame onto me.

580
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,440
Like you did.

581
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,350
Whoa, what? How did I --

582
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,350
I came to you,

583
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,160
you accused me of exaggerating to get back onto the case.

584
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,100
No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I had no idea --

585
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,680
I said he was too friendly.

586
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,360
You said he was "Trying to establish a rapport."

587
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm sleeping with you, Jared,

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,730
and you thought I was overreacting.

589
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,350
How do you think three strangers will see things?

590
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,510
Claire, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

591
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,560
Don't worry about it. It's just the way it is.

592
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,090
I've got a patient to round on.

593
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,880
Dr. Melendez and I had a talk

594
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,780
and we believe we can excise the tumor

595
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,370
if you're willing to make a sacrifice.

596
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Sacrifice?

597
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,520
That sounds better than death.

598
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,940
My thinking as well.

599
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,160
We believe we can remove the mass,

600
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,470
but we'll also have to take a piece out of your brain stem.

601
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,970
A chunk of the red nucleus,

602
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,390
which helps control the left side of your body.

603
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,940
You'll be paralyzed on that side.

604
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,110
It could also result in difficulty eating and swallowing.

605
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,790
Speech difficulties.

606
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,430
Let's do it.

607
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,750
Good for you.

608
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,830
Hold on. Hold on.

609
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,880
Bobby, this is very risky surgery.

610
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,520
You could die on the table, and even if all goes well,

611
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,550
you will be severely disabled.

612
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,810
Yeah, I -- I was listening, and I'm in.

613
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,310
Guys, hey, I get it.

614
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,310
If I'm dead, I'm -- I'm dead.

615
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,550
But if not -- PT, relearning stuff, whatever.

616
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,060
It's not gonna stop me from competing.

617
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,030
Not ever.

618
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,050
Bobby, your career is over.

619
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,620
We need you to understand that.

620
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,360
Yeah?

621
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,480
Once a gamer, always a gamer, huh?

622
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,580
You got my respect.

623
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,410
What the hell is your problem?

624
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,330
If you ever threaten Claire,

625
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,470
take a disrespectful tone,

626
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,510
or so much as look at her cross-eyed again,

627
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than put you up against a wall.

628
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,060
We clear?

629
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,600
Your lungs are looking a lot better.

630
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,980
Overall, you're in pretty good shape.

631
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,670
Thank you.

632
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,270
You're welcome.

633
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,650
All part of the service.

634
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,790
And good for you.

635
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,870
I wasn't sleeping.

636
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,630
I heard the way you handled that other doctor.

637
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,230
You heard that? All of it?

638
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,570
I wish I had done that.

639
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,050
You were brave.

640
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,860
No, no.

641
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,370
If I was brave, I --

642
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,700
Rick Allen.

644
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,080
- Who? - One-armed drummer for Def Leppard.

645
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,090
Come on, man.

646
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,060
And there is the tumor capsule.

647
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,610
Richie Parker. Anyone?

648
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,020
Isn't he a NASCAR guy? An engineer, right?

649
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,100
Born without arms?

650
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,140
And Nurse Ocampo gets the door prize.

651
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,780
And now we will take just a little piece

652
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,290
of our friend here -- a nice sample to test.

653
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,600
Thank you, Doctor.

654
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,800
And now the rest.

655
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,590
He may not be able to tie his own shoes,

656
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,390
but I wouldn't bet against him ever competing again.

657
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,080
Aut libertatem aut mortem mihi da.

658
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,740
Shaun, do you know that means?

659
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,200
No. It's not relevant to this surgery.

660
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,550
Oh, it's relevant. Look it up.

661
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,800
No, it's not.

662
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,560
Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.

663
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,300
Slight change in body temperature.

664
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,510
His heart rate's 108.

665
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,380
Check tube placement and suction him.

666
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,550
If he takes a turn, we might have to abort.

667
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,540
I don't think so. I'm too far in.

668
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,610
Keep him stable.

669
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,020
He's tachy. Heart rate's climbing.

670
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,650
115, 117, 120, and rising.

671
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,980
He is going into v-tach.

672
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,180
Robert Ato is dying.

673
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,470
I'm gonna pull out of the pons slowly.

674
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,450
Well, hold on. You pull out now,

675
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,010
you might damage the cerebellar peduncle.

676
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,910
If I don't get out now, I'll kill him if he starts seizing.

677
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,190
Something's not right. Tachycardia?

678
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,900
Bradycardia would make more sense.

679
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,010
- Ideas. - Anyone?

680
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,270
Tell me what you see.

681
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,430
Tachycardia, rising body temperature again,

682
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,200
muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising.

683
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,660
Muscle rigidity? Which side?

684
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,000
It's all over.

685
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,140
Then it's not the brain stem.

686
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,130
We'd only have muscle rigidity on one side.

687
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,070
Think. Tachycardia, rising temp, CO2...

688
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,210
CO2...

689
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
It's the anesthesia.

690
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,030
Malignant hyperthermia. Get the MH cart.

691
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,650
140 dantrolene, STAT.

692
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,370
Kalu, Murphy, get as many cooling blankets as you can.

693
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,540
We need to get this temperature down.

694
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,410
- Coming out. - Now!

695
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,690
Hyperventilate at 100% O2,

696
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,830
10 liters per minute.

697
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,110
Flush out the old anesthetic, lower the ETCO2.

698
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,260
I want vecuronium on deck. We got to keep him under.

699
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,330
Let's move!

700
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,930
And we're on.

701
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,730
Uh, temp's not coming down.

702
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,660
Wait.

703
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,400
CO2 is coming down.

704
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,830
Heart rate is coming down, too.

705
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,710
Temperature is 101.

706
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,670
Okay. Nice work, everyone.

707
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,900
Thank you very much.

708
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,740
Terry Fox.

709
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,550
Or my personal favorite -- Jim Abbott.

710
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,750
Come in.

711
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,870
I need to talk to you about Dr. Coyle.

712
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,310
Dr. Browne.

713
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,280
I wanted to talk to you about the same thing.

714
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,980
Please.

715
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,500
The surgery was a success.

716
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,680
And the outcome might be better than expected.

717
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,610
There will still be significant neurological dysfunction

718
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,540
on your left side, but not as much as we'd anticipated.

719
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,450
Sick!

720
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,940
Thank you.

721
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,870
You did good, my friend.

722
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,760
You have to be patient.

723
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,060
Nah.

724
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,900
Is patience a bad thing?

725
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,410
Acceptance is a bad thing.

726
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:57,440
When I was a kid, I -- I wasn't good at jack.

727
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,800
But I never quit.

728
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,290
I...

729
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,530
found my thing.

730
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,550
Don't ever let anyone tell you

731
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,170
what you can and can't...

732
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,690
do.

733
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,610
I'm sorry. For last night.

734
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,590
It was a rough day. I was tired.

735
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,260
Probably had a few too...

736
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,240
Your relationship with your father is your business --

737
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,530
Neil, you don't have to.

738
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,740
I'll call your dad, and --

739
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,880
I don't want to have kids.

740
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,060
Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home.

741
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,050
You're gonna see Melissa.

742
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,710
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

743
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
But there's no more running away.

744
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,870
Why do you think I'm doing this?

745
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,590
Because you are stubborn.

746
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,550
Ok-Okay, yeah, okay, sure. I'm stubborn.

747
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,870
But I'm doing this for you, okay?

748
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,550
So that you can have a better life,

749
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,640
so that you can have a happier life.

750
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,740
What if it doesn't make me happy?

751
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,790
What if it doesn't make me happy?

752
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,450
What if it only makes you happy?

753
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,600
You think -- You think I'm doing this to make me happy?

754
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,350
I'm not happy, Shaun.

755
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,250
I'm not close to being happy, and you know what?

756
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,890
I am done explaining,

757
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,900
I am done bribing, and I am done talking.

758
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,190
- Now let's go. - No. N-No. No!

759
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,670
- Let's go! - No!

760
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,700
No.

761
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,520
No, I -- I want to make my own decisions.

762
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
- I -- - Shaun, can you keep your voice down, please? Please?

763
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,360
You -- You cannot keep ordering me around, okay?

764
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,920
You're not my father!

765
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,190
I know that.

766
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,120
Shaun, I don't understand...

767
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,260
Okay.You don't let ...why this is so upsetting.

768
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,500
- Anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do.-- - I don't get it.

769
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,430
Shaun, let's just calm down now, please.

770
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,750
- Okay, okay. - Don't let anyone

771
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,910
ever tell you what you can and can't do!

772
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,080
Hey, just calm -- Shaun. Hey,

773
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,330
- I want to make my own decisions. - Shaun.

774
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,480
- I want to make my own decisions! - Okay, okay, okay.

775
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,230
- I'm just trying to help. - I want make my own --

776
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,460
- I don't want help! - Shaun!

777
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,060
I --

778
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,580
What were you thinking?!

779
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,960
I do not need you to fight my battles,

780
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,230
and I certainly never asked you to.

781
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,440
And if you really respected me,

782
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,510
you would not treat me like some damsel

783
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,740
who needed protection, okay?

784
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,200
You would treat me with the respect

785
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,550
that you would automatically give to a man.

786
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,760
You'd treat me like a person capable of handling her own life!

787
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,190
And maybe -- maybe it's too much to ask of you.

788
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,010
Apparently Andrews agrees with you.

789
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,020
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

790
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,840
Shaun? Shaun!

791
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,040
Where would he go?

792
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,140
Is there a place he likes to hang out,

793
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,630
a place where he feels comfortable?

794
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,810
No, I don't know.

795
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,500
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

796
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,090
And there used to be a picture here of Shaun...

797
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,730
and his brother, Steve.

798
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,950
What do you think that means?

799
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,650
It means he's not coming back.
