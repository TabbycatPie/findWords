1
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,833
That's the chess player?

2
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,666
She looks like Ann-Margret.

3
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,333
Let's hope the Russians like redheads.

4
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,083
In the words of Thomas Huxley,

5
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,166
"The chessboard is the world,

6
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,541
the pieces are
the phenomena of the Universe,

7
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,000
the rules of the game are

8
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,791
what we call the laws of Nature,

9
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,583
and the player on the other side

10
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,958
is hidden from us."

11
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,416
Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,250
dear comrades,

13
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,375
please welcome,

14
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,291
Thank you.

15
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,625
And maybe she takes with check.

16
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,708
He takes back.

17
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,000
But then she takes his rook.

18
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,750
So what? He's got h5.

19
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:58,083
Yes, that's a nasty pin.

20
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,166
And, she's done.

21
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:19,666
Elizabeth Harmon plays pawn to Queen four.

22
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,958
Borgov plays pawn to Queen four.

23
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,958
Harmon plays pawn to Queen Bishop four.

24
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,750
The Queen's Gambit.

25
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,833
Borgov declines,

26
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:35,375
moves pawn to King four.

27
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:38,375
The Albin Counter Gambit--

28
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,666
Knight to G6.

29
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,416
Go!

30
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:26,166
Knight to G6!

31
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:44,125
Let's play.
