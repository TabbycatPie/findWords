1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,550
I have to show a house today,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,340
so see you guys at Luke's football games.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,320
I'm too tired to go.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,560
I have a midterm tomorrow

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,370
which I'll probably fail. And I was up really late studying.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,350
She was. I was up really late doing this.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,560
Don't even bother coming. I'm quitting today.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,270
I'm sick of this guy in the team always making fun of me.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,050
He's just jealous because

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,890
you're the one who puts points on the board.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,540
Why?

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,810
- Because you run the scoreboard. - ...run the scoreboard.

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,610
I'm out, too.

14
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,160
But all your classmates will be there.

15
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,700
We ignore each other all week.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,290
It's nice to have a little break on the weekends.

17
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,070
Geez, I've never seen such a bunch of no-getters.

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,020
Coined it!

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,870
Remember, keep a positive attitude,

20
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,530
and good things will happen.

21
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,870
Two things I bring to every open house --

22
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,440
my lucky pen and a smile.

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,920
I haven't sold a house all month.

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,050
Do you see me saying "I'm done"? Never.

25
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,430
Because there is no "Done" in Dunphy.

26
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,500
I'll see you guys at the game.

27
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,730
Hey, there is no "Umph" in Dunph--

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,990
different spelling!

29
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,420
Cam!

30
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,550
Yes, Phil, I remember your special play,

31
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,770
but I think the triple gull-wing is a little tricky

32
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,000
to run at such an important sporting match.

33
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,970
Cam has a number of delightful superstitions

34
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,110
during the football season.

35
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,210
Well, they're not superstitions when they work.

36
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,780
That seems science-y.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,960
Not sorry that today is the last g-a-m-e.

38
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,220
Well, thank you, but good coaches don't need luck.

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,840
We make luck.

40
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,720
See you at the athletic endeavor.

41
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,130
I'm going to call Gloria

42
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,670
and see if she can pick up Lily, too,

43
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,690
you know, just in case...

44
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,960
What, you procrastinate again

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,330
and not tell Charlie you're quitting?

46
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,490
No, no! I'm gonna do it.

47
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,840
I just -- I'm picturing his face when I tell him,

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,560
shaking his head in disappointment.

49
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,900
It's -- it's hard.

50
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,810
- Hey, just do it! - No.

51
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,270
I don't know why you're making yourself so crazy over this.

52
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,080
You're right. You're right.

53
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,620
I -- I do not want to be crazy.

54
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,200
I'll see you at the game.

55
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,440
Hey, Gloria.

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,520
Yes, Mitch, I will pick her up.

57
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,030
Thank you so much! All right. Bye, Lily.

58
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,770
Good luck with the whole Patrick situation.

59
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,010
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

60
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,320
Well, welcome to the rest of your life, sweetheart.

61
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,660
So, Lily, tell me more about this Patrick.

62
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,230
He likes the swings, he sits by the flag,

63
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,100
and he can count to 100.

64
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,750
He sounds like the whole package.

65
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,920
Then what is the problem?

66
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,240
He doesn't notice me.

67
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,330
So then make him notice you.

68
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,040
You don't want to wake up one morning

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,220
as a lonely 9-year-old,

70
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,720
wondering where all the time went.

71
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,150
Hey, mom. If you're at the store later,

72
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,320
could you pick up some ice?

73
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm gonna need it for after the game.

74
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,650
My little athlete.

75
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,240
I want to try out the gelato maker I traded my bike for.

76
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,000
Lures me in every time.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Oh, okay. Bye.

78
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,710
Dad, you can just drop me at the next light.

79
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,520
I can walk from there,

80
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,810
and I got to call Phil anyway.

81
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,850
You did the same thing yesterday.

82
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,180
Why? What's going on with you?

83
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,760
- You smoking again? - No! No.

84
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
I just -- I don't want to put a spotlight

85
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,520
on the fact that I'm the boss's daughter.

86
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,460
It makes people resent me.

87
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,930
- This is good. Thanks, dad. - Yeah.

88
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,000
- Bye. - Bye.

89
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,520
I can see that bothers you.

90
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Well, yeah, your own kid,

91
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
embarrassed to be seen with you,

92
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,510
you know what I mean?

93
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,970

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,250
Last month, a law-school classmate offered me a job

99
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,560
at his legal aid society,

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,190
and I just knew I had to take it.

101
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,370
And I explained that in a letter

102
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,730
that I was going to sneak onto Charlie's desk.

103
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,340
Oh, good. It's you.

104
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,460
Did you sleep here?

105
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,570
My girlfriend dumped me, uh, in an e-mail.

106
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,410
Couldn't even do it face-to-face.

107
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,300
Pretty gutless, huh?

108
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,640
Oh, you should go home, get some rest.

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,780
I can't go back there. It would be too hard.

110
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,060
Mm, too many memories?

111
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,320
No, we were living on my boat.

112
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,650
I don't know where she took it.

113
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,200
Enough of my whining. What do you need?

114
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,690
Oh, well, I just -- I just came by to say hi. Hi.

115
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,970
And also, mm, to tell you in a very gut-ful fashion,

116
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,020
face-to-face,

117
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,040
about something that I have been thinking about.

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,010
But I do think that, um, I am going to have to leave

119
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,780
about five minutes early today.

120
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,760
Uh, Cam is -- is coaching a high-school football game.

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,170
- I'm in. - What?

122
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,400
Certainly not gonna be able to focus on any of this today.

123
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,060
Yeah, I need a shot of marching bands,

124
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,090
fresh-cut grass, rosy-cheeked kids.

125
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,280
Do they still run through a banner?

126
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,540
- They do! - I love that. I love that.

127
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,350
OK. So the game's at what, like, 4:00?

128
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,570
We should probably -- hey! Give me that.

129
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,770
I'm --

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,230
This is my private cell.

131
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,450
Only three people in the whole world use this.

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,700
Two people.

133
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,810
Uh, Claire, is, uh -- is there a reason

134
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,110
you didn't sign this shipping form?

135
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, no. Sorry. I'll do it now.

136
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,640
Oh, no. No. Now's a little late.

137
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,850
See, they came in this morning,

138
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,080
and they can't do a thing without a manager's signature.

139
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,570
So now I've got 100 rosewood panels lined up in the warehouse.

140
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,940
On the future, I'd appreciate it --

141
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,690
Hey, hey, Tim. I think you made your point.

142
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,180
It was an honest mistake, all right?

143
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,560
- Dad. - I'm just saying that it's what a warehouse is for,

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,650
to hold things.

145
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,580
- Not the end of the world. - Right. Of course.

146
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,110
- Sorry. - No, I'm sorry.

147
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,220
It's my fault. Bye, Tim. Bye!

148
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,650
Dad!

149
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,510
This is exactly what I was talking about in the car this morning!

150
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,520
I want them to see me like a co-worker,

151
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
not somebody who's getting special treatment

152
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,330
'cause she's the boss' daughter.

153
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,280
Is it possible you're being a little oversensitive here?

154
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
No, I'm not. I'm being -- wow, here? Really?!

155
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,020
You know, you gave me this.

156
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,070
- Look how adorable you were. - Okay. Okay. Okay.

157
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,950
I want you to try really hard to hear what I'm saying.

158
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,580
When I need your help, I will ask for it.

159
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,840
And until then, just butt out.

160
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,330
What happened to you?

161
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,580
Hey, Miller, your toes are looking a little lonely.

162
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,800
Why don't you pay them a visit?

163
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,290
What's with the extra warm-ups, coach?

164
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,740
These guys haven't won all year.

165
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,990
Did you hear that, team?

166
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,120
Miller just bought you a little present.

167
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,830
I wasn't complaining. I was just wondering why we have to --

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,890
Take a lap!

169
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Burt Levoisier, Red Stagg,

170
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,900
Duckie Pond --

171
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,090
All coaching legends at this high school,

172
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,540
and none have won more than two games their first season.

173
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,300
I win today, that makes three,

174
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,980
making me the winningest first-year freshman coach ever.

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh, hey, Luke, Reuben's sick,

176
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,970
so I'm gonna need you to be the announcer today.

177
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,690
How am I supposed to keep score and announce at the same time?

178
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,600
Same way you're a spaz and a dork at the same time, spork.

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,300
Okay, lose the attitude, but keep that intensity.

180
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,140
Uh, hey, excuse me, ref.

181
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,960
What's with all the black arm bands?

182
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,970
Their coach passed away last night.

183
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,240
He'd been sick for a while.

184
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,630
That's terrible. And we're still playing?

185
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, they're tough kids.

186
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,890
Roger Knight lived for high-school football,

187
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,720
so they're playing this one in his honor.

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,350
Okay, hey, guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

189
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,140
Tragic news about coach Knight.

190
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,400
But you know what? We need to focus up.

191
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,110
Plenty of time to pay our respects,

192
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,500
but there will be no mourning Knight this afternoon.

193
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,310
- Lot of character over there. - Yep.

194
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,630
- Those kids haven't won a game all year. - Uh-huh.

195
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,050
And now to have to play on his birthday...

196
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,470
Okay, see you at the coin toss.

197
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,310
Top of the morning!

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,400
Real estate and,

199
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,460
to a lesser extent, life

200
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,320
is all about perseverance.

201
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,200
Things go wrong.

202
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,290
Keys get lost, deals fall through, keys get misplaced.

203
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,000
Uh, a lot of it has to do with keys.

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,410
But that's when you find out there are two types of people --

205
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,270
those who waste time staring at a closed door...

206
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,840
and those who find a window.

207
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,650
I'm looking at my first month ever without a sale.

208
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,150
Some people might give up.

209
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,800
But those people aren't Phil Dunphy.

210
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,050
No!

211
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,280
It's like I tell my kids --

212
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,850
keep a positive attitude and things will fall your way.

213
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,980
As my favorite redhead once sang,

214
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,340
the sun will come out tomorrow.

215
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,390
That redhead, of course, was Mitchell,

216
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,780
introducing me to the plucky orphan Annie...

217
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,710
...whose never-say-die attitude pulled this country

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,470
out of a little thing called...

219
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,170
the great depression.

220
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,240
And anything a little girl can do, I can try to do, too.

221
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,650
Hey, guys! Welcome back!

222
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,020
Drink it in!

223
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,890
Pretty great, huh?

224
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,460
Oh, am I glad you guys could see this during the daytime.

225
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,320
I really think it shows better like that.

226
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,380
So?

227
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,040
Should we just cut to the chase and pay me my commission?

228
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,690
I'm kidding. You don't pay me directly.

229
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,670
There's no fee in Dun-- Phil.

230
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,200
Listen, Phil, we've got some great news.

231
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,280
I love it! Where's my lucky pen?

232
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,990
We wanted to tell you this in person.

233
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,940
- We just came from the doctor. - I'm pregnant!

234
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,710
Oh, my god! You guys!

235
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,580
Except we decided to put off buying the house

236
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,700
- until after the baby's born. - Sure.

237
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,920
- We've been trying for, like, six years. - Sure.

238
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,540
For a while there,

239
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,350
it seemed like the universe was against us.

240
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,120
That's ridiculous.

241
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Why would the universe be against one person?

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,490
Here, have a spirit sticker!

243
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,390
Don't be the only student without one.

244
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,730
I actually go to this school!

245
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,210
Wow, you really are invisible, huh?

246
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,000
I could not be more fine with it.

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,580
You're like that guy from that movie

248
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,200
who wishes he was never born.

249
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,760
"It's a Wonderful Life".

250
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,660
You say that, but do you mean it?

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
Beautiful day here at Red Stagg field.

252
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,910
Kicking off for the home team is number 44,

253
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,840
Jason Miller,

254
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,070
who also plays lacrosse, soccer, and all the girl parts

255
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,390
when he and his friends act out

256
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,730
"High School Musical".

257
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,640
Quite possibly the only girl parts he'll ever see.

258
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,220
Haley!

259
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,840
Hey, Dylan!

260
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,550
I didn't realize you were coming here.

261
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,490
Are you kidding?

262
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,120
This place was like a home to me.

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,850
It's like I was homeschooled.

264
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,680
But I wasn't. I was school-schooled.

265
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,770
Were you?

266
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,710
I got six kinds of pills in my pocket,

267
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,550
but this here, all this, this is the best medicine.

268
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,390
Aw, I'm glad you're feeling better.

269
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,330
So, Charlie, I --

270
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,790
I'm here to get Lily.

271
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,740
Oh, before I call her, we had a small issue today.

272
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,250
One of the boys, Patrick, said Lily pushed him down

273
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,600
and tried to kiss him.

274
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,580
No, that doesn't sound like Lily.

275
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,810
She was probably imitating something she saw

276
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,430
on TV or in her family --

277
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,140
Ay, it was the TV, yes.

278
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,980
Oh, but here she is. She's always so sweet.

279
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,980
Bye, Patrick.

280
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,370
You see? They're just friends.

281
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,080
What are you laughing at, Evan?

282
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,420
You're next.

283
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,020
Okay, I'm going to talk to her for a little bit.

284
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh, did I ever tell you that I put your name up here?

285
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,340
Huh?

286
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,300
"Haley Dunphy dome."

287
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,560
Aww, you named our special spot?

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,220
Actually it was supposed to be "Haley Dunphy, do me."

289
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,190
I'm bad with spacing.

290
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,850
Oh, you're not so bad.

291
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,120
And that's halftime -- Panthers 6, Dolphins 0.

292
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,990
That zero score by Jason Miller,

293
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,090
who proudly prances off the field.

294
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,140
Just let me go up there and kick that kid's butt.

295
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,500
Knock it off, Miller. I need your leg.

296
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,470
Take a knee.

297
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,530
Now, I don't know what tuna net you Dolphins swam into,

298
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,330
but you are drowning out there!

299
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,900
Coach, would it really be such a bad thing if we lost?

300
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,000
- Beg your pardon? - Look at them, coach.

301
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,630
Haven't they lost enough already?

302
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,210
Maybe giving them a win would,

303
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,970
in a way, be a victory for us, too.

304
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,450
Okay, you know what mattered the most to coach Knight?

305
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,770
His work with special-needs kids?

306
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,820
Okay, he took one kid to one beach one time.

307
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,980
Football!

308
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,520
Football is what mattered the most!

309
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,330
He lived for competition!

310
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,740
He believed in sportsmanship, integrity!

311
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay? Now, the way I see it, we can roll over

312
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,510
and give them an empty, meaningless victory

313
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,290
that he... would hate.

314
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,620
Or we can go out there, leave it all on the field,

315
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,010
and be a team he would be proud to lose to.

316
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,420
Now, is this an "I" activity or a "We" activity?!

317
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,560
- We! - What?!

318
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,360
- We! - What?!

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,920
- We! We! We! We! We! We! - That's right!

320
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,780
Now you sound like dolphins!

321
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,410
Hey, Tim!

322
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,010
I got the next three days of delivery slips

323
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,500
for you here, signed, huh?

324
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
- Thanks, Claire. - Yeah.

325
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,440
Signed those up good, huh?

326
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,680
Thanks.

327
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,690
So, this is -- this is the, uh, the regency birch?

328
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,540
Beautiful model. Gorgeous.

329
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,460
You guys do such good work down here.

330
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,890
Really, you mind if I take her for a spin

331
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,110
before she goes up to the showroom?

332
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,390
- You're the boss... - 's daughter.

333
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,370
That's what you want to say.

334
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,460
Oh, okay. So, no mirror when they're shipping, which makes sense.

335
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,030
Also have, uh... no handles.

336
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,170
Hey -- hey, Tim?

337
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,110
Hey, Tim!

338
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,550
Tim!

339
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,570
Oh, god. Yeah, hi, dad.

340
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,700
Hey, co-worker.

341
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,490
Just seeing when you want to leave for the game.

342
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,150
- We're late already. - Soon, soon.

343
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm -- I'm just -- I'm finishing up

344
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,080
a little paperwork in my office.

345
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,790
Okay. Let me know if you need any help.

346
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,040
No, I do not need your help.

347
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,030
And as I believe I mentioned, I would appreciate it

348
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,790
if you were not constantly looking over my shoulder.

349
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,910
Come on. Give me some credit.

350
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,480
That's the last thing I would do.

351
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,140
Dad, you seem to forget that I raised three children,

352
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,850
and I had a career before this.

353
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,180
I have done plenty of stuff that does not --

354
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,870
Do you hear that?

355
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
Sounds like it's coming from the warehouse.

356
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Yeah, what even is that?

357
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,060
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

358
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
Uh, one piece of advice -- take it or leave it.

359
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,780
What?

360
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,680
The latch is under the panel on the right.

361
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,660
I got you mustard and sauerkraut, just what you like.

362
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,750
You're being awfully nice,

363
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,860
considering I started that whole closet-nado.

364
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,080
Well, you're still my daughter.

365
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,790
It's okay I call you that here, right?

366
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,780
Yeah.

367
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,730
Listen, it's hard for me to treat you like everyone else.

368
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,990
You're the only one I carried home in my arms --

369
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,230
Except Dontrell, last year's Christmas party.

370
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,540
I pretty much poured him through his sunroof.

371
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,510
But I'll try.

372
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,900
-Thanks, dad.  -You got plans this weekend?

373
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,540
- No. Not really. Why? - Good.

374
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,330
Be at the warehouse, 8:00 tomorrow.

375
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,650
Wear something you don't care about.

376
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,100
Hey, guys.

377
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,080
Hi, honey.

378
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,030
What'd I miss?

379
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,150
Nothing good.

380
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,240
We're down by 6 with 3 minutes to play.

381
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,040
Well, they could still turn it around.

382
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,190
Show's not over till the fat -- mama!

383
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,880
Sensational punt by Miller, who hasn't kicked that high

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,410
since he broke the gender barrier

385
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,410
and joined our own modern dance troupe.

386
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,860
- Are you okay, honey? - Yeah!

387
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,310
It's all about keeping an attitive positude.

388
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,860
Positude attitive.

389
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,880
Hey, we should see a midnight movie tonight,

390
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,820
like old times.

391
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,530
Oh, my god. I am so in!

392
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,770
Cool. Cool.

393
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,110
I'll come by your house around 11:30 with the ladder?

394
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't need to climb out of my window anymore, Dylan.

395
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,550
Oh, ooh. Can we do it earlier? I have a midterm tomorrow.

396
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,890
Oh, I can't do earlier.

397
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,430
I've got to meet up with some classmates from nursing school.

398
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,070
You're gonna be a nurse?

399
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,700
Yeah, I figured it was a natural next step.

400
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,570
I've always healed people with my music,

401
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,060
and now I'm just doing the same thing with drugs.

402
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,630
Wow. Well, ye-- another time, then.

403
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,570
- Yeah. - Yeah.

404
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,170
Hey, if everything goes well,

405
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,160
maybe one day I'll see you in the hospital.

406
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,530
I'd like that.

407
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,050
So, I finally get out of the closet,

408
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,120
and there's dad looking down at me.

409
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,140
Been there.

410
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,470
The whole daddy thing, though,

411
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,950
it's really one of your bigger issues.

412
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,620
At least my daddy issues are with my actual daddy.

413
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,690
I don't run around making every authority figure

414
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,180
I meet into a father.

415
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,060
Wait.

416
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,130
W-what's that supposed to mean?

417
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,530
Mitchell, come on.

418
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,350
Why have you not quit your job yet?

419
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,660
His girlfriend just broke up with him.

420
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,100
Yeah, and what was your excuse last week?

421
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,830
I had a cold.

422
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,580
And the week before?

423
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,920
I felt a cold coming on.

424
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,530
Mitchell, this fell out of your jacket.

425
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:31,980
Care to explain?

426
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,250
I was holding it for a friend.

427
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,830
You want to quit?

428
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,440
Charlie, you're -- you're a great boss,

429
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,890
but I ju-- I got this other offer,

430
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,880
and I just really miss the courtroom.

431
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,260
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,

432
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,360
you're... really letting me down.

433
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,300
I just expected so much more out of you.

434
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,330
Ohh. You were my favorite.

435
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,970
Ohh, god.

436
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,600
Um, well, maybe I-I could still do things on the weekends.

437
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,300
No, no! Charlie, I'm -- I'm sorry.

438
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,400
I -- I'm done.

439
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,940
You know what?

440
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
I don't blame you.

441
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,260
I have to get back on solid ground.

442
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,710
- We both do. - Well, I do more.

443
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,180
My house is a boat.

444
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,480
You made me in trouble.

445
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,190
I didn't tell you to sit on a boy until he liked you.

446
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,500
- Yes-huh. - Nuh-huh.

447
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,060
We're not doing this again.

448
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,880
Home team calls time-out.

449
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,970
12 seconds left, they're down by 6,

450
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,140
and unable to shake the Miller curse.

451
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,290
That's it!

452
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,030
Okay, boys, final play.

453
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,460
Time for a little trickery.

454
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,740
Oh, honey. What happened to you today?

455
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,120
A cosmic pummeling.

456
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,040
I lost the deal.

457
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,670
If I don't close on one tomorrow,

458
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,770
it's gonna be my first month ever with no sale.

459
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,320
Actually, there is no 31st this month.

460
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,310
What are you talking about?

461
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,450
Tomorrow's the first.

462
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,740
Honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

463
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,500
No, I'm not okay!

464
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,600
I just found out there is literally no tomorrow!

465
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,360
You know, I always say if you wait long enough,

466
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,410
your luck will change?

467
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,140
Turns out that's just a big pile of c--

468
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,610
Hold on to your hats, folks.

469
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,940
Are they? They are! It's the triple gull-wing!

470
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,000
That's my play!

471
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,630
Woodson fakes right, he fakes right again,

472
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,410
he fakes faking right, and he scores!

473
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,040
They scored on my play!

474
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,830
- Mitchell says you can sell me a house. - Yes, I can!

475
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,360
- Good call, Phil. Was that your play?! - Yes, it was!

476
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,650
You're being too rough, Lily.

477
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,340
You cannot just see a guy and,

478
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,390
mwah, kiss him like that, okay?

479
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,290
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!

480
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,770
Okay! Okay! Miller's out. Manny, you're my backup kicker.

481
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,920
I need you to go out there and nail this.

482
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,790
Although if I miss it,

483
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,230
wouldn't a tie be a perfect way to --

484
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,270
Manny, enough!

485
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,130
You are not gonna take away my victory!

486
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,990
I mean -- I mean, your victory.

487
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,250
Okay?

488
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,380
Manny, I'm sorry. I should not have yelled at you.

489
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,510
You can go out there and do whatever feels right.

490
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,630
Okay? I support you no matter what.

491
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,950
Hut! Hut! Hike!

492
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,850
I won! I won! I mean, we won!

493
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,240
We won! We won!

494
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,980
Ooph! Sorry, ma'am.

495
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,590
Ma'am? I sit next to you in English.

496
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,470
Hey, I think I dropped my phone under the bleachers.

497
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,350
Come get it with me?

498
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,820
Found it.

499
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,380
Great, and world order is restored.

500
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,350
- Can we go home now? - Yeah. Okay.

501
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,900
Oh, hey, what's that?

502
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,510
"Alex Dunphy dome?"

503
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,610
Uh, I think it says "Alex Dunphy, do me."

504
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,560
Ugh, who would write something like that?

505
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,870
No idea.

506
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,330
Hey, you want me to scratch it out?

507
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,550
No! I mean, pfft, too late now.

508
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,650
If it's out there, it's out there.

509
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,750
Hey, champ.

510
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,750
Aren't you gonna go celebrate with your team?

511
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,100
Yeah, in a minute.

512
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,880
You meant to miss the kick, didn't you?

513
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,820
I blew it.

514
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,570
I could miss that kick nine out of ten times.

515
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,820
Why couldn't I miss it when it counted?

516
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,870
Let me ask you something.

517
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,120
That ball sails through the uprights,

518
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,530
your team carries you off the field.

519
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,610
How does that feel?

520
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,170
- Come on. - Good.

521
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,560
It's fun being part of a team.

522
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,680
And it's really fun being the hero.

523
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,080
So I think you made that kick on purpose.

524
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,470
And listen.

525
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,620
I don't think you're willing to admit it yet,

526
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,260
but somewhere underneath all that humanity,

527
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,690
there's a competitor -- sorry.

528
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,760
There's a competitor, and, Manny,

529
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,370
there's nothing wrong with that.

530
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,010
Nothing.

531
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,980
Thanks, coach.

532
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,670
You want to go eat some pizza?

533
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,970
- Sure. - Me, too.

534
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,140
Hey, you think someday they might name this field after you?

535
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,970
Well, you're not the first person

536
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,130
to think along those lines.

537
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,280
Earlier today, someone in the faculty bathroom

538
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,540
was messing around with the phrase "Cameron Tucker dome."

539
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,890
Just sold the most expensive house in town,

540
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,780
sight unseen, all cash.

541
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,480
- How 'bout that? - I'm proud of you, dad.

542
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Pretty great day for all the Dunphys.

543
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,240
And then I said, "Michelle, do you honestly believe

544
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,950
every stupid rumor you hear?"

545
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh, you haven't heard?

546
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,330
Well, apparently, one of my exes is just, like...

547
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,420
Tim, I -- I am so sorry that you got hurt,

548
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,470
and I will get to the bottom of it,

549
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,290
but I suspect it was sabotage by the competition,

550
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,060
maybe Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.

551
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,830
Not too bad, a little puffy, kind of like your eyes were

552
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,600
when you saw "Finding Nemo," Miller.

553
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,450
Like I said -- positive attitude.
