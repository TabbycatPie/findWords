The fact that Wally

is the big win here, so in the future

112

could you try not
chasing him out of the house?

Actually the depth and uniformity

of the burn pattern
is something you would see

248
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:55,019
if the body was covered
in something like lava,

and an added chemical characteristic.

251
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,060
The fire investigator didn't
find a secondary accelerant.

Yeah, he probably wouldn't with a meta.

for when he finally takes it, send me back,

911
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,428
use the implosion reactor
to shut down the breach.

912
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,564
Shut down all the breaches.

913
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,200
Close them all

914
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,936
and Zoom will never be able to crossover,

915
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,838
ever again,

916
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,573
and that'll be the end of it.

917
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,943
What about your daughter?

918
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,579
Jesse's my battle to fight, not yours.

919
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,515
<i>[poignant music]</i>

920
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:10,456
[beeping]

921
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,625
[door whirring]

922
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,766
[moans]

923
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:23,169
Hey, how are you feeling?

924
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:26,172
Like I could use some pizza right now.

925
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:28,374
[both laughing]

926
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:29,909
Well, they're letting you out tomorrow,

927
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,577
so I can get you any kind you want

928
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,645
from anywhere you want.

929
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,747
Deal.

930
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,985
You know... growing up,

931
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:40,687
we didn't have a lot of money

932
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:44,891
to go to the movies or buy toys.

933
00:38:44,893 --> 00:38:46,559
Instead, she would just take me in the car,

934
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,194
we'd would go for these long drives.

935
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:52,231
Just her and I and her music.

936
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,300
I remember being on the road with her

937
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:58,771
and just watching the scenery flash by

938
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,206
and feeling so happy.

939
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,312
And now, when I race,

940
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:08,047
feeling that rush of speed

941
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,183
it's like...

942
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:12,885
It's like I get to back

943
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,387
to those days.

944
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:19,292
I didn't want to stop

945
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,761
because if I do...

946
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,734
[sighs]

947
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:32,038
See, that wasn't so hard.

948
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,709
Actually, it was pretty hard.

949
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,711
[both chuckle]

950
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:42,081
This is a sample of Barry's cells

951
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,484
after whatever Harry did to them.

952
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:45,852
As you can see, not only is it

953
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,019
drained of the Speed Force,

954
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,588
but it's also presenting itself

955
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,356
as chromosomal damage.

956
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:53,526
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

957
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:56,462
he could have taken your powers permanently.

958
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:58,631
Even Evil Wells couldn't
figure out how to do that one.

959
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,233
Well, look, somebody better
send his ass back

960
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:01,801
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

961
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:04,070
- Amen.
- No.

962
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:06,773
What do you mean, no?

963
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:08,141
What would we have done

964
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:10,376
if we were in his position?

965
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:11,444
I mean, what would you do

966
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:13,212
if it was Iris, Joe?

967
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,782
And Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

968
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,016
threatened to kill your brother

969
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:18,317
unless you helped, you did,

970
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,853
and none of us judged you for that.

971
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:23,456
We still don't because
when it comes to family,

972
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:27,059
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

973
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,428
we're all vulnerable.

974
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,631
None of us are above
making a wrong decision.

975
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:32,698
He could have done it.

976
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,699
He could have stolen my speed,

977
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,767
gotten away with it.

978
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,402
None of us would have even known,

979
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:39,305
but he didn't, and now
his daughter's gonna die

980
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:40,973
and we're okay with that?

981
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,975
I can't just give up on her.

982
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:45,912
I can't give on a world.

983
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:47,814
This is a world full of people

984
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:50,249
who are facing death.

985
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,251
I don't know, I may not be fast enough

986
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:56,222
to beat Zoom yet, but I'm not gonna just

987
00:40:56,224 --> 00:41:01,093
close the breaches and forget about it.

988
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:04,297
We have to help Wells.

989
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,366
Look, guys, I...

990
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:10,303
I was the one that trusted him first.

991
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,304
I own that.

992
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:12,638
I let him stay

993
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,974
when literally all of you told me not to,

994
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,042
so everything that's happened

995
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,410
up until this point, it's on me,

996
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:19,879
but this has to be a group decision.

997
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:22,315
<i>[tense music]</i>

998
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:23,649
[computer beeping]

999
00:41:25,954 --> 00:41:27,820
Come on.

1000
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,030
Well...

1001
00:41:39,634 --> 00:41:42,068
I guess this is good-bye.

1002
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,004
No, it's not.

1003
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,173
I told you, we're a team.

1004
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,909
Now you're a part of it.

1005
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,244
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

1006
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:54,013
We're not sending you through alone.

1007
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,048
We're going to Earth-2.
