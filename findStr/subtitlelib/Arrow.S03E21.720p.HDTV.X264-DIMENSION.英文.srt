7
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,560
My name was Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,390
For three years, I worked to save my city.

9
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,190
But to save my sister, I had to become someone else.

10
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,470
I had to become something else.

11
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,030
Previously, on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,550
You can still save her, Oliver!

13
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,820
Take your rightful place as heir to the Demon.

14
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,140
Ra's Al Ghul will bring your sister back.

15
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,530
I fulfilled my end of our arrangement.

16
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,550
I suggest you begin to make peace with yours.

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,270
The only way that I'm going to survive this

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,960
is if I know that you're out there

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,580
living your life, happy.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,330
Oliver Queen is dead, and for now,

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,380
only the Arrow, Al Sah-him, shall remain.

22
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,140
Heir to the Demon.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,130
Oliver Queen is alive only in the past.

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,000
He is forgotten.

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,670
Oliver Queen is alive only in the past.

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,520
He is forgotten.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,840
You are Al Sah-him.

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,570
You have made great progress in three weeks.

29
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,210
Al Sah-him.

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,330
You no longer flinch upon hearing your new name.

31
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,810
Oliver Queen is alive only in the past.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
He's forgotten.

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,930
Indeed. You are Al Sah-him.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,910
You are Wahreeth al Ghul. Heir to the demon.

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,950
My lord.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,680
I apologize for this interruption.

37
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,500
We captured this intruder.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,330
Why, then, is he still yet alive?

39
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,440
He is known to Al Sah-him.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,790
Oliver, what the hell is going on?

41
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,970
Clearly he made another attempt to free Al Sah-him.

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,870
Well, then it falls on Al Sah-him to deal with him.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,480
Oliver, they're lying to you.

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,870
I never made it home.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,160
They've had me here prisoner for weeks.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,160
My oath of mercy on your friends

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,620
was premised by your fealty.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,520
Prove it.

49
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,280
No, Oliver. Listen to me--

50
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,920
they're lying to you. We could still get out of here;

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,680
you and me working together. There's still a chance.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,580
Remove his chains.

53
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,830
Give him your sword, Sarab.

54
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,430
I will not kill an unarmed man.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,880
That's the way this is?

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,340
You've been here for a few weeks

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,550
and you forget who you are.

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,950
Do you remember when you brought me into your crusade,

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I told you that I would be here to help remind you

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,440
who Oliver was, if you ever became something else.

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,290
I haven't given up on that promise.

62
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,510
Fight.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
The past three weeks,

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,370
you've been exposed to a rare herb centuries old.

65
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,270
It causes one's conscience

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,830
to come to the forefront of their mind

67
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,790
so it is the only thing that they see.

68
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,040
The herb's effect is different for everyone.

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,070
Some people see family and loved ones.

70
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,180
Others encounter trusted friends or teachers.

71
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,490
Who did you see?

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
Very well.

73
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,940
There is something else I wish you to see. Come.

74
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,460
Where?

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,280
The past.

76
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,390
A place now home only for the dead.

79
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,980
I had the vial in my hand!

80
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,650
What's happening is not your fault.

81
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,480
Shrieve is to blame, this is his doing.

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,940
I can't get through.

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Everyone's calling the police.

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,450
We're all inoculated, remember?

85
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,980
I want to get back to my son.

86
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,340
Have not been back to this place

87
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,240
since I pledged myself to the League.

88
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,570
What happened here?

89
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,280
When I joined the League, I was conscripted with another man.

90
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,610
Damien Darhk.

91
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,400
We would become the prized agents of Ra's Al Ghul.

92
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,220
We were his horsemen. And he molded us into warriors

93
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,830
the likes the world had never seen.

94
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,900
We were as brothers.

95
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,300
What happened to him?

96
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,730
He believed himself worthy of becoming heir to the Demon,

97
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,990
but I was the one chosen.

98
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,450
So you had to kill him.

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,250
Yes.

100
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,270
But you see, I hesitated. And with that hesitation,

101
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,220
he found an opportunity to escape,

102
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,750
taking with him his loyalists and water from the Lazarus pit.

103
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,800
And he has vexed me ever since.

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,060
And you.

105
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,310
I don't follow.

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,960
Damien continues the League's ways,

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,010
but through his own organization filled

108
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,300
with a hive of agents devoted to his own agenda.

109
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Last year, he tried to

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,850
purchase Malcolm Merlyn's earthquake generator.

111
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,830
He gave Gholem Qadir safe haven to Markovia.

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,540
And he hired Mark Shaw

113
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,710
to steal a secret file from A.R.G.U.S.

114
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,220
This was all the work of one man?

115
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,610
The list goes on.

116
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,010
Many lives have been lost, others endangered.

117
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,950
And all because I was slow to swing a vengeful sword.

118
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,730
And I will not have my heir

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,260
haunted by the same mistake.

120
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,330
What is it you wish me to do?

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,080
There is a rival who claims to be heir to the Demon.

122
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,660
And you must eliminate this threat from your reign.

123
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,790
And you must do so without mercy.

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,110
Did you hear?

125
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,900
Masks aren't wanted in Starling no more.

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,230
Tell that to the woman you mugged.

127
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,190
You underestimated your opponent again.

128
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,750
I should have known he had a knife.

129
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,440
He didn't have a knife.

130
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,160
What the hell?

131
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,160
He had two.

132
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,780
Shall we continue your training?

133
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,070
I'm starving.

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,410
There's a diner near here that serves the best

135
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,540
black and white milkshakes in Starling City.

136
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,040
What is a black and white milkshake?

137
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,450
I never understood your country's need

138
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,240
to fry everything.

139
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,470
That's because everything tastes better that way.

140
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,940
This is more oil than potato.

141
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,680
Dip it in your milkshake.

142
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,950
I sense you're mocking me.

143
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm serious.

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,070
Here. Dip it in your milkshake.

145
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,020
I have to admit...

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,740
It's fun seeing you like this.

147
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,310
Like what?

148
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,900
Like a normal person.

149
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,020
I am a normal person.

150
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,980
I can't believe you just said that.

151
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,820
That's actually not bad.

152
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
And the student becomes the teacher.

153
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,120
You have a point.

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,610
For me, normal is a world where only the strong survive.

155
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,650
One without simple pleasures.

156
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,070
Thank you, Laurel.

157
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,510
I was alone and adrift,

158
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,680
and you have shown me kindness.

159
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm only returning the favor.

160
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,320
Isn't that what you did for Sara?

161
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,070
There's little comparison between my current situation

162
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,520
and Sara's after her time with Oliver on Lian Yu.

163
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,290
What's wrong?

164
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,070
It's about Oliver.

165
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,740
There's something that I haven't told you.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,640
He's in Nanda Parbat.

167
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,380
I don't understand.

168
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,640
He's accepted your father's offer to become the next Ra's.

169
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,150
You should have not kept that from me.

170
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,660
I'm sorry, it's just--

171
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,470
it's just that you seemed so happy,

172
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,600
and after what happened with your father, I...

173
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,140
And here comes the Cat-5 prong into the Ethernet port!

174
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,110
Even if she knew what that was,

175
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,050
even if I knew what that was,

176
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,860
I think Sara's still a little young for chicken cacciatore.

177
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,190
Well, my mom used to feed me nachos from the bar

178
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,900
at the Grand before I was off the bottle,

179
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,050
and I turned out normal.

180
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,230
Ish.

181
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,180
John...

182
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,860
What's the house rule?

183
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
No Glocks on the dinner table.

184
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,180
How'd it go out there tonight?

185
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,950
Your intel was spot-on.

186
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,780
Caught four Halcones at the docks

187
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,160
trying to unload a shipment of M16s.

188
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,370
Well, I'm especially proud that you didn't get yourself killed.

189
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,850
That was my favorite part, too.

190
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,090
If you're going to keep going out into the field,

191
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,850
we should really design you some sort of...

192
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,120
Do not say "costume."

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,230
Ok.

194
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,130
Identity concealment.

195
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,500
Look, eventually we're going to have to figure out

196
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,190
a new status quo, a working one, now that...

197
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,200
Ollie's gone.

198
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,850
How are you doing?

199
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,490
Having never been resurrected before,

200
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't really have anything to compare it to.

201
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,590
I mean about Oliver.

202
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,510
Being gone.

203
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,710
I don't know.

204
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,090
Mornings are the worst.

205
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,040
I can't really... leave the loft,

206
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,130
so it's nice to be able to come here.

207
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,420
You are always welcome in our home.

208
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,770
I just miss him.

209
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,900
The fact that he's gone because of me--

210
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,850
He wouldn't want you blaming yourself.

211
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,540
In the military, they have a saying

212
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,890
for a soldier

213
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,630
that makes the ultimate sacrifice.

214
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,100
Gone...

215
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,220
but never forgotten.

216
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,780
Gone, but never forgotten.

217
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,050
Liling's apartment is just a few more blocks north.

218
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,350
Wallace said there wasn't a cure.

219
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,210
It's United States Army. Shrieve's men.

220
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,310
That's not a cure they're giving those people!

221
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,340
It's the virus!

222
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,610
Shrieve is leaving nothing to chance.

223
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,540
He wants to infect as many people as possible.

224
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,650
Come on, we have to stop him.

225
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,060
Hey! Get away from there!

226
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,590
Tatsu, the truck!

227
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,210
I had him!

228
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,620
What do we now?

229
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,940
Destroy it. All of it.

230
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,940
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Oliver earlier.

231
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,210
That was your right to know.

232
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,020
I just--

233
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,040
things were going so well for you.

234
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,380
You seemed happy, and I didn't want to upset you,

235
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,630
but I still shouldn't have kept it from you.

236
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,270
Were I so inclined, I'd question why your first instinct

237
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,990
is to always keep matters secret.

238
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,990
Even after doing so cost you a relationship with your father.

239
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,270
But I have much greater concerns.

240
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,730
What's going on?

241
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,590
You should go.

242
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,100
No.

243
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,170
I'm not leaving.

244
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,300
Friends don't do that to one another.

245
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,760
Now that Oliver has ascended to his position

246
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,090
as heir to the Demon, he will come for me,

247
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,690
with as many men as it takes to see me dead.

248
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,050
Tonight, Nyssa Al Ghul

249
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,540
faces justice for her betrayal.

251
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Wait a second! Oliver wouldn't.

252
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,680
I don't see how.

253
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,270
I think what she's trying to say

254
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,640
is that Oliver would never do anything to hurt you, Felicity.

255
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,530
And the only reason why he joined the League

256
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,080
is to protect the people he loves.

257
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,420
Now what you need to understand

258
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,330
is that Oliver Queen is dead.

259
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,830
He's a memory.

260
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,090
Apparently, the League has some of their recruits

261
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,100
undergo a process of reprogramming.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,180
Like brainwashing?

263
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,310
Oliver never said that he was signing on for brainwashing.

264
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,010
The League's ways are shrouded in ritual and ceremony.

265
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,960
Oliver would not even know what's happening to him.

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,260
I don't care! Oliver, he is stronger than that!

267
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,840
I did not come here to debate.

268
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,990
Laurel insisted that I bring this news to you myself,

269
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,880
but I can see all I'm doing is damaging your memory of him.

270
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,620
Perhaps it is better for

271
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,650
you to not think of what Oliver has become.

272
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,560
You can have that luxury.

273
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,220
Wait, where are you going?

274
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,770
To face him, and if necessary, my destiny.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
I will not cower in the shadows waiting for death.

276
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,930
Great. Now what are we supposed to do?

277
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,450
Nothing. No offense, but Nyssa is insane.

278
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,550
Oliver is still Oliver.

279
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,540
Nobody knows the League better than Nyssa.

280
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,700
And did you see the look on her face? She was terrified.

281
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,140
I didn't even think that was possible.

282
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,550
Even if Nyssa's right about Oliver...

283
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,400
Which she isn't.

284
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,680
Getting between her and the League isn't an option.

285
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,910
And since when does Ra's daughter

286
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,030
become someone we stick our necks out for, Laurel?

287
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,390
I know you're furious with Ra's for what he's done to Oliver.

288
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,300
We all are.

289
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,720
But Nyssa, she saved my sister's life.

290
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,710
She gave her a home.

291
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,600
She's a good person.

292
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,870
In spite of everything that she grew up with.

293
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,970
And the last time I checked,

294
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,880
protecting good people, that is what we do.

295
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Fine.

296
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,380
Nyssa does seem to have an

297
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,280
idea where we can find Oliver and the League.

298
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,520
Well, then I guess we shouldn't have let Nyssa leave alone.

299
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,130
No, it's fine. I just put a tracking device on her.

300
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,130
This isn't my first day.

301
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,090
Everybody, get back!

302
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,220
Away from the truck!

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,360
No more virus.

304
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,170
We have to get back to Akio.

305
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,960
Come on.

306
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,870
Anything?

307
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,120
Nyssa hasn't stopped moving.

308
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,160
But I'm still getting a strong signal off the tracker.

309
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,320
Copy that. Radio check every five minutes.

310
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,760
What?

311
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,240
If anything happens with Nyssa,

312
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,610
let me handle it on my own.

313
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Laurel, we're talking about the League of Assassins!

314
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,240
I know that, I just...

315
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,010
Oliver. You were closer

316
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,780
to him than any two people I've ever known.

317
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,340
- You should not have to... - What, fight him?

318
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,210
Kill him?

319
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,340
Laurel, it's not going to come to that.

320
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,600
Look, I'm with Felicity.

321
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,100
There's nothing that Ra's al Ghul can do

322
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,570
that can turn Oliver against the people he loves.

323
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,610
Right.

325
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,470
Nice secret headquarter upgrade.

326
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,430
Does Mr. Palmer know you guys are in here?

327
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,380
Yes. He's out of town.

328
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,950
And how did you get in here?

329
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,920
My dad's a super villain

330
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,910
and you left your doors unlocked.

331
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,240
Right.

332
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,960
I have been distracted.

333
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,580
'Cause you and Mr. Diggle are trying to

334
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,290
save the city by yourselves?

335
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,520
Look, I've been thinking.

336
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,180
Um, maybe, rather than me sitting at home,

337
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,880
alone, miserable, maybe I could...

338
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,740
be out there helping you guys.

339
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,900
You seem like you're shorthanded one,

340
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,910
and vigilante skills run in my blood.

341
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,990
Thea, this might actually

342
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,680
be the worst week ever for this conversation.

343
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,440
What's going on?

344
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,170
I--I can't.

345
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,110
Felicity, I cannot be handled right now.

346
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,970
It's possible-- and I stress possible--

347
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,800
that Oliver is back in town with the League.

348
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,580
I don't understand.

349
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,530
Why would Ollie come back here?

350
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,480
They're after Nyssa.

351
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,000
- Ollie would never... - Nyssa thinks

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,130
he's under some sort of League mind voodoo.

353
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,980
But it's going to be fine.

354
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,890
We're handling it.

355
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,700
You are a terrible liar.

356
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,780
That is true.

357
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,360
Do you know where he is?

358
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,930
I mean, maybe I could just talk to him.

359
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,670
Thea, I don't know what doctor's orders are

360
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,930
for when someone gets brought back from the dead,

361
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,720
but I am pretty sure getting

362
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,270
into a fight with the League of Assassins goes against them.

363
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,860
I can get through to him.

364
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,930
Please, Thea.

365
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,860
Oliver wouldn't want you involved.

366
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,380
He did what he did so that you would stay out of harm's way.

367
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,050
Yeah, well.

368
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,140
It sounds like Ollie's not here anymore.

369
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,200
This is where my beloved spirit departed this world.

370
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,830
Do you even remember Sara?

371
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,870
Or has my father already obliterated her from your memory?

372
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm here to bring you back to Nanda Parbat.

373
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,920
To face justice?

374
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,340
If so, for what crime?

375
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,700
To face vengeance?

376
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,130
If so, for what offense?

377
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,520
You told me...

378
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,960
Vengeance is justice.

379
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,670
And you bested me in battle.

380
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,530
That won't happen again.

381
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,660
Do it! If I would die,

382
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,690
I would have it on the same ground as Sara.

383
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,780
Oh, my God.

384
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,960
We can't let you hurt her, man.

385
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,940
Oliver!

386
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,930
You should not have interfered.

387
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,330
Look, I am sorry.

388
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,950
But I have lost a sister, a father, Oliver--

389
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,200
There is no way that I was about to lose you, too.

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,560
You don't understand.

391
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,250
You already have.

392
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,500
I was marked for death the moment

393
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,490
Oliver accepted my father's offer.

394
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,840
Laurel, these past few weeks,

395
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,930
they've enlightened me.

396
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,490
To live a life outside of my father's rule,

397
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,860
to be someone else, even for just a little while,

398
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,570
brought me great happiness.

399
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,990
But I am daughter of the demon.

400
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,060
Happiness is not something that was ever meant for me.

401
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,690
I've known Oliver my entire life.

402
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,460
We've been friends since childhood.

403
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,530
But tonight, I did not recognize him.

404
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,880
I told you... he has been changed.

405
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,510
Well, if he can change, then why can't you?

407
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,250
How's Nyssa?

408
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,780
She's with Laurel. She's going to be ok.

409
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
How are you?

410
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,800
Same as you, probably.

411
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,740
Neither one of us believed Nyssa

412
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,630
when she said Oliver had been turned.

413
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm still not sure I believe it.

414
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,080
I heard about this kind of thing.

415
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,330
Guy gets captured by the enemy, gets broken.

416
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,680
I just never imagined Oliver--

417
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,350
still can't imagine-- that Oliver would.

418
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,610
Strongest man I've ever known, Felicity.

419
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,300
When Oliver stayed behind when he agreed to join the league,

420
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,670
he never could have known that this is what he was agreeing to.

421
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,030
The only way that I've been able

422
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,980
to get out of bed these past few weeks

423
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,800
is because I knew that Oliver was still alive.

424
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,280
He is alive, Felicity.

425
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,000
We thought that Oliver was just giving up his life to Ra's.

426
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,260
But he gave up his soul.

427
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,360
There was doubt you would return.

428
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,440
But not from me.

429
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,300
What happened?

430
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,230
Nyssa had friends.

431
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,210
I warned you not to face her alone.

432
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
These friends of Nyssa's--

433
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,970
Were they friends of yours?

434
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,440
They'll be protecting her now.

435
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,220
We need to draw her out.

436
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,830
Thank you for coming.

437
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,620
Suffice it to say, I was surprised to get your call.

438
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
I need your help.

439
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,220
That couldn't have been easy for you to say.

440
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,860
I need to know, is Ollie back in town?

441
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,540
Is he going after Nyssa?

442
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,180
According to my sources,

443
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,820
he intends to eliminate her

444
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,150
as a threat to his ascension to Ra's.

445
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,740
Well, I need to stop him.

446
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,780
His is Wahreeth Al Ghul now, Thea.

447
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,120
Heir to the demon.

448
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,480
He is my brother.

449
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,330
It's one thing to let him join

450
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,060
the League and run off to Nanda Parbat, but--

451
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,710
Another to let him kill?

452
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,540
What did you think he would be doing

453
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,300
in the League of Assassins?

454
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,630
Felicity told me that he's been brainwashed.

455
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,460
I know what it's like to kill

456
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,710
while under the influence of someone else.

457
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,870
Your brother didn't sacrifice everything

458
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,870
for you to go to war with the League.

459
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,590
That's what Felicity said.

460
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,090
And she was right.

461
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,130
No.

462
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,240
I couldn't stop him from trading his life to save mine,

463
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,110
but this, this I can stop.

464
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,450
You are a warrior, Thea.

465
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,790
Long before I trained you.

466
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,300
You have always had an incredible strength inside you,

467
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,660
and your brother knows that, too.

468
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Now...

469
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,620
What do you need from me?

470
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,760
Are you sure this is ok?

471
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,470
Yeah. With Oliver and the League running around,

472
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,390
it's best we stay close. Especially if something...

473
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,270
John?

474
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,150
Something's wrong. Lyla?

475
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Where's lyla?

476
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,980
- John. - Oliver?

477
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,450
First, let me assure you that no harm will come to Lyla,

478
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,400
if you do exactly as I say.

479
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,360
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse at Fullerton and Halstead,

480
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,500
and I'll let your wife go.

481
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,750
Oliver, I swear, if you do anything to Lyla...

482
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,020
You have 30 minutes.

483
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,100
Laurel!

484
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,050
What happened?

485
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,750
Oliver and his new friends took Lyla.

486
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,300
What?! Where's Sara, is she ok?

487
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,370
Yeah, she's with John's neighbor.

488
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,580
What's wrong with you?!

489
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,290
Hey, it is not Nyssa's fault!

490
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,650
No, just her people.

491
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,080
You call yourself warriors.

492
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,820
You claim to have honor.

493
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,170
Well, if you knew the meaning of the word,

494
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,060
you would know there are some lines you do not cross!

495
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,140
- Ok, John, back off. - You back off!

496
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,760
I am truly sorry.

497
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,720
I never meant for any harm to come to you or your family.

498
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,780
Yeah, Nyssa?

499
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,520
Then prove it.

500
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
Hand yourself over to the League.

501
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
What?!

502
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,770
We're just going to negotiate with him now?

503
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,380
Are we just going to give in? Turn over an innocent person?

504
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,370
She's not innocent!

505
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,660
She's the daughter of the demon.

506
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,560
She's killed hundreds of people.

507
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,440
Enough!

508
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,450
The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.

509
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,910
- I don't care how we do it. - Yes, you do.

510
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,610
Trading one person's life for another--

511
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,110
we're supposed to be better than that.

512
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,140
It's all right. Of course you should

513
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,060
exchange me for your beloved.

514
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,840
I won't see an innocent life taken for mine.

515
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,110
No.

516
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,430
I'm not going to let you commit suicide.

517
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,650
Don't you remember what you said?

518
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,640
These past few weeks have been some of the best of your life.

519
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,890
I remember.

520
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,680
And I remember telling you

521
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,620
that happiness is something denied to me.

522
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,210
Where's the exchange take place?

523
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,890
No. There has to be another way.

524
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,020
Another way to save Lyla

525
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,950
without turning Nyssa over to the League.

526
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,940
And if there isn't, even if you get Lyla back safe and sound,

527
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,180
Oliver won't be the only one who lost his soul.

528
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,010
What happened to you?

529
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,820
Johnny told me, but how could you become this?

530
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,760
Quiet.

531
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,520
It'll be over soon.

532
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,440
No. I genuinely want to know.

533
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,150
How could the man who stood up at my wedding do this?

534
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,430
How could the man who's been like a brother to--

535
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,580
Quiet!

536
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,970
You know...

537
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,970
when John's brother died,

538
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,810
a part of him died, too.

539
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,070
His guilt and the emptiness

540
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,130
from the loss outweighed everything.

541
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,920
I tried my hardest to help him,

542
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,730
but no one seemed to be able to comfort him or fill that void.

543
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,830
Until he met you.

544
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,780
You gave him hope and purpose again.

545
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
It's time.

546
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,180
Akio!

548
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,550
Mother!

549
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,230
Akio! Akio!

550
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,930
Liling's sick.

551
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,230
It's going to be ok.

552
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,280
Akio. Hao ba.

553
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,350
We have to leave Hong Kong.

554
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,400
Shrieve and his men--

555
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,730
Have enough to worry about!

556
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,750
Tatsu's right.

557
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,820
The chaos will give us cover.

558
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,480
Could be our only chance.

559
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,350
They're here.

560
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,350
Search them.

561
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,560
Where's my wife?

562
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,480
Where's my wife?!

563
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,400
You son of a bitch.

564
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,030
Whatever Ra's did to you...

565
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,830
Don't you dare touch me.

566
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,750
Oliver, this isn't you.

567
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,030
Look at me.

568
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,330
I know you're still in there somewhere.

569
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,960
Bind her.

570
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,180
You're free to go.

571
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,230
Johnny!

572
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,180
It's ok, I'm here.

573
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,550
I thought they were going for Sara.

574
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,240
Everything's fine, Sara's fine.

575
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,110
I told Felicity this is just like Jakarta.

576
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,650
Kneel before the true heir to the demon.

577
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,580
I kneel before no one.

578
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,810
Laurel!

579
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,520
Nyssa! No!

580
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,590
You're still Oliver.

581
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,290
I don't care if the hood is black or green.

582
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,570
You're still you!

583
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,770
Get away from him.

584
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,460
Get away from him, or the next one goes in your eye.

585
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,330
Lyla's got Sara.

586
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,230
They're headed out of town

587
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,610
until we can get things straightened out.

588
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,000
There is no straightening this out.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,660
I don't know, Felicity. I can't see past tomorrow right now.

590
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,530
They're going to kill Nyssa.

591
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,600
Oliver or her father, they're going to kill her.

592
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,630
I'm sorry, Laurel.

593
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,990
It's not fair.

594
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,810
No. No, it's not.

595
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll ask it to ask it--

596
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,750
there is no way I'm getting him back.

597
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,000
He's gone, Felicity.

598
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,650
No one wants to believe that less than me.

599
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,160
But he's gone.

600
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,180
There's only one thing left of him now.

601
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,830
And what's that?

602
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
Us.

603
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Gone, but never forgotten.

604
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,550
There are no more threats to my reign.

605
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,540
Your fealty continues to impress me, Al Sah-him.

606
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,650
You truly are Wahreeth Al Ghul.

607
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,500
And yet my daughter still does not approve of my choice.

608
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,390
Fortunately, what I require from you is not your approval.

609
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,980
Did you search her?

610
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,110
It does not appear to be on her person.

611
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,120
Bring me her weapons.

612
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
You know, as a young child,

613
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,820
Nyssa displayed the panache of a thief.

614
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,340
Always stealing extra qatayef at her meals

615
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,990
and then stowing them away in her quarters.

616
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,710
She would grow to learn

617
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,340
that there is nothing she can hide from me.

618
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,940
Her exploits of late...

619
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,840
seem to have clouded that memory.

620
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,390
I will remember you as the warrior you once were

621
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,270
and not as this shell that stands before me.

622
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,330
All my life, I've lived in fear of you.

623
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,310
But now, as I stand before you ready to leave this earth,

624
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,630
I want you to know--

625
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,220
I am not afraid.

626
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,360
Do what needs to be done, my heir.

627
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,330
And take with it the satisfaction

628
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,450
that your reign will be unchallenged.

629
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,040
I can see now, you do not require

630
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,160
a culling to solidify your reign.

631
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,450
You have broken your rival, Al Sah-him.

632
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,160
Something I was unable to do as an heir.

633
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,360
Spilling her blood now would only serve as gluttony.

634
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,510
Now, perhaps...

635
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,490
her blood could be of another purpose.

636
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,160
As a means to unite our families.

637
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,420
You as husband...

638
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,280
and you as wife.

639
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,920
I would rather die than become his betrothed.

640
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,880
Well, your wishes were no longer my concern

641
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,030
from the moment you betrayed me.

642
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,790
So you will marry Al Sah-him.

643
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,400
And you will become bride of the demon.

644
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,710
We need a vehicle.

645
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,380
Oliver!

646
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,810
Let's get out of this place.

647
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,140
It's ok. You're safe now.

648
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,930
Thea?

649
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,520
The door was open.

650
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,500
Sorry to interrupt your staring into nothingness.

651
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,620
He should have let me die.

652
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,580
That was never an option.

653
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,720
That's why I love him.

654
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,550
I didn't know...

655
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,760
about you and my brother.

656
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,080
Yeah, well...

657
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,600
It was complicated.

658
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,080
But I did love him.

659
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,120
Despite everything, I still do.

660
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,350
I do, too.

661
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,750
How...

662
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,370
is that even possible?

663
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,630
- After what he's - Become.

664
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,580
I don't know.

665
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,760
But I think John's right;

666
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,730
I think we have to remember the best parts of him,

667
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,190
and we have to move on.

668
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,840
Are you trying to convince me

669
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,040
or yourself?

670
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,060
Both of us.

671
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,640
I don't know how, but we have to go on living.

672
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,450
That's what Oliver...

673
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,730
Ollie would want for you--

674
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,970
to move on.

675
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,040
To live.

676
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,570
To be with the one that you love while you still can.

677
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,240
Roy is gone, so...

678
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,820
You've had a lot on your plate,

679
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,870
and I've been trying to think of the right time

680
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,160
to tell you this...

681
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,030
Roy's alive.

682
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,400
We faked his death.

683
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,680
It's a long story, as most fake death stories are.

684
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,340
We were going to tell you, I promise.

685
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,740
But then you were busy being mostly dead,

686
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,240
and then Oliver signed on to become darth Oliver.

687
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,970
- I don't-- - He's starting...

688
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,210
a new life.

689
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,360
One that hopefully includes you.

690
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,530
If you want it.

691
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,280
When my daughter left Nanda Parbat,

692
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,110
she absconded something critical to both our futures.

693
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,930
Do you recall the village I showed you?

694
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,920
The one where only the dead remain?

695
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,980
- It was your home. Was.

696
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,880
And I was obligated to unleash death upon it.

697
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,270
It has been this way ever since there has been a Ra's.

698
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,810
You see, it is the final act of ascension,

699
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,350
the transformation to demon's head.

700
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,580
The erasure of one's former life, former home.

701
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,740
Now, my predecessor,

702
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,550
he wiped away Alexandria, Egypt,

703
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,870
with cholera in 1609.

704
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,540
Today you will do the same.

705
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,330
Do you recognize this?

706
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,490
The Alpha and Omega bioweapon.

707
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,500
Beginning and the end.

708
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,530
Nyssa stole this to prevent my heir from doing that

709
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,820
which you will do today.

710
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,370
You will unleash this on Starling City.
