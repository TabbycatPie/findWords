20
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,410
Shaun, did you undress me?

21
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,170
Except your underpants.

22
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,180
How long have you been here?

23
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,470
All night.

24
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,240
You should be at work.

25
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm taking the day off.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,720
No, you should be at work.

27
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,730
You're sick all the time, not just after hours.

28
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,590
Shaun, you shouldn't give up your life.

29
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,520
You have my number. You check in with me.

30
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,680
I have 15 paid vacation days and 10 sick days per year,

31
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,520
but I can only take sick days when I'm sick,

32
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,320
not when you are,

33
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,880
so this is a vacation.

34
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,960
The plan is to align your eyes

35
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,980
using what's called distraction osteogenesis.

36
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,120
We cut the bone and implant posts

37
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,180
on either side of your eye orbits.

38
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,980
Then we slowly expand that distance,

39
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,170
allowing for new bone to grow in the gaps.

40
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,780
Will it hurt?

41
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,660
For mere mortals it would,

42
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,620
but with your pain tolerance, it'll tickle.

43
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,860
You up for this?

44
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,640
So I'll have perfectly aligned eyes

45
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,660
but still look like a wad of chewing gum.

46
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,740
Molly...

47
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,770
You lost an awful lot of bone and soft tissue in the accident,

48
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,770
and in terms of facial reconstruction,

49
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,020
we've actually come a long way in the past two years.

50
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,890
And after 12 surgeries,

51
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,190
you get your own personalized coffee mug.

52
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh, I forgot about that.

53
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,360
Okay, when can we get prepped?

54
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,750
Is now too soon?

56
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,520
Car accident. Karin Tindle, 14.

57
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,530
She was sleeping in the back.

58
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,160
Trucker in the oncoming lane fell asleep.

59
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,530
She wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

60
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,090
Head trauma, not responsive,

61
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,880
GCS of 5 with decorticate posturing.

62
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,110
Sounds like a bleed in the brain.

63
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,030
And she has a 25-point difference in blood pressures between her arms.

64
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,150
- Possible aortic dissection. - Head and heart.

65
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,390
Page Dr. Melendez.

66
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,780
Have him meet us in the O.R.

67
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,530
Have you contacted Karin's father?

68
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,020
He passed away three years ago.

69
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,060
Let's go.

70
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,490
Why isn't she waking up?

71
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,850
We're gonna take good care of her.

72
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,830
CT confirmed an aortic dissection.

73
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,230
She needs a thoracotomy.

74
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,580
Aorta hasn't ruptured yet...

75
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,040
And she has a pseudoaneurysm.

76
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,930
We need to get after her head trauma first.

77
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,910
I don't see any major brain bleeds

78
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,640
and we can monitor pressures.

79
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,810
In this case, the heart trumps the head.

80
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,070
Okay.

81
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,660
I have two major symptoms --

82
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,690
nausea and boredom.

83
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,460
I didn't know boredom was a symptom of chemotherapy.

84
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,900
It's a symptom of sitting on my ass all day.

85
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,750
I used to run a 700-bed hospital

86
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,570
with a staff of thousands.

87
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,320
Now all I have to think about is how I keep my food down

88
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,910
and how many bowel movements I've had all week.

89
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,900
Four.

90
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,650
And I don't have to think about that.

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,780
You know what I need?

92
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
My meds.

93
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,550
Will you do me a favor and run and pick these up?

94
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,500
When I come back, we can do "Mad Libs."

95
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,740
Unclamp.

96
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,860
Graft is holding.

97
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,790
That's one fire out. Drill.

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,350
Pupils are blown.

99
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,610
ICPs are spiking way up,

100
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,530
brain perfusion CPP is down.

101
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,300
She needs a hemicraniectomy.

102
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,350
Let's sit her up.

103
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
It's marijuana.

104
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,860
Yes, it is.

105
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,960
It's marijuana.

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,100
Medicinal marijuana. Hold on.

107
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,560
One...for the boredom.

108
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,980
One for the nausea.

109
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,400
Can I try one?

110
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,960
I met someone who said cannabidiol

111
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,060
improved his ASD symptoms.

112
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,190
A person?

113
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,270
You met a person once?

114
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,920
Shaun, have you heard of the scientific method?

115
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,240
I'd like to perform a practical,

116
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,480
albeit anecdotal, experiment.

117
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,910
Since you're on vacation...

118
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,600
and we can keep an eye out on each other...

119
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,070
One. One.

120
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,610
One. Take one.

121
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,370
Cruciate wide incision of the dura.

122
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,390
- Brain edema. - She's bradycardic.

123
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,530
Push another 50 grams of Mannitol

124
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,860
and ventilate down her CO2.

125
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,170
- No corneal reflex. - No overbreathing vent.

126
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,440
No brain stem reflexes.

127
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
She's brain-dead.

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,020
Fore!

129
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,710
You broke my house.

130
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,250
You got to club down. It's just 12 yards.

131
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,770
It's a little dog leg.

132
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,110
Here. Watch this.

133
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,700
It's in the cup.

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,260
Nice shot, Glassy.

135
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,930
You're gonna call me Glassy?

136
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,090
All right. I'm gonna call you Smurf.

137
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,320
Smurf. This --this is very interesting.

138
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,130
I find that very funny.

139
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,370
But it's not.

140
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,570
It's not. Am I high?

141
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,310
I think you're pretty high, yeah.

142
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,390
Am I acting more... normal?

143
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,660
- No, you're acting high. - Smurf. Smurf.

144
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,760
- Why is Smurf funny? - I don't know.

145
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
It's -- it's, um --

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,260
You take the first letter of the first name

147
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,940
and you attach it to the first syllable of your last name, see?

148
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,980
S-S-S-Murph. Smurf.

149
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,650
We did it all the time in high school.

150
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,860
So your name was A-Glass?

151
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, no, it didn't work for me.

152
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,670
Okay, serious now.

153
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,170
Where's the next hole?

154
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,450
Right there. Careful of the hazard right behind it.

155
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,210
- Okay, Sam Snead. - Dr. Glassman.

156
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,350
See what you got.

157
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,140
How's Lea?

158
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,220
Lee-Ya.

159
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,280
Lee-Ya!

160
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,520
There should be a "Y" in her name.

161
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,280
Lee-Ya.

162
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,940
She still into Jack?

163
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,190
No.

164
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,810
She is into Jake.

165
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,560
Who the hell is Jake?

166
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,520
Jake is the guy

167
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,460
Lea is into.

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,290
You okay with that?

169
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,460
I don't think you're okay with that.

170
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,020
I think that's why you're here.

171
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,340
I'm here to help you through chemo.

172
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,420
When a guy is stoned,

173
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,590
he can tell another guy anything that's in his heart.

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,870
You know, all the messy, scary, embarrassing stuff

175
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,640
that he would otherwise never, ever, ever tell anyone.

176
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,220
So what are you thinking?

177
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,540
A dog pooped on your lawn.

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,280
You were right to insist

179
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,340
that we deal with the aorta before the brain.

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,490
I appreciate you saying that.

181
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,660
Don't let guilt make you second-guess yourself.

182
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,980
Why would I have guilt?

183
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,620
You shouldn't. That's my point.

184
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,940
Good.

185
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

186
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,710
I think I am.

187
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,440
When a man's hungry, you know what a man wants?

188
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,720
There's an open can of chickpeas in the fridge.

189
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
- Mallomars. - What are Mal--

190
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,580
What are -- what -- what is the Mallomar?

191
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,860
Pure chocolate, fluffy marshmallows

192
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,000
on a crispy bed of graham goodness.

193
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,370
Get us an Uber.

194
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,180
The next few days are going to be filled

195
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,150
with many difficult decisions.

196
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,020
Decisions no parent should ever have to make.

197
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,400
We've kept your daughter on life support

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,150
- because we -- - You...

199
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,250
want to ask about organ donation.

200
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,820
Yes.

201
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,280
You want her what? Her heart?

202
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,630
Unfortunately, her heart was injured by the trauma,

203
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,680
as were several other organs.

204
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,270
We have a 16-year-old girl

205
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,800
who had a tragic accident a couple of years ago

206
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
that destroyed her face.

207
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,940
And we were hoping that you might...

208
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,490
You...want to take my daughter's face...

209
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,400
and put it on someone else?

210
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,850
This young girl's life has been devastated,

211
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,040
and you have a chance...

212
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,050
No.

213
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm sorry, Dr. Andrews.

214
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,790
No.

215
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,540
Okay, how about this one?

216
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,980
"The ugly can be beautiful.

217
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,430
The pretty, never."

218
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,490
Seems a little judge-y.

219
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,080
Yeah, well, it was Oscar Wilde.

220
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,480
Fair enough.

221
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,740
So I'm guessing you didn't see the Quakes last night.

222
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,600
The San Jose Earthquakes?

223
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,930
Your home team?

224
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,080
Yeah, I know who the Quakes are.

225
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,360
I recorded it.

226
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,880
No, you didn't.

227
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,280
Don't worry.

228
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,600
I watch enough soccer for the both of us.

229
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,000
They won 3 to 2, by the way.

230
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,660
Beautiful goal in extra time.

231
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,050
They didn't have any either.

232
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,040
Well, that's all the major chains.

233
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,410
We're 0 for 4.

234
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,140
Our next place is on Thornwood Drive,

235
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,940
just west of Santa Teresa Boulevard.

236
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,460
That's in Alamitos.

237
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,650
Yes.

238
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,620
There are still 28 stores

239
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,040
in the greater San Jose area that we can try

240
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,450
and I've devised a route starting in the south

241
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,780
working counterclockwise around the city

242
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,340
to best avoid traffic.

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,220
We'll buy you a box, I promise.

244
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,380
Okay, guys, I, uh, like a big fare

245
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,890
as much as the next driver

246
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,600
but racking up hundreds of dollars on a munchie quest

247
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,630
is starting to feel exploitative.

248
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,790
What do you say I order ahead for pizza

249
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,210
and then we just pick it up on the way home?

250
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,420
- I don't want pizza. - I don't want pizza.

251
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,730
What takeout food do you like?

252
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,740
- I like pancakes. - I don't want pancakes.

253
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,160
I don't want to go home.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,440
We're paying you to drive us.

255
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,540
You want these cookies?

256
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,260
What is the real reason?

257
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,490
- You'll laugh. - What's the funny reason?

258
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,660
I had a crush on a girl.

259
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
Robin Demayne.

260
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,670
Senior year in high school.

261
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,730
Her favorite snack.

262
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,760
Okay.

263
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,210
Are we going to get Mallomars?

264
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:18,950
Nope.

265
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,630
You have been harboring feelings for this girl

266
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,760
for over 40 years.

267
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,180
That is a worthy quest.

268
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,810
Now, how do you spell "Demayne"?

269
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,170
D-e?

270
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,430
You're the same sex, race, approximate age,

271
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,290
share compatible blood types and antigens,

272
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,740
and a whole bunch of other things that make you the perfect match.

273
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,590
And we just received permission from her next of kin.

274
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,500
Yeah.

275
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,870
Our donor's on life support but her heart is compromised,

276
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,620
so we are very much on the clock.

277
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,940
Cancel all elective surgeries, all personal plans,

278
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,600
and all hopes of sleep.

279
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,780
This is your home for the next two days.

280
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,250
Let's give Molly a new face.

281
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,700
There is another Robin Demayne living in San Mateo.

282
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,910
That's less than half an hour from here.

283
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,810
Ooh, I found one in Los Gatos, even closer.

284
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,030
You realize how stupid this is, right?

285
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,260
This is a quest. A quest is never stupid.

286
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,650
A quest is, by definition, almost always stupid.

287
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,030
Why would I want to see Robin Demayne

288
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,000
after all these years?

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,770
To tell her you love her?

290
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,470
I just want a cookie!

291
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,050
I wasn't in love with her.

292
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,200
I was a teenager.

293
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,290
I was infatuated.

294
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,750
And whenever you thought about her,

295
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,250
it made you happy.

296
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,770
And you thought about her all the time.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,930
And every time you saw her,

298
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,480
you felt a rush, light-headed...

299
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,850
Is that how you know you're in love?

300
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,790
That's how it starts.

301
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,260
And when you're not with that person,

302
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,370
you miss them so much you're willing to drive to 32 stores

303
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,610
to find a sensory reminder

304
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,900
that might bring back those memories.

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
{\an1}BGM: You Worry Me by Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats

Ride home's on me.

320
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,630
Flake.

321
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,390
Flake's a guy from my high school.

322
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,140
He knew everyone, he kept track of everyone,

323
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,390
and I guarantee you he never left Livermore.

324
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,070
We need to go to Livermore and ask Flake about Robin.

325
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,780
We're going to Livermore.

326
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,560
Every lab and imaging test that comes back

327
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,570
just reinforces the fact that this really is

328
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,140
a one-in-a-million match.

329
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,670
Nice.

330
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,980
Yeah, it is.

331
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,090
It's also very scary

332
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,260
and natural to be having second thoughts.

333
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,750
It's just...

334
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,590
I-I don't know how to accept a gift like this...

335
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,810
someone else's face, someone else's identity...

336
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,820
The face is just a mask.

337
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,060
- It's what's - Underneath that counts?

338
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,860
Really?

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Those lame quotes we've been mocking,

340
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,040
you're gonna use them on me?

341
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,590
Yeah.

342
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,580
Molly.

343
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,790
Right now, your face is the only thing anyone sees.

344
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,740
This operation will change that.

345
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,690
It'll let the world see not your new face

346
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,100
but what has always been behind it.

347
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,480
Will it count towards the coffee mug?

348
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,570
Flake lives at your old high school?

349
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,850
He was the janitor back then.

350
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,980
He's the janitor now.

351
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,840
He'll probably be the janitor

352
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,430
when this planet crashes into the sun.

353
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,430
- Flake. - Findlay Lake was his name.

354
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,250
Hey, Flakey.

355
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,430
Hey yourself, Glaaron Assman.

356
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,300
Your name was Glaaron Assman.

357
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,100
His name was Glaaron Assman.

358
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,110
1973 state championship.

359
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,590
He threw for 460 yards.

360
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,950
And if you squint hard enough,

361
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,880
you'll see who was named MVP.

362
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,290
You said you had something to show us?

363
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,520
Oh, yeah. Wait right here.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,440
Shannon?

365
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,750
I keep thinking she's just sleeping.

366
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,990
How can I say goodbye?

367
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,120
We call it the Walk of Honor.

368
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,970
To thank your daughter for her sacrifice.

370
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,600
Do you remember a guy named Bobby Juarez?

372
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,580
Tall kid but too clumsy to play hoops?

373
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,900
He told me that Robin married a dentist named Scaplin

374
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,300
and moved out of state.

375
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,480
You couldn't tell me that when I called?

376
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,140
I wanted to see you.

377
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,760
I found her.

378
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,930
Robin Scaplin is in Portland, Oregon.

379
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,690
It's an 11 hour and 27 minute drive.

380
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,030
Fill up the tank, I guess.

381
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,190
We're going to Portland.

382
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,340
10 blade.

383
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,270
10 blade.

384
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,000
Proximal facial nerve isolated and dissected.

385
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,960
Okay, let's start the heavy lifting.

386
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,210
Clamping the left and right common carotid arteries

387
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,570
and jugular veins...

388
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,860
Cutting the carotids and jugulars...

389
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,450
Let's do it.

390
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,460
It's a long way to go to visit a married woman

391
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,130
you haven't seen since high school

392
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,830
who may not even be home.

393
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,870
She's home. I called at the last stop.

394
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,370
What did she say?

395
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,370
"Hello."

396
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,560
What did you say?

397
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,600
Nothing. He hung up.

398
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,900
When you sober up,

399
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,420
you are gonna want to turn around and go home.

400
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,510
Probably.

401
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,350
As rehearsed --

402
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,710
veins, arteries, nerves,

403
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,310
in that order, from the chin up.

404
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,090
Yes?

405
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,600
Can I get the osteosynthetic plates and screws, please?

406
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,730
Damn it.

407
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,770
I tore part of the donor's artery.

408
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,580
I need more interrupted sutures.

409
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,280
Let's keep our focus, people.

410
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,650
Dr. Browne,

411
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,620
Molly's parents would like to see you on your next break.

412
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,830
Take it now.

413
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,620
You, too.

414
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,200
Dr. Park?

416
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,280
I had a huge crush on Robin Demayne.

417
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,450
A thoroughly unrequited crush...

418
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,250
that slowly turned into a grudge.

419
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,180
Last day of school,

420
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,980
kids were passing around their yearbooks,

421
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,960
and I signed in hers

422
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,730
something that was borne out of anger

423
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,350
and resentment and pettiness.

424
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,350
It was designed to be somewhat humorous, but...

425
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,310
was really just mostly hurtful.

426
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,190
Later that day, at the award ceremony,

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,790
I was skimming through my yearbook

428
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,490
and saw what she wrote me...

429
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,030
"I have only two regrets --

430
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,240
my haircut in junior year

431
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,370
and that you never asked me out."

432
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,340
And just then, I looked out in the crowd and saw her.

433
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,090
Her eyes were red,

434
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,010
obviously crying, obviously very hurt.

435
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,220
And at that exact moment, I was awarded my trophy.

436
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,730
I looked for her after but never saw her again.

437
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,830
Is that all the scary, messy, embarrassing stuff

438
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,240
that guys never, ever tell anyone?

439
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,660
Pretty much.

440
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,670
Dean and Lori?

441
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,090
This is Shannon.

442
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,880
Thank you for meeting with us.

443
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,800
And for...

444
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,010
everything.

445
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,950
If you don't mind, we have so many questions for you,

446
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,970
about your daughter.

447
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,490
We'd like to know what she was like,

448
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,520
what she liked to do.

449
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,020
Molly wants to know, too.

450
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,990
Her name was Karin.

451
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,580
And I killed her.

452
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm supposed to tell you to get back in.

453
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,310
Don't let him get to you.

454
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,680
It's not him, it's you.

455
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,040
Your advice that I shouldn't be second-guessing myself

456
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,870
is making me think you must be second-guessing yourself.

457
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,860
About what?

458
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
You're the one who insisted

459
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,420
we deal with the heart before the brain.

460
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,340
And you didn't fight me. Why not?

461
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,300
- Because you were right. - I was right.

462
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,510
But you have never thought anyone

463
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,220
other than yourself was right in an O.R.

464
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,870
since you first stepped foot in one.

465
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,410
You backed off 'cause we're sleeping together.

466
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,010
The car accident was my fault.

467
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,510
It was my idea to leave so early,

468
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,720
to let her sleep in the back.

469
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,060
It was up to me to make sure she was wearing her seatbelt.

470
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,820
None of which would've mattered

471
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,780
if the truck driver hadn't fallen asleep.

472
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,960
It's natural to feel guilt,

473
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,740
but you have to understand this wasn't your fault.

474
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,580
It doesn't work that way, Dr. Browne.

475
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,130
It was my handgun that hurt Molly.

476
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,190
And you can say that it was a freak accident

477
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,360
or that Molly knew she wasn't supposed to touch it

478
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,340
or some other B.S., but...

479
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,510
it was my fault.

480
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,810
I had one job...

481
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,180
and that was to protect my family.

482
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,560
I didn't do my job.

483
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,500
And you could try to make sense of it,

484
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,780
try to find something, some pleasure somewhere,

485
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,070
some meaning.

486
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,160
But there just isn't.

487
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,080
And then your daughter...

488
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,460
...does this for us...

489
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,730
Hi, Robin.

490
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,780
Aaron?

491
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,420
He had a huge crush on you.

492
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,840
Yeah.

493
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,010
That's not why I'm here, though.

494
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,430
I'm here to apologize.

495
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,970
For what I wrote in your yearbook.

496
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,680
Yearbook?

497
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,060
Yeah.

498
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,230
I wrote something, um...

499
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,030
...hurtful and untrue and really stupid.

500
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,000
And then I read what you wrote in mine.

501
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,960
What did I write?

502
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,170
She had a bad haircut in junior year.

503
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,090
I certainly remember that.

504
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.

505
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,690
Anyway, I just -- I wanted to say I'm sorry.

506
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,860
Well...

507
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,440
Apology accepted.

508
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,820
Thank you.

509
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,870
Mallomars.

510
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,500
Robin's favorite snack.

511
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,570
Right side donor to recipient vessels are anastomosed.

512
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,530
Ditto on the left.

513
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,490
Let's see how our plumbing works.

514
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,810
Unclamp them, please.

515
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,860
She's pinking up.

516
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,910
Moving on. Motor and sensory neurorrhaphies...

517
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,960
How's our girl doing?

518
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,170
She's just waking up now.

519
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,260
Hi, Molly.

520
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,090
How are you feeling?

521
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,350
Terrible.

522
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,060
Then we're right on target.

523
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,890
You want to have a look?

524
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,310
No.

525
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,940
No rush.

526
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,110
It is going to look...

527
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,490
surreal.

528
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,200
Like you're looking at a stranger.

529
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,660
But it won't always.

530
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,430
Because nobody laughs or holds their head

531
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,500
or looks someone in the eye exactly the way you do.

532
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,630
Okay.

533
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,810
I apologize

534
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,900
for telling you how to react to losing a patient.

535
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,860
Thank you.

536
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,260
When I accused you of second-guessing yourself,

537
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,200
that's because I'm doing it, too.

538
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,050
Our relationship has me questioning everything I do

539
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,540
and everything you do.

540
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,210
You're making this way more complicated than it has to be.

541
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,040
It is complicated.

542
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,810
The fact that we're seeing each other

543
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,090
changes the context of all of our interactions.

544
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,800
I guess that's why there are rules against it.

545
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,120
I think I can keep being a jerk to you at work

546
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,350
if that's what you want.

547
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,980
You think we should end it?

548
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,030
No.

549
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,880
See you tomorrow.

550
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,110
So, once you're feeling a little less woozy,

551
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,410
we'll set you up with a whole bunch of therapists --

552
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,520
speech, occupational, physical.

553
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,610
Shannon.

554
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,360
Please come in.

555
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,950
I'm Karin's mom.

556
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,660
I brought something for you.

557
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,570
She was beautiful.

558
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,670
Thank you.

559
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,590
And thank you for timing that elevator ride so perfectly.

560
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,850
Can I ask you for a favor?

561
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,850
I'd like to say goodbye.

562
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,800
Eh, we'll clean up tomorrow.

563
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,360
And buy a new vase.

564
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,640
Yeah, buying a new vase is easy.

565
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,770
Vacuuming up my grandmother's ashes,

566
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,350
not so easy.

567
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,230
Are you glad you apologized?

568
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,480
Yeah.

569
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,610
Do you still feel guilty?

570
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,660
Yeah.

571
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,550
Guilt must be a bad thing if it makes people feel badly

572
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,710
about something they can never fix.

573
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,980
Or maybe it's a deterrent

574
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,090
so we do the right thing the next time.

575
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,640
You loved Robin

576
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,680
but could never be with her.

577
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,870
Do you wish you'd never met her?

578
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,890
Not for one second.

579
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,980
I'm not okay that Lea is into Jake.

580
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,710
Good night, Smurf.

581
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,580
Night, Glassy.
