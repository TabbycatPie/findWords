你得做出彌補
You need to make amends.

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,570
為對她的輕慢嗎
For slighting her?

27
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,380
-為指出他們嗎  -你得給他們點什么
- For identifying them? - You have to give them something.

28
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,480
-我不相信這份法案  -該死的
- I don't believe in the bill. - Oh, goddamn it!

這份法案  你在聽嗎

我很高興總統辦公室總算迎來一位女性
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman in the Oval Office.

32
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,650
我們的命運一直糾纏在一起

不管愿不愿意
like it or not,

34
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,240
這幾十年來都是如此
for decades now.

35
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,590
我們有權分道揚鑣了
We deserve to go our separate ways.

36
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,060
問題是  我們有個緊急的問題要處理
The problem is we have something urgent to attend to

37
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,600
凱茜·杜蘭特
called Cathy Durant.

38
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,710
然后我們就終于自由了
And then we can finally be free.

39
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,360
你需要我的幫助
Now, you need my help.

40
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,760
今晚晚些時候
Later tonight,

41

我要眼看著你簽署
I'm going to watch you sign that bill

42
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,270
你桌上的那份法案

43
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,460
"對于死者  王國毫無意義"
"To the dead, a kingdom means nothing."

44
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,420

I never had sex with a farm animal

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,290
也沒虐待過女友  除非娶了她算虐待
or abused a girlfriend, unless you count marrying her.

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,420
但是  這的確不易
Let me say, it was tough, uh...

47
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,990
選出十件我最重要的案子
narrowing down my ten most significant cases.

48
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,580
我更喜歡那些小問題
I prefer the smaller questions.

49
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,220
關于我加入的專業組織  我的教學
Of my professional memberships, my teaching.

50

總統女士  就跟你說一句
Madam President, just between you and me,

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,980
我認為這事沒有有些人說的那么遙不可及
my feeling is that it's not as far-fetched as some people say.

52
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,030
我依然認為
I still think there is a universe

53

《平權修正案》是可以通過的
where the ERA gets passed.

54
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,150
女人真是最了不起了  是吧

我很榮幸能成為繼任大法官候選人
I am deeply honored to be considered for the late Justice's seat.

告訴我
So, tell me.

57
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,310
他們怎么買通你的  謝潑德家族
How did they buy you? The Shepherds.

58
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,730
阿布佐法官  總統女士  抱歉打擾了
Judge Abruzzo, Madam President, I hate to break this up.

59
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,280
我已經占用了
I have already taken

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,170
總統太多的寶貴時間了
too much of the president's valuable time.

61
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,560
總統女士
Madam President.

62
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,800
-副總統先生  -法官大人

63
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,170
我真的非常榮幸
It has been a sincere pleasure.

64
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,030

我覺得很無力
I felt emasculated.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,640
什么
Excuse me.

68
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,220
比爾·謝潑德把著我的手
Bill Shepherd guiding my hand.

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,020
你看上去也很無力  馬克
And you looked emasculated, Mark.

70
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,800
-你錯了  -不  我沒錯
- You're mistaken. - No, I'm not mistaken.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,960
我看到你的表情了
I watched your face.

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,630
-總統女士  -別那么喊我了
- Madam President-- -Please don't call me that. Please.

73

74
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,780

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,460
那場斗爭你贏不了的
That was not a fight you were gonna win.

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,420
-你喜歡當信使嗎  -什么

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,030
這是你從小的夢想嗎
Has it been a dream of some sort since you were a little boy?

78
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,400
因為我可以告訴你
Because I can tell you something.

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,230
一旦你認清你是多么受局限
Once you identify the degree to which you are boxed in,

80
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,030
就會覺得無比釋然
you'll see how liberating it is.

81
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,490
你是我這邊的
Are you with me...

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
還是你結交的那些無恥之徒
or are you with those horrible, horrible people

83
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,460
那邊的
you've attached yourself to?

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,110
因為我可以告訴你關于比爾·謝潑德的一點
Because I can tell you something about Bill Shepherd.

85
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,360
我能從他身上聞出來
I could smell it on him.

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,030
我曾在我父親  母親身上聞到過那味兒
The way I could on my father, on my mother.

87
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,020
他病了
He's sick.

88
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,400
-他已經好了  -還病著呢
- Well, he was. - He is.

89
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,510
然后你怎么辦
And then where will that leave you?

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,740
只剩她了
With her?

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,150
安奈特·謝潑德
Annette Shepherd?

92
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,900
我清楚那女人的本事
I know what that woman is,

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,150
更重要的是  沒什么本事
and more to the point, isn't capable of.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,290
還有跟阿布佐法官在籌款晚宴上
And that little encounter with the honorable Judge Abruzzo

95
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,100
偶然相遇  也是安排好的吧
at the fundraiser, that was orchestrated too, wasn't it?

96
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,930
是的
Yes.

97
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,490
我有時看著他  會想象他六歲時的樣子
I look at him sometimes and imagine him at six years old.

98
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,390
他一直這么慎重
Was he always so deliberative?

99
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,470
小心嗎
Cautious?

100
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,830
我覺得換了別的人生
And I think in another life...

101
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,060
在別的情況下
some other context

102
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,020
我們或許還能成為朋友
might we have been friends.

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,110
你該決定了  馬克
It's time to decide, Mark.

104
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,940
我衡量每位總統的標準都一樣
I hold every president to the same standard.

105
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,940
你是讓美國變好了
Are you making America better,

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,620
還是變差了
or are you making America worse?

107
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,990
這才是唯一重要的
That's all that matters...

108
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,940
抱歉  你可以把這個關掉嗎
Excuse me. Could you turn this off, please?

109
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,120
-好的  先生  -這個城市的言論水平啊
- Yes, sir. - The level of discourse in this city.

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,570
告訴你  她說得對
I'm telling you. She does have a point.

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,180
你得叫鄧肯
You need to tell Duncan

112
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,610
對他的斗牛犬留點神
to be careful when it comes to his pit bull.

113
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,240
城市
City.

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,150
小羅斯福把這地方變成了一座城市
FDR turned this place into a city.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,940
他的各種機構  辦事員
With his agencies and armies of clerks.

116
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,020
還有隨即而至的教授
All the professors that followed.

117
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,870
戰前  這里就是個南方小鎮
Before the war, this was just a small Southern town.

118
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,000
雖然是大理石建的  但是
One built of marble, yeah, but just a...

119
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,880
也只是個沼澤邊的小鎮
small town sitting on a swamp.

120

可以來玩
Place to visit.

121
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
可以來
Place to...

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,710
保護共和制
protect the Republic.

123
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,300
保護各州權利
Secure States' rights.

124
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,060
可不像今天這樣
That's not what it is today.

125
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,910
徹底淪為官僚  說客
Some top-down money grab for bureaucrats,

126
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,330
和整個民主黨搶錢的地方
lobbyists and the entire Democratic party.

127
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,230
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}分別是第26任[共和黨]和32任[民主黨]總統
兩人是遠親

128
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,720
你一直更喜歡老羅斯福
You've always been more Teddy.

129
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,230
比那個叛徒小羅斯福強
Than that traitor pig Franklin?

130
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,240
我知道對于你來說  來華盛頓是種犧牲
Look, I know it's a sacrifice for you to be here, in Washington.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,530
但老天爺啊  為什么要住他當初住的房間
But for God's sake, why take the same room he was in?

132
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,680
這個嘛
Well--

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,680
他是想盯著她
Well, he wanted to keep an eye on her.

134
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,090
弗蘭西斯放不下白宮
Francis never could let go of the White House.

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,690
但他給了我們一個我們一直在等待的機會
But he did give us the opportunity we've been waiting for.

136
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,220
她不夠格
She's not qualified.

137
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,620
總統之位是她偷來的
She stole the damn thing.

138
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,350
如果說有一個
If ever there was ever a chance

139
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,750
縮小政府規模的機會
to shrink the office down to size,

140
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,440
那就是趁克萊爾·安德伍德在職的時候
it's the presidency of Claire Underwood.

141
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,170
或許你是該去競選
Maybe you should run for office.

142
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,740
那個時機已經過去了
I think that time has passed.

143
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,050
我擔心你
I'm worried about you.

144
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,400
不用
Oh, don't be.

145
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,900
我好極了
Never better.

146
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,810
去監管法案只是個開頭  還有數百份
Deregulation bill is the first of a hundred,

147
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,040
都蓄勢待發
ready and waiting.

148
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,930
你的行動速度
The speed you're moving at--

149
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,430
我可以待會兒再來  律師就要來了
I can come back. The lawyers are due any minute.

150
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,120
沒事  進來吧  自己倒點什么喝
No, no. Come on in here. Grab yourself a cup of something.

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,210
我知道安奈特想在其他人到來前
I know Annette wanted to talk to you in person,

152
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,900
當面跟你談談
before the rest of the team arrives.

153
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,340
我把你告訴我的關于總統的事轉告她了
I passed on what you told me about the president.

154
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,040
我希望鄧肯拿到前
I want you to have it all before

155
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,570
讓你先知道
Duncan got his hands on it.

156
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,420
她承認了三次墮胎
She admitted to all three of the abortions.

157
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,510
但我可以查到孩子都分別是誰的
But I can get you the names of the men. Who they were.

158
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,990
不  我不喜歡這樣
No, I'm not comfortable with this.

159
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,870
我們暫且不談這個了
Let's take that off the table for now.

160
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,290
她會配合的
She'll play along.

161
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,230
我們會確保的
We'll make sure of it.

162
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,330
我一直想象如果我當了總統
I always imagined that if I were president,

163
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,420
我會請你加入我的內閣
I would want you to be a member of my cabinet.

164
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,700
你像個電影明星
You look like a movie star.

165
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,480
是光的緣故  摔倒后我經常偏頭痛
Oh, well, it's the glare. I get migraines since the fall.

166
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,750
-而且是突然發作  -那太遺憾了
- They can come on quite suddenly. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,150
副總統說你想當面見我
The vice president said that you wanted to meet me in person.

168
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,770
見到你我太高興了
It's so good to see you.

169
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,390
坐吧
Sit.

170
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,480
那樣的一摔可不是每個人都能恢復過來的  凱茜
Not everyone comes back from a fall like that, Cathy.

171
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,490
是啊
Yes.

172
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,750
我開始覺得像九命貓了
I'm starting to feel like a proverbial cat.

173
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,510
摘掉你的墨鏡吧  讓我看看你的眼睛
Take off your glasses, let me see your eyes.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
你不缺故事可說
You have no shortage of stories.

175
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,520
這你知道
You know that.

176
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,620
我的記憶現在不太好
My memory's been very erratic lately.

177
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,040
有時候  我覺得我可能會
Sometimes, I think I might just forget

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,320
完全忘記自己在任時發生的事  如果...
the details of my time in office altogether if...

179
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,460
怎么
If?

180
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,030
老實說  我十分想
Honestly, I would love nothing more

181
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,340
向前看  總統女士
than to just move on, Madam President.

182
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,510
我知道你收到了工作邀約
Well, I understand that you have a job offer.

183
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,440
好幾份呢  很幸運
Several. I'm lucky.

184
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,650
艾森豪威爾戰略企劃  是吧
The Eisenhower Strategic Initiative, isn't it?

185
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,420
去智庫是個合理選擇  離開政府
Yes, a think tank makes sense. Outside of government.

186
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,590
也沒離開得很徹底
Well, not entirely outside.

187
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,750
而且資金主要來自...
And heavily funded by--

188
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,690
企業家和熱心公益者的聯盟  是的
A coalition of industrialists and civic-minded folk, yes.

189
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,190
有改變世界的大計劃
Big plans to change the world.

190
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,510
我還沒接受呢
I haven't accepted.

191
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,900
但你想接受
But you want to.

192
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,860
你覺得我不該接受嗎
You think I shouldn't take the job?

193
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,990
我覺得你該相信自己的直覺  凱茜
I think you should trust your gut, Cathy.

194
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,070
你保重
Take care of yourself.

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,790
克萊爾
Claire.

196
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,250
抱歉  我沒寫信向你表示悼念...
I'm sorry I didn't write after Francis--

197
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,320
不用道歉的
Oh, there's no need to apologize.

198
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,260
我還能感覺到他的手...
I can still feel his hand...

199
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,650
推在我后背上
on my back.

200
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,350
凱茜  他已經不在了
Cathy, he's gone.

201
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,940
比爾·謝潑德已經買通了她
Bill Shepherd got to her.

202
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,090
我感覺得到  她會作證的
I can feel it. She's going to testify.

203
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,510
我的律師告訴我她的團隊還在進行協商
My lawyers tell me her team is still negotiating,

204
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,020
可能還得要一陣呢
maybe for a while yet.

205
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,210
她覺得自己有他們  有這份工作就安全了
She thinks she's safe with them, with this job.

206
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,670
但其實他們是要讓她...
Instead they're gonna be sentencing her to...

207
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,640
得讓人以為是摔倒的并發癥
It needs to look like complications from her fall.

208
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,470
我可以查到她的安保隊  我還有認識人
I can have her detail pulled. I still know some people.

209
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,610
總會有機會的
The opportunity will present itself.

210
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,060
這是我們與弗蘭西斯最后的一環聯系
One last piece connecting us both to Francis.

211
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,010
世界要么與我們同心  要么與我們敵對  道格
The world is either with us or against us, Doug.

212
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
你會戴上嗎
You think you'll ever wear them?

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,380
感覺不對
Doesn't feel right.

214
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,620
知道他對我說的最后一句話嗎
Do you know the last thing he said to me?

215
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,180
"向我保證你和道格
"Promise me you and Doug

216
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,360
會照顧好彼此"
will take care of each other."

217
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,350
我想感謝國家美術館
I want to thank the National Gallery

218
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,170
組織了這場美輪美奐的展覽
for curating this magnificent exhibit.

219
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,020
我們希望  假以時日
Our hope is, in due time,

220
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,420
這些藝術品能回到它們該去的地方
these works of art will return to their rightful place

221
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,680
阿富汗  伊拉克  敘利亞
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

222
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,220
納澤先生
Mr. Nasser.

223
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,970
謝潑德兄妹在讓你出丑
They're making a fool of you, these Shepherds.

224
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,120
特別利益  中間人
The special interests. The go-betweens.

225
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,670
你在敘利亞所謂的維和行動成了無恥的搶地盤
Your so-called peacekeeping in Syria was a shameless land grab

226
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,770
犧牲的是你送去戰場的美國士兵的性命
built on the lives of American soldiers you sent into battle.

227
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,560
那你得怪簡·戴維斯  納澤先生
Then you can blame Jane Davis, Mr. Nasser.

228
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,470
我是怪她
I do.

229
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,660
我本想重新談
I had hoped to renegotiate

230
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,070
簡幾個月前促成的交易
the deal Jane helped broker many months ago.

231
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,970
但現在我知道那不可能了
Now I know that's impossible.

232
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,570
因為她剛巧沒空
Oh, because she's conveniently unavailable.

233
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,150
因為你根本沒這個權力
Because you're in no position to do so.

234
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,140
你跟我一樣  被排擠了
You've been excluded, just as I have.

235
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,120
他們在剝奪你的權力
They're stripping power from you.

236
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,810
你看過復興社會黨的行動手冊嗎
Have you ever seen the Baathist playbook?

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,520
是受了美國情報部門的啟發
It was inspired by American intelligence agencies.

238
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,360
有時候你得在自己國家里搞叛亂
Sometimes, you need to be an insurgent in your own country.

239
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,750
有意思  因為我正在
Well, that's interesting. Because presently,

240
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,530
跟一位已知恐怖組織成員見面呢
I'm meeting with a member of a known terrorist organization.

241
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,130
不好意思  我是個律師
Pardon me. But I'm a lawyer.

242
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,840
如果你縱容美國企業勢力
If you allow American corporate interests

243
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,270
斬斷哈里發國在敘利亞的未來...
to cut ICO out of Syria's future--

244
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,030
你是要威脅我嗎  納澤先生
Are you about to threaten me, Mr. Nasser?

245
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,640
不是  但我們都清楚哈里發國能做出什么事來
No, but we all know what ICO is capable of.

246
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,100
我只是在替我的一位委托人傳話
I'm merely conveying a message from one of my clients.

247
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,040
你和你的委托人是一體的
You and your client are one and the same.

248
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,100
美國人是如此自信他們能
Americans have such faith in their ability to

249
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,520
保護局勢和人民
keep things and people safe.

250
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,710
納澤先生  敘利亞是個
Mr. Nasser, Syria is a country of...

251
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,980
曾經有學校  家園和清真寺的國家
former schools, former homes, former places of worship.

252
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,450
你的組織是制造破壞的主要勢力
Your organization played a large part in the destruction.

253
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,320
你也是  總統女士
And so have you, Madam President.

254
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,930
我恐怕幫不了你
I'm afraid I can't help you.

255
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,850
是啊
No...

256
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,630
你是幫不了
you can't.

257
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,170
我有兩個女兒  美麗的妻子
I got two daughters, a beautiful wife.

258
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,090
盡了職
Paid my dues.

259
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,750
做了四屆
Four terms.

260
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,120
多元化選區的共和黨人
A Republican in a diverse district.

261
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,810
我在當地的政績傲人
I got a ground operation second to none.

262
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,090
我的志愿者
And my volunteers,

263
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,150
在他們之后
their sons and their daughters

264
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,110
他們的孩子也都追隨我
are coming up right behind 'em. I just...

265
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,610
讓我覺得
I just feel like, um...

266
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,470
我的時機可能到了
this could be my moment, you know?

267
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,950
弗萊德跟我說了即將推出的立法
Fred told me about the legislation about to be introduced.

268
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,130
我要聯署
I'm co-signing.

269
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,000
-是...  -很有野心
- It's-- - Ambitious.

270
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,120
史無前例
It's unprecedented.

271
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,580
有兩黨的支持
It's bipartisan, is what it is.

272
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,020
你為她工作
You worked for her.

273
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,600
我為她丈夫工作
I worked for her husband.

274
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,920
沒人希望她控制核武公文包
Nobody wants her hands on a nuclear football.

275
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,130
或是把軍隊派去任何地方  不論國內國外
Or sending any more uniforms anywhere, here or abroad.

276
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,220
你只能接受這一點
You're gonna have to be okay with that.

277
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,530
你接受嗎
Are you?

278
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,720
我不欠她什么
I owe her nothing.

279
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,750
他們有你什么把柄
So what do they have on you?

280
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,600
等等  哥們
Hold on, slugger.

281
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,600
我們還沒那么熟呢
I'm still trying to get acquainted here.

282
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,170
-好吧  -你去哪
- Right. - Where do you think you're going?

283
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,920
弗萊德·安博格叫我來見你
Fred Amburg asked me to meet you.

284
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,680
-弗萊德也叫我來見你  -我們見過了
- Well, Fred asked me to meet you. - And we've met.

285
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,480
你圖個什么啊
Where do you get off?

286
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,200
-就你的經歷而言  -我去的地方
- After where you've been. - You mean where I was.

287
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,670
安博格先生也在
With Mr. Amburg.

288
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,300
你的上一位老板
The last person you worked for--

289
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,960
成了美國總統
Became the President of the United States.

290
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,760
他把你趕出去了
He pushed you out.

291
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,620
我是你的機會
I am your chance.

292
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,250
雖然我不用向你或任何人
You know, not that I have to prove myself to you,

293
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,630
證明自己
or to anyone else,

294
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,030
但我找得到漏洞
but I can find the opening,

295
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,940
裂口  薄弱點
the crack, the weak spot.

296
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,680
我不知道
I don't know,

297
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,670
或許看得清人的恐懼是種詛咒
maybe it's a curse to know what people fear.

298
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,200
比如你
Like you.

299
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,240
我覺得你害怕的  議員
I think what scares you, Congressman.

300
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,890
你的選民
Your base,

301
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,300
你的本地政績  人民的愛戴
your ground game, all that love.

302
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,170
讓你覺得這是你應得的
You thought you deserved it,

303
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,340
這只屬于你  而不是別人
that it was meant for you and nobody else.

304
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,280
你盲目了
You got blind.

305
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,320
你忘了他們也會找你的麻煩
You forgot that they'd come for you.

306
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,830
他們會來的
But they will come.

307
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,350
這一行就是如此
That's how this business is built.

308
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,750
所以我再問你一次
So, I'm going to ask you again.

309
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,020
他們有你什么把柄
What is it that they have on you?

310
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,990
我的選區包括芝加哥奧黑爾機場
My district covers O'Hare.

311
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,880
養老金
Pensions.

312
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,170
行李工的  我...
The baggage handlers. I--

313
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,490
該死
Shit.

314
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,000
真是犯蠢
It was stupid.

315
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,620
嗯
Well...

316
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,950
不能解決掉才叫蠢呢
it's only stupid if you can't make it go away.

317
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,360
湯姆  冷靜點
Tom, calm down.

318
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,560
我已經太老  做不到禮貌了
I'm getting too old to be polite.

319
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,190
聽聽協議條件  報道內容不會變的
Hear the deal out. Content will not be changed.

320
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,470
你和我都清楚那不是真的
And you and I both know better.

321
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,940
那晚上發生了什么事
Something happened that night.

322
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,790
他們的婚姻已破裂
Their marriage was broken,

323
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,030
他去了白宮
he went over there.

324
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,790
我不是說這有關聯
I'm not saying they're connected,

325
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,250
但他第二天就死了
but the next day he winds up dead.

326
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,130
而她早知道他要遭起訴
She knew an indictment was coming.

327
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,640
你明白這意味著什么嗎
Do you understand what that means?

328
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,770
那就接著寫報道啊
Then keep writing.

329
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,270
好讓他們發推特騙點擊量嗎
So they can turn it into a 140 characters for clickbait?

330
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,190
我們不做報道了
We don't write anymore,

331
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,150
我們不過是在做豬食
we come up with feed for the trough.

332
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,000
馬上把那玩意放下  否則我砸了它
Put that goddamn thing down before I smash it!

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,090
你得回去
You need to go back in there

334
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,780
道歉
and apologize.

335
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,730
對誰道歉  戴娜
To whom, Dayna?

336
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,470
我們的新老板就是一個揚聲器里的聲音
Our new boss is a voice on a speakerphone!

337
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,450
他都不知道我已經出去了
He doesn't even know I walked out.

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,040
我們為什么不報道加德納分析
Why don't we write about how Gardner Analytics

339
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,340
買下了好多電視臺
is buying up television stations

340
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,460
和國內一些最好的報紙
and some of the greatest papers in this country?

341
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,080
"分析"  天吶
"Analytics." Oh, my God.

342
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,470
這叫什么名字
What the fuck does that even mean?

343
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,320
尸檢結果
According to the autopsy,

344
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,220
是自然死亡
natural causes.

345
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,140
心臟病嗎
Heart attack?

346
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,570
肝臟藥物服用過量
Overdose of his liver medication.

347
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,090
推測為意外
Accidental, presumably.

348
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,750
-你有什么沒告訴我  -沒有了
- What aren't you telling me? - Nothing.

349
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,310
他絕不會有意那么做的
He would never do that intentionally.

350
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,260
當晚海亞當斯酒店大堂的目擊者稱

351
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,390
前總統看上去很凌亂
said the former president was acting disoriented.

352
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,430
你跟他的遺孀說過這些嗎
Did you share this with his widow?

353
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,610
就是她在要我調查
She's the one who asked me to look into it.

354
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,350
她懷疑是謝潑德兄妹
She suspects the Shepherds.

355
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,640
他當時常跟他們見面  但那晚沒有
He was with them a lot, but not that night.

356
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,680
-那誰在  -除了她嗎
- And who was? - Other than her?

357
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,990
那可是她丈夫  道格
That was her husband, Doug.

358
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,570
她是總統
She's the president.

359
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,860
你還真忠心啊  納森
Don't you sound devoted, Nathan.

360
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,140
我跟她只有職業層面的接觸
My only contact with her is in my official capacity.

361
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,460
你以為不會再見到我了嗎
Did you think you'd seen the last of me?

362
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,370
我才不會那么想呢
That's the last thing I thought.

363
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,380
我就當做是稱贊了
I'll take that as a compliment.

364
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,810
道格  給
Doug, here.

365
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,430
我追查了他的行蹤
I tracked his comings and goings

366
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,430
一直查到他離開白宮后

367
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,870
我拿到了他電腦接收的元數據
I got my hands on the metadata going into his computer.

372
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,580
看著讓人難受  但...
It's not easy to watch, but...

373
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,460
-好  -你自己決定吧

374
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,070

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,770
抱歉下午的會議我沒能親自到場
I'm sorry I couldn't be at the meeting in person this afternoon.

377

如果我下班晚  遛狗員就會送它過來
My walker drops him off when it's late.

378
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,220
來

你看到了我的爆發

381

你的憤怒

382
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,760
我們需要更多這個

我尤其喜歡你前幾晚在電視上的露面

384
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,710
嗯
Yeah. Well...

385
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,310
我有時候會比較激動
I get a little heated sometimes.

386
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,020
這正是《先驅報》需要的曝光

387
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,040
湯姆

你現在是一個影響廣泛

人脈發達的大集團的一員了

390
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,520
我要說的是  你需要什么證據我都能找來
The point is I can bring you whatever evidence you need.

391
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,740
-等等  -離婚換赦免
- Hold on. - Divorce for pardon.

392
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,500
這是有幾分真實的  但你的消息源...
There's a kernel of truth to it, but your source...

393
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,930
你開口前  先想想我能給你什么
And before you say anything, consider what I'm offering.

伸張正義的機會

395
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,910
如果你是說編造證據  謝潑德先生
If you're talking about manufacturing evidence, Mr. Shepherd,

396
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,250
-我沒興趣  -我不覺得

397
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,150
拜托別拿老記者的那套來壓我

398
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,070
你在這行干了30年
Your 30 years in the business.

399
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,720
我跟你的老助理安吉拉談過
I've spoken to your old assistant, Angela.

400
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,460
她寫了一篇關于與你共事的報道
She's written a piece about her time with you.

401
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,200
我可以發布  也可以...
I could run it, or...

402
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,140
你曾經對弗蘭克·安德伍德像狗一般緊咬不放
Your dogged pursuit of Frank Underwood, pardon the pun,

403
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,260

404
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,780
想想吧
Think about it.

405
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,700
你這年紀的男人  如今都很容易崩潰

406
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,890
文森特·阿布佐法官有資質

407
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,300
有發表論著  有公開聲明
The published writings, the public statements.

408
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,810
全都沒問題  都齊了
It all checks out. Full package.

409
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,720
所以你為什么遲遲不決定啊  總統女士
So what's the hesitation, Madam Prez?

410
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
首都電視是加德納分析的子公司
Beltway Television is owned by Gardner Analytics.

411
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,720
是鄧肯·謝潑德的最新創造
It's the latest brainchild of Duncan Shepherd.

412
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,560
我已經回避了一切
So far, I've deflected

413
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,890
關于科魯茲小姐言論的問題
all questions regarding Ms. Cruz's commentary.

414
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,140
很好  不要回應她
Good. Let's not dignify it.

415
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,620
行了  謝謝
No. That's fine, thank you.

416
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,650
就是有這個問題  但我忍不住
They were a hazard, I couldn't resist.

417
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,390
抱歉我沒參加葬禮  還念《詩篇》了嗎

419
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,670
我喜歡那個
I love 42.

420
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,880
納澤不該直接找到你
Nasser had no business coming to you directly.

421
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,900
我知道如果我見他  你就會突然出現
Well, I knew if I met with him, you'd suddenly appear.

422
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,200
他覺得被騙了  簡
He feels lied to, Jane.

423
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,690
因為確實如此
Because he was.

424
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,590
我們根本沒打算給那些土匪一席位置
We were never gonna give those bandits a seat at the table.

425
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,610
簡  他威脅說哈里發國會再發動襲擊
Jane, he's threatened more ICO attacks.

426
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,280
哈里發國基本上都被消滅了
ICO is neutralized, mostly.

427
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,950
我們該重新考慮在敘利亞的行動了
It's time to re-think our involvement in Syria.

428
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,640
撤軍  重建
Stand down, rebuild.

429
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,350
這個協議對于我們所有人都很重要
This deal is important for all of us.

430
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,180
包括謝潑德兄妹
Including the Shepherds.

431
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,430
我也不喜歡他們家族
Look, I'm no fan of that family,

432
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,580
但在敘利亞問題上  我們的利益是一致的
but in the case of Syria, our interests align.

433
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,140
我們下一階段
The next phase of our...

434
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,000
在該地區的行動
presence in the region

435
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,590
更多是為了戰利品而不是和平了
is more about the spoils than the peace.

436
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,590
問題在于佩特羅夫
The problem is Petrov,

437
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,670
謝潑德兄妹和我都鄙視他
whom the Shepherds and I despise.

438
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,520
你有謝潑德家族什么把柄
What do you have on the Shepherds?

439
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,400
跟你有聯系的那幾家機構
I'm sure one of the several agencies you're

440
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,190
肯定有一家有料
involved with has something.

441
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,060
你不是給每個和你打交道的人都建立份檔案嗎
And don't you keep files on everyone you're dealing with?

442
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,690
比爾和安奈特都很小心
Bill and Annette are very careful.

443
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,890
那安奈特的兒子鄧肯呢
What about Annette's son, Duncan?

444
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,070
馬克比我更了解他們
Well, Mark knows them more than I do.

445
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,080
我覺得對于前總統還有更好的選擇
I thought there were better options for a former president...

446
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,830
但安奈特不肯放過弗蘭克
but Annette wouldn't leave Frank alone.

447
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,830
那就是他們的問題  他們不知何時該收手
That's their problem, they don't know when to stop.

448
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,230
你三個月前離開時
You know, when you left three months ago,

449
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,790
我還想你去了哪
I wondered where you'd gone.

450
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,890
然后  我就再沒想你了
And then, I didn't think of you at all.

451
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,040
你那么說
You say that.

452
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,460
但我在你的眼里看到了痛苦  總統女士
But I detect pain in your eyes, Madam President.

453
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,730
就像渴望甘泉的小鹿
As a deer longs for streams of water.

454
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,170
我如此渴望你  上帝
So I long for you, God.

455
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,480
你想他嗎
Do you miss him?

456
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,580
上帝嗎  總在想
God? Always.

457
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,510
我希望你搬到白宮里來跟我住  簡
I'd like you to move in here with me, Jane, into the White House.

458
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,200
我需要你的建議
I need your counsel

459
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,720
以及你對馬克的了解
and your perspective when it comes to Mark.

460
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,930
事實上  去年一整年在白宮
The truth is that whole last year in the White House...

461
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,820
我完全迷失了
I just lost myself.

462
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,020
最瘋狂的是  我都沒見過佐伊·巴恩斯
And the crazy thing is, I've never even met Zoe Barnes.

463
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,420
你也這么跟聯邦檢察官說的嗎
Is that what you told the US Attorney?

464
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,880
還是你和克萊爾·安德伍德做了交易
Or did you and Claire Underwood make a deal?

465
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,050
我和總統分道揚鑣了
The president and I are on different paths.

466
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,930
你是說你沒見過她
You're saying you haven't seen her.

467
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,860
我們談過
We've spoken.

468
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,060
我就是不覺得她的白宮里有我的位置
I just don't see a role for me in her White House.

469
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,090
我在給科爾議員工作
I'm working with Congressman Cole.

470
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,620
他要競選議長
He's making a play for speaker.

471
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,760
我今天從《先驅報》辭職了
I left the Herald today.

472
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,440
如果你是為了這個找我
If that's why you wanted to see me,

473
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,560
-想讓我給你的新老板做報道  -不是
- make a pitch for your new guy. - No.

474
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,500
不  這是在做彌補
No, this is about making amends.

475
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,990
-我去年秋天又開始喝酒了  -不
- Last fall I started drinking again. - No.

476
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,980
你選這里
You picked this place

477
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,580
是因為這里到處是博主和國會山的鼠輩
because it's full of bloggers and Hill rats.

478
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,070
現在  這里的人都能看到我們在說話
Right now, everyone here can see us talking together,

479
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,400
客客氣氣的
like civilized people.

480
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,010
就好像我不曾在報紙上喊你"殺人犯"
As if I never called you a murderer in print.

481
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,480
你最新一篇關于弗蘭西斯的報道
Your latest article on Francis.

482
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,620
關于他死前的幾晚
This story about the nights leading up to his death?

483
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,800
-你想彌補嗎  -你的消息源是誰
- You want to make amends? - Who are your sources?

484
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,390
彼得·羅素
Peter Russo.

485
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,620
佐伊·巴恩斯
Zoe Barnes.

486
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,610
莉安·哈維
LeAnn Harvey.

487
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,340
道格  你已經沒有陰影可躲了
Doug, there isn't a shadow for you to hide in anymore.

488
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,730
唯一知道一切的人  就是你
The only person knows everything is you.

489
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,070
我不全知道
I don't.

490
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,610
放棄他吧
Let him go.

491
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,780
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

492
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,350
你早晚得做出決定
At some point, you're gonna have to decide.

493
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,480
克萊爾·安德伍德  相信我
Claire Underwood, believe me,

494
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,380
等時候到了  她會找上你的
she'll come for you when it's time.

495
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,920
謝謝
Thanks.

496
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,930
那玩意有咖啡因的
You know, there's caffeine in that.

497
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,070
我知道
I do.

498
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,870
我喜歡你愛喝阿諾德·帕爾默  但...
I love that you love Arnold Palmers, but--

499
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,260
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}指發明這種飲品的高爾夫球手

500
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,260
他可是個偉人
Arnold Palmer was a great man.

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,620
還在想她嗎
She still on your mind?

502
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,100
這樣下去不行
This arrangement isn't working.

503
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,470
怎樣
Which arrangement?

504
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,100
馬克  到床上來
Mark, come to bed.

505
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,220
她得覺得自己有點自主權
She needs to feel some degree of autonomy.

506
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,750
去他的自主權
Fuck autonomy.

507
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,610
她要為我們服務
She serves at our pleasure.

508
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,420
她肯定覺得自己不受重視
I'm sure she feels undervalued.

509
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,770
不受重視
Undervalued?

510
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,180
克萊爾·黑爾  得了
Claire Hale? Please.

511
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,750
要是比爾不能好起來呢
What if Bill doesn't get better?

512
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,650
他好多了
He is better.

513
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,530
如果在明面上
If we don't play this right,

514
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,990
我們不能做好  就注定要失敗
in the public eye, we are doomed to fail.

515
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,340
-你明白吧  -是她要完蛋
- You know that, right? - She's doomed, you mean.

516
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,270
聽著
Look...

517
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,270
我們說清楚
Let's be clear.

518
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,330
我對她沒有感覺  但她得把我視為伙伴
I am not attracted to her, but she needs to see me as a partner.

519
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,820
而且急什么
And what is the rush?

520
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,950
比爾要法庭的多數支持
Bill wants a majority on the court.

521
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,290
他等了很久了
He's waited a long time.

522
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,540
至少讓她有個總統的樣兒
Let her at least look like the president.

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,610
之后如果有必要  我會攪黃她的提名人
I'll scuttle the nomination if it comes to that later.

524
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,040
是我要阿布佐法官  馬克
I want Judge Abruzzo, Mark.

525
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,220
永遠別質疑我哥哥能不能
And don't ever question my brother's ability

526
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,650
發揮最大的本事
to function at the highest level.

527
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,460
西爾維婭·普拉斯[作家]那句話怎么說的
What is that Sylvia Plath line?

528
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
"她像吸氣一般吞食男人"
"She eats men like air."

529
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,200
這是說誰呢
Who are we talking about?

530
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,600
抱歉我們昨天沒碰到
Sorry we missed each other yesterday.

531
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,880
很抱歉今天又要讓你為難了
Well, my apologies for leaving you in the lurch again today.

532
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,930
沒事吧
Everything okay?

533
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,320
我跟安奈特談過了
I spoke to Annette.

534
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,720
我真心認為這是最佳辦法
I really think this is the best course.

535
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,790
-你見過喬治嗎  -誰
- Did you ever meet George? - George?

536
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,980
我弟弟喬治  平凡的喬治
My brother George. Incurious George.

537
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,220
不  沒見過
No, I never did.

538
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,420
想當年
And back in the old days,

539
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,980
我們在中西部買下了一個廠子
we acquired an operation in the Midwest,

540
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,880
精煉加拿大原油
refining Canadian crude.

541
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,610
利潤...
Profit margin was...

542
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,600
令人吃驚
It was staggering.

543
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,690
但喬治
But George,

544
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,020
卻突然崇高了起來
he got all high-minded about it.

545
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,670
覺得我們違法太多  于是
Thought that we were bending too many laws. So he--

546
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,300
他買下了一家對手公司  環保能源的那種
He bought a rival company, green energy type,

547
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,660
然后起訴了我們
and he sued us.

548
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,730
起訴我們啊
Sued us.

549
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,330
真是的
I mean...

550
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,200
這樣的背叛
The betrayal.

551
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,100
我父親真正信仰的  是家庭
My father's true religion was family.

552
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,050
他很心寒
And he was troubled.

553
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,990
他對喬治的所作所為非常心寒
He was deeply troubled by what George had done.

554
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,260
改了遺囑
Changed his will.

555
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,990
他死前
Any sibling bringing litigation

556
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,020
任何起訴過其他兄妹的子女
against any other at the time of his death

557
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,940
將自動失去他或她的那份遺產
would automatically lose their share of the inheritance.

558
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,150
每一分該死的錢
Every damnable penny.

559
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,690
他就這么說的
He used that word.

560
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,100
而喬治就這樣失去了繼承權
Which is exactly what happened to George.

561
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,940
他不敢相信
George couldn't believe it.

562
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,090
還說是我哄騙爸爸那么做的
Accused me of tricking Dad into doing it

563
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,500
因為他已經虛弱得神志不清了
when he was too weak to know his own mind.

564
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,440
我父親心里從來都很清楚
My father always knew his own mind.

565
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,130
喬治
George...

566
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,580
他傷心透了
...he was just so broken up about it.

567
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,520
都沒對遺囑做出抗爭
Didn't even contest the will.

568
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,190
而在我看來
Which as far as I see it,

569
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,810
這意味著他就不配
it means he had no place inheriting

570
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,860
繼承那樣的錢
that kind of money to begin with.

571
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,730
他本來有他所需要的一切
The man had everything he ever needed.

572
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,400
但他太...
He was just so...

573
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,980
短視
Short-sighted.

574
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,780
現在住在緬因州的一個島上
Lives on some island in Maine now.

575
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,630
知道對于我來說最糟的部分是什么嗎
You know what the worst part for me was?

576
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,220
這讓安奈特多傷心
How much it upset Annette.

577
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,230
這不行
That was a no-go.

578
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,430
我會拿到提名的  比爾
I'll get the nomination, Bill.

579
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,320
再見了  馬克
Bye-bye now, Mark.

580
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,630
他們好心
They were good enough to

581
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,320
給了我一個大堂的外線
provide me with a direct feed from the Hall.

582
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,180
-這真有必要嗎  -吸氣
- Is this necessary? - Inhale.

583
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,800
你看過《吉賽爾》嗎
You ever seen Giselle?

584
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,280
別那么看我
Don't look at me like that.

585
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,400
也不都是壞結果
The results aren't all bad.

586
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,270
我被監視了
I'm being watched.

587
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,700
誰
By whom?

588
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,190
湯姆·漢默施密特  聯邦檢察官
Tom Hammerschmidt, the US Attorney.

589
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,270
我覺得這已經有段時間了
It's a feeling that I've had for a while.

590
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,240
喂
Hello?

591
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,830
我在
I'm here.

592
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,350
太冒險了
It's too risky.

593
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,630
如果是弗蘭西斯提的  你就會找到辦法
If Francis had asked, you'd have found a way.

594
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,070
沒錯
That's true.

595
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,450
那我很遺憾
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

596
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,210
看來我們要分道揚鑣了  道格
I guess this is where we part ways, Doug.

597
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,760
這樣最好
It's for the best.

598
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,630
那道別吧
Then say goodbye.

599
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,480
知道他對我說的最后一句話是什么嗎
You know what the last thing he said to me was?

600
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,460
"我無法想象你們中
"I can't imagine a world

601
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,030
有一個不在了世界會是什么樣"
with only one of you in it."

602
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,400
每段關系發展到一定時候  你都會想知道
There comes a point in every relationship where you wonder,

603
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,840
"你跟我是一邊的嗎"
"Are you with me?"

604
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,930
是嗎
Are you?

605
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,100
比爾·謝潑德想利用
So, there are some loose ends

606
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,130
一些遺留問題
that Bill Shepherd is trying to exploit.

607
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,220
一個是
One being...

608
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
凱茜·杜蘭特
Cathy Durant.

609
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,890
我們認識很久了
And I have known each other for a very long time.

610
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,830
我知道
I know.

611
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,200
我上次見到凱茜時  她像是一腳踩在鬼門關上
Well, the last time I saw Cathy, she looked at death's door.

612
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,490
你不能要我那么做
You can't ask that of me.

613
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,550
她信任你  簡
She trusts you, Jane.

614
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,220
她信任你
She trusts you.

615
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,220
這是在光天化日下動手
That's making a move in broad daylight.

616
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,700
我喜歡有你住這兒
I enjoy having you here.

617
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,000
我會永遠無法原諒自己的
I'll never be able to forgive myself.

618
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,620
你告訴他莉安的事后呢
And when you told him about LeAnn?

619
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,480
他沒表露出什么情緒  女士
He showed no emotion, ma'am.

620
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,350
-他現在在哪  -還在家
- Where is he now? - Still at home.

621
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,340
我找了幾個探員跟蹤他
I have a couple of agents trailing him.

622
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,490
在聯調局看來  這是為了保護道格
As far as the Bureau is concerned, it's for Doug's own safety.

623
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,410
除了科爾議員  他還見誰了嗎
And besides Congressman Cole, has he met with anyone?

624
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,180
除了我  還有湯姆·漢默施密特
Other than myself, Tom Hammerschmidt.

625
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,130
或許你該去跟他
Perhaps you should be the one on him.

626
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,360
以防我們什么時候需要單獨跟他談
In case we need to find him alone at some point.

627
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,550
我還是很擔心他的精神狀態
I continue to be very concerned about his state of mind.

628
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,490
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,160
弗蘭西斯在手寫遺囑里把一切都給了他
Francis left him everything in his handwritten will.

630
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,220
我好奇嗎  是的
Am I curious? Yes.

631
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,600
但那也不想等著道格拉斯·斯坦普扳倒我
But not enough to wait for Douglas Stamper to bring me down.

632
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,310
杜蘭特國務卿  戴維斯女士在后面
Secretary Durant, Ms. Davis is in the back.

633
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,190
-塞爾呢  -他沒當班  我是吉安卡洛
- Where's Sal? - He's off. My name is Giancarlo.

634
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,760
認識您很高興
It's a pleasure to meet you.

635
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,540
這邊請
Right this way.

636
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,710
今天人很少
Very slow today.

637
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,760
請
Please.

638
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,330
抱歉
I'm sorry.

639
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,440
-國務卿女士  請  -抱歉
- Madam Secretary, please. - I'm sorry, I'm--

640
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,720
國務卿女士
Madam Secretary.

641
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,570
簡  你怎么能
Jane, how could you?

642
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,200
你怎么能這么對我
How could you do this to me?

643
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,370
-聽我說  親愛的  -不  你聽我說
- Listen to me, sweetheart. - No, you listen to me.

644
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,570
是克萊爾嗎
Is this Claire?

645
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,750
你是為了她嗎
Are you doing this for her?

646
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,950
凱茜
Oh, Cathy.

647
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,570
一旦決定已下  你就逃不掉了
Once the decision is made, you can't escape.

648
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,750
或許今天不會  但是
Maybe it won't happen today, but...

649
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,650
總有一天
someday,

650
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,290
恐怕總有那一天
someday, I'm afraid.

651
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,900
我詛咒你
I curse you.

652
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,760
我詛咒你  愿你死得很痛苦
I curse you and wish you a painful death.

653
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,240
漫長而極其痛苦
Drawn out and excruciating.

654
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,020
我不想讓你失望
I don't want to disappoint you.

655
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,460
但我不會那樣死的
That's not how I'm gonna die.

656
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,430
走著瞧吧
Well, we'll see.

657
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,310
是吧
Will we?

658
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,440
我考慮了提名的事
I've been thinking about the nomination.

659
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,120
你應該選阿布佐
You should go with Abruzzo.

660
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,290
如果發出了錯誤信號
We could get beaten up in the midterms

661
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,060
中期選舉時可能會受打擊
if the wrong signals are sent.

662
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,960
這樣可以成為連任總統
It's the way to be a two-term president.

663
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,660
我們還可以成就很多
There's still a lot we can accomplish.

664
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,690
你真是個怪人
You're such a strange animal.

665
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,150
你當上副總統后
You've never been comfortable in your skin

666
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,020
就一直不舒服
since you've been vice president.

667
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,920
你為什么還要費這個心
Why did you even try?

668
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,780
我相信你
I believe in you.

669
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,680
那可不夠
Well, that's not enough.

670
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,800
那我不打擾你看電影了
I'll leave you to your movie then.

671
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,010
安奈特對這一切怎么看
What does Annette have to say about all this?

672
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,400
-我知道你們很親密  -我不會背叛她的
- I know you're close to her. - I won't betray her.

673
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,790
就像我也不會背叛你  克萊爾
Just like I won't betray you, Claire.

674
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,870
他們制住我們了
They got us, you know?

675
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,070
我們應該宣布了
We should make the announcement.

676
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,730
阿布佐
Abruzzo.

677
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,610
開始放吧
You can start the film.

678
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,430
她已經見過了環保署地區行政人員
She's already met with the EPA Regional Administrator,

679
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,890
找備忘錄
looking for memos.

680
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,630
硬盤已清空  云端也沒留東西
Hard disks have been scrubbed, and there's nothing in the cloud.

681
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,190
沒有文件  電子和紙質都沒有
There's no paper trail, virtual or otherwise.

682
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,240
-斯克斯基  -她曾是《先驅報》的
- Skorsky? - She was with the Herald.

683
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,920
我加入白宮時離開了那里
She left when I joined the White House.

684
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,230
就是個當地報紙  我們可以買下來
It's just a local paper. We can acquire it.

685
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,810
這不是總統的嘩眾取寵
This isn't about the president grandstanding.

686
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,590
她有線人
She's talking to someone.

687
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,630
-鄧肯  -我們應該為中期選舉留著應用
- Duncan-- - We should save the app for the midterms.

688
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,340
你相不相信你做的東西
Well, do you trust what you've built or not?

689
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,490
我不希望被曝光
I don't want it exposed.

690
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,180
她也用了應用
She signed up for the app.

691
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,680
我們可以侵入她的手機  打探一番
We can get into her phone, take a look around.

692
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,390
可以讓我們單獨談談嗎
Would you gentlemen excuse us?

693
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,080
不  留下吧  比爾
No, stay. Bill.

694
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,380
她要見我
She wants to see me.

695
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,630
不
Nope.

696
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,620
她說馬克已經不是個稱職的副總統了
She says Mark is no longer a viable vice president.

697
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,610
不能傳達她的意愿
He's not communicating her wishes.

698
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,390
她要直接跟我談
She wants to deal directly with me.

699
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,970
她根本無權做任何要求
She's in no position to demand anything.

700
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,120
天吶
My God.

701
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,500
你想去見她
You want to meet with her.

702
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,730
她始終是總統
She's still the president.

703
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,050
曾三次墮胎
Who had three abortions,

704
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,560
還在這事上對美國人民撒謊
lied to the American people about one.

705
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,140
我說了  我不想用那個
I told you, I'm not willing to use that.

706
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,090
那你就用另一個
Then you'll use the other thing.

707
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,190
馬克告訴我們的
What Mark told us.

708
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,310
封存了  案子挺典型的
Seal. The case was pretty typical.

709
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,210
預科學校嗑藥
Prep school drugs.

710
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,220
鄧肯·謝潑德有足夠的錢脫罪  但另一個男孩
Duncan Shepherd was rich enough to get off, but the other boy,

711
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,700
就沒那么幸運了
not so lucky.

712
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,380
但是
But...

713
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,060
轉錄內容啊
the transcript.

714
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,310
-有趣的讀物  -是令人痛苦
- Fascinating read. - Painful, really.

715
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,020
謝潑德女士來了
Ms. Shepherd's here.

716
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,330
叫她進來
Oh, please send her in.

717
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,160
-安奈特  -克萊爾
- Annette. - Claire.

718
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,630
-簡  -安奈特
- Jane. - Annette.

719
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,970
很高興我們都能直呼彼此的名字了
I'm honored we've graduated to a first name basis.

720
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,800
姓氏有時是個負擔
Surnames can be a burden.

721
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,930
有意思
That's funny.

722
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,300
我一直喜歡我的姓呢
I've always loved mine.

723
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,990
你呢  克萊爾  你放棄了你的娘家姓
What about you, Claire? You gave yours up.

724
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,040
是啊
Exactly.

725
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,320
覺得更像個安德伍德嗎
You feel more like an Underwood?

726
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,950
就像你說的  姓氏有時是負擔
Well, like you said. Surnames can be a burden.

727
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,990
我喜歡你的
I like your...

728
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,370
-女性風格  -女人是什么
- lady quotes. - What is woman?

729
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,440
德·波伏瓦的問題
De Beauvoir question.

730
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,740
沒錯  《第二性》里的
That's right. From The Second Sex?

731
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,750
記得那堂課嗎  安奈特
Remember that class, Annette?

732
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,160
作為少女  那感覺多怪啊
How strange it was, as a teenager,

733
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,620
被一個男人用法語教女權主義
to be taught feminism by a man in French.

734
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,380
我討厭那本書
I hated that book.

735
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,200
的確很啰嗦
Long-winded, for sure.

736
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,200
但你得承認
But you gotta admit.

737
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,300
她什么都說對了
She was right about everything.

738
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,990
跟我合作吧
Work with me.

739
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,180
直接商談  不要中間人
Directly, without a middleman.

740
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,730
馬克如果不頂用
What use is Mark,

741
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,460
又有什么用呢
if he can't be effective?

742
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,990
馬克是可以很有用的
Mark can be very effective.

743
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,330
但現在兩邊都不滿意
Well, but both sides are unhappy.

744
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,470
最高法院
The Supreme Court.

745
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,950
這是一個
This is a choice

746
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,640
能超越總統任期的決定
that outlives any presidency.

747
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,860
沒錯
Exactly.

748
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,440
但也是總統的重要政績之一
But also part of what defines a presidency.

749
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,730
當然
Of course.

750
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,790
所以我不能...
So I can't be...

751
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,620
我可以考慮一切信息充足的意見
I will consider any informed opinion.

752
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,260
但我  你明白吧
But I... You understand.

753
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,710
這必須我來決定  安妮
The decision has to be mine, Annie.

754
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,310
已經沒人那么喊我了
No one calls me that anymore.

755
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,390
你兒子  他多大了
Your son, how old is he now?

756
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,270
27嗎  不對
Twenty-seven? No...

757
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,820
28了  我似乎總把他記小一年
Twenty-eight. I always seem to make him a year younger.

758
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,060
他看上去總是比實際年齡年輕
He always did look young for his age.

759
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,290
尤其是少年時的收監照
Especially his juvenile mugshot.

760
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,660
一張娃娃臉
Such a baby face.

761
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,720
你會跟比爾商量一下嗎
So, you'll speak to Bill?

762
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,700
不必
I don't need to.

763
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,200
你是總統  你該按自己的想法做事
You're the president. You should do what you want.

764
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,810
我也總這么想
That's what I keep thinking.

765
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,090
記得我們以前原本多快樂嗎
Do you remember how much fun we used to have,

766
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,750
直到我們明白了規矩
before we understood the rules?

767
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,480
先別急著徹底跟她決裂  好嗎
Look, let's not let it all break down here, okay?

768
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,220
如果我說錯了糾正我
Correct me if I'm wrong,

769
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,370
但你此前從未在白宮
but you've never had a foothold

770
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,290
有如此的影響力  所以
like this in the White House. So...

771
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,610
你是想挽救她  還是上她
You want to save her or fuck her?

772
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,440
不管怎樣  私下里去做
Either way, do it on your time.

773
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,000
別變成私人恩怨
Don't make it personal.

774
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,230
別侮辱我
Don't insult me.

775
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,810
讓她聽話
Shut her down.

776
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,800
給她看
Show it to her.

777
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,120
這是我和比爾的意思  你得照做
That's what Bill and I want. And you'll do it.

778
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,090
不
No.

779
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,380
-這不是請求  -這會造成的后果
- I'm not asking. - The fallout from that...

780
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,560
我不在乎
Not my concern.

781
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,330
你會在乎的
It will be your concern.

782
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,580
你沒靠山了
You're on your own now.

783
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,260
-不不  我們完了  -別
- Oh, no, no, we're done. - Don't.

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,590

是謝潑德自由基金會的人

推動阿布佐法官的提名表決

沒有

我好久沒有湯姆的消息了
I haven't heard from Tom in a long time.

797

798
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,260
偶爾吧

840
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,380
你已經沒有選擇了  總統女士
You've run out of options, Madam President.

841
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,030
我知道了
I understand.

843
00:50:50,970 --> 00:51:40,960
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}美國最高法院設有九名大法官  往往其中八人在意識形態上左右各半
而總有一名在斷案時忽左忽右  成為決定案情的最關鍵一票
今年夏天"搖擺票"肯尼迪法官宣布退休
特朗普提名布雷特·卡瓦諾接替肯尼迪的席位
因為卡瓦諾是保守派  一旦他成功任命  最高法院勢必整體右傾
在參議院舉行的任命聽證過程中  反對黨民主黨議員們雖然百般努力
但是因席位不夠  所以無力阻擋卡瓦諾進軍最高法院的腳步
然而9月16日  《華盛頓郵報》刊文  報道加州一名大學教授
克里斯汀·福特稱高中時在一次聚會上曾遭到卡瓦諾性侵未遂
雖然卡瓦諾立即發表聲明斷然否認性侵指控
但民主黨迅速抓住機會要求白宮撤換卡瓦諾
媒體則如同打了興奮劑一樣全天候轟炸式地對性侵指控進行報道
9月27日  參議院召開公開聽證會
福特首先出場  雖然對于那次聚會的很多細節都回憶不起來
但她表示自己"百分百"確定卡瓦諾就是當年的施暴者
福特發言時表情真摯  回答訊問從容鎮定  談及性侵事件  聲音顫抖
幾個小時下來  觀者無不動容  社交網絡上輿論幾乎一面倒地同情福特

845
00:51:40,960 --> 00:52:30,960
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}但卡瓦諾靠聽證會下半場的"激情自辯"扳回了局面
他在開場陳詞中不僅堅決否認自己是施暴者
還控訴民主黨議員利用福特給自己栽上莫須有的罪名
在談及此事對自己的家庭帶來的巨大傷害時  聲音哽咽幾難成言
在問答環節  卡瓦諾對民主黨議員們的嚴厲質詢
給予了毫不客氣的反駁  甚至進行反問  輿論的天平就這樣被扳了回來
10月6日下午  參議院以50比48的表決結果正式確認了卡瓦諾的大法官任命
一名共和黨投了反對票  一名民主黨投了贊成票  其余議員都是按黨站隊
卡瓦諾成為1881年以來任命投票時結果最為接近的一名大法官
而卡瓦諾的激情自辯讓共和黨支持者認為
他受到了民主黨和媒體的雙重政治迫害
這種情緒被共和黨政客們轉化為了催票利器
卡瓦諾正式任命后  多個民調顯示共和黨選民投票熱情大幅提升
在11月6日的中期選舉中  那些投票反對卡瓦諾任命的民主黨參議員紛紛落馬
唯一投票支持任命卡瓦諾的民主黨參議員曼欽則順利連任

847
00:52:30,960 --> 00:53:05,960
{\an5}{\pos(193,140)}美國的各類工會組織實力強大  在同民主黨結成政治同盟之后
同民主黨政客互相扶持  在政客競選時出錢出力出人
而政客上臺后則會通過一系列對工會有利的法律法規
多年以來  由于影響力巨大  加上又有政治保護傘
所以很多大工會組織內部腐敗不斷  不少甚至成為準黑幫組織
涉及敲詐勒索  偷竊洗錢  非法賭博等等違法勾當
而挪用盜用工會成員的養老金也是被媒體揭露出來的工會黑幕之一
據報道  美國最大的一家工會成員養老金基金
因經營不善  曾經申請破產  涉及金額超過百億美元
在芝加哥地區  當地最大的工會組織頭目科力及其整個家族
控制工會多年  同芝加哥地區的各路政客也都稱兄道弟
