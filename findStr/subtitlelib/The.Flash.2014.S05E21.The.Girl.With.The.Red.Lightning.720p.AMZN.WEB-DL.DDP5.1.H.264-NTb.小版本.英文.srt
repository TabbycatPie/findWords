17
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,830
Previously on "The Flash"...

18
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,620
My time on this earth is coming to an end.

19
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,980
You're part of something different now.

20
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,710
Part of a negative force. Pain racing through your mind.

21
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,380
Thawne really got to her.

22
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,650
Her lightning. It was red.

23
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,640
- Ren¨¦e Adler. - Sherloque Wells.

24
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,550
You're a meta.

25
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,210
You're from the future.

26
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,480
- The mission can succeed. - What mission?

27
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,850
To kill every last meta-human.

28
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,870
Cicada's dagger can dampen powers.

29
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,570
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

30
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,980
it's this mirror gun.

31
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,470
Cicada has a lethal virus.

32
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,060
She stole the atomizer so she could spread the virus.

33
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,710
Cicada is gonna kill every meta-human in the city.

34
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,310
15 years, Thawne.

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,270
Tell me, how's it feel to know you're about to become extinct?

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,650
I guess time will tell.

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,070
I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,590
Especially our rehabilitation time.

39
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,170
How about a taste of what's to come?

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,770
Ironic, isn't it?

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,960
The same thing that gives you your powers is gonna end you.

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,170
It's time.

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,340
We need to stop this plague from spreading.

46
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,550
We will.

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,060
We can't just purge the meta-humans in this city.

48
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,370
We need to wipe every one of them off the face of the planet.

49
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,350
We will.

50
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,850
You need to promise me this will work, Gracie.

51
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,980
I said it will.

52
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,560
It's time we finish this, Gracie.

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,310
It's time to ensure our legacy.

54
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,510
Here's what we know about the Cryo-atomizer.

55
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,060
Tannhauser originally developed it

56
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,820
to combat land fires caused by droughts.

57
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,980
So the Cryo-atomizer can disperse cold air particles

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,410
into the atmosphere that triggers rainfall.

59
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,570
However, if Cicada can replace the cold particles

60
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,940
with the cure prototypes she stole from Cisco...

61
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,650
Which doesn't cure so much as it kills.

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,880
She could infect the entire city.

63
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,050
And every meta-human in it.

64
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,980
Not great, but this dark cloud does have a silver lining.

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,240
Which is if Cicada had everything

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
that she needs to carry out her plan...

67
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,490
would've already done so.

68
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,580
He's right.

69
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,030
She must be missing something or else we'd be done.

70
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,290
Yeah, but not for long.

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,880
She's not gonna waste any time.

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,970
Whatever it is that she needs,

73
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,900
she's out there looking for it right now.

74
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,580
Well, then we move right away.

75
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,410
We get the cure to everyone who needs it as soon as possible.

76
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,110
So we just up and release some game-changing wonder drug?

77
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,520
We tested it. We know it works.

78
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,970
People need a choice now more than ever.

79
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,580
Do we have enough for the cure?

80
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,810
Not nearly enough.

81
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,590
Caitlin, how fast can you make more?

82
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,850
Guess we'll find out.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,280
Okay, okay, good.

84
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,650
Now we just need to find someplace to distribute it.

85
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,930
Well, what about CCPD?

86
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,050
It's public. Everybody feels safe going there.

87
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,970
Yeah, but gathering that many metas in one place

88
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,260
is gonna make it one big target, right?

89
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,370
Cicada has the virus and the atomizer,

90
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,990
that makes every meta everywhere a target.

91
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,120
Well, how about this?

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,260
You guys make up as much of the cure as you can

93
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,810
and Cecile and I will talk to Singh.

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,500
- Yeah. - All right.

95
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm going to warn Ren¨¦e.

96
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,030
Yeah.

97
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,820
All right, let's track Cicada too.

98
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,750
Get ready to face her when we find her.

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,490
Let's take it one step at a time.

100
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,600
Follow me.

101
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,490
- Is that the satellite core? - That's right.

102
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,200
The reflective panels on the mirror gun

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,140
aren't the only thing we got from the satellite.

104
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,930
We also have the core and, of course, the dagger.

105
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,500
So they're all composed of the exact same alloy

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,600
- and contain the same dark matter levels? - Yup.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,190
So if the Mirror Gun works on the core,

108
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,760
then it should work on Cicada's dagger.

109
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,640
Only one way to know for sure.

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,440
You might wanna step back.

111
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,180
I mean, you don't know what this gun's gonna do.

112
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,800
I mean, we shouldn't be firing this in such a small space

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,510
but what's life if you don't pull down your shorts

114
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,040
and slide on the icery once in a while?

115
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,990
Here we go!

116
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,070
Is something supposed to happen or...

117
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,840
Where did it go?

118
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,960
It doesn't matter.

119
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,160
This thing works.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,380
It works!

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,440
We can finally destroy Cicada's dagger.

122
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,570
If we do that, we have our powers.

123
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,480
And we can stop her.

124
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,260
N--Nora, are you okay?

125
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,530
Yeah, why?

126
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,280
Nora, earlier today you had red lightning like Thawne's.

127
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,530
We want to make sure you're okay to get out there.

128
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm fine, okay?

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
Caitlin ran every test in the book.

130
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,080
My lightning's back to its normal color.

131
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,740
And besides, Thawne's Speed Force is fueled by negative emotions,

132
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,770
and right now I feel pretty dang positive.

133
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,140
Okay. We're your parents. It's our job to worry.

134
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,270
The only one that should be worrying is Cicada II.

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,290
You want me to open the doors to the CCPD

136
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,200
to every meta in this city?

137
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,940
David, these people need our protection.

138
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,980
And not all metas are criminals.

139
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,200
You know, some of them are doctors and students and cops.

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,930
I know, but this is a police station, not a clinic.

141
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,490
S.T.A.R. Labs says that the cure is safe

142
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,360
and it's as easy to give as a flu shot.

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,070
Well, S.T.A.R. Labs isn't exactly the FDA.

144
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,650
Look, we have to do it here.

145
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,340
Red tape alone, it would take weeks at a medical facility.

146
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,420
If we do nothing, there's a whole bunch of citizens

147
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,180
who could've been saved that will die on our watch.

148
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm not having that.

149
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,370
Well, you clearly believe in this.

150
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,350
So I'm willing to as well.

151
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,850
But that means there's going to be a lot of political navigating.

152
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,570
So I'll go down to city hall and brief them in the morning.

153
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,560
While I'm away, you're in charge.

155
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,400
Sherloque, you scared me to death.

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,430
Well, I apologize.

157
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,430
But when you don't answer my many emoticon pictograms,

158
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,030
no, I fear the worst, huh?

159
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,950
I was in the library. What could've happened to me?

160
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,830
Stacks collapse. Livid librarian.

161
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,790
- Really? - Death by Dewey Decimals?

162
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,330
Yeah, life lost by late fees?

163
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,910
- Ha-ha! There you go. - Yeah. Oh.

164
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,310
Shall we?

165
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,210
I'm sorry I didn't-- I didn't check my texts.

166
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,450
I mean, well, actually I haven't checked my phone all day, so...

167
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,120
And yet the average person checks their phone 110 times a day.

168
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,570
- That's not true. - That is true. Look it up.

169
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,530
Well, also the library's right next to the tech lab.

170
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,160
So, you know, I get terrible reception in there.

171
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,260
And yet that built a cell phone tower less than a mile away.

172
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,150
Hasn't made a difference.

173
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,100
I don't know, Maybe my phone's just crap.

174
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,080
Or maybe you don't want to respond

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,750
because then you would have to discuss your secret.

176
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,230
- My secret? - Yes, your secret.

178
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,110
Run. Run!

179
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,080
What?

180
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,870
It's Sherloque. Cicada's at CCU.

181
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,790
So at Jitters, I saw you open the door without touching it.

182
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,220
I know you have powers. What are they?

183
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,340
That.

184
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,380
I see you too.

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,260
Are you okay?

186
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,650
I think so.

187
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,340
Nora.

188
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey, you find anything?

189
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,580
Confirmation that She-cada hasn't stolen everything she needs.

190
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,890
So we have some time.

191
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,530
Finally some good news.

192
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,750
Except what she did steal was a Quantum Tunnel Converter.

193
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,900
The first working prototype of its kind.

194
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,670
Yeah, that's the same face Cisco made when he heard.

195
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,110
The converter can transform dark matter energy to practical energy.

196
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,680
Cicada's gonna use her dagger to superpower the atomizer.

197
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,460
If she wants to connect it to the atomizer,

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,710
the last piece she'll need is a hyper-conduit,

199
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,450
and those are pretty hard to come by, to say the least.

200
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,290
She'll be lucky to locate one in the CC area at all.

201
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,450
Well, we better find it first.

202
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,710
We'll get to it.

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,580
Small sips, huh?

204
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,770
The second she saw me, she wanted me dead.

205
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,470
She tried to kill me, Sherloque.

206
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,050
Because of what you are.

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,350
A magnokinetic meta-human!

208
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,610
That was something, your powers, huh?

209
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,980
I wanted to tell you, but...

210
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,900
I didn't know what you'd think.

211
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,020
I think...

212
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,860
the world of you.

213
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,450
Nothing is ever going to change that.

214
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,860
Do you think Cicada's gonna come back again to try to find me?

215
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,100
To try again?

216
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes. I don't think she'll stop.

217
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,550
What am I gonna do?

218
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, you know what?

219
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,540
I believe I can help you with that.

220
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,300
Guys, you okay?

221
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,670
Yeah, uh, I need to tell you something.

222
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,410
When we were running over here,

223
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,050
I connected to Grace's mind again.

224
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,290
I could see through her eyes.

225
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,160
Wait, like the same thing you did

226
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,040
when Cicada attacked Alice Bolan's birthday party?

227
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah, we must still be psychically connected

228
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,270
from when I was in Grace's mindscape.

229
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,390
That's what caused the red lightning.

230
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,240
The anger that you felt, it wasn't yours.

231
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,400
It was hers.

232
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,590
We can use this.

233
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,440
If I can see where she is just for a second,

234
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,830
we can run to her.

235
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,480
Guy, this is the key to stopping Cicada II.

236
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,320
No.

237
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,610
No, Nora, it's too dangerous.

238
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,980
- We don't even know what the side effects are. - No.

239
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,130
We just got the stuff out of you.

240
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,540
We're not risking exposing you to that again.

241
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,360
Mom, I want to do this.

242
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,540
We'll find another way.

243
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,690
We'll find another way.

244
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,780
The dizziness should subside shortly.

245
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,520
Make sure he gets lots of rest.

246
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,830
Hey, we know you're feeling anxious.

247
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,880
But I promise you're safe now.

248
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,850
Head out that way.

249
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,970
I'm gonna go see if there's anyone else.

250
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
Should we reopen the Cicada tip line?

251
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,530
And Dupree's asking where you want the security checkpoints.

252
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,000
Uh, yeah.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Uh, yes. Open it and, uh, checkpoints should be

254
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,410
two blocks on either side of the CCPD. Okay?

255
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,610
Uh, actually, three--three blocks.

256
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,860
Hey, you. You good?

257
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,310
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. Look.

258
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,670
They are airing Iris' story again.

259
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,740
New updates on the meta-human serial killer Cicada,

261
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,920
who recently attacked Central City University.

262
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,630
Now in response to these attacks,

263
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,740
The Central City Citizen reports that CCPD,

264
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,040
in conjunction with S.T.A.R. Labs,

265
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,490
is offering a groundbreaking meta-human cure,

266
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,770
entirely free of cost.

267
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,360
Maybe I should call the night shift in earlier.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
Oh, my God.

269
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,850
Or not.

270
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,910
Joe, I just felt a huge wave of panic.

271
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,270
We're about to get slammed in here.

272
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,140
Everyone, please be patient. We'll get to you.

273
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,190
Far enough.

274
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,240
Okay.

275
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,000
Stagg, Mercury, Ivo.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,780
None of them have a hyper-conduit compatible

277
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,840
with the converter Cicada stole.

278
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,450
You know, now that I've actually experienced

279
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,640
this whole time travel thing,

280
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,790
I think I understand it a little bit better.

281
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,730
Which makes me understand Thawne's plan less and less.

282
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,520
Why would he send Nora back to create a new Cicada

283
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,260
only for a newer Cicada to appear

284
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,700
who's harder to stop than the one Nora created?

285
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,800
Ralph, can we get away from Thawne's plan

286
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,210
and try to stick to our own?

287
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,910
Yeah, yeah, I--I just--

288
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,070
I feel like there might be an answer

289
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,010
in this timey-wimey crap that could help us solve this.

290
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,730
Nora, where would you find this hyper-conduit in 2049?

291
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,980
Probably Ollins Laboratory.

292
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,560
Ollins won a Nobel Prize for quantum engineering.

293
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,440
Ollins? As in Sebastian Ollins?

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
Yeah, do you know him?

295
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,340
He's a true genius.

296
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,240
A genius, you say.

297
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,700
The guy couldn't even stay awake through a single physics lecture.

298
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,830
In fact, I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for his very smart,

299
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,810
very considerate college roommate

300
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,500
lending him notes, helping him study,

301
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,490
he wouldn't have made it through his finals!

302
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,370
Nobel Prize my ass!

303
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,650
Yeah, he knows him.

304
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,860
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

305
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,330
Life's too short and I'm not about to spend my life

306
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,570
worrying about little Sebastian Ollins.

307
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,760
Found him.

308
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,850
Looks like he's been renting a warehouse

309
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,440
somewhere on the Southside

310
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,550
and then he retrofitted it with fiber-joules technology

311
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,440
to test out his experiments.

312
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,110
Including one bleeding-edge hyper-conduit.

313
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,050
I'll go get it before Grace can.

314
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,040
- Right behind you. - I, um...

315
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,740
I--I think you should sit this one out.

316
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,650
What? Why?

317
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,780
Nora, your connection with Grace.

318
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,320
It puts you in too much danger.

319
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,150
I mean, we don't-I think it's best for you

320
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,250
to just stay out of the field until we stop her.

321
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,340
So what? Now I can't help the team at all?

322
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,280
Nora, please understand.

323
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,690
Look, you would be much safer here.

324
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,760
All right, I'm here.

325
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,120
No sign of Cicada.

326
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,760
Great. Grab the conduit and get out of there.

327
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,360
I think I got something.

328
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,250
Barry!

329
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,520
She's already got the conduit.

330
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,980
And she blew up Ollins' warehouse.

331
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,600
Grace has everything she needs.

332
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,020
It's just like we thought.

333
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,430
Great.

334
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,490
What?

335
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,420
With all the pieces that she's stolen,

336
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,190
Grace can now use the dagger's dark matter energy

337
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,320
to supercharge the atomizer.

338
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,780
Apparently it wasn't enough for her

339
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,980
to just kill all the metas in Central City.

340
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,500
With this super-charge,

341
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,690
she'll kill every meta in the country.

342
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
All right, look,

343
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,570
I know you guys want me off this whole Thawne thing,

344
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,140
- but you've got to hear this. - Ralph.

345
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,360
No, you've got to look at this.

346
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,600
You've got to hear this.

347
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,310
So just--just give me a second, all right?

348
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,810
- All right. - Please.

349
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,170
All right, so, this is the original timeline

350
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,010
with the original Cicada, David Hersch.

351
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,660
This is the night of the Enlightenment,

352
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,150
when Nora interfered with the satellite,

353
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,130
giving us our Cicada, Orlin Dwyer.

354
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,930
That's also the same night that Grace goes into a coma.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
This is where it gets complicated.

356
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,730
At some point in the future,

357
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,220
Grace wakes up, she becomes her own full-fledged Cicada.

358
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,520
She goes back in time,

359
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,620
she kills her Uncle with his own dagger.

360
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,740
What happens to all the metas that Dwyer killed?

361
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,800
Do they get un-killed?

362
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,820
What about all the metas that Grace killed in the future?

363
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,670
What did she kill them with?

364
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,330
And most importantly,

365
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,540
what happens in the timeline where Grace never killed Dwyer.

366
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,140
Something doesn't add up.

367
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,140
You might be right.

368
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,250
But right now, there won't be any future for any metas

369
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,270
if we don't get rid of that dagger.

370
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,010
Now. This is our last chance.

371
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,940
We have to figure out how to find Grace.

372
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,370
Or we lose everyone.

373
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,620
We'll go see what the satellites can do.

374
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,640
Maybe we're due for a miracle.

376
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,330
Hey, come on.

377
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,260
Do you think we made the right decision

378
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,570
leaving Nora out of this?

379
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,910
I mean, the whole reason she came back

380
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,200
was to fight Cicada in the first place.

381
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,910
We're her parents, all right?

382
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,730
It's our job to protect her from harm.

383
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,930
The best way to do that is just to keep her far away from it.

384
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,150
You worked for Caitlin and Killer Frost's connection.

385
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,420
Let's see what you can do for me and Grace.

386
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,790
What's taking so long?

387
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,220
Look, how much more cure do you have left?

388
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Listen, we have plenty.

389
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,910
Please, uh, we will administer the cure

390
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,030
as fast as we can, people. Okay?

391
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,020
Detective West, we need additional squads to aid the crowd control.

392
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,330
Uh, yeah, take--take two.

393
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,910
No--no, no. Take three. Two, two, two.

394
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,010
Joe, we need more alcohol swabs.

395
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,290
Babe, you okay?

396
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,140
Hey, oh! Hey, oh!

397
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,140
- Sherloque? - So, Dr. Caitlin Snow.

398
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,730
This is Cecile Horton and Detective Joe West.

399
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,640
This is my...

400
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,080
this is Mademoiselle Ren¨¦e Adler.

401
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,420
- Hi. Adler. - Adler. And Ren¨¦e,

402
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,280
these are the people that can help you.

403
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,910
So you can actually just remove my powers?

404
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,270
We can if you want us to.

405
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,480
And--and this would be permanent?

406
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,520
Oh, it's permanent, yes.

407
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,650
But better than Cicada permanently killing you.

408
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,630
Am I right? Tell her detective.

409
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,690
- That's right? Right? - Yes.

410
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,630
Uh, you're feeling nervous, I can tell.

411
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,270
But Cicada really is trying to kill

412
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,810
every meta-human in this city.

413
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,550
Hey, what's your problem?

414
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,250
Back off! I'm standing here.

415
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,630
Is something wrong with your eyes?

416
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,560
They're fine.

417
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,550
Then get out of my way.

418
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,380
All right, all right. Break it up.

419
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,650
We need to keep this line moving.

420
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,960
Want us to detain them, Detective?

421
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,180
Just give me the cure and I'll get out of here.

422
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,060
No way! I was here first! You know that!

423
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,620
Sir, what should we do?

424
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,490
Detective, we've got one squad left.

425
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,370
Give me the cure and I'll get out of here.

426
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,530
Enough!

427
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,130
I need a minute to think.

428
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,450
I'm so--

429
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,990
Ren¨¦e?

430
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,710
There she is.

431
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,510
That was Cecile.

432
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,910
CCPD is flooded with a lot of really scared people.

433
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,710
Are there any signs of Grace's dark matter signature?

434
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,960
No. Nothing. Not even a--

435
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,820
Is that her?

436
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,570
Nora!

437
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,550
Barry, she can't hear you.

438
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,460
I don't think she can see us either.

439
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,440
Nora! Nora!

440
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,170
Nora!

441
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,950
What were you thinking?

442
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,610
Nora, you almost gave yourself an aneurysm.

443
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,140
I was tring to find Grace.

444
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,100
Opening yourself up to Grace and her rage

445
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,060
also opens you up to the Negative Speed Force.

446
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,080
We don't know anything about it.

447
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,180
Don't you get how dangerous that is?

448
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,370
Yeah, I do.

449
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,140
And I still wanna try. I have to try.

450
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,820
Nora, you tring almost destroyed Cisco's workshop

451
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,840
and almost got yourself killed.

452
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,330
Not to mention, what if Cicada saw through your eyes?

453
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,930
You could've given away our location.

454
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,510
No, I made sure there was nothing in my eye line

455
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,550
that said S.T.A.R. Labs.

456
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,770
Guys, listen.

457
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,180
I saw Grace and I almost saw where she was.

458
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,010
Right now she is putting her pieces together

459
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,150
and when that is done,

460
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,250
thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people

461
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,500
are going to die.

462
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,920
I can't stand around and do nothing.

463
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,910
Yes, you can because that's what we're telling you to do.

464
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,670
When I first got here, I would rush in to fix things

465
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,610
and by doing that, I always ended up making them worse.

466
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,810
But I am not that person anymore

467
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,640
because of you.

468
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
You showed me how to use my powers.

469
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,990
You taught me how to make the right choices.

470
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,410
And right now, I am choosing to face this risk.

471
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,050
Nora, this is a terrible idea.

472
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,510
I know you feel that way.

473
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,580
But I don't.

474
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm an adult capable of making my own decisions.

475
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,160
I've made up my mind about this.

476
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,870
So I am asking you, please, as my parents,

477
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,760
stop trying to keep me away from this danger

478
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,060
and start helping me face it.

479
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,130
No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. I can handle it.

480
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,120
All right.

481
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,050
What are you doing? Those people are overwhelmed.

482
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,820
They don't know what to do.

483
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,070
They need you and you just-- you walked away?

484
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,050
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. It's just--

485
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,230
Okay, did I just catch you on the phone with Singh

486
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,200
trying to find out how fast he was gonna be back?

487
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,740
Cecil, I--I--I'm not used to being in charge

488
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,690
of all this managerial and logistic stuff.

489
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,680
- I'm just not cut out for that. - What are you talking about?

490
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,430
Babe, I have seen you take charge

491
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,310
in the field a million times.

492
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,060
But that's in the field

493
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,130
and I always knew that I had Singh to go to

494
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,510
if I had any problems this way.

495
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,530
Now everybody's coming to me

496
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,020
and I can't answer all these questions.

497
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,310
Joe West.

498
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,820
How many times has Barry, Iris, Nora,

499
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,790
even Ralph Dibny come to you?

500
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,610
Specifically come to you to get answers to their problems?

501
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,540
More times than I can count.

502
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,580
Exactly.

503
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,810
And that is because everyone of them knows

504
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,030
that when they come to you,

505
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,040
they're gonna get an honest answer

506
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,510
straight from the heart.

507
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,140
Babe, that heart of yours, that is a moral compass.

508
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,570
It's one of the many reasons why I love you.

509
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,480
Right here.

510
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,550
That's all you need, babe. Right here.

511
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,120
As long as you speak from there,

512
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,620
I promise you, you will never lead anyone astray.

513
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,280
- Sherloque. - Yes.

514
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,110
Sherloque, I'm sorry I ran.

515
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,650
I was--. Just feeling so overwhelmed.

516
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,200
All I wanted to do... make you feel safe.

517
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,930
And then I put you in a position where you

518
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,220
feel overwhelmed and not safe.

519
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,120
But look, we'll go to S.T.A.R. Labs, quiet and safe.

520
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,830
We'll administer the cure. It will be great.

521
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,250
Look, Sherloque, that's--.

522
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,340
That's not why I ran away.

523
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,060
- It's not? - No.

524
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,550
I don't wanna take the cure.

525
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,200
- You don't? - No.

526
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,460
I love having my powers.

527
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,820
You do?

528
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,810
Y--yes and yes,

529
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,990
is it scary knowing that there's a killer out there

530
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,990
that's targeting people like me, but...

531
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,440
I don't want to change who I am.

532
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,940
I don't want to give into fear

533
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,750
just because there's danger involved.

534
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,740
You know?

535
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,900
I want to live my life on my terms.

536
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,760
As a meta-human.

537
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,780
No, but you're brave.

538
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,940
I just worry that Cicada won't stop

539
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,760
until she kills every meta-human on this...

540
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,740
On this earth.

541
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,360
There is a way.

542
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,170
For you to still have your powers and be free of Cicada.

543
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,210
- How? - On a different Earth,

544
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,610
where'd you be safe.

545
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,510
In your travels in your career as a librarian,

546
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,310
have you ever heard of the theory of the "Multi-verse"?

547
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,070
So--so this a device that opens

548
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,740
- a portal to another world. - Yes.

549
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,140
- Right. - Any world I choose?

550
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Right. You're so smart. You catch on so quickly.

551
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,810
You know, some people, they just don't believe.

552
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,550
Well, a few weeks ago I saw a giant shark

553
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,390
fighting a giant gorilla on the 6:00 news, so...

554
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,230
That's a good point.

555
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,970
Now look, this Earth that I'm going to send you to,

556
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,990
it's...it's my Earth.

557
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,540
I'll have some friends there to meet you,

558
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,560
but secret, huh?

559
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,960
This trip, you must not tell anyone

560
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,850
because if Cicada were to find out there's multiple Earths

561
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,820
and each one of these Earths contains meta-humans,

562
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,760
no, they would be her next target. Hmm?

563
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,460
- What? - Come with me.

564
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,510
No, I must stay.

565
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,340
Now knowing Cicada is a threat to this Earth,

566
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,450
I must fight alongside my friends.

567
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,270
You know, Team Flash, they're like...

568
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,660
They're like a family to me but when I am done...

569
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,070
I will come find you.

570
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,370
You are the woman I have been waiting for.

571
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,550
So...

572
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,040
I know.

573
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,680
- Okay, you ready? - Yeah.

574
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,320
All right.

575
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,920
Allez.

576
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,960
You were right.

577
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,050
We taught you how to be a hero.

578
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,750
So we shouldn't be angry at you when you act like one.

579
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
I know you're just afraid I'll get hurt.

580
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,400
There's always going to be danger

581
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,930
that you're going to face, Nora.

582
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,010
And we can't hold your hand through all of it.

583
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,640
As much as we want to.

584
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,040
You're our daughter but you're not a kid.

585
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,430
You're right, you are capable of making your own decisions.

586
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,120
You really think you can control your connection

587
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,870
to the Negative Speed Force, find Grace for us?

588
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,780
Yeah, I do.

589
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,410
All I need is for you guys to keep our home safe while I do it.

590
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,100
I think I know how.

591
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,950
Let's find Cicada.

592
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,410
Man, this thing brings back memories.

593
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,600
- Good ones? Bad ones? - Thawne ones.

594
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,510
We trapped the Reverse-Flash in this thing

595
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,100
before we even knew he was Thawne.

596
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,290
But we actually ended up trapping his Speed Mirage.

597
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,970
while his real self just sat there chilling in his wheelchair.

598
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,600
Man, Thawne's plans got plans.

599
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,720
But fear not, true believers.

600
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,120
The Thawne Trap 2.0 is smaller, sleeker, and stronger.

601
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,450
I've gone ahead and sharpened the inflexion points

602
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,640
to account for your Negative Speed Force energy.

603
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,320
So if you go full "Dante's Peak" in there,

604
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,400
we'll be safe out here.

605
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,110
It also means I can't phase in there if you need me.

606
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,380
Your dad and I will be right here the whole time.

607
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,760
You always are.

608
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,390
You got this.

609
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,370
Let's go catch our big bad.

610
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,320
Excuse me! Excuse me!

611
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,540
People, please! Please!

612
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,660
Thank you.

613
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,610
For all of you I haven't met, I'm Detective Joe West.

614
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,520
Now I am not a meta-human. I don't know what that's like.

615
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,230
But I do know what it's like to be afraid and overwhelmed.

616
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,880
You all came here because you wanted answers

617
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,830
and you needed help.

618
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
Myself and everybody else here at CCPD

619
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,410
are here to help you.

620
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,370
So I swear to you,

621
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,640
with a little bit of patience from all of us,

622
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,970
we will get through this together.

623
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,950
Thank you.

624
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,400
Officers, let's start moving the line again.

625
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,090
We're gonna get to everybody.

626
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,030
Hold onto your butts.

627
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,320
They're connected.

628
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,590
I can see the completed atomizer.

629
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,000
But I can't see where she's taking it.

630
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,270
Remember Nora, that's not your anger.

631
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,330
It's hers.

632
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,090
Nora.

633
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,970
I see what you're doing.

634
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,690
Okay, something pissed her off.

635
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,750
Is your memory machine letting you back into my head?

636
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,670
No.

637
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,010
This is all me.

638
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,220
I can't let you release that virus, Grace.

639
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,600
Thousands will die.

640
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,970
Thousands today. Even more tomorrow.

641
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,730
The world I wake up in

642
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,950
is overrun with people with impossible powers.

643
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,390
Destroying innocent lives.

644
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,090
Ripping families apart. Just like mine was.

645
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,330
And all of this is because of you!

646
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,060
Is that bad?

647
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,160
Well, it's not good. I'm pulling her out.

648
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,020
No, no. No, she'll get control.

649
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,880
Your Flash family created meta-humans.

650
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,590
The Particle Accelerator. The bus metas.

651
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,320
The Enlightenment satellite which you shattered!

652
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,300
This isn't my anger.

653
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,140
It's yours.

654
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,730
You may look different, Grace.

655
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,890
But you're still the angry little girl I met

656
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,610
the first time I came here.

657
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm sorry you have to carry that anger.

658
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,860
But you're gonna have to carry it alone

659
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,580
because I make my own decisions,

660
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,410
and I've decided not to be like you.

662
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,260
Nora!

663
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,370
She's-- she's at CCPD.

664
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,160
Get everybody out of here right now!

665
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,350
- Cecil, go. Go! - Move, move, move!

666
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,850
And now their end begins.

667
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,030
Cicada's at CCPD but she could use the atomizer

668
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,440
to spread the virus from anywhere.

669
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,660
There are hundreds of metas there.

670
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,060
She's going to try and take all of their lives.

671
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,510
Not their lives, their dark matter.

672
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,290
She's going to use all those metas like a battery.

673
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,500
What are we gonna do?

674
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,860
Reach in, lose our powers, destroy the dagger,

675
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,370
stop Cicada from Supergirl-ing away,

676
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,810
then regroup for the emotional fallout.

677
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,660
Fallout. Cisco, where did you send Fallout's energy

678
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,750
when he was going nuclear?

679
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,820
Earth-15. It's a dead Earth.

680
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,280
Let's breach the atomizer there.

681
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,130
- I'm coming with you! - Nora, look.

682
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,460
You've already helped. More than enough, all right?

683
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,770
Okay, just do me a favor.

684
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,480
Blast that dagger to hell.

685
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,660
Absolutely.

686
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,250
Get out of my precinct.

687
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,110
Hey, Cricket freak.

688
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,100
You and I have some unfinished business.

689
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,940
- Nice hit. - It won't keep her down long.

690
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,450
Why do we have our powers? Did we already win?

691
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,050
Not yet. The dagger's in the atomizer.

692
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Wait, wait, wait!

693
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,950
If we shoot the dagger while it's still in there,

694
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,290
it could detonate the virus.

695
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,070
Guys, she's waking up.

696
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,430
All right, figure out a way to stop it.

697
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,010
- I'll keep her off your back. - All right.

698
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,110
This will help.

699
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,370
Cisco, remove the dagger and then breach the atomizer away.

700
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,040
Yeah, there's a slight problem there.

701
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,110
Breaching this thing anywhere could set it off.

702
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,800
My powers are useless here.

703
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,790
Then use your other power. Your mind.

704
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,870
Bring up the atomizer blueprints.

705
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm gonna have to science the crap out of you.

706
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,590
Good morning, sunshine.

707
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,810
A little different without your power-dampening dagger, huh?

708
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,330
Oh, I don't need a dagger to kill you.

709
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,410
I never had it before I came to this time.

710
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,730
You wanna kill me? Come get me.

711
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,960
What she said.

712
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,250
Once you remove the plate,

713
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,630
you should be able to see the control processor plane.

714
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,070
I see it. It's not gonna work.

715
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,340
I need a quantum computer to hack this thing.

716
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,770
Wait! I have one.

717
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,600
Yeah.

718
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,980
Your gauntlet!

719
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,690
Damn, I love the future.

720
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,020
Okay, if I can connect to the three nodes inside,

721
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,510
I'll override the system.

722
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,180
If I touch anything else,

723
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,760
hasta la vista, baby.

724
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,250
Okay.

725
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,430
There. I got it.

726
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,290
Yeah, great. Um, how long for the other two?

727
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,540
However long we have left.

728
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,750
Two down.

729
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,500
Well, you're not great at the Operation game, are you?

730
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,020
You suck at constructive criticism!

731
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,260
Cisco, get out of there.

732
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,690
Almost there.

733
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,320
It's in.

734
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Oh, shrap.

735
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,890
Cisco, what's going on?

736
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,280
It's too late.

737
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,660
Gotcha.

738
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,800
- The Atomizer's off. - Flash!

739
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,220
The dagger.

741
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,900
Anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

742
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,190
it's gonna be the mirror gun.

743
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,710
Something doesn't add up.

744
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,630
Plans got plans.

745
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,270
She didn't have the dagger in the future.

746
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,430
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

747
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,030
Don't shoot it.
