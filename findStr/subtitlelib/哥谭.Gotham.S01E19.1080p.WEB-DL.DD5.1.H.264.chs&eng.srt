我召集韦恩集团董事会开过会

跟他们说我在调查他们
to tell them I was investigating them,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,970
于是他们就找了个我们会信任的人监视我们

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,430
阿尔弗雷德被人捅了

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,940
是他的老战友

他想找什么
What was he looking for?

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,540
我的几份文件不见了
Some of my files were missing.

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,480
我可以查出谁雇的他
I could find out who hired him.

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,170
他是一切的关键
He's the key to everything.

我有个计划

要是我失败了呢
And if I fail?

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,170
失败者一样有用
Oh, those who fail me still have their uses.

21
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,400
他们要干什么
What are they doing?

22
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,310
对不起了  亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.

23
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,520
你在单子上
You're on the list.

24
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,980
哥谭市警局半数警察都有个科波特
Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

25
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,410
洛布有他们所有人的把柄
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

26
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,960
这就是洛布的专长
That is what Loeb does.

27
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,040
那到此为止了
Well, it ends now.

28
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,360
你要怎么样
What do you want?

29

警察工会主席大选在即
With the coming election for president of the policemen's union,

30
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,220
我首推戈登警探
there's no man I'd rather support.

31
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,350
哥谭市警局迎来了新的一天

道格拉斯先生  我知道你不满意你房间的风景

你在外面
You're outside.

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,770
你没看错

怎么称呼你
And you are?

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,250
你在里面想怎么溜达都行
Inside you're free to roam,

50
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,160
那是杜马赫医生的特权
that's Dr. Dulmacher's prerogative,

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,710
但一旦你踏入外面
but once you step outside,

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,050
你就进入我的地盘了
you're in my world.

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,730
把那些有胆想逃的可怜虫
I'm the man who catches the poor souls

54
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,400
抓回来的人就是我
brave enough to try to escape.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,500
你就是追捕者吗
Ah, you're The Catcher.

56
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,200
久仰大名
I've heard a lot about you.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,420
人多吗
So, have there been many?

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,660
逃跑的可怜虫
Poor souls, I mean.

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,630
不多
No.

60
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,180
有水拦着逃不出去
The water does most of the work,

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,710
但时不时的
but every so often,

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,750
还是会有人犯傻
someone gets stupid

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,180
想试试
and gives it a go.

64
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,130
我不知道我不能出来
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to be outside.

65
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,560
怪我
My mistake.

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,990
你敢再犯
Make that mistake again,

67
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,130
就没有下次了
and it'll be your last.

68
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,090
我前几天看到报上报道了
I saw the papers the other day.

69
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,790
恭喜
Congratulations.

70
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,690
谢谢
Thanks.

71
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,580
警察工会主席到底是干什么的
So what does president of the policeman's union do, exactly?

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,330
依主席而定
Depends on the president.

73
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,950
明白了
I see.

74
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,960
阿尔弗雷德怎么样
How's Alfred?

75
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,070
比我想的爱发牢骚
W-Whinier than I thought.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,530
不  他好多了
No, he-he's getting better.

77
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,750
那就好
Glad to hear it.

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,130
你们俩对捅他的人说谎了  是吧
You two lied about who stabbed him, didn't you?

79
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,420
你是为了这个来的
That's why you're here?

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,300
是吗
Is it?

81
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,670
是的
Yes.

82
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,170
你说谎了吗
Did you?

83
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,780
你骗我了吗
Lie to me?

84
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,500
没有
No.

85
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,360
我们要是没有犯人的描述
If we don't have a description of the culprit,

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,830
就找不到他
we won't find him.

87
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,650
我也希望能帮上你  警探
I wish I could help you, Detective.

88
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,900
阿尔弗雷德想自己对付他
Alfred wants to go after him on his own.

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,510
这就是你们骗我的原因
That's why you lied to me.

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,970
不是
No.

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,510
布鲁斯  看着我
Bruce, look at me.

92
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,590
不管阿尔弗雷德在盘算什么
Whatever Alfred is up to,

93
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,210
你都不要插手
you have to stay out of it.

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,560
这很危险
It's dangerous,

95
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,600
而且与你无关
and it's not your fight.

96
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,910
我把面包切太厚了  对吧
I cut this bread way too thick, didn't I?

97
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,770
布鲁斯
Bruce...

98
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,200
你说的我都懂
I understand what you're saying.

99
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,310
那就好
Okay, then.

100
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,730

警官  我有什么能帮你的
Officer, what can I help you with?

103
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,780
你声名远扬
You're a man with a reputation.

104
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,300
-是吗  -哥谭能真正破案的警探

105
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,410
尽力而为
I try.

106
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,860
我就是为这个来的
Uh, that's actually why I'm here.

107
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,960
是吗
Oh, yeah?

108
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,760
是这样  几周前
See, a few weeks ago,

109
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,310
我接警了一起凶杀案
I was a first responder to a homicide.

110

死者名叫格蕾丝・费尔柴尔德

111
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,360
尸体在河边被发现  刺伤致死
They found her body down by the river, stabbed to death,

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
接手案子的警探
and the detectives who caught the case,

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,090
查不出结果  处理成了悬案
they got nowhere with it and moved on.

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,870
真遗憾  但这不可避免
I'm sorry to hear that, but it happens.

115
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,180
我希望你能继续侦办此案
I was wondering if you could pick up where they left off.

116
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,140
你想要我接手
You want me to take over the case?

117
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,870
是的
Yeah.

118
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,090
伦恩  我手上案子也一堆
Look, Len, I got a full boat here.

119
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,590
死者的家属
This victim's family,

120
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,640
该有人为他们伸张正义
they deserve justice.

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,380
-我理解  -她的凶手
- Well, yeah. - Her killer deserves

122
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,870
该为自己的所作所为付出代价
to pay for what he did.

123
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,820
这案子很残忍
This was a nasty one.

124
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,280
案子都很残忍
They're all nasty.

125
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,390
你有什么目的
What's your angle on this?

126
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,460
没有
No angle.

127
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,770
只是
It's just...

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,420
我们几个年轻的警员
Well, there's a few of us younger guys,

129
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,210
一直在关注你的事迹
and we've been watching what you've been doing

130
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,550
清理哥谭和哥谭市警局的乌烟瘴气
to clean up Gotham and the GCPD.

131
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,310
我也希望能和你并肩作战
And I want to be a part of it,

132
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,220
请你接手这个案子
and bringing you this case

133
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,520
就是我的方式
is my way of trying to do that.

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,780
我会看看的
I'll look into it.

135
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,390
法医鉴证室

136
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,570
准备好了吗
Ready to go?

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,770
准备好
Ready?

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,330
我一整天都在垂涎卢奇欧的意面
I have been dreaming about the carbonara at Luccio's all day.

139
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,540
新案子吗
New case?

140
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,140
算是吧
Uh, sort of.

141
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,440
一件凶杀悬案
It's an unsolved homicide

142
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,920
一个警员让我帮忙查查
a uni asked me to look into.

143
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,940
挺奇特的案子
It's an odd one.

144
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,550
是吗  怎么讲
Ooh, how so?

145
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,170
你不是早饿了吗
I thought you were hungry?

146
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,330
没办法
What can I say?

147
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,970
你说到凶杀案  我就不能自已了
You had me at homicide.

148
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,930
死者格蕾丝・费尔柴尔德两周前被发现
The victim, Grace Fairchild, was found two weeks ago.

149
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,510
四个月前就被报了失踪
She was reported missing four months earlier.

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,990
最后来自她的消息
Last anyone heard,

151
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,500
是她给母亲打的一通电话
she, uh, called her mother.

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,070
她说要在南格林威治的酒吧喝杯酒
Said she was having a drink at a bar in the South Village.

153
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,620
我就住那里啊
That's my neighborhood.

154
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,480
哪家酒吧
What bar?

155
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,260
警探排查了那一带
Detectives canvassed the area.

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,390
没人见过她
Nobody knows.

157
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
没线索  没消息
No leads, no tips.

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,910
也怪不得处理成悬案了
I'm staring to see why the case was dropped.

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,030
天哪  我们差不多大
God, we were almost the same age.

160
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
说不定能成为朋友的
We could've been friends.

161
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,820
南格林威治有几家地下酒吧
You know, they have a few speakeasies in the South Village.

162
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,140
这是新潮流
It's a new thing.

163
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,150
要从干洗店或者鞋店穿过去才能找到
You walk in through a dry cleaners or a shoe store to get inside.

164
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,860
不知道的话根本找不到
Easy to miss if you're not in the know.

165
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,280
谢谢  我会去查
Thanks, I'll check it out.

166
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,750
好
Good.

167
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,900
真高兴你打算调查此案
I'm glad you're looking into this.

168
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,660
不管凶手是谁
Whoever did this,

169
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,000
他就是个禽兽
he's a monster.

170
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,850
凯利
Kelly.

171
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,640
天哪
God.

172
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,520
情况不妙啊
Still bad.

173
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,690
你要干什么
What do you want?

174
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,560
我有个计划  但需要你的帮助
I have a plan, but I need your help.

175
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,910
什么计划
What plan?

176
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,760
我们要逃跑
We're going to escape.

177
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,180
我一定要离开这魔鬼岛
I'm getting off of this hell of an island,

178
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,170
不成功便成仁
or I'm gonna die trying.

179
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,340
哥谭
第一季  第十九集

180
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,990
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred?

181
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,350
你要去哪
Where are you going?

182
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,420
进城  布鲁斯少爷
Into the city, Master Bruce.

183
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,410
我了解雷吉
If I know Reggie,

184
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,370
他现在可能已经醉得半死了
he's probably drunk himself half to death by now

185
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,650
很快就会搞上劲儿更大的东西
and is moving swiftly on to the harder stuff.

186
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,150
他可能
I'll probably find him

187
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,260
蜷在哪个毒窝
holed up in a shooting gallery,

188
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,750
嗑得昏天暗地
totally off his maracas.

189
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,850
阿尔弗雷德  你不能去
Alfred, you can't go.

190
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
你身体还没好
You're not well.

191
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,020
没办法  布鲁斯少爷
No choice, Master Bruce.

192
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,440
他就会在这儿待几天
He'll only be here for a few days.

193
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,160
搞到毒品  就会走了
Enough time to get his fix, then he'll be off.

194
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,270
那咱们赶紧去吧
Well, then we better get going.

195
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,820
不要想着我会带上你  少爷
If you think I'm gonna take you, Master...

196
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,470
我的天
Oh, dear.

197
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,790
日安  莉迪娅
Good day, Lidia.

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,860
你有没有考虑我的建议
Have you thought about my offer?

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,030
跟你说过了  我这儿不卖
I told you already, my place is not for sale.

200
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,580
拜托  我求你了  再想想
Please, I beg of you, think again.

201
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,000
我只做个匿名合伙人
I will serve strictly as a silent partner.

202
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,320
由你继续打理日常经营
You will continue to run the day-to-day operations.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,870
你是疯子吧  我说过了
Che pazzo, I told you already!

204
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,430
女士  拜托  我没有恶意
Madam, please, I-I meant no harm.

205
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,660
行了  女士
Okay, Mama.

206
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,910
明白了
You made your point.

207
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,800
女士  我向你保证
Madam, I assure you,

208
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,120
我对你这里真心感兴趣
I have a sincere interest in your establishment.

209
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,500
如果你不想要钱
If money is not what you seek,

210
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,770
你肯定也有什么想要的
surely there is something you want.

211
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,940
我孙女  安东尼娅
My granddaughter, Antonia,

212
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,780
她美貌非凡
she's beautiful,

213
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,070
品德高尚
virtuous,

214
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,710
天使一个
an angel.

215
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,910
她被一个巧舌如簧的吉他手
And she has been seduced

216
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,030
勾引了
by a silver-tongued guitar player.

217
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,640
那人就是魔鬼化身
Lucifer himself.

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,740
好悲惨啊
A tragedy.

219
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,520
你让她回家
You make her come home,

220
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,410
离开那个皮条客
leave this...pappone...

221
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,360
我就考虑你的提议
...then I'll consider your offer.

222
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,310
女士
Madam,

223
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,580
主日弥撒前她就能回来了
she will be home for Sunday Mass.

224
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,170
我跟你保证
You have my word.

225
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,580
这地方烂死了
This place is a dump.

226
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,360
根本不值钱
Real nickel-and-dime.

227
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,260
这里很有价值  盖布
It's worth far more than that, Gabe.

228
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,130
你只是还不懂
You just don't see it yet.

229
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,510
不行
No.

230
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,020
我又不是说正式接手这个案子
I'm not saying we officially take over the investigation,

231
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,340
就帮我查查
just help me look into it.

232
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
不行
No.

233
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,370
哈维
Harvey.

234
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,010
该为死者讨个公道
The victim deserves justice.

235
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,100
那还该为我讨个
Yeah, and I deserve

236
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,520
喜欢苍白的爱尔兰人和烹饪的哑巴超模呢
a mute supermodel who likes pasty Irish guys and loves to cook.

237
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,840
不行
It's not happening.

238
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
更何况  你我心里都清楚
Besides, we both know

239
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,850
公道才不是你想插手的真正原因呢
that justice isn't the real reason you want this one.

240
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,000
警探们
Hello, Detectives.

241
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,440
爱德  问你个问题
Ed, question:

242
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,950
你愿意多做些工作还是少做些工作
would you rather work more or less?

243
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,470
这是谜语吗
Is this a riddle?

244
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,430
你看吧
Exactly.

245
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
你帮定了  什么事
You're helping. What's up?

246
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,670
这是南格林威治有酒水经营许可证的
Uh, list of all establishments in the South Village

247
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,800
所有酒吧清单
with a current liquor license.

248
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
包括地下酒吧吗
Including speakeasies?

249
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,910
是的
Yes, siree--

250
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,920
其中有四家
four of which, you'll be pleased to know,

251
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,520
被之前的警探遗漏了
were missed by the original detectives.

252
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,400
非常好  爱德  谢谢
Ah, that's great, Ed. Thanks.

253
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,380
还有一件事
One more thing.

254
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,880
我之前看了一遍费尔柴尔德凶杀案的
I was going through the crime scene evidence

255
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,210
犯罪现场证据
from the Fairchild murder

256
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,450
有一件证物不见了
and, uh, there's a piece of evidence missing.

257
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,050
知道是什么吗
Any idea what it is?

258
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,750
不知道  但标签是"3A"
No, but it's labeled "3A."

259
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,700
你觉得你能找到吗
Think you can find it?

260
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,400
警探  我会解开这个谜题的
Detective, I will solve this puzzle.

261
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,180
你要来吗
You coming?

262
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,130
让我用西班牙语回答你
Let me say it in Spanish:

263
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,070
不要
No.

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,460
好吧  听着  你说得对
Okay, look, you're right.

265
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,650
我的确有野心
I'm ambitious.

266
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,150
我想让这里的人看到
I want to show people around here

267
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,690
情况会有所改变
that things are gonna change.

268
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,580
但是  哈维  没有你的帮助我做不到这一点
But, Harvey, I can't do that without your help.

269
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,890
我知道你现在洋洋自得
Look, I know you're riding high,

270
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,990
因为搞定了洛布什么的
what with getting over on Loeb and all.

271
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,450
但是有件事你得永远记住
But there's one thing you should always remember.

272
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,200
飞得离太阳太近
Fly too close to the sun,

273
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,110
你终会被灼伤
you're gonna get burned.

274
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,270
你说完了吗
You done?

275
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,680
-说完了  -很好
- Yeah. - Good.

276
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,800
那就起身跟我走
Then get your ass up.

277
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,980
就是这样
So that's it.

278
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,800
你是在告诉我
So you're trying to tell me

279
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,970
你真觉得我们可以逃出这里
you actually think we can get out of here.

280
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,040
我不就是这么说的吗
That's what I said, didn't I?

281
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,620
怎么逃
How?

282
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,300
用点花招和小伎俩
With cunning and guile.

283
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,190
但是没有你们帮助就成不了
But it won't work without your help.

284
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,190
为什么是我们
Well, why us?

285
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,300
为什么不叫你的朋友们
Why not your friends?

286
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,960
逃出去的过程中会发生什么事难以预料
There's no telling how this is all going to go down during the breakout.

287
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,010
万一事态不妙
Just in case it goes south,

288
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,780
我需要一些冷血无情的杀手在我身边
I need some stone cold killers by my side,

289
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,190
而不是一些可怜巴巴的受害者
not some whipped-ass victims.

290
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
有道理
That's fair.

291
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,720
计划是什么
What's the plan?

292
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,290
外面的岸边上有艘船
Outside, there's a boat down by the shore,

293
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,100
足以载我们六个逃离这个岛
big enough to carry the six of us off of this island.

294
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,410
一艘船
A boat?

295
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,650
你还有更好的主意吗
You have a better idea?

296
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,450
我前两天听见了直升机降落的声音
I heard a chopper land the other day.

297
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,250
轰隆隆的响炸天
Thumped like a son of a bitch.

298
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,810
我们为什么不飞出去
Why don't we fly out of here?

299
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,490
你们中有人会开直升机吗
Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?

300
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,940
这就是原因了
That's why.

301
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,390
好吧
All right.

302
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,510
这艘船...
This boat...

303
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,630
你有钥匙吗
you got the keys to it?

304
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,090
没有
No.

305
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,900
还没拿到  但我会搞定的
Not yet, but I will.

306
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,080
所以你们加入  还是不加入
So are you in, or out?

307
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,960
三家无果  我走得脚都疼了
We're oh-for-three. My dogs are barking.

308
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,210
我通常不会抱怨去酒吧这种事
I'm hardly one to complain about going to a bar,

309
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,840
但这实在是太荒唐了
but this is getting ridiculous.

310
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,460
这的确枯燥  和其他案子一样
It's grunt work, just like any other case.

311
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,420
但这和其他案子并不一样
Except it's not just like any other case;

312
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,750
这是你的"业余爱好"

你记得她

是的  她提过自己上的是我学校的对手院校
Yeah, she mentioned she went to a rival college of mine.

说实话  她的约会对象可性感了

只记得他很帅了
Just that he was good-looking.

而且衣冠楚楚
But classy, you know?

327
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,030
好吧
Okay.

328
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,980

又比较帅的男人还是单身呢

331
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,780
-比较  -也许不止"比较"  说嘛
- "Mildly"? - Maybe a little bit more than that. Come on.

332
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,060
你肯定有些问题
Something has to be wrong with you.

333
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,200
或许你说的对
Maybe you're right.

334
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,470
我曾经...
I've, uh...

335

我曾经有过很多段恋情
I've had plenty of relationships,

336

但最终  她们都...
but in the end, they...

337
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,670
不怎么合适
never seem to work out.

338
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
为什么呢
Why not?

339
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,690
我觉得是我追求的东西令人害怕
I think what I'm looking for frightens people.

340
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,760
好吧
Okay.

341
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,590
不  不是...
No, it's...

342
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,180
不是什么奇怪的事
It's nothing weird.

343
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,300
到底是什么
What, then?

344
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,020
听起来挺俗气的
It's gonna sound cheesy.

345
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,620
我不会笑的
I won't laugh.

346
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,810
我保证
I promise.

347
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,990
我想要寻找的...
What I'm looking for...

348
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,700
是无条件的爱

349
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,780
无条件的
Unconditional,

350
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,360
真实的  激情的爱

351
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,880
很俗气  对吧
Cheesy, right?

352
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,390
相当的
Totally.

353
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,250
你喜欢吗
You like it?

354
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,850
还不错
It'll do.

355
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,210
厨房里有些酒
There's some wine in the kitchen.

356
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,950
你喜欢就开了吧
Open anything you like.

357
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,000
我来帮你拿外套
May I take your jacket?

358
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,710
这地方很有效吧
This place must work well.

359
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,860
什么意思
What do you mean?

360

对那些你带回来的女人
With the women that you bring back here.

其实我已经

有段时间
been a while

363
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,470
没带人来过了
since I've had anyone over.

364
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,110
我还真幸运
Lucky me.

365
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,520
我才幸运
I'm the lucky one.

366
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,170
谢谢你能给我机会
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

367
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,190
你逗我呢
Are you kidding me?

368
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,860
看看这地方
Look at this place.

369

371

如果他  回来了

给我打电话
give me a call.

374
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,670
没问题
Sure.

375
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,780
他来过这里  哈维
He was right here, Harvey.

376
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,650
是啊
Yeah.

377
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
你不会放手了吧
You're not dropping this one, are you?

378
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,650
不可能
Not a chance.

379
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,610
射击场

380
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,880

382
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,540

达成一致了吗

384
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,360
还没有
Not quite.

385
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,920
他说他还爱着那女孩
...says he still loves the girl.

386
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,620
不肯离开她
He won't leave her.

387
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,170
安东尼娅和我是天生一对
Antonia and I are destined to be together,

388
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,330
无论你做什么
and nothing you can do

389
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,720
都不会让我停止爱她
will make me stop loving her.

390
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,930
看到了吧
See what I mean?

391
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,060
真爱

392
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,510
要不要我给他一枪
You want me to put a slug in him,

393
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,710
看能不能让他松口
see if that loosens him up?

394
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,680
不用
No.

395
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,160
他是个吉他手
He's a guitar player.

396
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,930
断了手指
Lose the fingers.

397
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,990
你要我开枪打掉他的手指吗
You want me to shoot his fingers?

398
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,940
别用枪
Don't shoot them.

399
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,940
剪断
Lose them.

400
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,960
我正想见你呢
Just the man I wanted to see.

401
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,550
别这么说
Oh, don't say that.

402
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,410
吉姆好吃醋了
You're gonna make Jim jealous.

403
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
我刚完成费尔柴尔德的尸检
I finished the Fairchild autopsy

404
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,450
结果有些奇怪
and the results were a little strange.

405
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,480
怎么个奇怪法
Strange how?

406
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,620
格蕾丝・费尔柴尔德失踪了四个多月
Grace Fairchild was missing for over four months.

407
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,040
一般来说  这种绑架案
Usually, with these kind of abductions,

408
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,440
尸体上应该有多处外伤及虐待痕迹
there's a lot of trauma and abuse to the body,

409
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,500
但是她身上却没有
but not this time.

410
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,800
除了心脏和喉咙的几处刺伤外
Other than the stab wounds to her heart and her throat,

411
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,880
她身上几乎毫发无伤
her body was mostly pristine.

412
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,640
这说不通
That doesn't add up.

413
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,500
除非
Unless...

414
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,120
除非什么
Unless what?

415
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,310
你有没有想过她是自己跑掉的呢
You ever consider she ran off on her own?

416
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,090
就是说她的失踪和她的被杀毫无关联
That her going missing has nothing to do with her murder?

417
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,110
尸检结果与这相符
The findings would certainly support that.

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,890
也许吧
Maybe.

419
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,430
不
No.

420
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,260
不对  费尔柴尔德有一份很好的工作
No, Fairchild had a good job,

421
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,310
有房贷
a mortgage...

422
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,020
她失踪的那晚还给她母亲打了电话
Hell, she called her mother the night she went missing.

423
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,900
不  她没出走
No, she didn't run away.

424
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,200
她是被人抓走的
She was taken.

425
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,090
绑架她的人
And whoever took her

426
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,650
把她关了起来
kept her locked away

427
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,710
直到他完全准备好了
till he was good and ready...

428
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,110
才把她给杀了
and then he killed her.

429
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,050
我确定
I know it.

430
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,020
早上好
Morning.

431
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,410
睡得好吗
How'd you sleep?

432
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
睡得很香
Like a baby.

433
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,040
我想  吃完早餐
So I thought, after breakfast,

434
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,250
我们可以去看看派立克展览会
we could go to the, uh, Palick exhibit.

435
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,490
再过一星期就结束了
It's only in town another week.

436
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,500
我很想去  真的
I would love to, really,

437
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,940
但是我已经迟到了
but I am already late,

438
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,340
我要开早会  还有工作午餐
and I've got a morning meeting and a work lunch.

439
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,700
-重新安排嘛  -不行
- So reschedule it. - I can't.

440
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,090
昨晚和你一起真的很开心
I had a really good time with you last night.

441
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,460
希望还能再见到你
And I hope that I get to see you again.

442
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,740
那至少
At least, uh...

443
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,880
吃点早餐吧
have some breakfast.

444
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,320
我还得回家换身衣服  真的来不及了
Oh, I still have to go home and change and I am so late.

445
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,940
下次吧
Next time.

446
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,360
今晚给我打电话
Call me tonight.

447
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,600
如果你想的话  下班后
I can come over after work,

448
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,700
我可以过来
if you want.

449
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,160
杰森
Oh, Jason...

450
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,240
我真的要走了
please, I really have to go.

451
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,770
不
No.

452
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,440
你不能走
You don't.

453
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,830
穆尼女士
Miss Mooney.

454
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,280
真是意外啊
What a surprise.

455
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,840
有什么我能帮到你的吗
Is there something I can do for you?

456
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,090
这个嘛
Well...

457
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,360
给犯人们的物资
supplies were running low...

458
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,910
就快用完了
for the inmates.

459
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,070
物资在储藏室里
Those are in the storage room.

460
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,750
但是  当然了  你已经知道了
But then, of course, you already knew that.

461
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,400
我最不能容忍的
The one thing I won't tolerate...

462
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,450
就是说谎
is dishonesty.

463
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,020
你想逃走  是吧
You were trying to escape, weren't you?

464
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,960
不是
No.

465
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,170
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

466
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,310
我会一枪打在你肚子上
I'm going to shoot you in the stomach.

467
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,270
起初你会感到压力感
You'll feel pressure at first.

468
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,790
跟着你就会有种前所未有的
Then you'll feel an intense burning

469
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,560
强烈烧灼感
like you've never felt in your life.

470
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,280
也许那会让你肯说实话
Maybe that will properly motivate you to be honest with me.

471
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,370
我再问你一次
I ask you again.

472
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,010
你是不是想逃走
Were you trying to escape?

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,510
不是
No.

474
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,600
真让人失望
How disappointing.

475
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,660
等等  不要
Wait, s-stop.

476
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,230
等等
Wait, wait.

477
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,950
我说谎了  但...
I was lying, but I...

478
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,920
但我不是想要逃跑
but I wasn't trying to escape.

479
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,280
你想杀了我吗
You were going to kill me?

480
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,560
割断我的喉咙
Slit my throat, perhaps?

481
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,350
我发誓  不是的
No, I swear.

482
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,440
不是要杀你
Not yours...

483
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,610
不是你
Not yours.

484
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,050
每晚入睡的时候  我都要向上帝祷告
Every night when I close my eyes, I pray to God

485
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,570
祈求噩梦不要降临
that nightmare doesn't come.

486
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,320
那个活生生的男人被拼接了
That... living, breathing man, stitched together with...

487
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,870
不同人的胳膊和腿
arms and legs that weren't his.

488
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,080
那是你创造的噩梦
That nightmare you created.

489
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,380
我见识过危险之人
I've faced dangerous men,

490
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,500
但没有一个如你一般可怕
but none like you,

491
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,120
人偶师
Dollmaker.

492
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,030
所以你宁愿自杀
So you'd rather take your own life

493
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,930
也不愿变成我的作品
than end up one of my creations?

494
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,880
是的
Yes.

495
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,390
穆尼女士
Well, Miss Mooney,

496
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,390
类似的事再发生
try anything like this again,

497
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,290
你的噩梦就会成真了
and your nightmare will come true.

498
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,410
如果有必要  即使你死了我也能让你活过来
I will bring you back from the dead, if I have to...

499
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,700
并把你打造成史无前例的作品
...and make you into something the world has never seen.

500
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,870
还有别的事吗
Was there something else?

501
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,370
没有了
No.

502
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,890
我可能会拿砖头砸烂你的脑袋呢
Could've smashed your head with a brick, you know?

503
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,480
你为什么要那么做
Why would you do that?

504
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,060
你为什么要说这种话
Why'd you even say that?

505
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,420
给你提个醒罢了  怎么了
Just thought you should know. What's up?

506
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,770
为什么要找我
Why're you looking for me?

507
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,010
刺伤阿尔弗雷德的那个人  雷吉・佩恩
Reggie Payne, the man who stabbed Alfred,

508
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,120
他还在哥谭
he's in Gotham.

509
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,900
你想让我帮你找他  好啊
And you need my help to find him. Okay.

510
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,630
阿尔弗雷德说他这几天肯定在射击场
Alfred said he'd be at a gun range for a few days,

511
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,210
但我已经查遍了城里的每个射击场
but I checked every one in the city.

512
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,120
毫无线索
Nothing.

513
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,440
谁会在射击场逗留啊
Who stays at a gun range for a few days?

514
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,240
说不通
Doesn't make any sense.

515
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,470
他就是这么说的
That's what he said.

516
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,870
他说雷吉会在"射击场[毒窝]"
Said Reggie'd be at a shooting gallery.

517
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,750
那不是射击场的意思  呆子
That's not the same as a gun range, silly.

518
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,450
你真该多出来走动走动了
You really need to get out more.

519
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,810
好了  好了
All right, all right, all right.

520
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,080
好好洗洗吧
Go get yourself cleaned up.

521
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,220
我马上过去
Back in a minute.

522
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,260
我们可以谈条件了吗
So shall we discuss terms?

523
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,130
是什么
So what is it?

524
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,010
首先要申明
Well, to be clear,

525
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,890
这并不是犯罪现场的证据
this isn't an actual piece of crime scene evidence.

526
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,720
据我看  证据早就没有了
It's long gone, as far as I can tell.

527
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,690
我找到的是一本登记薄里的复印件
What I was able to find is a photocopy,

528
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,240
藏得很深
buried deep in a logbook.

529
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,240
一颗破碎的心
It's a broken heart.

530
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,880
我觉得是手绘的
Hand-painted, I'd guess.

531
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,970
这是犯罪现场找到的吗
This was at the crime scene?

532
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,580
确定吗
You're sure?

533
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,010
不是这个啦
Well, not this, exactly.

534
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,790
复印件其实是副本...
You see, a photocopy is a replica...

535
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,860
行了  爱德  别闹了
Damn it, no, Ed, not now.

536
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,120
-怎么了  -我警告过你的
- What's wrong? - I warned you.

537
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,420
但你不听我的  现在我们都有麻烦了
But no, you had to go and get both of us burned.

538
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,730
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

539
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,060
你追查的这个男人
This guy you're after,

540
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,930
这不是他的处女作了
this is not his first rodeo.

541
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,010
他是个连环杀手
He's a serial killer.

542
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,920
看起来很美味
This looks delicious.

543
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,730
谢谢
Thank you.

544
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,780
我觉得我可能
I, uh... I think I may have

545
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,700
把羊排烤老了一点
overcooked the lamb... a little bit,

546
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
但...
but I-I, uh...

547
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,300
肯定没问题的
I'm sure it's fine.

548
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,540
你今天过得如何
How was your day?

549
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,560
挺好的  亲爱的
Wonderful, darling.

550
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,490
你呢
And how was yours?

551
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,020
挺好
Good.

552
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,870
谢谢关心
Thank you for asking.

553
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,200
我觉得你说对了
I think you might have been right...

554
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,210
是有点老了
about the lamb.

555
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,900
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

556
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,860
没事的
It's fine.

557
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,860
在烤箱里时我还检查过两次呢
I checked it twice when it was in the oven,

558
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,410
我觉得温度可能是比显示的要高
and I think it might be hotter than it says it is...

559
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,510
知道吗
You know...

560
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,210
我觉得我们不合适
...I don't think this is working out.

561
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,600
不是因为你
It's not you.

562
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,650
是我的缘故
It's me.

563
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,860
我们本可以成为特别的一对儿
Could have had something special.

564
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,480
求你  别伤害我
Please. Please don't hurt me.

565
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,910
我还真以为  你是我的完美情人
You know, I really thought you were the one.

566
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,610
求你
Please.

567
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,940
不要啊
No, no.

568
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,110
别担心
Don't worry.

569
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,460
我迟早能找到她
Sooner or later, I'll find her.

570
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,030
我还是不懂
I still don't get it.

571
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,320
为什么费那么大事拿下这里
Why all that trouble for this pile of bricks?

572
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,570
这不是为了钱  盖布
This was never about money, Gabe.

573
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,930
不是为了钱
Not about money?

574
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,410
还能是为什么
What else is there?

575
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,410
人的动力有很多种
All kinds of things motivate people--

576
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,500
淫欲  野心  嫉妒
lust, ambition, envy.

577
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,380
好吧  你的动力是什么
Okay, what motivated you?

578
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,300
你为什么这么想要这里
Why do you want this place so bad?

579
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,230
很简单
It's simple.

580
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,450
我要在这里杀了马罗尼阁下
This is where I'm gonna kill Don Maroni.

581
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,080
到时候了
It's time.

582
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,140
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

583
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,260
行动吧
Let's go.

584
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,980
门一打开  警报就会大作
Now, as soon as this door opens, an alarm will go off,

585
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,650
我们的时间可就不多了
and we will not have much time.

586
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,800
大门怎么办
What about the gate?

587
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,060
昨晚已经打开了
Unlocked last night.

588
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,550
拿上这个
Take these.

589
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,770
一到船上马上启动马达
Get the boat started as soon as you get there.

590
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,050
你不一起来吗
You're not coming with us?

591
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,460
我会来  我就回来  我得去接凯利
I'm coming, I'll be right back-- I need to get Kelly.

592
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,200
他路都走不动了  我们走吧
He can barely walk. Let's go.

593
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,890
算我重感情
Call me sentimental,

594
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,060
但我不能把他丢下
but I cannot leave him here.

595
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,690
你们最好别丢下我
And you better not leave me.

596
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,560
你骗了我  菲什
You lied to me, Fish.

597
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,050
我警告过你对我撒谎会有什么后果
I warned you what would happen if you lied to me.

598
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,020
我能用你的身体创造各种奇迹
Oh, what wonders I'm gonna make of your parts.

599
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,700
回见了  医生
See you around, Doc.

600
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,450
别管他了
Leave him there.

601
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,420
我们时间不多
We don't have much time.

602
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,090
走吧
Let's go.

603
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,100
这边
This way.

604
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,040
他们去劫船了
They're headed for the boat.

605
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,050
干什么呢  开大门啊
What are you doing, man? Open up the gate.

606
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,070
不行
I can't.

607
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,150
锁上了
It's locked.

608
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,980
什么
What?

609
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,510
菲什说她给解开了啊
Fish said she unlocked it.

610
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,170
-那婊子  -怎么了
- That bitch. - What?

611
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,180
菲什
Fish.

612
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,890
她给我们下了套
She set us up.

613
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,130
凯利  副驾
Kelly, other side!

614
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,280
你不是跟他们说你不会开飞机吗
You told them you couldn't fly, didn't you?

615
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,970
我撒谎了
I lied.

616
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
直升机
The chopper.

617
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,630
坐稳
Hold on!

618
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,120
菲什
Fish!

619
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,960
他绑架年轻漂亮的单身女人
He abducts young, single, attractive women

620
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,070
监禁她们  有时是一周
and he keeps them sometimes for a week,

621
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,900
有时几个月
sometimes for months.

622
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,010
然后他把她们的尸体丢在哥谭各个地方
Then he dumps their bodies around Gotham.

623
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,090
他杀了多少人
How many has he killed?

624
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,990
12个  或许更多
A dozen, maybe more.

625
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,220
每次他杀一个人
Every time he makes a kill,

626
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,200
都在犯罪现场留下个这个
he leaves one of these at the crime scene.

627
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,620
这是他的名片
It's his calling card.

628
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,400
那他是谁
So, who is he?

629
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,190
没人知道
No one knows.

630
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,780
理论是  他受过教育  相貌良好  有钱
Thinking is he's educated, decent-looking, rich.

631
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,950
但这只是个侧写
But that's just a profile.

632
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,400
有人称他为唐璜杀手
Some of the guys call him The Don Juan Killer.

633
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,590
更多人喊他食人魔
Most call him The Ogre.

634
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,300
那我怎么没听说过这人
So, why haven't I heard about this guy before?

635
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,880
公众也不知道
Why hasn't the public?

636
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,970
-这是哥谭市警局  -两位好
- It's the GCPD's... - Hey, fellas!

637
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,360
肮脏的小秘密
...dirty little secret.

638
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,010
只有少数高级警探知道这人的事
Only a handful of senior detectives know anything about this guy,

639
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,730
而且他们绝不会向媒体透露
and they sure as hell ain't leaking it to the press.

640
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,990
为什么
Why not?

641
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,120
因为食人魔会报复
Because The Ogre retaliates

642
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,440
调查他的警察
against any cop who investigates him.

643
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,950
他杀害他们所爱的人
He kills the people they love.

644
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,650
所以才没人抓住过这疯子  吉姆
That's why this lunatic hasn't been caught yet, Jim,

645
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,560
因为没人会蠢到去调查他
because no one's been stupid enough to investigate.

646
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,790
直到我出现
Until I came along.

647
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,160
所以我想问你  这案子你怎么发现的
Which makes me wonder how did you catch this?

648
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,650
我说了  一名警官拜托我调查的
I told you a fellow officer asked me to look into it.

649
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,350
谁啊
Who?

650
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,310
哪个警官
Which one?

651
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,380
小猫
Cat.

652
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,110
是他
That's him.

653
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,100
放松  老头子
Relax, old man.

654
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,890
我们不会打劫你
We're not gonna rob you.

655
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,240
你们来干什么
What are you doing here?

656
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,610
来跟你说话
Came to talk to you.

657
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,650
她是谁
Who's she?

658
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,770
别管
Never mind.

659
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,760
谁派你去我家的
Who sent you to my house?

660
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,310
谁派我
Who sent me?

661
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,520
回家吧  布鲁斯
Just go home... go on, Bruce.

662
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,980
否则你会惹上更多的麻烦
You'll be in more trouble than you are already.

663
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,980
那是我的药  给我
That's my medicine! Give me that!

664
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,590
我朋友问你问题呢
My friend just asked you a question.

665
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,760
我叫你给我
I said give me that.

666
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,880
否则呢
Or you'll what?

667
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,840
-别  -回答我
- Don't... - Answer the question!

668
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,820
我没想伤人
I didn't mean any harm.

669
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,740
我只是去拿文件的
I was just supposed to take some documents.

670
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,940
但阿尔弗雷德撞见我了
But Alfred walked in...

671
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,390
他没事吧
Is he all right?

672
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,320
他没事吧
Is he?

673
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,510
你捅伤了他
You stabbed him.

674
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,360
你在乎什么
What do you care?

675
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,700
我在乎
I care!

676
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,270
他还好吧
He's all right, isn't he?

677
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,320
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

678
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,380
丢出去
Throw them out!

679
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,950
-不要  -告诉我谁派你来的
- No! - Tell me who sent you!

680
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,940
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

681
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,760
你不该做这种事  布鲁斯
You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.

682
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,350
只有阿尔弗能对付得了这些人
Only Alfie can deal with these people.

683
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
什么人
What people?

684
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,980
有个女人  玛希斯
There's a woman named Mathis

685
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,680
还有个叫邦德斯洛的男人
and a guy called Bunderslaw.

686
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,300
希德・邦德斯洛  是他跟我打的交道
Sid Bunderslaw-- he's the guy I dealt with.

687
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,310
但你得让阿尔弗处理这事
But you've got, you've got to let Alfie take care of this.

688
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,230
你不行  布鲁斯
Not you, Bruce.

689
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,470
这不是孩子能处理的事
It's not business for a child.

690
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,200
这个邦德斯洛
This man Bunderslaw...

691
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,460
他想要什么
what did he want?

692
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,810
只想知道你知道什么
Just to know what you knew.

693
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,400
看你的调查进展到什么地步了
To see how far your investigation had gone.

694
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,630
但他害怕了
But he was scared.

695
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,110
所以才派我去
And that's why he sent me.

696
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,700
能把包还我了吗
Now, can I have my bag back, please?

697
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,500
拜托
Please?

698
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,350
还给他
Give it back to him.

699
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,060
你
You.

700
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,320
你有病  佩恩先生
You're a sick man, Mr. Payne.

701
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,860
你需要帮助
You need help.

702
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,200
少教训我
Don't you patronize me.

703
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,450
我虽然有毛病
I may have vices, yeah,

704
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,110
但我是职业杀手
but I'm a professional.

705
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,210
你希望我去告诉邦德斯洛你发现他了吗
You want me to tell Bunderslaw that you're onto him?

706
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,210
因为他会来找你的
Because he'll come after you.

707
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,140
你根本没法阻止他
And there's nothing that you can do to stop him!

708
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,660
你就是个傻乎乎的小孩
You're just silly little children.

709
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,920
我会告密的
I'm gonna tell on you.

710
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,970
不  你休想
No, you won't!

711
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,740
不是我的主意
It wa... it wa... it wasn't my idea!

712
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,890
我发誓
I swear!

713
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,730
我得到命令骗你接下案子
I-I was ordered to get you to take the case.

714
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,690
谁命令你
Ordered by who?!

715
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,660
洛布
Loeb!

716
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,240
是洛布局长
It was Commissioner Loeb.

717
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,920
他叫我告诉你
He told me to tell you that...

718
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,240
我敬仰你
I looked up to you.

719
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
你激励了我
That you inspired me.

720
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,610
他叫我说
I mean, he-he told me to say

721
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,990
我想帮忙清理哥谭
that I wanted to help clean up Gotham.

722
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,060
和哥谭市警局
And, uh, the GCPD.

723
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,710
这桩案子
And that this case...

724
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,300
就是我的一份努力
this case was part of that.

725
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,590
他知道你无法拒绝
He knew you couldn't say no.

726
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,730
你像个好士兵那样听从了命令
And so you followed orders like a good soldier.

727
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,800
我没有选择
I-I didn't have a choice.

728
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,350
你知道洛布有什么本事
You know what Loeb can do.

729
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,570
非常清楚
All too well.

730
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,580
吉姆  听我说  你还没惹上麻烦
Jim, listen! You're still in the clear on this.

731
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,280
"没惹上"  他可能会去害小莱
"In the clear"? He could come after Lee!

732
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,700
如果他认为你在调查他的话
Only if he thinks you're investigating him.

733
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,130
想想啊
Think about it.

734
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,790
这案子你还没接
It's not on your docket.

735
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,400
也没有报道把你和案子联系起来
There's been no press linking you up to this case.

736
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,110
你不过就是问了些问题
Hell, all you've done is ask some questions

737
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,830
你现在放手就行
so you got to drop it now!

738
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,400
现在不是逞英雄的时候
This is no time to be a hero.

739
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,010
如果放手  我就放了一个连环杀手
If I drop it, I'm letting a serial killer go free.

740
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,850
他下个杀的人的血就在我手上
The blood of his next victim is on my hands!

741
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,530
如果你不放手  那就可能会是小莱的血
If you don't drop it, that blood could be Lee's.

742
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,080
这里是小莱
Hi, you've reached Lee.

743
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,830
请留言
Go ahead and leave a message.

744
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,610
小莱  尽快给我回电话
Lee, call me as soon as you can.

745
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,380
这很重要
It's very import...

746
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,440
你
You!

747
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,530
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

748
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,370
你说什么
Excuse me!

749
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,500
你给我下套
You set me up!

750
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,870
警探  我不知道你以为...
Detective, I don't know what you think...

751
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,240
别说话  听着
Don't talk. Listen.

752
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,420
滚开
Back off!

753
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,290
你敢...
Don't you...

754
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,170
我也想跟你妥协
I tried to work with you.

755
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,680
但你这下越界了
But now you crossed a line.

756
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,440
你敢冲我爱的人下手
You come after the one I love.

757
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,350
今后  我们按我的规矩来
From here on, we're playing my way.

758
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,740
不再玩游戏
No more games.

759
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,250
不再做交易
No more deals.

760
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,390
我要找到食人魔  把他关进监狱
I'm gonna find The Ogre and I'm gonna put him behind bars.

761
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,290
等我抓到他  我就会冲你来
And when I've done that, I'm coming after you.

762
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,340
我要抓到你  局长
I'm coming after you, commissioner.

763
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,780
你完了
You're done.
