7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,670
上面那些人利用我们作为零部件

增添点刺激感嘛

我们要抢银行的钱
We're here for the bank's money!

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,540
大家保持冷静
So just stay cool

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,900
就不会受伤

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,520
这种银行  总能自保
You know, banks like this one-- who are insured to death,

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,330
每天都在偷我们的钱
by the way-- steal from us every single day!

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,150
我们也该回报他们一下了  不是吗
'Bout time a few of us returned the favor, don't you think?

看见了吗
Did you see that?

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,230
那人对我开了六枪都没打中
That guy missed me with, like, six shots.

54
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,480
他又老又紧张
He was, old, nervous.

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,380
不不  相信我  是因为头罩
No, no, no, it's the hood. I'm telling you.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,670
该死  我们完蛋了
Damn it. We're cooked.

57
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,710
哥谭的市民注意喽
Attention, citizens of Gotham!

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,050
你到底在做什么
What the hell are you doing?!

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,710
大家自取吧
There you go, everybody!

60
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,840
拿回属于你们的
Take back what's yours!

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,370
跟我来  快
Follow me! Come on.

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,500
哥谭
第一季  第十七集

63
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,260
我们是查不出丢了多少钱了
Well, we'll never know how much cash was lost,

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,420
不过我刚看见一个流浪汉在玛德琳餐厅吃生蚝
but I just saw a bum eating oysters at Madeline's.

65
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,650
又是个戴面罩的变态  棒极了
Another freak in a mask. Awesome.

66
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,810
警卫是瞎了还是喝醉了
Is that guard blind or wasted?

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,810
克莱德拒绝戴眼镜
Clyde refused to wear his glasses.

68
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,430
说戴了会显老
Said they made him look old.

69
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,380
对站在身前六米处的人开六枪都没射中
Missing a man standing 20 feet in front of you with six shots

70
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,550
这才显老好吗
makes you look old.

71
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,390
-谁按的警报  -我
- Who tripped the alarm? - I did.

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,220
我们被抢的时候你在哪呢  警探
Why aren't you out there, Detective?

73
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,930
这种嚣张的气焰不可容忍
This brazen audacity cannot be tolerated.

74
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,160
他们没去金库
They didn't go for the vault...

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,000
只劫走了银台的钱
just the cash in the registers.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,090
出进不到两分钟
And the crew was in and out in under two minutes.

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,780
那个戴红头罩的人还挺好的
The red-hooded man seemed nice.

78
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,640
挺好的
Nice?

79
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,500
他没有抢劫我们的钱  只抢了银行的
He wasn't stealing our money... just the bank's.

80
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,430
之后他又撒了很多钱给街上的人  就像
Then he gave a lot of it back to people in the street. Like...

81
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,990
罗宾汉
...Robin Hood.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
呵呵  这银行还有共产主义者
Oh, great. This bank hires Communists.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,490
罗宾汉是劫富济贫
Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor.

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,950
而这些持枪匪徒漫天撒钱
These armed thieves only threw cash away

85
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,500
只是为了脱身
to guarantee their escape.

86
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,180
这是截然不同的  女士
It's very different, ma'am.

87
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,990
后面的这个劫匪
The thief in the back here,

88
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,850
-他一直在看表吗  -是的
- was he always checking his watch? - Yes.

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,240
他在倒计时
He was counting down.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,910
他们知道我们的响应时间
They knew what our response time was.

91
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,160
做足了功课
They'd done their homework.

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,630
警报最近有没有因为其他原因触响过
Has the alarm been triggered for any other reason recently?

93
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,510
没有
No.

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,740
别忘了之前烟雾弹那次
Well, there was that time with the smoke bomb.

95
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,820
烟雾弹
Smoke bomb?

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,090
一周前左右  一颗照明弹或是爆竹之类的
A week or so ago, a small flare or firework, or something,

97
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,880
在抵押贷款办公区爆开了
was set off by the Mortgages desk.

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,010
触发了警报
It tripped the alarm.

99
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,190
我们以为那只是小孩的恶作剧
We thought it was just a kid's prank.

100
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,540
我们需要你找出那起事件发生时的
We're gonna need you to find the surveillance footage

101
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,580
监控录像
from that incident.

102
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,720
你好先生  有什么能够帮到您的吗
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

103
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,180
雷吉
Reggie?

104
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,080
抱歉这么晚来找你
Sorry for calling so late.

105
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,020
请原谅我
Forgive me.

106
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,630
天啊  伙计  有多久了
Oh, my God, mate. How long's it been?

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,730
二十年了
20 years.

108
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,040
我昨晚被哥谭警局带走了
I got picked up by the GCPD last night

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,420
因为我想在韦斯特伯里桥下过夜
for trying to sleep under the Westbury Bridge.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,200
-给  伙计  -谢了  伙计
- Here, mate. - Cheers, mate.

111
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,580
一位警官是海军陆战队老兵
One of the officers was a marine, back in the day,

112
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
于是我们就聊了起来
so we got to talking.

113
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,510
我告诉他我曾是英国空降特勤队的
I told him I was with Her Majesty's Special Air Service back in the day.

114
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,720
于是他就放过了我
So he took pity on me.

115
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,040
他说  你为什么不去找找你的老队友
He says, "Why don't you look up some of your old regiment,

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,220
看看他们能不能  帮你一把
you know, see if one of the guys can... help you out."

117
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,200
好吧...
Well, you know...

118
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,290
很高兴你能来找我  雷吉
I'm pleased you looked me up, Reg.

119
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,070
如果有谁告诉我
If anyone would've told me

120
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,720
你会在这种地方  我都不会相信
this is where I'd find you, I wouldn't have believed them.

121
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,510
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

122
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,020
对我挺好
It's good for me.

123
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,600
我看出来了
I can see that.

124
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,650
我挺想你的  伙计
I've missed you, mate.

125
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,180
想你这张丑脸
Missed your ugly mug.

126
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,840
干杯
Cheers.

127
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,610
发生了什么  雷吉
What happened, Reggie?

128
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,770
温妮莎死了
Vanessa died.

129
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,580
到今天已经有11年了
11 years ago now.

130
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
在那之后
I just couldn't find the energy

131
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,850
我就是无法振作起来了  你懂吗
to get back out there after that, you know?

132
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,940
一年后  我丢了房子
A year later, I lost the house.

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
搬回了哥谭
Moved back to Gotham.

134
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,310
换了几份工作
I've had a few jobs.

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,030
没一件正经的
Nothing I'm proud of.

136
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,040
是因为酒  阿尔弗
It was the drink, Alfie.

137
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,110
是因为酒
It was the drink.

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,020
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred?

139
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,100
布鲁斯少爷
Um, Master Bruce.

Very pleased to meet you, sir.

143
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,060
被大雨淋到了吗
You were caught in the storm?

144
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,790
雷吉最近运气不太好  布鲁斯少爷
Reggie's had a run of bad luck, Master Bruce.

145
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,770
我不想麻烦人  我只是...
I-I don't wish to be a nuisance. I just...

146
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,000
我有很久没见过阿尔弗了
I hadn't seen Alfie in a very long time.

147

不  很高兴你来找我们  佩恩先生

请安心在这里待几天吧
Please, feel free to stay with us a few days.

149
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,460

150
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,600
我坚持
I insist.

151
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,920
别客气
Please.

152
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,350
你们要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

153
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,470
这边走  穆尼女士
This way, Miss Mooney.

154
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
谁选来的这些人
Who chose these people?

155
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,480
你们从哪找来的
Where'd you get them from?

156
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,490
请坐
Sit, please.

157
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,590
坐下
Sit.

158
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,540
找到你了  红头罩先生
There you are, Mr. Red Hood.

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,730
十年间的持械抢劫罪犯案宗
Armed robbery perps dating back ten years.

160
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,160
我拿走了死掉的和在监狱里的
I took out the dead ones and the ones in prison.

161
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,350
恶棍名录
A who's who of scumbags.

162
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,770
他们行动前一周对银行进行了勘察
They were casing the place a week before they took it down.

163
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,590
触发警报然后记录响应时间
Set off the alarm then timed the response.

164
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,750
他看起来挺年轻的  可能不在这堆里
He looks pretty young. He might not be in here.

165
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,490
你看到了吗
You see that?

166
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,620
没有  因为你拿掉了我的眼镜
No, 'cause you took my glasses.

167
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,510
那里  大衣下面
Right there, underneath his coat.

168
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,990
他穿了件工作服
He's wearing a work shirt.

169
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,120
克莱格汽车维修
"Kleg's Auto."

170
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,810
这个白痴
Idiot.

171
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,930
克莱格汽车维修

172
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,660
红头罩帮
"The Red Hood Gang"!

173
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,640
这名字多响亮啊
It's got a ring to it.

174
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,770
-才不呢  -看到这些人了吗
- No, it doesn't. - See those people?

175
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,730
他们喜欢我
They loved me.

176
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,410
他们喜欢的是你丢的钱
They loved the money you threw at 'em.

177
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,980
对了  那事真是多谢了
Thanks for that, by the way.

178
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,380
不如从你那份里扣吧
Shall we take it out of your share?

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,200
你们不明白
You guys don't get it.

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,860
我们不再只是五个持枪抢劫犯了
We're not just five mooks with shotguns anymore.

181
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,330
我们是红头罩帮
We're the Red Hood Gang.

182
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,550
我们劫富济贫
Taking from the rich and giving back to the poor.

183
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,660
相信我
Mark my words,

184
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,480
这个城市的人  他们懂我
the people in this town, they're gonna get me.

185
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,230
-懂我们行了吧  -你能闭嘴吗
- Us. - Will you shut up?

186
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,030
你到处乱蹦Q本可能会害我们被杀的
All that prancing around could have gotten us killed.

187
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,380
你错了  那保安离我就六米远
You're wrong. That guard, he was 20 feet away from me.

188
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,610
结果一发都没中
Not one shot got close.

189
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,560
狗屎运
Luck!

190
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,000
他显得很紧张
He looked r-real nervous.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,060
是因为头罩
It's the hood!

192
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,770
它给我带来了好运  相信我
It's good luck. I'm telling you.

193
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,700
戴上它我觉得自己完全变了个人
I feel like a totally different person with it on.

194
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,100
你能坐下吗
Eh, sit down, will ya?

195
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,450
我们还得梳理明天的计划
We need to go over tomorrow's score.

196
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,710
不  这让我们与众不同
Nah, this sets us apart.

197
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,790
只是块剪了两个洞的布
It's a piece of cloth -- two holes cut out of it.

198
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,100
这是个象征
It's a symbol!

199
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,160
戴它的人就是头儿
Whoever wears the hood should lead!

200
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,720
他说的对
He's right.

201
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,810
有人有意见吗
Any objections?

202
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,920
那么
So...

203
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,080
惹事的就是你吗
you're the one causing all of the fuss.

204
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,340
如今拿刀的那位
The one with the knife now.

205
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,870
这是你的地盘吗
This is your facility?

206
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,770
我管理这里  没错
I manage it, yes.

207
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,410
但这里属于你吗
But do you own it?

208
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,050
这里属于医生
The doctor owns it.

209
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,720
你去哪
Where are you going?

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,940
回地下室  我们没的谈了
Back to the basement. We're done here.

211
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,060
穆尼女士
Miss Mooney...

212
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,790
请坐
Take a seat.

213
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,860
我只和医生谈  其他谁也不行
I will talk to the doctor and the doctor only.

214
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,850
他正在哥谭会诊
He's away on a consultation in Gotham.

215
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,520
那等他回来再找我
Then call me when he returns.

216
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,490
他特地要求我
He expressly asked me

217
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,060
满足你的要求
to attend to your demands.

218
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,070
他叫什么
His name.

219
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,450
你说什么
I'm sorry?

220
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,180
那个医生  他叫什么名字
The doctor. His name.

221
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,180
杜马赫
Dulmacher.

222
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,590
你去告诉杜马赫医生
You tell Dr. Dulmacher

223
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,740
地下室是我的
that the basement is mine.

224
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,860
我不同意  他一个人也拿不到
No one will leave unless I say so.

225
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,930
他和我面对面谈好条件前
It will remain that way until he sits with me

226
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,730
一直都会如此
and negotiates terms.

227
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,790
也许
Perhaps...

228
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,050
我们一开始有些误会  穆尼女士
you and I got off on the wrong foot, Miss Mooney.

229
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,310
你多久没洗澡了
When was the last time you had a shower?

230
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,560
或是换新衣服
A new set of clothes?

231
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,820
带穆尼女士去我的私人卫浴
Take Miss Mooney to my private bathroom,

232
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,640
再从库房为她挑两件新衣服
and then pick up some fresh clothes for her from storage.

233
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,690
梳洗一番
Freshen up.

234
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,610
再回来见我
Come back to me.

235
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,420
那时我们也许能继续谈
And then perhaps we'll talk some more.

236
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,820
然后殡葬师对女服务员说
So the mortician says to the waitress...

237
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,130
不对  是女服务员对殡葬师说
No, the waitress says to the mortician,

238
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,260
他一直这么僵硬
"He was always stiff."

239
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,830
够了  走吧
That's it. Let's go.

240
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,820
等等  别走
Wait. No.

241
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,370
晚上愉快  下周见  先生  好吧
Have a good night. See you next week, sir. Okay.

242
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,940
没关系...
It's fine. We got, uh...

243
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,760
买单
Check, please.

244
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,070
还有什么...还有...  
What do we have? We got, um...

245
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,640
纸牌
...cards.

246
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,070
怎么了
What's wrong?

247
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,760
企鹅先生  企鹅人  那个...
Ah, Mr. Penguin. I mean the Penguin. I mean...

248
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,900
-我...  -什么事
- I... - What is it?

249
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,260
没酒了
We're out of booze.

250
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,540
什么  你后面  整面墙不都是酒
What? Hello? Behind you, there's a wall of booze.

251
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,320
那只是染色的水  一直都是
Just colored water, sir. Always has been.

252
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,530
真酒放在下面  现在都喝完了
We keep the real stuff down here, but we're out.

253
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,540
-别废话了  再订一批  -订了
- So, duh, order more. - We did.

254
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,500
只是...
It's just that...

255
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,040
都是马罗尼的酒
It's Maroni's booze.

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,300
他最近在生你的气
And he's a little grumpy with you these days.

257
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,380
他以前也不喜欢菲什
He was hardly a fan of Fish, either.

258
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,100
为什么还要卖她酒
Why did he sell her booze?

259
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,420
生意归生意
Business is business.

260
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,020
但他现在对你恨之入骨
But he hates you with a passion.

261
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,530
-他又杀不了你  -那...
- But he can't kill you, so... - That's...

262
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,440
太荒谬了  买酒的地方多了去了
This is ridiculous. There's a thousand places to buy booze.

263
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,010
麻烦就在这里
That's where it gets complicated.

264
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,310
马罗尼为这片区域供应酒水
See, Maroni, he supplies this whole side of town.

265
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,550
没人敢为了帮你而招惹他
No one would dare cross him to help you.

266
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,630
帮我
Help...

267
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,850
滚下台吧
Get outta here!

268
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,020
谢谢大家  再见  抱歉
Thank you. Bye. Sorry.

269
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,940
一点也不好笑
You're not funny.

270
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,640
你看我失败一定很开心
You must take great pleasure watching me fail.

271
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,340
正相反
On the contrary.

272
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,290
九年前我和菲什
I was with Fish

273
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,580
从一个华人赌注经纪人那里接手了这地方
when we took this place off a Chinese bookie nine years ago.

274
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,190
这里以前是斗鸡的
It was used for cock fighting.

275
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,180
那味道简直挥之不去
Took forever to get the smell out.

276
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,260
我在这里流过血  流过汗  也流过泪
My blood, sweat, and tears are in this dive.

277
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,390
失陪一下
Well, if you'll excuse me,

278
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,510
我还得为这些少得可怜的顾客
it seems as though I need to procure some alcohol

279
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,660
采购酒水呢
for my dwindling clientele.

280
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,330
当心
Be careful.

281
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,790
你知道惹恼了马罗尼会是什么下场
You've seen what happens when you cross Maroni.

282
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,170
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

283
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,720
看来他们昨晚还在这儿
Looks like they were here last night.

284
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,570
你那性感的医生朋友  汤普金斯
Your hot doctor friend, Thompkins...

285
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,450
-莱斯利  -随便了
- Leslie. - Whatever.

286
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,640
来说点劲爆的情节
Give me the double D-- "dirty details."

287
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,900
一字不许漏
Don't leave anything out.

288
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,730
真佩服你  搭档
Gotta hand it to you, partner.

289
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,660
没整天闷闷不乐
You don't sit around moping.

290
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,080
而是立刻重返情场了
You got right back up on the hobby horse.

291
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,220
但愿你一边恋爱
Let's just hope you can keep your head straight

292
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,590
一边能保持头脑清醒
whilst up there.

293
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,190
钱不缺
You had the purse.

294
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,980
女人也有了
Now you got yourself a nurse.

295
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,410
看来我找到弗洛伊德了
Well, looks like I found our friend Floyd.

296
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,490
干吗  我不喝  鉴证科的也会喝
What? If I don't drink it, forensics will.

297
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,770
他就是戴红头罩的那个
All right. This was the guy with the hood.

298
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,190
衣服一模一样
He's wearing the same coat.

299
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,980
不知道他做了什么  惹恼了其他人
I wonder what he did to piss off the rest of his crew.

300
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,880
也许他们知道咱们会抓到他
Maybe they knew we'd catch up to him.

301
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
他是头头
Well, he was the leader,

302
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,250
看来红头罩帮算是完了
so it looks like we've seen the last of the Red Hood crew now.

303
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,870
早上好  各位
Good morning, everyone!

304
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,540
别碰我  我行的
Get off me! I got it.

305
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,190
-好  -我们不是来抢你们的钱的
- Okay. - We're not here for your money.

306
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,000
是为了保险
We're here for the insurance!

307
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,750
为了银行的保险金
I mean the bank's insured money!

308
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,040
还有60秒
60 seconds.

309
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,580
你打算给我们分点吗  红头罩
Hey! You gonna share a little bit of that cash with us, Hood?

310
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,590
还剩30秒
Th-thirty seconds.

311
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,880
拜托  我们很多人都时运不济
Come on. A lot of us are hurting here.

312
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,310
10秒  走...
Ten seconds. L-l...

313
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,880
走吧
l-let's go!

314
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,480
好吧
Fine.

315
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,650
别了  哥谭
So long, Gotham!

316
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,360
再见
Sayonara!

317
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,560
只剩四个了
And then there were four.

318
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,240
人们都会在银行等着这些白痴撒钱
People are gonna hang out in banks waiting for handouts from these idiots.

319
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,390
{\an8}红头罩罗宾再次出击

320
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,280
我们绝对抓不到一个大家不希望我们抓到的团伙
We're never gonna catch a crew no one wants us to catch.

321
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,920
你可以说我老派  但当恶棍
Call me old-fashioned, but when crooks

322
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,610
比警察更受人欢迎时
become more popular than cops,

323
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,640
-就天下大乱了  -想想看
- that's anarchy. - Think about it.

324
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,960
只要有人愿意头戴红头罩
As long as somebody's willing to put that red hood on,

325
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,770
这个团伙就无法消灭
this gang can go on forever.

326
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,140
伙计们
Hey, guys.

327
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,250
我这里有个人  你们也许会想见见
Got somebody here you might want to meet.

328
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,930
-这位是  -我姓姜
- This is Mister... - Chaing.

329
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,330
姜  他是目击者
Chaing, right. He's an eyewitness.

330
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,310
银行抢劫案吗
From the bank?

331
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,200
我工作的餐厅离银行只有一个街口
I work at a restaurant a block away.

332
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,620
红头罩帮今早把他们的货车停在了那儿
The Red Hood Gang parked their van there this morning.

333
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,560
他们跑回货车时  我正好出去倒垃圾
I was throwing out the trash when they ran back to it.

334
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,650
你看到他们的脸了吗
You see their faces?

335
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,180
只看到一个  那个带着头罩的胖子
Just one-- the fat one with the hood.

336
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,630
他摘下了头罩开车
He took it off to drive.

337
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,560
-我去叫人像速写师来  -等一下
- I'll get the sketch artist. - Well, wait a minute.

338
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,720
持械抢劫的案宗已开
Got the armed robbery files already opened.

339
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,240
也许他可以看看是否能认出什么人
Maybe he can look through them, see if he recognizes someone.

340
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,950
也许那人就是格斯・弗洛伊德的同伙
Maybe that someone is a known associate of Gus Floyd.

341
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,450
唯一的问题是记录有点旧了
Only problem is records are kind of old--

342
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,500
他现在的样子可能不一样
he might look different now.

343
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,810
我们可以从中筛选几个符合姜描述的疑犯
We could pull a few based off Chaing's description.

344
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,410
用老办法  让他通过列队辨认嫌疑犯
Get ourselves a good old-fashioned lineup.

345
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,120
等一下  我有什么好处
Wait. Wait a second. What's in it for me?

346
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,970
我被开了很多张停车罚单
I got all these parking tickets

347
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,230
因为我前妻是个神经病
because my ex-wife is a crazy bitch.

348
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,550
我们去想想办法
We'll see what we can do.

349
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,720
在为战斗训练吗
Training for a fight?

350
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,110
只是训练而已
Just training.

351
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,720
谁在帮你
Who's helping you?

352
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,710
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

353
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,460
不错的选择
Good choice.

354
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,830
给我看看你的战姿
Show me your stance.

355
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,890
很好
Good.

356
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,490
打我
Hit me.

357
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,840
再来一次
Again.

358
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
不要犹豫
And don't hold back.

359
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,460
狠狠攻击我  孩子
You have a go at me, son.

360
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,740
好了  不该这就被惹恼  孩子
Come on. It should take more than that to piss you off, son.

361
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,660
来吧
Come on.

362
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:14,980
再来一次
Again.

363
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,200
来
Come on.

364
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,030
别这样  永远要保持冷静
Now, now. Never lose your cool.

365
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,470
否则会害死你的
It'll get you killed.

366
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,230
你想打我  是吧  你想打我吧
Now, you want to hit me, right? You want to hit me, right?

367
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,420
好  挥拳打
Okay. Take a swing.

368
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,690
挥拳打  来  出拳吧
Take a swing. Go on. Do it.

369
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,510
有人让你打
Somebody gives you a free shot,

370
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,860
你一定得打狠点
you got to make it count.

371
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,720
用尽全力打我
You hit me as hard as you can.

372
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,220
好多了
Better.

373
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,370
用肩膀使劲
Put your shoulder behind it.

374
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,840
用全身的力量
Put your full body weight behind it.

375
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,450
来吧  出拳
Go on. Do it.

376
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,190
用力点  再来一次
Harder. Again.

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,450
再来一次
Again.

378

把我打倒  孩子  来吧  你可以的
Put me on my back, son. Come on, you can do it.

380
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,200
来吧  再来一次
Come on. Again.

381
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
你的个头比我大太多了
You're so much bigger than me!

382
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
那就把你个头小作为优势
Then use that to your advantage!

383
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,110
打我下盘
You hit me low.

384
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,260
攻击我的膝盖  脚踝
Hit me in the knee, the ankle.

385
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,420
别管拳击手套了
Forget about the gloves!

386
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,930
利用身边的一切
Use whatever's around you.

387
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,070
来  给
Here. Here.

388
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,570
-来吧  -好了
- Go on. - Right!

389
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,140
差不多了
That's enough of that.

390
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,710
你去洗个澡吧  布鲁斯少爷
Perhaps a shower's in order, Master Bruce.

391
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,330
佩恩先生在教我一些别的打斗方法
M-Mr. Payne was just showing me some alternative methods.

392
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,840
是啊  我看见了
Yeah, I can see that, can't I?

393
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,060
和我们的课程大相径庭  是吧
Not methods that fit into our curriculum, though, are they?

394
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,240
是啊  但很有效
No, they're not; but they're effective.

395
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,330
纪律  技巧
Discipline, skill,

396
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,810
努力才会出效果
and hard work are effective.

397
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,240
需要我给你放水吗  少爷
How 'bout I start that shower for you, sir?

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,730
不用了
No.

399
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,500
你养过孩子吗  雷吉
You ever raised a child before, Reg?

400
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,740
没有
No.

401
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,570
我也是
Me neither.

402
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,990
这是我生平遇到的最困难的工作
Hardest job I've ever had to do in my life.

403
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,400
让人无从下手
Nothing prepares you for it.

404
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,950
如果我僭越了  对不起
Listen, I'm sorry if I overstepped the mark.

405
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,070
我只是...
I was just...

406
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,230
看得出你在这孩子身上下了很大功夫...
It was obvious how much you've helped him so...

407
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,240
不  是他帮了我
No, he helped me.

408
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,980
因为认识他  我成了更好的人  雷吉
I'm a better person for knowing him, Reg.

409
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,120
过去的事已经过去了
Let's keep our past where it belongs.

410
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,770
就让它留在过去吧
In the past.

411
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,320
这就样吗  俩工人
That's it? Just two workers?

412
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,130
太容易了
This'll be easy.

413
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,090
麻利点  伙计们
Make it quick, guys.

414
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,710
这下麻烦了
Well, this is inconvenient.

415
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,770
警官
Officer.

416
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,320
我们这儿没事啊
Nothing going on here.

417
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,310
是吗
That so?

418
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,210
你们的酒水供应许可证过期了
Eh, your liquor license is out of date.

419
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,870
这批货被没收了
We're gonna be confiscating the shipment.

420
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,360
马罗尼阁下知道你们这样吗
Hey, does Don Maroni know you guys are here?

421
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,910
滚  不然把你抓回局里
Walk away... before I run you downtown.

422
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,050
哥谭真是堕落了
This town is truly going to the dogs.

423
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,330
晚上好啊  伙计们
Evening, fellas.

424
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,940
笑什么笑  布奇
Why the smile, Butch?

425
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,830
先是马罗尼断了我们的酒源
First Maroni blocks our liquor,

426
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,990
现在又是条子
and now the cops?

427
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,050
谁  他们吗
Oh, who, them?

428
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,620
他们是我的人
They're with me.

429
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,210
我总偷偷留几个警察内线
I always keep a few uniforms in the closet.

430
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,360
比进去明火执仗地抢干净多了吧
A lot cleaner than going in guns blazing, don't you think?

431
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,050
不用谢  奥斯瓦尔德
You're welcome, Oswald.

432
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,910
干得好
Nice work there.

433
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,320
你还好吗  吉尔兹先生
How you doing, Mr. Gilzean?

434
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,080
这边  还有那批...
This over here, this...

435
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,350
不用担心
Nothing to worry about.

436
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,690
你没事吧
You okay?

437
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,220
当然
Of course.

438
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,900
谢谢你让我们住下
Thank you for letting us stay here.

439
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,980
抱歉把你这儿搞得有点乱
Sorry it got a little messy.

440
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,290
我这就走了
I was just about to go.

441
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,060
我喜欢有你们陪着
I like having you guys here.

442
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,960
塞琳娜

443
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,310
来
Come here.

444
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,450
知道吗  你眼看长成个美人了
You know, you're turning into quite the beautiful woman.

445
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,430
才没有
No, I'm not.

446
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,240
收拾干净
Remove the dirt...

447
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,000
脱掉这旧帽子
that old hood...

448
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,070
和这身脏衣服
these ratty clothes...

449
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,930
绝对是一位小公主
I bet we find a princess undernea...

450
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,290
我有个点子
I have an idea.

451
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,480
天啊
Holy moly.

452
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,030
合身的尽管拿走
Take anything that fits you guys.

453
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,240
这都是你穿过的衣服吗
This is all stuff you've worn?

454
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,390
大部分吧
Most of it.

455
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,770
你一定经常参加聚会
You sure must go out a lot.

456
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,190
以前是
I used to.

457
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,530
跟我来
Come with me.

458
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
你真的很美
You're a true beauty.

459
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,510
你可以利用你的美
Something you can use to your advantage.

460
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,490
你的外表就是一件武器
Your appearance can be a weapon,

461
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,120
威力不逊于任何兵刃火器
as powerful as any knife or gun.

462
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,480
是吗
Yeah?

463
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,330
你的外表对你有什么好处
What good's it done you?

464
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,560
好了  靠墙站着
All right, backs to the wall.

465
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,050
号牌放胸前
Hold your numbers up.

466
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,200
不准说话
No talking.

467
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,950
我还以为他们长得会差不多
I thought they were going to be similar types.

468
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,810
确实差不多
They are.

469
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,500
好好看看  姜先生
Look closely, Mr. Chaing.

470
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,020
我知道要怎么做
I know how this works.

471
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,320
那个四号  矮胖的那个
There, number four-- the short, fat one.

472
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,650
-你确定  -他就是那个戴红头罩的
- You're sure? - That's your Red Hood.

473
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,400
扔了那么多钱  一分都没落到我手里
Threw all that money away, and I didn't get a cent.

474
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,240
克莱德・戴斯特罗  47岁
Clyde Destro, 47 years old,

475
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,690
三年前曾因伤人罪和持械抢劫一家便利店
conviction for assault and armed robbery of a convenience store

476
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,770
被判刑
three years ago.

477
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,560
-把他拿下吧  -慢着
- Let's book him. - Wait a minute.

478
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,690
我们只有一个在犯罪现场外的目击证人
All we have is one witness outside of the crime scene,

479
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,620
没别的了
that's it.

480
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,900
弗洛伊德被杀了
Now, Floyd was killed,

481
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,600
说明他们已经开始内部反目了
so we know they're turning on each other.

482
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,050
放戴斯特罗走
Let Destro go?

483
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,000
然后跟踪他
And tail him.

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
跟着他找到团伙其他成员
He takes us to the other gang members.

485
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,180
然后让他们相互指证
We use them against each other.

486
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,190
当场把红头罩帮一网打尽
We catch the Red Hood Gang red-handed.

487
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,220
没错
That's right.

488
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,070
我能搭个便车回家吗
Can I get a ride home?

489
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,050
如果我从警车里下来
My girlfriend will freak out

490
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,900
我女人会吓疯的
if I turn up in a patrol car.

491
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,940
你真是太迷人了
Don't you look lovely?

492
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,690
还有事情要谈呢
There's still business to discuss.

493
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,810
也对
Of course.

494
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,660
地下室
The basement.

495
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,710
我如何才能恢复经营呢
How do I resume operations?

496
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,490
我们还有生意要做
We do have a business to run.

497
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,990
你那是偷窃人体器官
Yes, you're stealing body parts.

498
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
给谁偷
For who?

499
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,850
有需求的客户
We have clients...

500
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,130
遍及世界各地
all over the world in need of such things.

501
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,110
而且  医生他本人
Also, there's the doctor's

502
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,520
也有试验需要
personal experiments.

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,250
你的气场真是难得
You have such a presence,

504
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,590
穆尼女士
Miss Mooney.

505
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,990
眼神尤其凌厉
Such a gaze.

506
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,050
你的眼球
Your eyes...

507
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,340
肯定值不少钱
will fetch quite a penny.

508
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,180
你休想从我身上拿走任何东西
You will take nothing from me.

509
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,020
是吗
Really?

510
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,810
在我看来
Because the way I see it,

511
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,900
你只有两条路可走  第一
you have two choices: One...

512
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,740
我们杀了你和你地下室里的朋友
we kill you and your little friends in the basement.

513
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,180
虽然会造成不便  但还是可以接受的
That's an inconvenience but an acceptable one.

514
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,640
或者  第二
Or, two...

515
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,670
我们现在就取了你的眼球
we take your eyes now

516
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,220
看看一个瞎眼女人在地下室里能活多久
and see how long a blind girl can survive in the basement.

517
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,260
你忘了第三条路
You forgot option three.

518
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,940
拦住她
Stop her!

519
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,250
不
No!

520
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,030
我从酒窖里拿来了这个
I picked something out from the cellar.

521
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,950
希望你不介意
I hope that's okay.

522
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,620
你真是太客气了
Well, that's, uh, extremely kind of you,

523
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,700
布鲁斯少爷  但我觉得我们...
Master Bruce, but I don't think that we...

524
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,690
今晚不打算喝酒
that I'll be, uh, drinking this evening.

525
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,000
我觉得偶尔喝一两杯
I'm sure it's perfectly fine to have

526
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,280
没什么关系的  阿尔弗雷德
a glass of wine occasionally, Alfred.

527
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,910
我拿了瓶有年头的
I-I picked an old one.

528
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,620
干放在那里吃灰未免可惜了
Seems a shame to let them gather dust down there.

529
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,040
罗曼尼・康帝红酒
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

530
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,310
是瓶不错的勃艮第红酒  1966年的
It's a rather nice Burgundy, actually, it's 1966.

531
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,440
是啊
Yeah.

532
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,170
你父亲最喜欢了
It's one of your father's favorites.

533
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,570
好啊
Why not, eh?

534
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,060
坐吧
Take a pew.

535
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,930
多谢了
That's very kind of you.

536
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,840
给
There you go.

537
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,960
谢了  伙计
Cheers, mate.

538
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,680
喝这酒
Now, the idea, of course,

539
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,300
应该至少放一小时
is to let it breathe for at least an hour.

540
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,480
或者一口闷
Or not.

541
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,390
真好喝
Delicious.

542
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,000
他终于把背包打开了
So he eventually opened his backpack

543
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,430
发现了那条蛇
and he found the bloody snake.

544
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,830
我们都等一晚上了
We'd been waiting for it all night.

545
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,020
他完全不害怕
He didn't even flinch.

546
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,010
-你怎么做的  -就那样
- What'd you do? - Oh, you know,

547
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,180
我把蛇头砍下来  跟大家分着吃了
I chopped its head off and we ate the bloody thing.

548
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,910
真的
He did.

549
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,120
什么味儿啊
What did it taste like?

550
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,540
有点像...
Uh, a bit like, um,

551
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,940
快餐
fast food.

552
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,340
难吃死了
It was horrible.

553
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,310
真是难吃
It was horrible.

554
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,110
恶心死了
It was disgusting.

555
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,580
那么
So, um...

556
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,750
佩恩先生  你是空军的
so, Mr. Payne, you were in the Air Force?

557
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,550
特种空勤团
Special Air Service-- SAS.

558
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,310
世上最好的兵
Best soldiers in the world,

559
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,320
如果我实话实说
if I'm being honest.

560
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,550
那么你们执行秘密行动吗
So that means covert missions?

561
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,480
没错
That's right.

562
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,060
战斗开始之前  我们被投放在敌后
Before a conflict, they dropped us behind enemy lines.

563
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,810
我们行动低调
We were quiet,

564
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,710
准确  致命
precise, and deadly.

565
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,610
我们从未损失过人
We never lost a man

566
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,740
而且总能完成任务
and we always completed our missions.

567
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,640
就除了那一次吧
Except that once, I guess.

568
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,880
战争的老故事说够了  雷吉
Yeah, well, that's enough of the old war stories, eh, Reg?

569
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,850
哪一次
What one time?

570
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,160
发生了一场沙暴
There was a sandstorm.

571
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,530
我们被吹散了
We got separated.

572
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,670
两人被俘
Two of us were captured.

573
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,450
你吗
You?

574
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,950
他打败了他们12个人才被制服
He fought 12 of them off before they cut him down.

575
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,070
是不是  阿尔弗
Didn't you, Alf?

576
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,880
我这不在这里吗
I'm here now, aren't I?

577
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,030
这才最重要
That's all that matters.

578
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,190
好了  先生们  我得说
All right, gents, while I have to say

579
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,640
这真是很愉快
this has been absolutely lovely,

580
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,740
但是
I'd like to,

581
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,760
但是上床前我还想收拾收拾呢
I'd like to tidy up before I go to bed.

582
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,310
收拾收拾
T-T-Tidy up?

583
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,530
军纪如山的大兵
Mr. Yes Sir, No Sir.

584
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,960
纪律严明  从来令行禁止
Mr. Queensberry rules and discipline.

585
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,340
多谢  够了
Thank you, that's enough.

586
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,540
阿尔弗雷德说得对
Alfred's right...

587
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
该睡觉了
it's time for bed.

588
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,760
晚安  布鲁斯少爷
Good night, Master Bruce.

589
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,190
晚安  晚安
Good night. Good night.

590
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,230
好好睡  孩子
Sleep well, son.

591
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,380
你为什么瞒着他
Why are you hiding from him what you really are,

592
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,830
你真实的面目
who you really are?

593
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,700
我们是老兵  阿尔弗
You're a war dog, Alfie.

594
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,650
你是个冷血
You're a cold-blooded,

595
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,830
致命的老兵  那就是你
lethal war dog, is what you are.

596
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,740
我给你找了些干净衣服  雷吉
I found some fresh clothes for you, Reg.

597
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,670
我已经叠好  放在你床上了
I folded them and I put 'em on your bed,

598
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,140
我还自作主张  给你准备了
and I've taken the liberty of packing you

599
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,290
明天路上吃的午餐
a lunch for your travels tomorrow.

600
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,700
能再见到你真的很开心  雷吉
It's been really nice to see you, Reggie.

601
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,850
我晚上会看到他们  我独自一人时
I see them, at night... when I'm alone.

602
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,350
那些人的面孔
The faces...

603
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,700
那些被我们杀的人
the faces of those we killed.

604
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
你呢
Do you?

605
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,440
我不会去找他们  雷吉
I don't have to look for them, Reg.

606
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,910
他们会找到我
They find me.

607
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,930
我去
Holy crap.

608
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,940
你吓死我了
You scared the snot out of me.

609
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,660
我得见你
H-Had to see you.

610
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,990
我等不及了
I c-couldn't wait.

611
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,370
你去哪了
Where were you?

612
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,520
出去了
Out.

613
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,520
只是出去了吗
J-Just out?

614
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,800
关你什么事
What's it to you?

615
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,100
我需要头罩
I need the hood.

616
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,140
什么

她昨晚说我是个废物

她前任又回哥谭了  他是个保镖

621

我觉得她如果看到我戴头罩
I figured she-she sees me in the hood,

622
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,440
她就会重视我

623
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,670
你为了找头罩把我家翻了一遍吗

很遗憾  我手机没信号

一堆被抢银行寄来的贷款拒绝信

650
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,490

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,520
他们都拒绝了你

655
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,380
那么你是出于报复
So these are revenge robberies.

656
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,720
银行才不在乎我这样的人
Banks don't care about people like me.

657
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,650

你得强迫别人看到你

我想
I do.

673
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,960
即便考虑到她对我做的一切
Even after everything she did to me.

674
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
或许定义我们的不是我们的朋友
Perhaps it's not our friends but...

675
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,380
而是我们的敌人
our enemies that define us.

676
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,650
敬菲什

你可以直接问我借钱的  雷吉
You could have just asked me for money, Reg.

你不知道求人有多难吧  阿尔弗
You don't know how hard that is, Alfie... do you?

681

没有

根本没有展开调查的根据

没什么要紧
Nothing.

734
