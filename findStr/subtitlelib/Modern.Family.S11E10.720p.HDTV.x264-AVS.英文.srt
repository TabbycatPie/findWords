20
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,290
This one's from me. The ribboning isn't my best --

21
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,510
I have carpal tunnel.

22
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,600
My new company is putting me up at The Prescott,

23
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,880
a luxury residence with full amenities.

24
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,050
I admit, this extravagant lifestyle

25
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,720
can make me a little uncomfortable.

26
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,350
Gentle, Marta!

27
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,980
Another candle. Thanks, everyone.

28
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,150
Alex, you should know

29
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,770
that a crook works at the hair salon downstairs --

30
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,030
Adolfo of Venice.

31
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,830
Isn't he the colorist to the stars?

32
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,130
Thank you for asking even though I know you know.

33
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,430
I hate him.

34
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,460
Adolfo of Venice is actually

35
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,260
Alan Carpman of Bakersfield.

36
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,400
We started as hairdressers together,

37
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,930
but he stole my hair dye formula.

38
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,830
For a family of generally lovely people,

39
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,510
we sure have a lot of rivals.

40
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,900
You know what, it's been fun, but it's time to go.

41
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,610
You haven't even opened the candle that Cam and I got you.

42
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,220
And don't we get a tour of the building?

43
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,910
This place has everything.

44
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,490
Um, an archery range, a shark tank, a --

45
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,330
a Westworld?

46
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,660
Sorry, I've got a huge project due.

47
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,220
We can always just explore on our own.

48
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,010
Actually, you can't.

49
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,240
There's a strict "No unaccompanied guests" policy.

50
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,290
I violate that, they kick me out.

51
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,750
I'll have the valet fetch your cars.

52
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,950
Oh, you can do that from here?

53
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,380
Yeah, everything's automated.

54
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,250
You just need a resident ID code.

55
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,150
- Bye, Phil. ?- Bye.

56
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,190
All right, well, I parked on the street,

57
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,190
so I'll just meet you at home.

58
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,000
- Bye, Claire. - I need to run to the mall.

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,240
Would you pick up some steaks from the farmers market for tonight?

60
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,530
Oh, so you did remember it's date night.

61
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,040
I was a little worried after your response to my Paperless Post.

62
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh, come on.

63
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,820
You know my maybes always turn into will attends.

64
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,590
Okay.

65
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,310
When was the last time that you and I

66
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,600
cooked a romantic dinner together?

67
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,790
We did it last week.

68
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,300
I'm not talking about sprinkling hot dog slices on a DiGiorno's.

69
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,700
You couldn't bring my car before I got in trouble?

70
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,090
Thank you.

71
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,310
I've been secretly moonlighting as an online food blogger,

72
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,550
"Foodie in a Hoodie"

73
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,930
it rhymes on the page.

74
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,650
I've quickly developed a huge following,

75
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,270
and The Prescott is home to the city's hottest restaurant,

76
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,490
called Pardon.

77
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,340
Hello.

78
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,500
Ah, good day, sir.

79
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,180
Forgive me. I'm new here.

80
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,790
Still getting to know each of the tenants.

81
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,500
I'm your concierge, Higgins.

82
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,610
You look so familiar. Have we met?

83
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,030
'Fraid not, no.

84
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,040
I do get that a lot, though.

85
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,580
I have an everyman face and body.

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,060
They're rising.

87
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,740
Ah, yes, Finley.

88
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,390
Patrols the building for non-residents

89
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
using a motion sensor and face scanner.

90
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,870
Useful, yes, but does he have that uniquely human ability

91
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,170
to anticipate a person's every need?

92
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,280
Coconut water?

93
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,270
I didn't even know I wanted this!

94
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,660
Finley, away!

95
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Anything else I can help you with, sir?

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,260
No. I'm just headed down to the restaurant.

97
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,180
Pardon?

98
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,250
Your...in-house eatery.

99
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,270
Pardon?

100
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,720
You know -- uh, waiters, cutlery, daily specials.

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
I think it's called Pardon.

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,640
- Of course. My mistake. - It's all right.

103
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Right this way.

104
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,480
Avoiding the security robot would be tricky,

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
but Finley had a weakness --

106
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,860
he can only detect people if they're moving.

107
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,970
And it was worth the risk --

108
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,110
Pardon claimed to have the world's best beef slider,

109
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,370
and my -- my followers are dying for a review.

110
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Well, all but one.

111
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,770
I have a troll.

112
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,620
Screen name "Close to Utlaw," Wherever that is.

113
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,120
We recently got into a -- a heated comment war.

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
Insults were hurled, mothers disparaged.

115
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,030
Who knew the Internet could be so negative?

116
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,290
Table for one. I live here.

117
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,500
Something just opened up.

118
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,320
Great, lead the way. I live here.

119
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,750
Hi. Uh, I'm new here.

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,800
Could you lead me to the screening room?

121
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,850
I should think so.

122
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,710
At the butler academy, I led my class in leading.

123
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,880
This way.

124
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,980
Recently, I got a special edition Blu-ray

125
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,160
of the best movie ever made, "Lawrence of Arabia."

126
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,560
Word is, The Prescott has

127
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,730
a state-of-the-art screening room with surround sound.

128
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,060
Know what it doesn't have?

129
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,260
Manny.

130
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,990
Hello! I would've gone with a tracking shot there.

131
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,630
I sure hope he finds a plot out there in that desert.

132
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,960
Behold, our famous candy wall.

133
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Hey, Sugar Babies.

134
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,710
Yes, honey buns?

135
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,840
?No, Sugar Babies. The greatest movie candy of all time.

136
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,930
A thousand apologies.

137
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,810
I will track some down for you straight away.

138
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,510
- You wouldn't mind? - Mind? Please.

139
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,490
There is no greater joy

140
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,500
than fetching something I've never heard of

141
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,410
for someone I've only just met.

142
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,290
May I help you with something?

143
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,370
No, I'm just -- I'm waiting for someone.

144
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,210
And his name is David Beckham.

145
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,870
Resident at The Prescott.

146
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,050
Okay, Mitchell hates it when I do this,

147
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,450
but every time I meet a celebrity,

148
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,740
I ask them to record my outgoing message.

149
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,360
My current one is from when I saw Snoop Dogg at a bank.

151
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,770
Sorry I missed you. As you can see --

152
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm busy!

153
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,230
And sometimes things can --

154
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,340
Get away from me!

155
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,230
Please leave a message, including your phone number,

156
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,800
just for -- ?Security!

157
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,280
Hey, sweetie, what's up? I'm -- I'm kind of busy.

158
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,990
Cam, I'm hurt. It's my leg.

159
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,660
What?

160
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,120
I slipped in the food court,

161
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,820
and I'm all sticky and tweens are laughing at me.

162
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,000
You have to come pick me up.

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Well, that sounds awful, but --

164
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,960
Isn't -- Isn't Claire closer?

165
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,950
Well, you're at the farmers market right down the street.

166
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,320
Okay, fine. I'm on my way.

167
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,400
Aww, you're the best.

168
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,540
I was not gonna let Cam ruin my chance

169
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,950
to thank my wallpaper, Victoria Beckham, one-on-one.

170
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,600
Okay, so, it was 1997.

171
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,710
I was in Detroit for a Spice Girls concert with my girlfriend.

172
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,640
I was going to propose to her,

173
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,770
had the ring in my pocket and everything,

174
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,380
when from the stage, Posh looked right at me and said,

176
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,300
"Be true to yourself, Mitchell!"

177
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,620
Okay, you know, she might've said "Michigan,"

178
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,530
but she was looking right at me!

179
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,750
She inspired me to come out that night.

180
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,930
I had that diamond reset as an anklet charm,

181
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,170
and I was off to the races.

182
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,930
What kind of gym bag is that, anyway?

183
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,330
It's a satchel, you ignorant sneeze.

184
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,150
You have been so unpleasant lately.

185
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,990
On a definitely related note,

186
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,070
Manny hasn't gotten any action in months.

187
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,010
Well, other than whatever gave him carpal tunnel.

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,530
Luckily, The Prescott has an '80s aerobi-cise class,

189
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,930
which will be full of single older ladies.

190
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,450
Women hit a sweet spot right after 40

191
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,720
where they still look great

192
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,700
but their standards have lowered.

193
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,910
You're in pretty good shape for someone who's...

194
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,560
42? 43?

195
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,780
I'm 38.

196
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,190
Bye.

197
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,580
Higgins.

198
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,750
Oh, Mr. Beckham. Apologies.

200
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
Blind as a bat without these bad boys.

201
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,900
So, myself and Courteney are expecting a bowling instructor.

203
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,510
Would you have him meet us

204
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,470
downstairs at the bowling alley, please?

205
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,500
You and Ms. Cox getting an edge

206
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,090
for this weekend's celebrity bowl-a-thon?

207
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,140
Oh, we'll need it.

208
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,150
You should've seen the way he bowled last year.

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,360
I mean, it is to raise money for charity.

210
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,770
Yeah, a dollar for each of the 18 pins that you knocked down.

211
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,500
Thanks to you, Doctors Without Borders

212
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,700
are now Doctors Without Malaria Pills.

213
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,130
A bit harsh.

214
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,820
Did you see the two friends in the back?

215
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,010
The blond one liked me, and the brunette kept staring at you.

216
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,890
Can you blame her?

217
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,020
No one moves to "Caribbean Queen" Like me.

218
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,950
Ah, just who I was told to be on the lookout for.

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,140
A certain couple have asked

220
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,650
that you meet them in the bowling alley.

221
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,000
Was it a blonde and a brunette?

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,350
Indeed, and they seemed eager to get rolling.

223
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
Bowling alley?

224
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,380
These girls are freaky.

225
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,940
Hair salon?

226
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,880
- Just off the courtyard to your right. - Thank you.

227
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,870
I've always wanted to dye my hair dark.

228
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,050
But there's only one colorist I would trust to do it --

229
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,260
Adolfo of Venice.

230
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,540
Gloria's sworn enemy.

231
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
I just have to sneak back in and do it without her knowing.

232
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,990
Hi, Mom.

233
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,650
Hi, Alex. Hey, honey.

234
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,970
So, how's the project going?

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm never gonna make this deadline.

236
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,430
Oh, yeah, no, that -- that -- that's tough...

237
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,170
I'm sorry -- sorry to hear that.

238
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,660
Work is so stressful.

239
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,410
Yeah, got to go, love you! Bye!

240
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,830
The pool?

241
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,850
Just hop on the elevator

242
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,310
and press the big button marked "Pool."

243
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,530
I am known as the fearless one of the family.

244
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,520
So, when Claire gave us all free passes

245
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,060
for the Fun Town Water Park next week,

246
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,190
I couldn't admit that I am afraid of slides.

247
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,950
They go so fast, I feel like I'm going to fly off.

248
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,320
I just need to try it once and I am going to be fine.

249
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,250
I cannot do it!

250
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,010
Hey, no backsies!

251
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,140
Okay, here I go!

252
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,260
You should have let me do backsies!

253
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,370
Resident ID access -- hair salon.

254
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,190
What? Who's using my code?!

255
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,010
You a-look like that a-actress...

256
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,780
Audrey Hepburn.

257
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,100
This is Phil Dunphy. Leave a message.

258
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,970
Phil, I have a little surprise for you later.

259
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,420
Let's just say I know how much you love brunettes.

260
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,130
- Here's a menu for you. ?- Thank you.

261
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,400
And for my followers...

262
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,260
an Instagram tease.

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,090
Your Sugar Babies, sir.

264
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,350
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

265
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,540
On the contrary.

266
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,400
There was a Mexican birthday celebration

267
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,550
taking place in the park across the street.

268
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,500
I waited for the crack of the pinata,

269
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,250
mixed in seamlessly with the children,

270
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,480
and pounced.

271
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,040
He's here?!

272
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,250
Some moron food blogger took a shot

273
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,590
at one of my favorite spots.

274
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,580
So I go after him using my screen name, "Closet Outlaw."

275
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,360
It escalates, and he turns his army of followers against me.

276
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,010
As I wrote in my last comment --

277
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,330
"Let's see how well my fist pairs with your face."

278
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,770
The bowling alley?!

279
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,070
Alex is here?!

280
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,780
If she sees us, she'll throw us out.

281
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,060
Excuse me.

282
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,590
If that blonde and brunette come by,

283
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,330
could you tell them there's a new meet-up spot?

284
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
The hot tubs on the rooftop.

285
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,350
Of course, warm things up a bit before your workout.

286
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,660
If there's nothing else, I need to make sure

287
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,610
these balls are marked with their correct weights.

288
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,260
Size 10 for him

289
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,480
and anything with a steel toe for me.

290
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,260
Someone drops his ball a lot.

291
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,390
There has been a change of plan.

292
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
Your bowling instructor would now like you to meet him

293
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,060
in the hot tubs for a warmup first.

294
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,550
- Meet you up there? - ?Yep.

295
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,960
If you're calling the charity for a new partner,

296
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,060
it's not gonna work.

297
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,590
They already made the posters.

298
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,670
- Ready to order? - ?Very.

299
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,860
I came to this restaurant for one thing and one thing only.

300
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,530
And that thing is...?

301
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,530
Sorry. Uh, one of your world fa--

302
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,670
One of our world's fattest hot dogs coming up.

303
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,040
No! The-the slider.

304
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,780
And how would you like it?

305
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,540
Me...

306
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,580
- Yes, you, sir. ?- ...dium rare.

307
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,470
And can you have it delivered to the pool, please?

308
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,460
Of course.

309
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,280
Okay, that slider goes to the pool,

310
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
and it looks like we need one for Mr. Beckham to the roof.

311
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,420
You seen a guy in a black hoodie?

312
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,590
- Just left. - ?Thanks.

313
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,600
Oh, I'll be back.

314
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,910
I'm dying to try one of your world's fattest hot dogs.

315
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,940
Hey, you here at the mall?

316
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,080
No, not yet. Why are you breathing so hard?

317
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Oh, um, a bunch of kids were vaping next to me,

318
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,800
and I had to army-crawl into a-a candle store.

319
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,800
Yeah. Is there anything you want while I'm here?

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Can I tell you what I want, what I really, really want?

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
You're watching me right now, aren't you?

323
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,400
Cam, okay, look.

324
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,240
I was hoping I'd run into Posh

325
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,580
here at the gym for a private moment, okay?

326
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,420
Look, we're both after the Beckhams.

327
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's come up with a plan together --

328
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,380
meet me at the swim-up bar.

329
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,690
There's a swim-up bar?!

330
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,470
I know, we should be living here

331
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,590
and Alex should be living in our stupid house.

332
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,420
Higgins, I need you!

333
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,850
Where are you?!

334
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,130
A spot of bother, I see?

335
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,560
I can't do it!

336
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, of course you can.

337
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
I'll just crawl in front of you

338
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,420
so you can grab me around the waist.

339
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,550
I apologize in advance for any giggling.

340
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,480
I'm cursed with the tickle gene.

341
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,810
What's going on?

342
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,870
Someone's stuck on the slide.

343
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,570
She tried to climb back down, but --

344
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,100
- No backsies, I get it. - Yeah.

345
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,640
Oh, oh, oh! That's for me.

346
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,470
Thank you.

347
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,600
- But it goes too fast! - Oh, no, don't worry.

348
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I shall vary the flex of my buttocks to control our speed.

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,660
We should be --

350
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,790
No!

351
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,580
My deepest apologies!

352
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,030
Oh, no!

353
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,580
Okay.

354
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,680
Noooo!!

355
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,690
That one's sorted.

356
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,230
I need some sparkling water sent up to the hot tub cabanas.

357
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,100
Can't say for whom,

358
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,840
but let's include a glass of champagne

359
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,480
in case his posh wife joins him.

360
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,960
Easy.

361
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,080
Easy.

362
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,100
Come on!

363
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,120
Higgins!

364
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,290
Um, listen...

365
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,510
I need your help getting my hands on the slider.

366
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,400
The slider?

367
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,910
Oh, of course.

368
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,390
Quite a looker, that one.

369
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,560
Well, that's the problem -- so far,

370
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,340
I've only been able to look and not taste.

371
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,150
Say no more. I shall find a way to deliver the slider to you.

372
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,000
Great! Um, is there somewhere private

373
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,580
where I could enjoy the slider alone?

374
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,140
Might I suggest one of our rooftop hot tubs

375
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,000
overlooking the city?

376
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,270
Perfect, I'll wait there.

377
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,440
And I'll-I'll need a bib -- I can make a mess.

378
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,580
Still crisp.

379
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,720
He's close.

380
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,480
How'd I get back here?

381
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,190
Ah, Posh.

382
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,610
Thank you.

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,540
Your husband has asked that you meet him

384
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,950
up in one of the rooftop hot tubs for some champagne.

385
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,250
Phil.

386
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,230
Higgins! The slides aren't the enemy.

387
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,390
Fear is.

388
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,820
It's always a thrill to see one of my residents grow.

389
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,890
By the way, a certain mystery man

390
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,160
has spotted you around the building

391
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,180
and has requested your presence on the roof.

392
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,860
Jay's finally doing something romantic!

393
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,810
Just when I thought he was a clueless grouch.

394
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,520
How many lobbies does this place have?!

395
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,890
Excuse me. Where can I find a bathing suit?

396
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,880
Oh, there are complimentary suits in all of the cabanas.

397
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,080
?Worry not, I boil them myself nightly.

398
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,220
Let's see a robot do that.

399
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,640
Hi, Higgins. We have a bit of an unusual request.

400
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,310
Now, we know you need to be discreet, but...

401
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,540
we are hoping to have a rendezvous

402
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,420
with a certain distinguished Brit.

403
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,130
Consider it arranged.

404
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,170
- Okay. - ?Okay.

405
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,980
Still no sign of the ladies.

406
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,510
Maybe they're in a different cabana.

407
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,350
Mine's here.

408
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,540
Let's wait for the blonde.

409
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,430
I only know how to do this with even numbers.

410
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,470
Hello, Mr. Robot!

411
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,620
Can you tell me where to go for my romantic surprise?

412
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,920
Gloria?!

413
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,840
Now mine's here, but yours is gone.

414
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,540
Now they're both gone!

415
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,470
They'll be back.

416
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,320
Maybe one of them had a nanny emergency.

417
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,540
Let's wait for them in there.

418
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,600
Slider?

419
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,910
Arriving shortly. Cabana 3.

420
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,780
Thank you.

421
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,420
Here we are, then.

422
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,510
Higgins, what are you doing?!

423
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, role play.

424
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,190
I know I am but a lowly stable boy,

425
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,280
unwanted in the master's quarters, but --

426
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,010
Perhaps you'd like to teach me a lesson?

427
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,660
Just stay away from the face.

428
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,930
Uh, obviously there's been some sort of misunderstanding.

429
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,660
Yeah, do we look like the kind of people

430
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,860
that would be into some sort of weird role play

431
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,520
involving a stable boy?

432
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm assuming he's been naughty

433
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,550
and would do anything to keep his job.

434
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,650
Cam -- Cam?

435
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,240
In my defense, I do get this request quite often.

436
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,570
Particularly around the holidays.

438
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,730
Actually, um...

439
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,790
we were hoping to meet a certain celebrity couple.

440
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,830
Yeah. ?Say no more.

441
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,250
I make no promises, but let me just

442
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,920
wriggle back into my shorts and make some inquiries.

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,370
Ah, wonderful timing!

444
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,550
Please step into Cabana 3 -- your mystery man awaits.

445
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,350
Hi.

446
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,390
I know that you and I aren't supposed to be here,

447
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,780
but after today,

448
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,450
I am tired of living a life of fear.

449
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,700
Was Gloria Claire's brunette surprise?

450
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,480
It all started when Claire gave me a free pass to Fun Town.

451
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,160
I thought, just try it today.

452
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,930
Take a ride, see how it feels.

453
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,280
Oh. I never noticed how sexy your feet are.

454
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,320
Thank you, but this isn't happening, Gloria! ?

455
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,830
Oh, there you are. Sorry we missed you at the bowling alley.

456
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,620
She looked different with a headband on.

457
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,490
Warming up in a hot tub first --

458
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,010
unconventional, but, hey, anything to loosen up Becks.

459
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,210
Did we meet a Becky?

460
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,050
Maybe. There were so many of them.

461
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,960
So, how old is this Becks?

462
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,170
44.

463
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,090
It's on.

464
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Oh, there you are.

465
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,620
Wait... you're Becks?

466
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,190
Yep, and I'm eager to learn.

467
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,970
A warning -- my form is clumsy, but I'm great on my feet.

468
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,940
Okay, who gets the dude?

469
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,830
This never happened.

470
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,340
Fine, I'll take him.

471
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,750
But we're just gonna hang out and see where it goes.

472
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,140
Pardon the interruption.

473
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,880
It looks like you're finished with the slider?

474
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,280
I am, and can I be honest? I prefer bigger buns.

475
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,950
It's wonderful to just talk like men sometimes, isn't it?

476
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,830
It is.

477
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,290
Jay, what are you doing here?

478
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,570
I've spent the whole day looking for that miserable --

479
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,710
You're the Foodie in a Who-dy?!

480
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,020
W-Why would you say that?

481
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,200
Ketchup!

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,910
I'm trying, but I'm lost!

483
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,460
You insulted my mother!

484
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,010
Oh, my God. You're Close to Utlaw?!

485
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,630
It's Closet Outlaw!

486
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,850
Jay, I don't blame you for being mad.

487
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,260
I-I turned my legions of fans against you, and, uh...

488
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,740
it's Foodie in a Hoodie, by -- by the way.

489
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,770
But you got a bigger problem at home that I just heard about,

490
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,240
and I think I can help you with it.

491
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,190
- Claire? - ?Oh! Gloria.

492
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,710
I can't believe you recognized me.

493
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,660
I'm so sorry about my hair.

494
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,710
I'm so glad that we can finally talk about it.

495
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,390
Grow it out, let yourself be a girl.

496
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,420
Okay, final set of instructions

497
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,490
on a day that will no doubt be a memorable chapter

498
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,900
in my forthcoming memoir, "You Rang?"

499
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,100
You, Cabana 2.

500
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,150
You, Cabana 3.

501
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,910
You are romantic.

502
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,900
Honey, if you don't like my hair, I can change it.

503
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,050
What? I love it.

504
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,680
Maybe next week I can arrange

505
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,030
a little rendezvous with a redhead.

506
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,040
O-Okay.

507
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm glad we cleared that up.

508
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,300
I can't wait for my bowling lesson with you.

509
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,240
Oh, my God.

510
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,680
Foot-y in a Hoodie was here today.

511
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,340
Ah, you're great.

512
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,200
When does Posh get here?

513
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,790
And I apologize for being late.

514
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,400
You know, I-I left a message.

515
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,530
I'm sorry I missed your call.

516
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,910
Can you say that one more time?

517
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,680
So, I got a few incidental charges from yesterday.

518
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,390
Two hundred dollars for sugar babie procurement.

519
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,310
Sorry.

520
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,140
Eight sliders and one coconut water?

521
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,440
He charged me for that?

522
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,570
Three hundred dollars for a slide rescue.

523
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,940
Forty dollars fine for the non-wiping of stationary bike.

524
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,010
I barely sweat.

525
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,240
You are sweating right now.

526
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
A hundred and fifty dollars fine for the non-return of legwarmers.

527
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,200
And eight one hundred dollar west world entry fees?

528
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,430
Oh my God! We left Cam there.

529
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,120
Oh no!
