Central City Museum

363
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,927
is hosting a special
black tie event tonight

364
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,196
showcasing "The Crystal Ball."

365
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,065
It's a famous painting, apparently,

366
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,900
recently recovered from Markovia.

367
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,502
The painting is on loan to the museum

368
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,803
from the Silverberg family.

369
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,505
Jacob Silverberg himself said,

370
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,241
"The painting's safe
return means more to us

371
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:57,042
than all the money in the world.

372
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,944
It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it.

373
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,180
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

374
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,216
So the Turtle will make his move,

375
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,453
and we can be there
waiting to take him down.

376
