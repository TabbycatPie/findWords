We won't.

Listen to me.

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,721
To take our Jaeger,
they'll need to walk it.

39
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,975
And what are the odds
any two of these lowlifes can even drift?

And once we're in the conn-pod,

43
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,943
we'll show them
what we can do in the Drift.

44
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,824
Joel.

[sighs] What did I tell you
about channeling my mother?

53
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,266
Joel, you're not just tuning up
Shane's neural bridge here.

54
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,811
"It's a whole damn Jaeger, Joel."
"Bring your A game, Joel."

-That's right. Disappoint Shane on this…

…he'll end you.

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,692
Oh, no, no, no. No worries.

58
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,153
There's not another Drift tech
in the entire Black, and Shane knows it.

"Why, Joel, you're bulletproof."

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,909
One of those kids is a PPDC cadet.

Cadet?

62
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,621
You know what?

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,833
I should-- I should probably
go check that Jaeger out.

Old Mark 3, stripped to the bone.

No wonder the PPDC left it behind.

67
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,562
Get that thing up and walking.

68
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,856
Sure. Where's my copilot?

69
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,944
Uh, no.

I don't need his demons,
and he definitely doesn't need mine.

You're right.
It's a mess in there. [sighs]

-You know me better than anyone.
-Asked and answered.

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,420
My brother and I will drive it for you.
Wherever you want.

75
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,048
I'll send you some Riders.

There isn't a full hemisphere between 'em.

[gun cocks]

183
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,775
Only one person makes the deals in Bogan,

184
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,984
and it ain't you.

185
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,612
[Mia] I'll pilot.

186
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,700
But I want someone
who has actual Drift training.

187
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,787
Him? He's in no shape
after our little meeting of the minds.

188
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,248
I know what shape that is.

189
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,002
Take him.

190
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,714
No. Taylor can't go through another Drift.

191
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,590
Let me do it.

192
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,926
I'm doing you a favor, princess.

193
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,970
My mind's not a fun place to be.

194
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,305
[Hayley] No. T--

195
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,437
Mei, take that Jaeger straight
to our next camp at the old coal burner.

196
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,108
Bogan needs to get through the fields
before the Kaiju reaches us. Let's roll!

00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,464
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

[Loa]<i> Welcome back, Cadet Taylor.</i>

201
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,601

<i>-Mei.</i>
<i>-I issue this caution, Cadet Mei.</i>

<i>-Don't worry about me.</i>
<i>-Suit us up, Loa. Copperhead's on his way.</i>

[Loa] <i>Affirmative.</i>

00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
Wait. You've never been in a Jaeger?

209
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,339
Don't worry. I got this.

[Loa] <i>Cadet Taylor, your brain waves</i>

00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,146
I'm fine. Just hurry.

213
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>Affirmative. Initiating neural handshake.</i>

00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>Right hemisphere, check.</i>

215

<i>Left hemisphere…</i>

<i>Warning. Pilot-to-pilot connection</i>

217
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,253
Mei? You can't hold anything back in here.

218
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,755
[Loa] <i>Drift requires</i>
<i>complete mental access.</i>

220
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,513
I don't give a crap what's in your past.
We have to do this together.

What you've been through… I'm so sorry.

237
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,705
Shove your pity. We wouldn't be here
if you'd killed that Kaiju.

Pick up your legs. We have to run.

00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
I knew it.

243
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,857
Those emotions are not yours, Cadet.

They're mine.

245
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,944

Don't we?

258
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,685
Yes. But not now.

How many years have I wasted on you, huh?

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,035
Have you learned nothing?

326
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,579
You don't start a fight you can't finish.

327
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,292
Do you even know what
your half-cocked decisions have cost me?

328
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,085
Take a look at my only Drift tech.

329
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,588
Looks the same to me.

330
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,632
Six hundred mines.

331
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,718
Half my damn arsenal, wasted.

332
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,555
And you crippled
the only Jaeger in the goddamn Black.

333
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,559
I should've left you
on the streets where I found you.

334
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,314
And you know what you'd be right now?
The things they'd have you doing?

335
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,234
-[Taylor] I did it.
-[gasps]

336
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,613
Did what?

337
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,783
I turned to fight. She had to follow.

338
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,623
That's all I needed to hear.

339
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,917
Leave him alone!

340
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,377
Shane, stop.

341
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,214
-What did you say?
-I put him into that rig.

342
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,632
He was in no shape.

343
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,012
[chuckles]
You know why she's sticking up for you?

344
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,974
Because she thinks you're special.
But you're not.

345
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:35,145
The Black purged every weak remainder
like you in the first month.

346
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,732
So… might as well finish the job then, eh?

347
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,900
No!

348
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,156
Maybe it'd be more humane
to do all three of you.

349
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,324
[chuckles]

350
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:51,495
Please. Just let us go. We'll leave.

351
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,497
[Mei] Shane.

352
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,499
They came to us for help.

353
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,336
You ripped into this kid's mind
and took everything they had.

354
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,672
Now it got you what you wanted, a Jaeger.

355
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:08,303
We'll fix it, weaponize it, and you'll be
the most powerful man in the Black.

356

Either they're walking outta here…

or I am.

358
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,610

are still here at sunup,

359
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,362

360
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,451
