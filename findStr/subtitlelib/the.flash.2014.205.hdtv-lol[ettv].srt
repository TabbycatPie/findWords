1
00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:01,961
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,963 --> 00:00:04,730
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:08,738
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,775
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:15,378
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,280
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:20,650
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:24,020
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:26,122
I am The Flash!

10
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,059
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,360
I get a vision of something
that's already happened,

12
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:32,829
and then it's gone.

13
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,330
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

14
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,865
When you created the Singularity

15
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,602
above Central City, you
also created a breach

16
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,237
between my world and yours,
connecting our two earths.

17
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,974
52 breaches in Central
City and the biggest one

18
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,775
just happens to be
in our basement.

19
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,677
The person who broke into
my facility last night

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,279
was Harrison Wells.

21
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,616
Hey, put him down!

22
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,120
Who the hell are you?

23
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:01,519
Hello.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,743
EARTH TWO

25
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:04,260
For those of you
who don't know me,

26
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:06,329
my name is Harrison Wells.

27
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,174
We know you.

28
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:08,673
8 MONTHS AGO

29
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:12,068
Today, the future has arrived.

30
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,071
Our city has seen incredible...

31
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:18,808
impossible things: meta-humans...
men and women...

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,610
with extraordinary abilities:

33
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,912
the ability to soar
above buildings,

34
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:26,816
to run faster than
the speed of light.

35
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,252
Unfortunately, most
of these meta-humans

36
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:32,689
have chosen the wrong path with
these powers, a dark path.

37
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,759
My team and I at S.T.A.R.
Labs are committed

38
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,594
to keeping up with
these perilous times,

39
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,830
and so may I present
to you our new line

40
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,666
of meta-human awareness apps?

41
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,095
NEXT GEN TABLET
S.T.A.R. LABORATORIES

42
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:54,277
This technology will allow
you to instantly detect

43
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,979
the presence of a meta-human.

44
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,148
You'll be instantly alerted
to an approaching speedster,

45
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,448
like Zoom or like...

46
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,490
Flash.

47
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,130
Welcome, Flash.

48
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:15,965
Tell them the truth, Dr. Wells.

49
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,267
Everything that has happened to
this city the past two years

50
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,669
is because of you.

51
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,304
You created all of us metas.

52
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,673
You created Zoom.

53
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,141
I created Zoom?

54
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,976
11 hours before the
first meta sighting,

55
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,112
enormous blasts of
dark matter radiation

56
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:31,114
were silently expelled
beneath this lab.

57
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,549
I'm sorry, Flash, I believe
all this fast running

58
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,984
may have scrambled your brain.

59
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,453
You take no responsibility
for the wreckage

60
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,022
your mistakes have caused.

61
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,858
Admit it, Wells, and
then maybe you can truly

62
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,060
help me do something about it.

63
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:47,147
Help you, because I'm the greatest
tech entrepreneur of all time?

64
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:49,032
You're the superhero,

65
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,967
and we would all be safe

66
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,704
if you would just do
your job and stop Zoom.

67
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:05,414
Well, I guess it's safe to say
the speedster sensors work.

68
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,919
- You okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, sweetie.

69
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,788
Now where was I?

70
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,591
Oh, that's right, the future.

71
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,377
<font color=#FFFFB0>www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-</font>

72
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,637
Very strange to be holding
your autobiography,

73
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,572
especially when you
didn't write it

74
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:31,207
and it's not about you.

75
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,679
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells

76
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,381
from Earth-2.

77
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:41,584
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:44,587
So let me get this straight.

79
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:48,391
You're the doppelganger of
the man who murdered his mom

80
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,794
and is responsible
for both Ronnie

81
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,295
and Eddie's deaths?

82
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:53,462
Yeah, but he's not
even the doppelganger

83
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,231
of the Dr. Wells that we knew

84
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,766
because that Dr. Wells'
body had been taken over

85
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,169
by the Reverse Flash, who
was really Eobard Thawne

86
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,873
and Eddie's distant
relative from the future.

87
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,875
Yeah, I didn't follow any of that.
I'm my own man.

88
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,143
I had nothing to
do with the murder

89
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,477
of your mother or
your friend Ricky.

90
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,346
- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

91
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,916
You told me you have
proof of your identity?

92
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:16,219
This almost hit me when I
went through the portal.

93
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,154
Your stabilized breach
downstairs connects directly

94
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,190
to the S.T.A.R.
Labs on my Earth.

95
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,557
Technically, this could be mine,

96
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,693
but I want to run
some tests on you.

97
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,128
I'll be genetically
indistinguishable

98
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,262
from my Earth-1 counterpart.

99
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,697
Your tests will reveal nothing.

100
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,932
Great! Still gonna run 'em.

101
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,200
Be my guest.

102
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,901
Why are we even
listening to him?

103
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,669
How do we know he's not
evil like the other guy?

104
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,205
He saved my life last night.

105
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,973
The question is why.

106
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,674
I'm guessing you didn't
travel between dimensions

107
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:39,909
just to meet The Flash.

108
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,577
That's exactly what I did.

109
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,647
I came here to help you, Barry,
to stop your greatest enemy.

110
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,015
He already did that.

111
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm not talking about
Reverse Flash.

112
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,153
I'm talking about Zoom.

113
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,554
I see you've already
heard of him.

114
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:54,057
Yeah, Zoom has been
sending meta-humans

115
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,592
from your world through
the breaches to fight me.

116
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:59,095
Well, they're the symptoms.

117
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,930
Zoom's the plague,

118
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,499
one that's infected my world,
and now he's coming for yours.

119
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,633
What do you know about Zoom?

120
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,870
Everything.

121
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:10,173
I created Zoom.

122
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,742
I'm responsible for all
the Earth-2 meta-humans,

123
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,177
a fact I've ignored
for far too long,

124
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:18,181
but now I'm doing
something about it.

125
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,416
Yeah, well, we're
batting a thousand

126
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,352
against these breachers.

127
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,553
You're batting a
thousand, Cisco?

128
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,222
What's your sample size?

129
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,958
Ten? Less?

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,161
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

131
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:34,497
He will never allow there
to be another speedster

132
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,099
in the multiverse, and
he's gonna keep sending

133
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,801
these metas here,
one after the next,

134
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,270
all with the same goal:

135
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,172
to kill The Flash unless
we stop him together.

136
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,708
Last time we listened to
a guy with your face,

137
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,777
some bad things went down.

138
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,813
We lost people we cared about.

139
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,416
Everyone loses someone
they care about, Snow.

140
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,451
The real test of
character is what you do

141
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:57,653
once they're gone.

142
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,439
Joe! Put the gun down!

143
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,841
How is he still alive?
How are you still alive?

144
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,910
I don't know,
because you missed?

145
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,611
Hey, I'm trying to keep
him from shooting you.

146
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,014
You're not helping. Let's
take a walk, all right?

147
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,283
It's all good.

148
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,285
We know someone who
can verify everything

149
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,687
that this guy just said.

150
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,090
Be careful.

151
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,391
I don't suppose you
have a Big Belly Burger

152
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,260
in this universe, do you?

153
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,661
This isn't happening.

154
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:41,064
I know that this is
a lot to take in,

155
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,299
but that guy back in that
room, that's not Wells.

156
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,735
Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

157
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,604
What? Why didn't
you tell me this?

158
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,139
Because I didn't believe her.

159
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,474
I didn't even want to
consider Wells was alive.

160
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,143
Eddie erased that
Wells from existence.

161
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:57,580
This guy is...
he's someone else,

162
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:59,915
and he says he's here
to help us stop Zoom.

163
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,050
How can you even look at him?

164
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,818
You think this is easy for me?

165
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,122
The guy in there looks, moves,
sounds exactly like the guy

166
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,723
that drove a knife through
my mother's heart.

167
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:10,093
I have to resist the
urge to kill him.

168
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,561
I'm trying my best to
get past that, okay?

169
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,964
You shooting him...
that's not helping.

170
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,480
After all our losses,
I thought at least

171
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,884
we were free of Wells.

172
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:22,055
I just want one week where
we're not surprised

173
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,409
by somebody from our past.

174
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,198
I better go fill in Iris.

175
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,626
Good luck.

176
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,059
I hope you're happy, Linda.

177
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,057
Tanner's lawyers are
threatening to sue us.

178
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,492
I'm sorry, Chief.

179
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:39,294
I don't care how many
touchdowns Tanner throws.

180
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm not interviewing some roided
out jerk who hit his wife

181
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:43,664
unless it's to hold
him accountable

182
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,101
for domestic violence.

183
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,902
All right, run your story, Park.

184
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:51,072
The sports page used to be
a lot less complicated.

185
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,940
She shoots.

186
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,809
She scores.

187
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,245
Larkin's the best editor
I've ever worked for.

188
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,846
It's just, every
once in a while,

189
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,315
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

190
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,858
But that's not really him,

191
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,194
the Wells who Eddie
gave his life to stop?

192
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,596
Apparently not.

193
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:20,701
That's life in Central
City these days, right?

194
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:23,671
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine, really.

195
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,141
Good.

196
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,308
I want to keep you that way.

197
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,511
- Dad.
- Take it.

198
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,246
I taught you how to
use it for a reason.

199
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:33,114
And I'm praying
that Barry's right

200
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:34,516
and this Wells means us no harm.

201
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,051
Last year, you had Eddie
to look out for you,

202
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:40,555
but now, you can't
murder somebody

203
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:44,659
that everybody thinks
is dead, right?

204
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,794
Put it away.

205
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,999
You do realize that when I said

206
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:54,169
I wanted a drink, I didn't
mean a latte, right?

207
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,570
I was talking about alcohol.

208
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,305
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

209
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,774
All right, look, you got
give him a chance, okay?

210
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,509
He's not a speedster.

211
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:05,913
He's just a regular, normal
guy from another universe.

212
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,649
I never thought I'd
miss time travel.

213
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:09,850
Time travel?

214
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:11,819
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi!

215
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,722
Is there a meta-human
who can time travel?

216
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,857
Time... no. Time
travel's not real.

217
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,159
'Cause that would
be pretty cool!

218
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:20,495
Not so sure about that.

219
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:22,797
Patty, you know
Cisco Ramon, right?

220
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,932
Yeah, you're the scientific
advisor on meta-humans

221
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,201
to the CCPD, right?

222
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,902
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

223
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:29,904
Hey, Barr, did you hear I
was right about King Shark?

224
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:32,340
King Shark? Nice name.
I like her.

225
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,975
Yeah, yeah, King Shark
almost ate The Flash.

226
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,843
Oh, nah, I'm sure The
Flash had it handled.

227
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,778
Oh, no, I was there.
I saw it all.

228
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,547
Some hooded guy saved his life.

229
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,682
Wait, and you're not, like,
traumatized or anything?

230
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,018
I just watched a
half man-half shark

231
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,820
take on the fastest man alive.

232
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:48,356
I love this city.

233
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,126
See... sorry.

234
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,860
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

235
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:56,231
He wants me to write
my police report.

236
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,199
Uh, you maybe want
to write it with me?

237
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,302
Uh, I can't tonight. I'm busy.
Um, yeah, sorry.

238
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,604
Oh, yeah, okay.

239
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,405
I've just got science stuff.

240
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:07,308
Stuff I gotta science
the stuff out of.

241
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,909
Maybe next time.

242
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:12,280
- Yeah! Coolio.
- Yeah.

243
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,249
But I'm gonna actually
skip the coffee

244
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,850
and go get a head start, so...

245
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,452
Good to see you guys.

246
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:19,854
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

247
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,456
- For real?
- Stop, all right?

248
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,758
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark

249
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,493
tried to eat me, and then Dr.
Wells the sequel showed up.

250
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,195
Okay, can we not use the name "Dr.
Wells"?

251
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,796
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

252
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,365
Okay. Harry, yeah.

253
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,167
Listen, there's always
gonna be Harrys out there,

254
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,734
but you can't let the
Harrys of the world

255
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,603
get in the way of you
living your life.

256
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,071
Ask Patty out.

257
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:38,906
You gotta... you gotta be bold.

258
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,441
That's tough talk.

259
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:44,812
When was the last time you
asked a girl for her number?

260
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,447
Watch and learn.

261
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,683
I'm watching.

262
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,419
Hi. What can I get you?

263
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:54,822
- Hi, there.
- Hi... again.

264
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:00,861
Do you want some coffee?

265
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:02,096
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.

266
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,199
No, uh, no, I don't want coffee.

267
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,667
You know what I do want though?

268
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,168
I want to ask you this.

269
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,037
Do you want to go out with me?

270
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:17,378
To... we... I mean, we could
go get coffee or we...

271
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,048
No.

272
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,084
That's a no.

273
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:26,020
That's totally cool. It's cool.

274
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:27,388
Respect.

275
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,718
Yo, dude, you good?
It's her loss.

276
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,854
Hey, what's up?

277
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:01,222
We have another breach.

278
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,557
What? How do you know?

279
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,259
Central City Bank.
You gotta go now!

280
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:05,260
All right.

281
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:17,970
You got my attention.

282
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,772
Flash.

283
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:36,555
Her name is Doctor Light.

284
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,791
Small-time thief on my
Earth until exposure

285
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,926
to the dark matter from
the Particle Accelerator

286
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,828
and became a meta-human
with the ability

287
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,030
to derive power from starlight.

288
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,565
Oh, very cool.

289
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,334
Stars having a temperature
of 5,300 degree kelvin

290
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,669
and a blinding
luminosity, I would say,

291
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,204
"Not very cool at all."

292
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,006
You know, our Dr. Wells
may have been evil,

293
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,574
but you're just a dick.

294
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,511
Okay, so obviously,
Zoom brought her here

295
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,145
from your Earth like the others.

296
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,214
Now that we know that,

297
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,782
we can use that to
gain advantage.

298
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,417
What do you mean?

299
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:10,122
We capture Doctor Light and
use her to lure Zoom here.

300
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,657
You are insane!

301
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,826
Okay, we are not
luring Zoom anywhere!

302
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,093
Apparently, they
know each other,

303
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,562
and Jay is not a fan.

304
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,097
Well, well, well.

305
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,001
Like everyone else, I assumed
Earth-2 Flash was dead.

306
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:24,003
Why am I not surprised to
find Jay Garrick here,

307
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:28,140
still alive and in hiding a
full universe away from Zoom?

308
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,608
I'm not in hiding.

309
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,545
Zoom nearly killed me
and stole my speed

310
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,246
before the Singularity
pulled me here.

311
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,748
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

312
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,150
Well, whatever the
case, in your absence,

313
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:41,754
Zoom has only gotten
more powerful, faster.

314
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:44,723
Barry, you have to defeat
Zoom now while you still can.

315
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,525
No, this isn't the
time to be reckless.

316
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,393
We don't even know why Zoom
sent Doctor Light here.

317
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,128
She's a thief, not a killer.

318
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,897
Zoom can make people do
things out of character.

319
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,666
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

320
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,100
All right, look, hey,

321
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,235
we can decide what to
do with Light later.

322
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,772
First, we have to
find her, okay?

323
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,211
Hey, how did you know

324
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,113
that she was breaking
into the bank?

325
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,050
I got an alert on my phone.

326
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,052
There's a little ring-a-ding

327
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,352
every time, like, there's
a robbery at a bank.

328
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,921
- What?
- But you know what?

329
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,823
I think I can get the S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite

330
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,192
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

331
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,528
and we can find
Doctor Light's light.

332
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,866
Okay, I'm gonna also call Joe,
see if CCPD has any leads.

333
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,703
Why don't we keep them
apart until I get back?

334
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:33,305
I am sure that won't
be a problem.

335
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:39,579
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

336
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,550
- Hey!
- Hey.

337
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,219
How's your science stuff?

338
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,420
I finished it.

339
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,022
Um, did you get
your report done?

340
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,027
It wasn't as much fun writing
it by myself, but...

342
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,261
I'll see ya.

343
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,097
Yeah.

344
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:02,501
Hey, do you ever feel
completely overwhelmed

345
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:03,769
by everything that you
have to do in a day

346
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,403
and it feels like the one thing

347
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,406
that you actually want to do
is the thing that gets lost?

348
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,075
I'm confused. What?

349
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,712
I've been thinking, for
a while now actually,

350
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,514
would you want to get
dinner with me sometime?

351
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,983
Yeah, this isn't gonna
be one those things

352
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,653
where I get really excited
and then, you know,

353
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,154
more science stuff
comes up, right?

354
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,257
No, no, that's not...
um, tomorrow?

355
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,759
We can grab an early dinner.

356
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,361
I don't want to wait anymore.

357
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:33,799
Okay. Looking forward to it.

358
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:43,155
DR. WELLS LEAVES CENTRAL
CITY IN BLACK HOLE

359
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,919
S.T.A.R. LABS DISASTER
ONE MONTH LATER

360
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,580
WELLS CONFESSES TO NORA
ALLEN MURDER POST MORTUM

361
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,182
Hey, Harry.

362
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,250
Hey, over here.

363
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,619
Hey!

364
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,856
Come inside. Use my workroom.
Use my computer!

365
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,758
- I don't care!
- Thanks.

366
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,660
You and Wells prime have very
different musical tastes.

367
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,095
His were better.

368
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:06,264
This Harrison Wells and
I are very different

369
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,700
but similar in some respects.

370
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:09,768
I see he made almost
the same mistake I did

371
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,170
with the Particle Accelerator.

372
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:12,771
He did a lot of terrible things,

373
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,107
and none of them
were by mistake.

374
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,143
What did he do to you?

375
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,745
I know he caused
the Singularity,

376
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,814
murdered Barry's mother,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

377
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,281
What did he do to you?

378
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,283
You can barely look
me in the eye.

379
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,086
Why is that? What
did he do to you?

380
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:30,322
He shoved his hand
through my chest.

381
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,489
He stopped my heart.

382
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,294
Okay, that would do it,

383
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,797
but you survived that.

384
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,367
Only because Barry
erased that timeline.

385
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,703
I see. Barry traveled in time.

386
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:49,141
Twice.

387
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,409
- Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

388
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,011
You don't have to like me.

389
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,679
I don't like you,

390
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,016
but you have to work with me
to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.

391
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,753
Can you do that?

392
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,054
I guess we'll see, won't we?

393
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,989
I guess we will.

394
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,991
One more thing...

395
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,392
you said you were
going to re-task

396
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,194
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

397
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,496
To scan for solar emissions,
yeah, we're up and running.

398
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,697
I'd like to examine
your program.

399
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,032
I want to see if it works.

400
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,201
Don't worry. It'll work.

401
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,244
Harry's starting to
get on my nerves.

402
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:27,679
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

403
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:30,048
- That's gotta be Doctor Light.
- Could be a trap.

404
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,017
Barry, trust me, Doctor
Light is not a killer.

405
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,820
- You can talk to her.
- Okay.

406
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,867
Looking for this?

407
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,869
I know Zoom sent you
here to kill me.

408
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,671
Good news, you don't
have to do that.

409
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,273
Not if I can get out of
town with that cash.

410
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,874
And then what?

411
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,742
Zoom's not gonna like that
you ditched him, right?

412
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,511
My friends and I can help you.

413
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,614
Nobody can protect me from Zoom!

414
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:03,849
All right, why don't
we take it down

415
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,451
a lumen, have a
normal conversation,

416
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,787
all right?

417
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,522
Thank you.

418
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,459
Linda?

419
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,229
- Linda Park?
- How do you know my name?

420
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,231
I don't understand.

421
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,234
This was a mistake.

422
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,207
Barry, what's happening?

423
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,476
I can't see. Guys, I can't see.

424
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,792
I still can't see.

425
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:39,327
How long is this gonna last?

426
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,229
You're suffering from
solar retinopathy.

427
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:43,298
Your retinas are
severely damaged.

428
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,866
You're lucky you're not
permanently blind.

429
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,868
But with your rapid
regeneration abilities,

430
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,103
your sight should return soon.

431
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,904
6.25 hours by my estimation.

432
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,739
All this could have been avoided
if you just stopped Light

433
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,308
instead of
chitchatting with her.

434
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,809
She caught Barry off guard.

435
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,744
Always an excuse
with you, right?

436
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:58,779
He's the fastest man alive. How
could she possibly do that?

437
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:01,116
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend,

438
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:03,118
Linda Park.

439
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,753
That's why Zoom sent her...
because he knew you'd hesitate.

440
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,588
That means Zoom had
to have known somehow

441
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,224
that Linda was your ex.

442
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:11,192
Which is why Barry
has to act now,

443
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,528
before Zoom sends another
double from Barry's life.

444
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,296
All right, right now, I'm
more worried about Linda.

445
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:18,599
When I saw who was under
the mask, I said her name.

446
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,335
What if Light didn't even
realize that she had

447
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:22,203
a doppelganger here until
I accidentally told her?

448
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,005
The first thing that
Atom Smasher did

449
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,307
when he crossed the breach was
to kill his doppelganger.

450
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,143
Yeah, but Light's not
like Atom Smasher.

451
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,844
We should keep an
eye on your Linda.

452
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,746
All right, I'll go.

453
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:32,914
Sorry.

454
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,115
- Bro.
- Barry!

455
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:36,284
- What?
- Okay, okay.

456
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,653
You can't do anything
until your sight returns.

457
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,423
No, no, no, come on, here's
the little rail here.

458
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:44,092
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you!

459
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:45,593
- Hey, Barry!
- Hey.

460
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:48,296
I came as soon as I heard...

461
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,165
You look just like him.

462
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,818
I'm guessing my counterpart did
something to offend her as well?

463
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:55,002
Her fiancé died because of him.

464
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,778
Iris, I know it's
weird seeing him.

465
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,813
Yeah, it's just a lot
to process lately.

466
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:08,149
Wells, my mother.

467
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,718
How are you doing with
that, by the way?

468
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,055
I mean, now that she's gone,

469
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:16,091
okay.

470
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:17,959
Yeah, Iris, um, look...

471
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,127
Yeah.

472
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:20,428
Thanks.

473
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,397
You know you can
talk to me about it.

474
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,433
Yeah, I know, but
really, I'm fine, okay?

475
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:27,168
I should be asking
how you're doing.

476
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,770
That's me. I got it.

477
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,606
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it.

478
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,774
All right.

479
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,578
Uh, "Running a little late. P."

480
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,512
Who's P?

481
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,747
P.

482
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,682
- That's Patty.
- My dad's partner Patty?

483
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,185
What is she running late for?

484
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:47,322
Um, our first date.

485
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:50,191
That's so great! She's great.

486
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:52,393
Yeah, no, Patty's great.
I just, you know...

487
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,061
I doubt she's gonna
give me another shot

488
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,263
when I have to cancel on her.

489
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:56,797
Don't cancel.

490
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,367
I'm blind, Iris. A
literal blind date.

491
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:00,435
It's not gonna work.

492
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:01,936
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs.

493
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,338
Come on, there's gotta
be something here

494
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,972
that can help you get
through the night.

495
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,108
Yeah.

496
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,844
Or someone.

497
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,749
Cisco, hey!

498
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,918
- To your left. Other left.
- Cisco.

499
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,193
Sorry.

500
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:29,797
Sorry.

501
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,876
Okay. She's two steps
in front of you.

502
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:36,322
- Nice glasses.
- Hey, hey!

503
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:38,717
- Touchdown.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

504
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:39,922
- I...
- No, don't be.

505
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,076
I... You know, I actually judge
my dates on whether or not

506
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:44,515
they stand me up, so you
are off to a great start.

507
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,266
What do you mean? Who
would stand you up?

508
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,516
I have a reputation.

509
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,586
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

510
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,588
That's embarrassing.

511
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,923
You know, I actually... I
arrested a boyfriend once.

512
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,294
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

513
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,297
He got really wasted and decided
to insult the waitress,

514
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,432
so I cited him for
public intoxication.

515
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,634
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah.

516
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,637
Special.

517
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,872
So...

518
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,374
Dude, she looks amazing.

519
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,210
You have to tell her
how amazing she looks.

520
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,312
You look amazing, Patty.

521
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:20,281
Uh, thanks, I actually
had a really hard time

522
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,083
trying to figure out
what to wear, like,

523
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,952
if I should wear a dress or if
this color was a little weird.

524
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:26,521
No, you look great.

525
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:30,625
Um, yeah, no, that... what
would you call that color?

526
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,827
I can't tell.

527
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,429
- The feed's black and white.
- I don't know.

528
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,731
Yeah, whatever it is, that
color should thank you

529
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,099
for wearing it.

530
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:39,900
My man.

531
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,670
- Smooth.
- Not smooth.

532
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:46,708
Oh, wine list. Here we go.

533
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,978
Uh, yes, uh, got it. Thank you.

534
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,749
Um, you know, why don't you...

535
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,317
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

536
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,152
The guy always picks.
Why don't you choose?

537
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:02,223
Yeah, what do you
want, red or white?

538
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,325
Whatever you'd like. Uh, yeah.

539
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,694
You got this. Why do
you even need me?

540
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:16,237
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

541
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,338
Classic stakeout fuel.

542
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,673
Yeah.

543
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,575
You have coffee on
your Earth, right?

544
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,977
I think coffee's the one
constant in the multiverse.

545
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:28,983
So I don't mean to pry, but
when Wells keeps referring

546
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:31,753
to you and Zoom, what's
he talking about?

547
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,588
I fought Zoom many times,

548
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,823
each time barely
escaping with my life.

549
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:39,661
So yeah.

550
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,696
Maybe I didn't always confront
him when I should have.

551
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,197
Truth is, Zoom scared me.

552
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:47,368
He stole the most precioushing
from me: my speed.

553
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,404
I didn't want Barry to
suffer the same fate.

554
00:23:49,406 --> 00:23:51,839
Well, maybe if you just
sat down with Wells,

555
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:53,341
talked to him about it...

556
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:55,343
No, no, no. Do not
trust Wells, Caitlin.

557
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:56,911
The guy was more than
happy to make money

558
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,780
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps,

559
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:00,682
and now he's obsessed with Zoom.

560
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,984
Something has changed and not
just because I disappeared.

561
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:09,590
Well, I don't trust Wells.
I trust you.

562
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:15,863
So I've actually been
dying to ask you,

563
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,198
what was it like to be
struck by lightning?

564
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,768
Life-changing, to be honest.

565
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,370
Did it hurt?

566
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:24,972
I mean, all I really remember
is feeling electricity

567
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:26,374
surging through my body.

568
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,443
It was an intensity
I had never felt,

569
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:33,047
like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.

570
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,216
Then I woke up from a
coma nine months later.

571
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:36,951
Waking up in the
future like that,

572
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,787
it's like time travel.

573
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,690
- Sort of, yeah.
- Yeah.

574
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:46,327
When I was nine, I
actually drowned.

575
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:47,928
I hit my head on
the diving board

576
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,597
and fell into the swimming pool.

577
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,633
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

578
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:55,403
until my dad rescued
me and saved my life.

579
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,771
Yeah.

580
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:59,774
So I guess we've
both cheated death.

581
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:03,177
I've been through a
few things in my life

582
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,346
that taught me not to
be afraid of anything.

583
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:06,981
I think fear is what
holds people back

584
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,049
from being who they should be.

585
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:11,352
Preach!

586
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,321
Yeah, I'm still here,
creepin' and peepin'.

587
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:15,790
You okay?

588
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:19,560
Sorry, I just... yeah, I
really agree with that.

589
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,429
Really?

590
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:26,901
I think another thing, too,
I think you can't see me.

591
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:29,604
- Abort!
- What? What do you mean?

592
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,439
I think you can't see me.

593
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:33,040
Come on, I would not
be a good detective

594
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,542
if I couldn't have
figured this one out.

595
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:37,478
I don't know.

596
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,381
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

597
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:43,851
I'm really sorry and embarrassed

598
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:45,252
I didn't say anything.

599
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,355
- I had my pupils dilated earlier.
- Barry.

600
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,057
- Oh, my God!
- Barry!

601
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,493
And I really didn't
want to cancel.

602
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:56,497
Barry! I lost my eyes!

603
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:59,867
No, you have a great smile.

604
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:02,503
Really, how do you
know I'm smiling?

605
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:03,638
Just a hunch.

606
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,510
Okay, so what else is
different about our worlds?

607
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:11,412
Do you have Tahiti?

608
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,881
Never been, but I
do love Atlantis.

609
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:15,817
As in the lost city submerged
in the ocean somewhere?

610
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:18,385
Well, it's actually above
water on my Earth.

611
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:19,821
One of my best friends
is from there.

612
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,221
I would love to see it.

613
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,724
It's special.

614
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,694
It's the kind of place
you never want to leave.

615
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:55,857
Hello, gorgeous.

616
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:57,558
- Everybody out, now!
- Go!

617
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,795
Go, go, go. Go, move, quick.

618
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:03,063
- Except you.
- I don't think so.

619
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,665
No, no, she's leaving with us.

620
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,668
- Not today.
- What do you want from me?

621
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,570
Your life.

622
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,060
Doctor Light.

623
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:19,516
Oh, no. Go.

624
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,637
I've never killed anyone before,

625
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,439
but it's not murder if
it'ur double, right?

626
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,941
Why are you doing this?

627
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,243
It's the only way that
I can stay alive.

628
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,778
To become you.

629
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,079
I'm sorry, Linda.

630
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:40,017
No!

631
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:47,158
- How is this possible?
- You couldn't understand.

632
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,227
Light!

633
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:50,594
Flash.

634
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:52,997
I thought I took
care of you outside.

635
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,609
Please don't let go. I may trip.

636
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:08,112
Okay, I won't. I promise.

637
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:10,848
- Two more steps.
- All right. Missed one.

638
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,484
There you go.

639
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:15,953
It's funny how we skipped

640
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,756
straight to the
hand-holding part.

641
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:21,759
Yes.

642
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:24,662
We, uh, have arrived
at my car, so...

643
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:32,403
Well, do you think we've reached
the good night kiss stage?

644
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:55,559
Um, this is burgundy,
by the way,

645
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,061
and you look great in it.

646
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,864
- Now you can see?
- Yeah, I can.

647
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:02,133
That must have been some kiss.

648
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:05,402
I guess so.

649
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,706
- Sorry.
- No, it's mine too.

650
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,774
Weird. Cisco, hey.

651
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:12,609
Sir?

652
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:19,083
I saw myself.

653
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:21,452
How is that even possible?

654
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,755
Sounds like you have
an evil meta-twin.

655
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:28,893
And now Larkin's dead

656
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:31,695
because someone who looks
like me wanted to kill me?

657
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:33,264
Linda, none of this
is your fault.

658
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,599
We're gonna figure it
all out, I promise.

659
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,268
How you doing?

660
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,938
I'm alive, thanks to Iris.

661
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,841
Turns out she's as badass with
a gun as she is with a pen.

662
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,309
Yeah, she is.

663
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,643
I'm just happy that you're safe.

664
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,212
I've arranged a security detail

665
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:49,680
around the clock,
just to be sure.

666
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:51,548
I can take you to
them if you're ready.

667
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,851
Yeah.

668
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,823
This is because of me.
I should've been here.

669
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:01,225
Barry, you were blind.

670
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:02,994
There's nothing that
you could have done.

671
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,162
You think this mask can
help us find that woman?

672
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,664
Any evidence on this is
just gonna match Linda.

673
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,566
I'll think in something else.

674
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,702
Light's not gonna kill again.

675
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:16,440
Caitlin, are you guys okay?

676
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:19,043
- Yeah.
- Barry, I'm sorry.

677
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:20,378
Doctor Light's never
killed before.

678
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,179
I thought we could
reason with her.

679
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:25,849
You cannot reason with someone
under Zoom's influence,

680
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:28,319
and now a man is dead
because of you, Garrick.

681
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:30,154
This whole thing
is because of you.

682
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:31,822
He doubts himself
because of you,

683
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:34,491
but believe me, Barry can
do what you could not.

684
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:35,993
Barry can stop Zoom.

685
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:37,795
I spent two years hunting Zoom.

686
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:41,198
Wrong! Zoom hunted you!

687
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,167
You spent the last two
years of your life

688
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:45,669
running, running,
running from Zoom.

689
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:48,005
Zoom would have killed me
just like he will kill Barry

690
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,573
if you lead him down this path!

691
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,442
No, because he is not like you.

692
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:53,945
Barry runs towards
danger, not from it,

693
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:56,113
because Barry's not a coward.

694
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:09,726
Enough!

695
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,532
You were pretty hard
on Jay in there.

696
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:19,503
Maybe you should be
hard on Jay too.

697
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,138
I've seen what you
can do, Barry.

698
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,540
I've calculated how
fast you can run,

699
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:26,777
and you should be teaching
Jay, not the other way around.

700
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:33,851
You know, before I learned
that the other Wells

701
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:37,754
was the man who murdered my
mom, I looked up to him.

702
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,923
He was my mentor, actually.

703
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:47,231
So my doppelganger,

704
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,633
a man who looks exactly like me,

705
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,602
betrayed you.

706
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:55,206
I'm sorry, I'm not him,

707
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:58,075
so you need to listen to
me when I say you can

708
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:02,213
take care of Zoom, and
all we have to do

709
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,015
is capture Doctor Light.

710
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:07,818
I thought about testing
the mask for Light's DNA,

711
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,320
but it would only have Linda's.

712
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:12,423
The mask, what mask?

713
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:13,957
Light's mask.

714
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,062
How did you get this?

715
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:20,097
Iris shot it off Doctor Light
when she attacked Linda.

716
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,066
You know how to use the
mask to find Light?

717
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:23,334
Yes, I do.

718
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:26,003
All we have to do
is give it to him.

719
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,171
Why me?

720
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,274
Because you have powers.

721
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,779
What are you talking about?

722
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:38,982
I developed this watch
to detect meta-humans.

723
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:49,593
You never got an
alert on your phone.

724
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:55,232
You never reprogrammed the S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite,

725
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,767
and this is why.

726
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:01,004
He's a meta-human.

727
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,256
Cisco, have you known about this

728
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:09,909
and you didn't say
anything to us?

729
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,876
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

730
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:13,044
Thanks a lot, Harry.

731
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:17,882
I swear I was, but I didn't.

732
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:21,386
- I was just... I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

733
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:25,557
Dr. Wells said the dark matter
gave me this, this gift.

734
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,562
He said that one day
I'd thank him for it.

735
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:32,364
What if I become like him?

736
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:35,934
Cisco, I don't think any
of us would become evil

737
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:37,268
if we all of sudden got powers,

738
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,837
even if they were from Dr.
Wells.

739
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:43,107
Yeah, maybe you're right.

740
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,176
I should have said something.

741
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:47,011
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

742
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,413
Well, you can be sorry later,

743
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,014
because right now, we
have to use your powers

744
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,450
to find Doctor Light.

745
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:54,820
Cisco, your abilities,
how do they work?

746
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:57,356
Uh, I get these
feelings sometimes,

747
00:33:57,358 --> 00:34:00,325
these vibes, visions
of the breachers

748
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:01,793
when they come to this Earth.

749
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:03,428
I just... I'm not sure
what triggers it.

750
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,364
Sometimes it just happens.

751
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:08,166
Sometimes it's when I'm
touching something of theirs.

752
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:10,268
Touch the mask.

753
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,571
You want to find
Doctor Light, do it.

754
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:38,363
I don't think it's working.

755
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,331
Try again.

756
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,447
Try again!

757
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,213
- I'm sorry, it's not...
- Again!

758
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:57,516
- I can't control it.
- Because you're afraid.

759
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:59,083
I'm telling you I don't
know how it works!

760
00:34:59,085 --> 00:35:00,752
I can't just make it happen!

761
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:03,455
I'm telling you, yes, you can!

762
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:16,200
South Plaza train
station, platform 15.

763
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:19,003
What are you waiting for?

764
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,747
Oh, guys, the
platform's crowded.

765
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,114
Are you sure she's here?

766
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,616
She should be wearing
a black trench coat.

767
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:34,753
Black trench coat. Found her.

768
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:38,356
Everybody, get out of here.
Go, go, hurry!

769
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,062
Why won't you just let me leave?

770
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:46,631
I can't let you leave. You
killed an innocent man.

771
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:47,999
That was an accident.

772
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,134
Trying to kill
Linda Park wasn't.

773
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:52,704
It's the only way that I
can be free from Zoom,

774
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:54,005
unless I kill you.

775
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,607
I can't let you do that either,

776
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,108
so we've got a problem.

777
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,177
We'll see.

778
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,045
Guys, should have talked
about this before I left,

779
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,347
but how should I stop her?

780
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:03,515
Keep trying different
angles, Barry.

781
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,049
Find her blind spot.

782
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:12,156
I can't get close enough.
What should I do?

783
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:13,692
I don't know.

784
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,193
I gotta tell ya,
that's not exactly

785
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:17,428
the answer I was looking for.

786
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,964
You need to confuse her.

787
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,231
Give her more than one target,

788
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,666
so she does not know
who to fire at.

789
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:23,368
All right, how do I do that?

790
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,204
By running so fast, you
create multiple afterimages

791
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,907
of yourself, you
create a speed mirage.

792
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:32,176
A wha... speed Mir...
I've never run that fast.

793
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:33,612
Well, from what I've been told,

794
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:35,046
you've traveled through time.

795
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,948
You'll be more than fast enough.

796
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,783
Okay.

797
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:58,136
- Barry?
- I can't do it.

798
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:00,605
- Yes, you can, Barry.
- Hey, Dr. Wells is right.

799
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:02,641
You are fast, faster
than I ever was

800
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,308
and better than I ever will be.

801
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,611
Don't let fear and doubt hold
you back like it did to me.

802
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:08,013
You're The Flash, Barry.

803
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:10,114
Show Light what that means.

804
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:23,327
Where are you?

805
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:30,936
I'm right here.

806
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:37,525
Doctor Light is safely
locked in the pipeline.

807
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:39,659
Nicely done.

808
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:42,562
Wells, thank you
for helping Barry

809
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:43,596
put away Doctor Light.

810
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:45,398
So what now?

811
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,535
We do what Dr. Wells said.

812
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:51,671
We use her to lure Zoom here,
end this once and for all.

813
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:52,972
You can't be serious.

814
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,407
More breachers are gonna come.

815
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,875
More innocent people may die.

816
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:58,011
I can't let this happen anymore.

817
00:37:58,013 --> 00:37:59,679
You're making a mistake.

818
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:03,115
Ok, Zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

819
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:05,585
I've already had my
worst nightmare.

820
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,053
His name was Reverse Flash,

821
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:09,956
and I spent a long time
being afraid of him.

822
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,291
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

823
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:14,627
Okay, Barry.

824
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:16,362
You may be faster than me,

825
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:18,731
but you're not ready to
fight Zoom by yourself.

826
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,700
That's just it, Jay.

827
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,334
I'm not gonna fight
him by myself.

828
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,003
I've got all of them to help me.

829
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:27,006
I've got Dr. Wells.

830
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:29,075
I've got you.

831
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:33,546
No, I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

832
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:36,182
it'll only lead to you
losing your speed,

833
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:38,017
or even worse,

834
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,019
your death.

835
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,956
Optimism must be
an Earth-1 thing.

836
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:46,693
You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

837
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,661
wouldn't admit that
he was responsible

838
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:51,230
for the Particle Accelerator
exploding underground.

839
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:54,634
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth,

840
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:57,837
but he has just as many
secrets as the one you knew.

841
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,842
Jay, please don't go.

842
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,046
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

843
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,023
Have a nice day.

844
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,825
What can I get... you?

845
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeah, I know, this
is supes awkward,

846
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:22,495
probably more for
me than for you,

847
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:24,530
but I just want coffee, okay?

848
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:27,299
Just three flashes,
one of them decaf.

849
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:28,901
That's it.

850
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,642
Are you sure that's
all you want?

851
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:36,876
Oh, that's funny.

852
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,244
You just want to
shoot me down again?

853
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,680
No, no, no, no.

854
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:45,118
What I mean is, I just
moved to Central City,

855
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,420
and it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

856
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,222
Everything here
is so big and new

857
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:52,558
and filled with meta-humans.

858
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,728
Yeah, well, when you factor
in the size of the city,

859
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,264
the chances of running
into a meta-human are

860
00:39:58,266 --> 00:39:59,498
actually pretty low.

861
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:02,501
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

862
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:06,039
you kinda caught me off
guard the other day,

863
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,074
but now I'm a little
more prepared,

864
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:12,779
so I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

865
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:18,918
Hi, I'm Cisco Ramon.

866
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,953
Kendra Saunders.

867
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,722
It's nice to meet you.

868
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:24,090
Are you okay?

869
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,858
Yeah, I just...

870
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,527
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

871
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:31,064
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

872
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:34,667
They always seem to show
up just when you need 'em.

873
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:37,403
Yo, peep that.

874
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,173
That's how it's done,
young Padawan.

875
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,540
- Nice.
- Going on a date next week.

876
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,342
Things are looking
up for Cisco Ramon.

877
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:44,543
I guess so.

878
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,145
Still stuck with these
powers, though.

879
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:47,747
Just don't know how
to feel about 'em.

880
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,448
Hey, look,

881
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,450
you don't gotta go
through it alone.

882
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:54,120
And now you need a cool name.

883
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:57,590
Oh, snap! You're totally right.

884
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:59,525
I gotta think about this one.

885
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:00,860
Well, you know me.
It's gotta be perfect.

886
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:02,981
Something that really
sings, you know?

887
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,732
Something like...

888
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,633
Vibe?

889
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:10,669
Vibe.

890
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:13,239
Vibe.

891
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:26,126
-TUSUBTITULO-
-IS NOT OVER YET-

892
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:30,255
EARTH TWO

893
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:35,828
Your father has abandoned you.

894
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,263
You're lying!

895
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,899
My father's the
smartest man alive.

896
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:44,003
He'll find me, he'll save me,
and then he'll kill you.

897
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:48,040
I will not die.

898
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:51,010
What happens to you
and your father

899
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:54,280
is still to be decided.
