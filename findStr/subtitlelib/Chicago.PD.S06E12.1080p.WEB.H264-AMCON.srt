1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,006
Hey, yo, you wanna put
your hands up,

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,169
because we're going all out.

3
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,933
All right, so where's
the supplier?

4
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,631
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,503
My contact's gonna meet the guy
upstairs at the card game.

6
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:29,116
It wasn't easy getting you guys
in here, making you look legit.

7
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,508
That's part of your deal.

8
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:32,380
This gonna be enough
to clear my case?

9
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:34,077
You get us the guy
selling China White,

10
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,080
I'm gonna clear your record
and never bother you again.

11
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,170
Get eyes upstairs,
let's ID the supplier.

12
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,825
Who's this guy?

13
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,175
Three body guards, wad of cash.

14
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,699
Looks like this guy's
coming to play.

15
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:49,266
All right, heads up.

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,878
We got a male, Hispanic, 30s,
5'7", buck-50.

17
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:55,881
He's in a blue coat coming in
with three additional.

18
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,579
Copy that.

19
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,585
All right, game on.

20
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:05,587
We got a positive ID
on facial rec,

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,154
Frank Delgado, got a sheet here,

22
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,155
multiple drug arrests.

23
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,418
He just walked in.

24
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,202
Frank, now we got a game.

25
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,725
Sit down so I can take
your money.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,385
Well, well, well, well, well,
well, well.

27
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,344
Can I pour you gentlemen
some shots?

28
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,476
Yeah, let's get a round.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,696
So, what's your name?

30
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,045
Candy.

31
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,850
You know, I got a bit of
a sweet tooth.

32
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,572
You know, I get that
all the time.

33
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:39,708
Listen, Candy, I'll give you
$500 to take off your dress.

34
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,233
The bar has a pretty strict
dress code.

35
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:46,584
A thousand.

36
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,762
There we go, smile for
the camera, you jagoff.

37
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:54,418
We got eyes on the supplier yet?

38
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,289
Whoo.

39
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,551
Yeah, facial rec just popped,

40
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,640
Matthew Garrett,
lighting up the board.

41
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,250
He's got multiple drug arrests.

42
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,470
Matthew Garret?
That's not possible.

43
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:03,775
Am I blind? I mean...

44
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,473
Yeah, Pontiac Prison,
he just go released.

45
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:11,827
That's our guy.

46
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,283
Son of a bitch.
This can't be happening.

47
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,439
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,833
I got history with him.
He can't see me.

49
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,791
He knows you?

50
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,014
Why are you leaving?

51
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,494
It's a long story.

52
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,472
Okay, but I did my thing,
so we're all good, right?

53
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,237
Yeah, you did great.

54
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,283
Come on. Come on, we gotta go.

55
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,459
Hey, yo. Yo, I know you.

56
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,220
Nah, I think you got me
mixed up with somebody, man.

57
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:40,377
Nah, nah, nah,
you're that cop, Halstead.

58
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:45,208
You're that punk that murders
teenage girls, Garrett.

59
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,475
Watch yourself.
What are you gonna do, cop?

60
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,869
You gonna hit me?

61
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,087
That's what you wanna do?

62
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,524
Come on, please, right here.

63
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,179
Please, take a swing,
I'm begging you, please.

64
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,006
My God, Chicago PD,
they might give me

65
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,245
another 200K, maybe even more.

66
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,333
Right here, sweetheart,
don't miss.

67
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,315
Come on, come on, let's go.

68
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,709
This dude ain't worth it.

69
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,237
See you around, Halstead,
you coward.

70
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,327
- Who is that?
- The devil.

71
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,528
The mystery player
bringing in China White

72
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:25,857
is Matthew Garrett.

73
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,270
He was doing 20 years for
possession

74
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,512
with intent to distribute,

75
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,514
served six, was released
last month.

76
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,951
So the police put in
the proper paperwork

77
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,257
before they did the bust.

78
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,867
It was deemed an illegal search.

79
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:39,044
That's why the city awarded
Garrett $200,000

80
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,307
for wrongful arrest.

81
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,373
Now he's using the settlement
from the city

82
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:44,678
to corner the market on
high-end heroin.

83
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,313
Gotta love the justice system.

84
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,619
I get it,
but we gotta stand down.

85
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,100
Ivory tower doesn't want us
chasing these so-called

86
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,295
wrongful conviction offenders.

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,364
Sarge, to hell with that.

88
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:57,237
Garrett's not just a drug
dealer, he's a murderer.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,716
He killed Lauren Sanders.

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,371
She was 17 years old,
she ran away from home.

91
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,566
Garrett found her,
he pimped her out,

92
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,374
and then she just disappeared.

93
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:07,072
We found her bloody clothes
in a dumpster.

94
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:10,075
We never found her body,
so we couldn't make the case.

95
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:14,210
All due respect, standing down
should not be an option.

96
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,913
Okay, let's go after him.

97
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:24,264
I mean, the good news is,
prick's got ambition,

98
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,310
means we can catch him dirty,
put him away once and for all.

99
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,312
So dig into Garrett's
associates,

100
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,096
talk to your C.I.'s,
let's find a way in.

101
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,272
Set up a buy/bust.

102
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,490
So who made the arrest,

103
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,100
put him away in the first place?

104
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,799
Narcotics, Garrett was part
of the Beverly Crew.

105
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:40,192
That's good,
I got a guy who can help.

106
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,934
Thanks, Sarge.

107
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,894
I gotta tell you, Gus,
you have not aged.

108
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:49,376
Tell that to my knees.

109
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,074
Hey, thanks. How's Erika?

110
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,597
She's back in Florida.

111
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,166
Got the place all to myself.

112
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,907
Miss seeing you around, bro.

113
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,605
Well, if you get nostalgic,
I'm still on YouTube.

114
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,433
1.6 million views,

115
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:05,522
everywhere I go, people know me.

116
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,176
Last time I went out for
a cup of coffee,

117
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,091
the barista spit in my face.

118
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,527
Jesus.

119
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,312
That video didn't show

120
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,836
the dirtbag beating the hell
out of his pregnant girlfriend,

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,056
just the part where
I pulled him off...

122
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,449
did what I did.

123
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,190
Heat of the moment.

124
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,626
I know.

125
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,325
23-year career down
the drain in 19 seconds.

126
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,848
What are you gonna do?

127
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:31,374
Let me ask you something, Gus.

128
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,420
When you took down
the Beverly Crew,

129
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,987
you come across a guy named
Matthew Garrett?

130
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,729
Yeah. I buried his ass.

131
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,383
Well, you didn't bury him
deep enough,

132
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,906
he just got released.

133
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,951
You kidding?

134
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:44,189
Yeah, he's back out
on the street,

135
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,171
he's dealing high-end heroin,

136
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,348
so we're looking for a way in.

137
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,958
I thought maybe
you might have an idea.

138
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,308
Garrett had a sweet spot
for his little cousin,

139
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,701
kid named Tyler Reynolds.

140
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,833
Right, you know where I can
find this Tyler kid?

141
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,662
He's doing 10 years at
Stateville for armed robbery.

142
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:03,014
Tyler was just the driver,
he took the weight for Garrett.

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,192
Yeah, I think I can work
with that.

144
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,977
Appreciate your time, Gus.

145
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,109
Listen, you need anything,
you let me know.

146
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,676
No, I'm good, Hank.

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,678
Got half my pension, my health.

148
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,768
And who the hell would wanna be
a cop in this day and age?

149
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,300
Matt Garrett.

150
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:31,826
- Right?
- Hey, yo.

151
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,436
Easy, man.

152
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,133
Who the hell are you?

153
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,701
I'm Chris Wilson,
I'm a friend of Tyler's.

154
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,877
We're neighbors on cell bock H.

155
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,923
Tyler didn't tell me
he had a boyfriend.

156
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,751
Hadn't said anything about you.

157
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,318
Well, he said a lot about you.

158
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,558
How he took the weight for that
robbery back in the day,

159
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,366
and you owe him a favor.

160
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,889
I'm the favor.

161
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,459
You can call him,
he'll vouch for me.

162
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,984
Does Tyler still got that
funny little scar on his head?

163
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:02,465
Tyler doesn't have any scars,
he's a baby face.

164
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,468
Maybe you forgot,
maybe you need to go see him.

165
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,011
So what'd they pop you for,
Christopher?

166
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:10,342
Cops hung a armed robbery
charge on me.

167
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,782
Come over here a second.

168
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:24,052
So listen, Tyler told me
you were the guy

169
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,271
to talk to about heroin.

170
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,751
You're in the game, right?

171
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,163
You dole out supplies,
why are you coming to me,

172
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,362
to a complete stranger?

173
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:32,930
Apparently you have China White.

174
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,932
Yeah?

175
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:38,022
Look man, I got a lot of
clients in the north burbs,

176
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,851
and they don't want that
dirty brown heroin.

177
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,853
These are white people
that want white stuff.

178
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,813
They got the green
to pay for it.

179
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,206
How 'bout you, Chris?
You got the green?

180
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,992
I can get it, yeah.

181
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:53,081
Tell you what,
I'll touch base with Tyler.

182
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,823
If your story checks out,
maybe we can do business.

183
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,651
All right, works for me.

184
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,391
The buy-in's 50K.

185
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,263
I can make that happen.

186
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,004
And I'll need that by today.

187
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,049
By today.

188
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:08,488
Shouldn't be a problem,
if you're serious.

189
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,141
All right?

190
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,666
Hey, Santana,
let's get out of here.

191
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,364
See you, pal.

192
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,239
Sir.

193
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,069
- Superintendent.
- Sergeant.

194
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,644
You called me?

195
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:39,649
Yeah, I saw your request
for 1505 funds.

196
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,869
I'm not sure how that
ended up on your desk.

197
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,348
Well, it's a new policy.

198
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,655
Anything $50,000 or over
requires my approval.

199
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,178
What's it for?

200
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,572
We got a time-sensitive play
on an offender

201
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:50,660
dealing bulk heroin.

202
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,532
And who's the offender?

203
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,359
Matthew Garrett.

204
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,057
As in the Matthew Garrett

205
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,711
who was just released
from prison?

206
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,191
We weren't targeting Garrett.

207
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:03,455
Chased that heroin case,
he just fell in our lap.

208
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,981
We just cut this bastard
a check for $200,000.

209
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,984
It was a big, fat black eye
for this department

210
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,768
- and for the city.
- I get it.

211
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,858
We can't be cute,
too many eyes on us.

212
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,599
You authorize that 50K,

213
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,080
I can have Garrett in bracelets
tonight.

214
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,475
Look, we all hate this prick
and yes,

215
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,695
he belongs behind bars.

216
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,480
But I cannot have members of
the CPD out there

217
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:32,876
acting like vigilantes,
not at this point in time.

218
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,054
There's about 100 different ways

219
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,143
this whole thing could go wrong.

220
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,060
Walk away, Sergeant.

221
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,106
Yes, sir.

222
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,459
Jay. Hey.

223
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:51,895
You all right? Where you going?

224
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,264
No, I just got off the phone
with Voight.

225
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,898
He said Kelton denied
the 1505 funds.

226
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,944
He's just covering his ass.

227
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,554
Look, Garrett's doing
bad things,

228
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,729
he's gonna make a mistake.

229
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:00,924
We'll catch him sooner or later.

230
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,210
Hailey, we got him right now.

231
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,448
All we have to do
is make a deal.

232
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,605
Jay, you got a visitor.

233
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,091
Hello?

234
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,530
Do you remember me?

235
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,141
Yeah, of course, Mrs. Sanders.

236
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:23,318
They released the monster
who murdered my daughter?

237
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,711
And they gave him money?

238
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,364
What kind of world is this?

239
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,932
- I don't know, I really don't.
- What I don't understand

240
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,239
is why
nobody bothered to tell me.

241
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:35,635
Nobody had the courage
to look me in the eye.

242
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:36,984
I'ml'm so sorry.

243
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,117
Eight years, and you know
something?

244
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:44,687
I can't let it go,
because I am so outraged

245
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,995
that he still exists
and my daughter doesn't.

246
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,650
We never even found her body.

247
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,869
I know, look, I promise you...

248
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,045
Don't make me any more promises.

249
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,787
I told you he would kill her.

250
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,137
You were supposed to stop it.

251
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,357
You didn't.

252
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,069
Hey, Sarge, I talked to Trudy.

253
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,071
The counterfeit crew that
we busted last year,

254
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,204
the money was still
in the evidence room.

255
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,121
We'll just flash the money,

256
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,359
Garrett's not gonna look
too close.

257
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,732
We got the hook in,

258
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,362
I think we gotta keep the deal
on track...

259
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,885
Jay, you do know we were told
to stand down, right?

260
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,171
So you wanna let this guy go

261
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,496
just because Kelton wants
to be Mayor?

262
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,218
I don't care about Kelton.

263
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,524
I did some digging
into Matthew Garrett,

264
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,352
got a hit on him as a victim.

265
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:44,007
Filed an official complaint
against a police officer

266
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:46,357
who threatened
physical violence.

267
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,055
Turns out, that officer was you.

268
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:51,101
Garrett is an evil guy.
I was just being a cop.

269
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,252
It was a ploy to get me
off his back.

270
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,887
The allegation was sustained.

271
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,516
Your superior officer
took you off the case.

272
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,021
I obeyed that order
and a girl went missing.

273
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,589
If we let this deal go away,
then we lose Garrett.

274
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:03,723
And if he hurts another girl,
that is on us.

275
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,734
You're not the first one
through the door.

276
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,344
You're background.

277
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,827
Hey, you talked to Garrett?

278
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,065
Yeah, he wants to meet
in an hour.

279
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,787
All right, confirm the meet.

280
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,484
- So we're back up?
- We are.

281
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,965
Hey, I don't want Adam
going in there alone.

282
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,750
Take someone with you,
right-hand man.

283
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,186
What about a right-hand woman?

284
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,754
Do it. Cameras and mics.

285
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,799
What about Kelton?

286
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,106
I'll deal with Kelton.

287
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,896
We're in position.

288
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,787
All right, let me know when
you got Garrett in pocket.

289
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,814
Remember Jay,
stay in the shadows.

290
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,773
Yeah, copy.

291
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,143
So the mother of
the murdered girl

292
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,603
came to see you?

293
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,562
Yeah.

294
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,086
Anything you wanna talk about?

295
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,261
No.

296
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,659
All right, here he comes.

297
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:15,359
You got Garrett on the way,
and he's got two males with him

298
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,796
and a young girl.

299
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,208
They're headed towards
the coffee shop.

300
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,061
Yeah, we see 'em.

301
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,895
How's it going, Matt?

302
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,437
You didn't say
you were bringing a friend.

303
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,787
Yeah, I could say
the same to you.

304
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,291
This is my partner,
this is Marcia.

305
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,728
Shouldn't you be at a kids'
soccer practice or something?

306
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,166
Exactly, I even drive a minivan.

307
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,950
Two traps and a 357,

308
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,910
she's very good at what
she does, I promise.

309
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,085
And this is?

310
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,000
This is Jill.

311
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,653
Hey, why don't you,

312
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,307
go and get yourself
something to eat.

313
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,787
I'll come and find you later.

314
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,223
Get a receipt.

315
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,360
Look at all these runaways.

316
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,363
They come from all over,

317
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,105
you know, looking for a fix,

318
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,889
trying to find Daddy.

319
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:11,502
But you get 'em hooked,
they'll do anything you want.

320
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,200
Amen.

321
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,857
Is this making you feel
uncomfortable?

322
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,035
I'll let you boys talk business.

323
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,517
Why the hell is Burgess
walking away?

324
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,172
I got no idea.

325
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:31,653
Hailey, you got eyes on Burgess?

326
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,700
No, I'm not sure where she went.

327
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:39,052
Okay, you said
you wanted serious.

328
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,402
I brought you serious.

329
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,108
Hey. Jill, right?

330
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:55,764
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, Marcia.

331
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,205
So, Jill, how long have you
known Garrett?

332
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,033
I met him a few days ago.

333
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,038
Look, I don't know you, Jill,
and you don't know me,

334
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:13,521
but I do know about Garrett,
and he is not a good guy, okay?

335
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,001
He's nice to me.

336
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,587
Let me guess, he took you
to a fancy dinner

337
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,936
and bought you some nice,
new clothes?

338
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,223
Right?
Come on, Jill, think about it.

339
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,616
You know where this is going,

340
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,444
you know what he's gonna
ask you to do next.

341
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,142
Why are you doing this?

342
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,231
My sister was hurt by a man
like that.

343
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,755
I don't want it to happen
to you too.

344
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,062
Do you any place else
you can go, just any place?

345
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,411
No.

346
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,065
Here.

347
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,782
This is $200, I want you to go
out the back door

348
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,068
and get away from this guy.

349
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,611
You just call your parents
or your friends.

350
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,985
Just get out of here, okay?

351
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,987
Okay, now I need you to move,
okay?

352
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,119
Go, go, go.

353
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,426
So where'd your partner go?

354
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,559
I'm guessing a little
pick-me-up.

355
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,300
How do I know
she can be trusted?

356
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,739
Don't worry about her,
you're just dealing with me.

357
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,698
Come on, let's pick a spot,
get this deal done.

358
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,788
I got 50K burning a hole
in this bag.

359
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,504
Let's get this deal done.
Come on, let's go.

360
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,580
Garrett's on the move.

361
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,626
Where is she?

362
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,106
- Who?
- Jill, the girl I was with.

363
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,455
Where is she?

364
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,891
- I don't know.
- Is she in there?

365
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,416
- I don't think so.
- Go and check. Check.

366
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,636
Look, man, I'm not trying to
push you or anything,

367
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,029
but I got a lot of money here,

368
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,311
I'm starting to get
a little nervous.

369
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,815
You wanna do this deal or not?

370
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,296
You keep your phone on,
I'll be in touch.

371
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,732
Okay.

372
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,043
- Boss.
- Yeah?

373
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,045
Talked to Garrett,
the deal's on.

374
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,525
All right, you got a location?

375
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,068
Yeah, Beverly Yards,
tomorrow at noon.

376
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,355
All right, get the
surveillance van, cameras.

377
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,921
Let's nail this guy.

378
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,314
Jay, remember,
you're background,

379
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,534
you got the long-eye.

380
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,581
No sign of Garrett.

381
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,152
Okay, well, we got
a blue coupe headed your way,

382
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,720
might be our target,
two passengers.

383
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,679
Here we go, game time.

384
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,467
We don't pounce till
we see those drugs.

385
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,651
What the hell?
Garrett's not in the car.

386
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,097
Where's Garrett?
He's with the dope.

387
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,901
He's not moving until
you give me that money.

388
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,294
What, do you we think
we're stupid?

389
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,904
The deal was a hand-to-hand
with Garrett,

390
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,190
that was the deal.

391
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,689
He never said anything about
a let-go, man.

392
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,106
So we're not gonna let go.

393
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,890
You are if you want
your product.

394
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,372
Look, man, we want the product,

395
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,655
you're just changing the rules
in the middle of the game.

396
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,028
All right, here's what we'll do.

397
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,335
I'll stay here with you
and the money,

398
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,032
she'll go pick up the drugs.

399
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,600
Why don't you call Garrett
and tell him the new plan?

400
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,734
You gonna call him or are
we gonna go our separate ways?

401
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:14,702
He's not answering.

402
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,185
You know the address?

403
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,492
All right, I'm gonna take that
as a yes.

404
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,754
Why don't you just tell us,

405
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,148
and we'll go meet him in person?

406
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:31,197
Tell us now or we take
the money and we walk.

407
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Last chance.

408
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:37,246
I see, this guy's a chump.

409
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,814
You don't know anything.

410
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,252
It's the old warehouse...

411
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,645
On McKenzie.

412
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:55,003
5021 George, what's your 20?

413
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,179
Halstead, you cop...

414
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,046
It's you.

415
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,266
Yeah, that's right.

416
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,093
What happened, Garrett?
Who did this?

417
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,835
Hey, Garrett, listen to me.
I will get you help.

418
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,098
I'll call you an ambulance.

419
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,492
You gotta tell me, where is
Lauren Sanders' body?

420
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,929
- Call an ambulance.
- No, you make this right.

421
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,017
You make this right,

422
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,323
you tell me where her body is,

423
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,846
and I will call you
an ambulance.

424
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,326
You understand me?

425
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,850
Garrett, you got a chance
to do something good.

426
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,287
You can make amends.

427
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:09,730
Kiss my ass.

428
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,862
Garrett.

429
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,866
Garrett. Garrett!

430
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:25,876
Jay? You all right?

431
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,922
Yeah.

432
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,359
What the hell happened?

433
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,373
That is exactly how I found him.

434
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,027
I arrived, I cleared
the premises first,

435
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,158
I tried to render aid...

436
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,467
And then Hailey arrived
just after me.

437
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:52,990
And the China White?

438
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,340
Nothing yet, still looking.

439
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,211
We talked to a crime tech,

440
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,169
preliminary time of death
is 1210.

441
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:00,998
Hailey called us over at 1223.

442
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,697
Whoever killed this guy,
we just missed him.

443
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,176
Hello, Leonard.

444
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,458
- Intelligence in the house.
- Hey.

445
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:07,677
And I thought I was gonna be
figuring out

446
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,355
who killed some worthless
bad guy.

447
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,965
He was worthless all right.

448
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,272
Trying to set up a drug bust,
somebody got here first.

449
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,534
So your guy see anything?

450
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,100
No, he was dead when
we got here.

451
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,015
- Murder weapon?
- Didn't find one.

452
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,366
Didn't find the drugs either,
figured whoever killed him

453
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,367
probably took 'em.

454
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,455
So who found the body?

455
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,065
One of my guys.

456
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,172
Well, that's more of
a head start

457
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,546
than I usually get.

458
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,350
We'll take it from here, man.
You know what?

459
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:31,072
If you don't mind, Leonard,
we'd like to run with this one.

460
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,726
Why?

461
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,946
DOA was our target,
we were told to stand down

462
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,774
not work him, so...

463
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,386
There's gonna be headaches
on this,

464
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,822
I don't wanna get you jammed up.

465
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,389
Okay, be my guest.

466
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,440
So?

467
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,376
I know I shouldn't have
gone in without backup,

468
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,291
but the deal was going
sideways and we were gonna...

469
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,635
Jay, I think you and I both know

470
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,796
that's not the question
you're gonna answer.

471
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:04,932
Upton found you standing over
Garrett's dead body, alone,

472
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,282
in a situation you would never
and should never

473
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,718
enter without backup.

474
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,025
So what the hell happened
in there?

475
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,029
He was alive when I got there.

476
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,512
Somebody already shot him.

477
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,688
I don't know who,
there was nobody else around.

478
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,865
Why didn't you call it in?

479
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:28,216
'Cause I knew he wasn't
gonna make it.

480
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,619
I've seen enough
of those injuries.

481
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,922
I wanted to find out
where Lauren's body was

482
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,794
for her mother.

483
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,405
So I gave that prick one chance

484
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,147
to redeem his miserable life,
he didn't take it.

485
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,671
He told me to kiss his ass.

486
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:51,718
Okay.

487
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,594
Listen, anybody asks you,
I mean, anybody...

488
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:01,031
Garrett was dead
when you got there.

489
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:05,819
That's it.

490
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,429
All right.

491
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,127
Thanks, Sarge.

492
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,694
Okay.

493
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:15,698
Sarge, check this out.

494
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,787
Casing found at the scene,
it looks like a match to

495
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,572
the slug that killed Garrett.

496
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,201
All right, well, let's hear
what Ballistics says.

497
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,357
We got anything else?

498
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,750
No, we got nothing, Sarge.

499
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,578
We got no weapons,
no witnesses, no dope.

500
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,754
No sign of struggle either,
which suggests Garrett

501
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,886
either knew his assailant
or was caught by surprise.

502
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,192
He got popped for his product.

503
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,498
Yeah.

504
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,021
Isn't it ironic
that we're the ones

505
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:35,477
that have to clear the murder
for this prick?

506
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,067
Well, that's what we gotta do.

507
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,374
So let's call in favors
with everyone who can help.

508
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,811
Okay, I don't care how much
we hated this son of a bitch,

509
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,726
we gotta find who killed him,
fast.

510
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,511
Hey, dig back into that
card game.

511
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,034
Who the hell had a beef
with Garrett?

512
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,688
Let's hit everyone
at that card game.

513
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,864
I just got a tip from a C.I.

514
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:53,127
Someone's looking to move
a lot of China White

515
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,128
on the south side.

516
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,346
Location?

517
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,696
Chicago Convention Center,

518
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,828
drop's gonna be in
an employee locker.

519
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,221
Hit it.

520
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,199
Get off me!

521
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:25,812
Santana, you remember me?

522
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,161
I remember you.

523
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:28,945
Come on, man. Come on.

524
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,643
Stop.

525
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,907
Ask him if he dropped something.

526
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,258
You drop something?

527
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,545
We found your friend
at the west side warehouse

528
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,961
with a bullet in his neck.

529
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,528
I don't know nothing about that.

530
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,095
Really, you sure?

531
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,594
'Cause he happened to be
missing a kilo of China White

532
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,141
we found in your duffle bag.

533
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:55,406
We also got a footprint
from that crime scene.

534
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,756
You a size 11?

535
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,322
That don't mean I killed him.

536
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,672
Does mean you were there.

537
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,935
Mike, this thing is pretty
open and shut.

538
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,390
We're just going through
the formalities,

539
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:04,677
so we can go home.

540
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,766
So if you have anything
to say, say it now.

541
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,638
Look, Garrett and I were
there to do a deal.

542
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,945
I was outside the warehouse,
heard the gunshot,

543
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,337
and ran inside.

544
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,948
I didn't see anyone else.

545
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:18,473
I swear, that's it.
I didn't kill nobody.

546
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,519
Mike...

547
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,955
the way I see it,

548
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:25,480
shooting Matthew Garrett
was a community service.

549
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,804
So you give us
the murder weapon,

550
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,571
help us clear this case,
I'll see if I can have

551
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,442
your charges lowered
to manslaughter.

552
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,009
I wanna help you, all right?

553
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,813
I'm telling you the truth,
I didn't kill him.

554
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:37,492
He told me to take the heroin
and run, so I did.

555
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,885
He was alive when I left.

556
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,626
- Where'd you run?
- To my car.

557
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,845
I was parked out back
of the warehouse.

558
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,461
Hailey, what's up?

559
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:53,813
Hey, I got some footage
from the warehouse.

560
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,641
Turns out Santana
was telling the truth.

561
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,947
He left out the back door
at 1205.

562
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,689
This next part might be
a bit of a problem, though.

563
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,125
You said you got to
the warehouse

564
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,997
a few minutes before us.

565
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,347
I'm not sure exactly, but yeah.

566
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,784
Okay, well...

567
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:09,892
According to this,
you were there

568
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,092
a full ten minutes before us.

569
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:18,098
I mean, I must have been
in there longer than I thought.

570
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,320
And then you shut off your radio

571
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,887
before you went inside.

572
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,456
Yeah.

573
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,371
What are you saying?

574
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:33,722
Jay, you went dark before
you went in the warehouse.

575
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,206
You weren't even supposed
to be there

576
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,551
in the first place.

577
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,509
You were alone with Garrett
for ten minutes,

578
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:40,381
and you never called it in.

579
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,904
If anyone looks at these facts,

580
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,384
given your history with Garrett,

581
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,952
they're gonna assume
that you had an agenda.

582
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,651
Is that what you think?

583
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,261
Come on.

584
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,395
And it doesn't matter
what I think,

585
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:56,571
these are the questions
they're gonna ask you.

586
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,835
Did you have an agenda?

587
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,358
The deal was blown,

588
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,012
I thought Garrett was gonna
disappear,

589
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,623
so yeah, I went after him.

590
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,668
I didn't know what I was
gonna do when I saw him.

591
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,192
I didn't know.

592
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:12,718
He was already bleeding out
when I got there.

593
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,197
And then what'd you do?

594
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,898
I knew he wasn't gonna make it,

595
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:21,291
and I tried to make him
tell me where her body is.

596
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,733
Jay...

597
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:30,474
You crossed lines,
you didn't render aid.

598
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,607
I know.

599
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,175
That's official misconduct,
you can go to prison.

600
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,619
Homicide wants to talk to me.

601
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,978
Thanks for coming.

602
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:57,719
So, what's this about?

603
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:01,288
Just clearing up
this Matthew Garrett business.

604
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:04,160
What a thoroughly despicable
human being.

605
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,033
Good riddance?

606
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,469
Is that a question?

607
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,081
Hell of a thing.

608
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,127
Hard enough being a cop
these days;

609
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,520
Paperwork, cell phone cameras,

610
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,088
everybody looking for ways
to blow you up.

611
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,830
And a horrible criminal
like Matthew Garrett

612
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:25,921
gets released with a gift
of $200,000.

613
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,706
Detective,
stop jerking me around.

614
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,925
You wanna ask me something,
just go ahead and ask me,

615
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,449
otherwise, I'm gonna walk out
of here.

616
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:36,105
Why'd you go dark?

617
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,020
We pulled the tracking records
from your unit.

618
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:41,763
You turned off your phone
and your GPS at 1215.

619
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,853
I turned my phone off because
I was afraid of a random call

620
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,420
just tipping off our suspect.

621
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,161
Something else
I don't understand,

622
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,337
you had history with Garrett.

623
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,993
He would recognize you.
Why go into the warehouse?

624
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,603
I was in my vehicle,

625
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,561
I was the closest one
to the warehouse,

626
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,539
and I heard over the radio that
the deal was going sideways.

627
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,043
And I knew he had heroin on him,

628
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,238
so I figured we'd at least
catch him

629
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:03,306
on a possession charge.

630
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,655
You didn't wait for backup?

631
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:06,440
I was afraid he'd get rid of
the drugs

632
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,244
and then he'd get away.
He'd still be on the street.

633
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,400
You wanna write me up
for being impatient, go ahead.

634
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,799
So just to confirm...

635
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,932
He was dead when you got there?

636
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,500
This sounds like I need
my FOP lawyer.

637
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:33,597
Just doing our due diligence.

638
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,904
Appreciate your time, Detective.

639
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:44,434
Why are you jamming up
Jay Halstead?

640
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,914
Beg your pardon.

641
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,135
Halstead was doing his job
to apprehend an offender.

642
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,614
An offender he had
a history with.

643
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:54,227
Yes, I talked to Tillman,
and he told me there were

644
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,447
problems with Halstead's
version of the events.

645
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,580
This city is no longer
gonna tolerate

646
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:03,192
cowboy behavior from
its police, not on my watch.

647
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,933
Lose the campaign speech, Brian.

648
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,543
There's no cameras here.

649
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,937
How 'bout you and I just shoot
each other straight?

650
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,306
You wanna shoot it straight,
Hank?

651
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,853
- Yeah!
- I told you to stay the hell

652
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:12,941
off of this one.

653
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:14,290
The last thing this city needs

654
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,335
is another cop involved

655
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,902
in a questionable shooting.

656
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:20,644
And if that is what
this turns out to be,

657
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,385
I'm not coming out on
the wrong side of it.

658
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,083
Halstead didn't shoot Garrett.

659
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,606
- Who did?
- I don't know yet!

660
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,956
Your guy had motive
and he went dark.

661
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,610
This is a murder,

662
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,787
and right now Jay Halstead
is suspect number one.

663
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

664
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,450
Jay.

665
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,408
Listen, I just talked to Kelton,

666
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:46,975
this thing isn't going away.

667
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,325
They're still looking at you
for the Garrett murder.

668
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,675
Are you telling me
I gotta call my FOP lawyer?

669
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,112
Well, I wouldn't.

670
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,785
Just spark more attention,
make things worse.

671
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,550
I think I gotta protect
myself, Sarge.

672
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,769
I think they best way
for you to protect yourself

673
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,859
is for us to go out there
and the find the guy

674
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,338
who actually did kill Garrett.

675
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:05,515
Then this whole thing
will just wash away.

676
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,648
I talked to Maury
at Ballistics...

677
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:10,714
They're still working
on the official report

678
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,696
of the Garrett shooting,
but he shared with me

679
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,697
the unofficial report.

680
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:14,829
Okay.

681
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,091
The slug that killed Garrett

682
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,876
is a match to a slug
used at a robbery

683
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,573
at a Pilsen store in 2015.

684
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,010
The guy they busted
was Frank Delgado.

685
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,664
Delgado was at the poker game.

686
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:26,188
Makes sense, we know he was
after the China White.

687
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:28,103
Plus, we got an LKA in Pilsen.

688
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:29,409
All right, so hit it.

689
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,932
Remember, we are on a clock,

690
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,336
so let's make sure
we get this guy.

691
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,717
Jay, you hang here.

692
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,241
I don't want you leaving
the District.

693
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:42,247
Chicago PD!

694
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,339
Clear!

695
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,125
- Clear.
- Clear!

696
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,910
We got a runner!

697
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,259
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

698
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,348
Wrong exit, pal.

699
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:58,307
What the hell are you doing?
Antonio!

700
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,937
- I got him, go ahead.
- I didn't do anything!

701
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,398
Spread your arms!
Stay still. Give me your hand.

702
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,617
Give me your hand.

703
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,966
Go.

704
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,936
We know you were doing
business with Matthew Garrett.

705
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:21,113
I don't even know who that is.

706
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:22,941
You sure about that?

707
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,081
Remember that night?

708
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,257
I got offered $1,000
to take my dress off.

709
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,782
That guy... yeah.

710
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,349
We played cards.

711
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,917
You found out he was holding
heroin at the warehouse,

712
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,616
and instead of paying for it...

713
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,792
You put a bullet in his neck.

714
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,707
Nah, that wasn't me.

715
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,274
Where were you at noon?

716
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,842
- I was still in bed.
- So you don't have an alibi.

717
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,979
Look, there's no upside
in taking Garrett out.

718
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,763
He had the hookup
for China White.

719
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,286
He's the golden goose.

720
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,941
What I don't understand
is we got ballistics back

721
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,117
on the bullet that killed
Garrett.

722
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:12,686
And it's a match to a Glock 17
you used to rob

723
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,122
a liquor store four years ago.

724
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,038
I don't got that gun anymore.

725
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,606
When I got busted,
the cops took it off me,

726
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,129
I never seen it again.

727
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,696
If the cops took it off you,

728
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,195
it would have been booked
in the evidence.

729
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:27,092
Then maybe somebody
un-booked it.

730
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:30,399
Wouldn't be the first time
Chicago Police played dirty.

731
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:41,019
Hey, Sarge, I found
the Delgado case file.

732
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,213
All right, you go through it?

733
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,847
Yeah, so according to
the report,

734
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,129
the clerk struggled with
the assailant, Delgado,

735
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,894
before knocking the gun
out of his hands.

736
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,611
And then he claims that he saw
a police officer

737
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,594
pick the gun up
after Delgado fled.

738
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,031
Then we should have the gun.

739
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,163
I checked, it never was
booked into evidence.

740
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,513
Who was the arresting officer?

741
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,044
Didn't have anywhere to put 'em,

742
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:08,263
so we jammed these scumbags
into a phone booth.

743
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,049
Remembering phone booths?
Barely.

744
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:16,054
Now there's cell phones,
hashtags, social media.

745
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:20,754
Ask me, technology did not
exactly improve our lives.

746
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:25,889
You're right about that.

747
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:34,811
I gotta hand it to you, Gus.
You almost pulled it off.

748
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:37,945
Not sure what you're saying.

749
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:41,905
You know, one thing I can't
figure out is...

750
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,473
How did you know Garrett would
be at the warehouse?

751
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:48,086
Now I definitely don't know
what you're saying.

752
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,132
We know about the gun, Gus.

753
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:54,353
The Glock 17 you took off
Frank Delgado.

754
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,271
We traced the ballistics.

755
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:06,060
Hard to make a case
without recovering the gun.

756
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,368
We can place you
at the warehouse

757
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,544
at the time of the murder.

758
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,076
How did you know he was there?

759
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,993
You asking as a cop or a friend?

760
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,041
I'm asking.

761
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,137
When I heard that animal
got released,

762
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,313
something just snapped.

763
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,189
I gave my life for this job
and it was all a joke.

764
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,625
There's no justice anymore.

765
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:52,237
The system is totally broken.

766
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,071
So you know what I did?

767
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:06,990
I hit the streets,
just like the old days.

768
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:09,123
I went digging back
into that world,

769
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,299
worked some leads,
squeezed an old C.I.,

770
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:14,128
and found out where
the meet was happening.

771
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,738
So you take him out
during a deal.

772
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,566
Bad guys killing bad guys.

773
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,613
What's CPD's new name for it?

774
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:24,182
- Mutual combatants.
- Mutual combatants.

775
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,400
Yeah.

776
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,968
Figured the CPD wouldn't look
too hard.

777
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:30,013
I had no idea
you guys were so close

778
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,103
to setting him up.

779
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:36,324
The world's a better place
without Matthew Garrett.

780
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,499
Don't you agree?

781
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,589
I do.

782
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,766
Maybe you can look
the other way on this one.

783
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,471
I can't, Gus.

784
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,779
Otherwise, Homicide's gonna
jam up one of my guys.

785
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,259
He's...

786
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:01,219
I mean, he's a hell of a cop.

787
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,745
I was a hell of a cop, Hank.

788
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:08,269
23 years.

789
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,228
And I got blown up for putting
a beating on

790
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,533
a convicted rapist.

791
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,666
I lost my career,
I lost my wife,

792
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,711
I lost everything.

793
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:18,540
But this scumbag Garrett?

794
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:19,889
A drug pusher, a killer,

795
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,065
they put him back on the street?

796
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:26,069
He gets 200 grand and I gotta
clip coupons?

797
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,375
What the hell happened?

798
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,476
You know how this works.

799
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,183
Can I have a little time alone?

800
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:02,149
Wanna get a few things in order.

801
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,891
Yeah, sure, of course.

802
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,501
Thanks, Hank.

803
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:11,027
You were always
one of the good ones.

804
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,819
I'll be outside.

805
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,228
Long week.

806
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,318
Yeah.

807
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,062
You all right?

808
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,374
I just keep thinking
about Lauren's mom.

809
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,247
She'll never have closure.

810
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:46,253
I get it, but you can't right
every wrong, Jay.

811
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:50,736
There's just some things,
some people...

812
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,564
You just gotta let it go.

813
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,959
How are you supposed to be
a good cop and let things go?

814
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,874
What's the point of the job?

815
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:02,443
Well, the job is to do
the best that you can.

816
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:07,274
Then you go home, pretend like
the bad stuff never happened.

817
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:11,452
Is that what you do?

818
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:12,845
No.

819
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,849
Yeah, I didn't think so.

820
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,473
Is that Adam?

821
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,301
Yeah.

822
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,610
You should go.

823
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,007
Yeah.

824
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,193
I'll see you later.
