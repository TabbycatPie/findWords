20
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,430
I'm covering the E.R. today.

22
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,660
Gonna be a madhouse.

23
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,130
Yeah.

24
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,430
This emergency room and everyone in it is now under quarantine.

25
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,500
A serious respiratory virus has infected three patients.

26
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,840
Take me to the hospital.

27
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,410
We are going to your appointment

28
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,070
and making sure your think-melon remains tumor-free.

29
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,140
I no longer have an immune system.

30
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,180
My donor's on his way, right?

31
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,300
Why are you answering our donor's phone?

32
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,910
Because he's here in quarantine.

33
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,910
My wife's in there. I need to get in there.

34
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,140
If something happens to me,

35
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,550
our son needs someone to take care of him.

36
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,060
Put your mask back on.

37
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,710
Why?

38
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,520
Because I'm infected.

39
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,810
On the bright side, I think I'm growing on Morgan.

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,090
Dr. Reznick.

41
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,800
Morgan.

42
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,630
He doesn't need to die.

43
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,080
He signed a DNR.

44
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
He shouldn't have.

45
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,350
We're gonna get his donor's marrow.

46
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,230
You need surgery now.

47
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,440
There's no operating room.

48
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,200
We will have to improvise.

49
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,940
Use your finger to plug the hole.

50
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,980
Now what?

51
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,100
Dr. Lim?

52
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,020
It's back.

53
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,830
Help my son! Help my son!

55
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,270
311 bus.

56
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,390
$2.35.

58
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,980
Left on Blossom Hill...

59
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,220
Kellan!

61
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,140
Right on Cottle Street --

62
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,610
Dr. Murphy?

63
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,360
Left on Santa Teresa --

64
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,420
I think there's something wrong with him.

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,730
- We'll get you a mask. - Can we get a pregnant woman a mask?

66
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,850
Kellan, can you hear me? Please!

67
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,920
It's empty.

68
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
Kellan!

69
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,000
Right on Meridian --

70
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,180
Dr. Reznick needs you.

71
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,470
He's not answering.

72
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,400
Dr. Murphy --

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Don't yell. It'll only make it worse.

74
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay -- what should I do?

75
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,590
Tell him about the surgery.

76
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,100
Give him every detail you can.

77
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,370
Santa Pete...has a torn IMA.

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,210
He's hemorrhaging into his belly.

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,240
His BP at 87 over 54 and dropping.

80
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,050
A saphenous vein graft.

81
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,240
We can repair the IMA

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,460
with a graft from the saphenous vein.

83
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,580
- We just -- - I don't need a diagnosis,

84
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,330
I need an extra set of hands.

85
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,030
Get me a 2-0 silk, vascular clamps, and an 11 blade.

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,110
Clear.

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,260
Charge to 200 joules.

88
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,010
Clear!

89
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,380
We just saved his life... and violated his rights.

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,070
We could lose our licenses.

91
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,140
You won't. You were following instructions

92
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,340
- given by an attending. - No, I wasn't --

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,330
Let's get him stabilized so I can go to Andrews

94
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,730
and talk to him about getting him some marrow

95
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,300
so this wasn't a waste of time.

96
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,280
Keep your lips together

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,340
and breathe like you're blowing out a candle.

98
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,350
I c-- I can't -- I-I can't.

99
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,680
Kel -- deep breaths. Deep breaths.

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,880
You're a doctor, right? Any update on the virus --

101
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,330
- Do I have it? - No -- no rash, no fever.

102
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,940
This is your asthma --

103
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,510
When can we go home --

104
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,460
Your lungs are hyper-inflated --

105
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,910
They better send in more doctors,

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,060
because that weirdo melted down --

107
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,180
Everybody shut up!

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,450
Just shut the hell up.

109
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,650
We have multiple people in serious condition,

110
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,400
including a senior doctor and my son.

111
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,130
Your questions are gonna have to wait.

112
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,180
I need a nebulizer.

113
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,680
It's in isolation -- with the infected patients.

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,270
I'll order one in from pharmacy --

115
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,170
No time.

116
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,630
Making your own nebulizer?

117
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,690
Something like that.

118
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,620
You broke in?

119
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,250
No.

120
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,330
Dad -- I saw the Taser.

121
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,710
I didn't use it. Just threatened to...

122
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,770
That was dumb.

123
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,720
Long, deep breaths.

124
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,410
You got her on maximal oxygen?

125
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,840
Yeah. Her vitals have recovered slightly.

126
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,720
The CDC is sending a PCR test

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,680
based off the virus in the Malaysian outbreak.

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,270
So what's their treatment protocol?

129
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,770
Antivirals, steroids, inhaled nitric oxide

130
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,800
and anti-TNF receptor antibodies.

131
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,680
That's what we did for the two plane patients.

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,270
And Tyler.

133
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,990
We got to Dr. Lim sooner, that should make a difference.

134
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,410
How's Dr. Murphy?

135
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,630
He's fine.

136
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,360
I saw his breakdown on the security feed.

137
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,790
Better. He's closing on Santa Pete.

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,660
Do you have a strategy for dealing with him?

139
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,410
- Dr. Park and I can -- - Park's in there?

140
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,430
When did that happen?

141
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,900
Just a few minutes ago.

142
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,540
He came in to help his son.

143
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,770
Perfect.

144
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,460
You're still here?

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
What did they say?

146
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,030
Very kind of you.

147
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,880
No wonder you and Shaun get along so well.

148
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,140
What did they say?

149
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,010
Did the new tests show anything new?

150
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,880
They need time to process the CT images,

151
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,740
send them off to Dr. Blaize.

152
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,460
So you might have been wrong about your cancer coming back?

153
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,560
No.

154
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,000
No?

155
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,760
How can you know you're not wrong

156
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
if you don't know you're not wrong?

157
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,240
This is how they do it.

158
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,990
First they tell you there might be something,

159
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,370
and then they order new tests to test the previous tests --

160
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,060
only to inform you that it was what they suspected all along.

161
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,480
Very effective way of breaking bad news.

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,330
Okay...

163
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,490
And if your tumor really is back, what does that mean?

164
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,130
It means that I had surgery

165
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,480
and let them pump radiation into my brain for nothing.

166
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,340
It means that my memory loss is because my brain is dying.

167
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,370
It means that I probably have a year, maybe 14 months.

168
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,770
Enough meaning for you?

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,970
What are we gonna tell Shaun?

170
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,050
Nothing.

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,030
St. Bonaventure's opened up a room for family and friends.

172
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,290
You want to come?

173
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,740
We expand the quarantine, we move our marrow donor

174
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,570
and our patient into --

175
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,120
If the donor has the virus, his marrow will transmit it

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,620
to your immunocompromised patient.

177
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,500
He'll be dead in hours.

178
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,450
As he will be without the transplant.

179
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,850
We create a sterile pathway from the E.R.

180
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,310
into this procedure room using polyethylene sheeting --

181
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,340
No, you won't.

182
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,020
The only people taking any risks here are my people,

183
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,170
the patient, and the donor --

184
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,840
And this hospital and everyone in it if you screw anything up.

185
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,760
But my larger objection is... it won't work.

186
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,270
That procedure room isn't negative pressure,

187
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,850
which leaves the virus free to escape to the main vent system.

188
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,160
I'll figure something else --

189
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,670
Janitors' closets.

190
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,440
They're negative pressure

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,450
because of the cleansers, sterilizing agents.

192
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,800
Don't want those odors and toxins

193
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,880
to disperse to patient areas.

194
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,220
Here.

195
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,820
That closet doesn't have room for two patients.

196
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,170
We can do the extraction there, but not the transplant.

197
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,770
We could use this linen room, in the basement,

198
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,700
which is also negative pressure

199
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,300
and connects to the janitors' closet

200
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,840
through this laundry chute.

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,420
Once the bone marrow is extracted,

202
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,180
it'd travel through the laundry chute into the linen room.

203
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,840
Where you could do the transplant.

204
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,720
Dr. Murphy?

205
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,360
Update me on patient status.

206
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,280
Santa Pete's vitals are stable,

207
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,330
no sign of post-op infection.

208
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,280
Toby is in Bay 3 receiving an IV drip;

209
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,610
Ester's ST --

210
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,810
I think you're overloading him.

211
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,340
No. When he's dealing with medicine,

212
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,540
he's not distracted by... everything else.

213
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,730
It helps. Keep going, Shaun.

214
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,170
Ester's ST depressions have improved.

215
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,410
That should help, too.

216
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,020
Ester's ST depressions have improved,

217
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,330
and Viola's water broke.

218
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,710
What? When?

219
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,780
It appears quite recently.

221
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,470
Given you're only 36 weeks gestationally,

222
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,110
and there's no sign of infection,

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,610
the baby should be able to stay in utero for at least 24 hours.

224
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,060
If the quarantine is done before --

225
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,120
You're not gonna fall apart again, are you?

226
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,230
I don't think so, Viola.

227
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,070
The buzzing is gone, and there is much less yelling.

228
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,440
Except you.

229
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,900
It was the buzzing and the yelling,

230
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,060
not the fact that we're trapped with three people

231
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,790
who have died from a highly infectious disease?

232
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,370
That's not something to worry about.

233
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,090
I either have the virus or I don't,

234
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,700
and, based on past national quarantine mortality rates,

235
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,960
we have a very good statistical chance of surviving.

236
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,540
But I didn't know that I would "fall apart" the first time,

237
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,940
so I may be wrong.

238
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Here you go.

239
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,150
You always talk like that?

240
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,300
Like what?

241
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,200
Just say whatever you're thinking

242
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,440
when you're thinking it?

243
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,090
Yes. It's good to be honest.

244
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,230
Wish my dad was like that.

245
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,950
Dr. Park is very honest. He always shares his opinions.

246
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,260
There's opinions. And then there's feelings.

247
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,370
Your dad doesn't tell you that he loves you?

248
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,550
What?

249
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,040
Well, he's just... not really there for us.

250
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,980
He did just risk his life, and his career,

251
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,310
to break into a quarantine to help you.

252
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,950
That's true.

253
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,840
But most kids want their dad there

254
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,670
even when it's not life and death.

255
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,080
Sorry for your loss.

256
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,920
Status?

257
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,950
O2 SAT is 92,

258
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,160
respiratory rate is down to 16.

259
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,640
Your lungs sound clearer.

260
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,930
Keep pulmonary edema to a minimum

261
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,250
with conservative fluid management.

262
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,090
Use furosemide so my CVP's under 8.

263
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,330
Absolutely.

264
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,240
I love this place.

265
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,900
I always said I'd be doing this 'til the day I died.

266
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Ta-da.

267
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,020
We started your treatment early.

268
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,030
You'll be back to repairing late-night, drunken head injuries in no time.

269
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,720
I forgot to call my mom on her birthday.

270
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,010
I forgot to do a lot of stuff...

271
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,820
Tyler was sweet.

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,270
He was a good guy.

273
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,890
Best to put him out of sight.

274
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,580
It's not a healthy reminder... for either of us.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,650
Tyler's mask had a tear in it.

276
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,480
It's possible the virus is droplet-based,

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
not airborne.

278
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,090
Blood or saliva could've made its way through his mask

279
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,770
from the airline passengers.

280
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,780
Unfortunately, until we know for sure,

281
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,980
we're still on lockdown.

282
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,580
But I'll let the CDC know.

283
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,640
Do you have a minute?

284
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,980
Is it urgent?

285
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,120
Not really.

286
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,080
Kel --

287
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,570
What's up?

288
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,820
Why'd you move away?

289
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm a resident, you go where the job takes you.

290
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,720
They don't need doctors in Phoenix?

291
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,190
This was an excellent opportunity for me.

292
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,770
And it's less than a two-hour flight; I'm not --

293
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,390
You had my baseball schedule for months

294
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
and you came for one game

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,210
and you were on your computer the entire time.

296
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,590
I had exams the next day.

297
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,830
So why'd you bother coming?

298
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,800
Good...

299
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,840
Slowly...

300
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,900
Good...

301
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,710
As delicious as these ice chips are,

302
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,120
I think I'm ready for some solid food;

303
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,670
did they send in any cookies?

304
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,990
Dr. Murphy was very clear -- no food until you fart.

305
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,270
Just imagine they're straight from the North Pole.

306
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,020
- Bob, you ready? - Of course.

307
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,340
I'm doing a bone marrow extraction,

308
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,020
and I need an extra set of hands to handle some bloody stuff...

309
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,140
separating bone and fat from stem cells.

310
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,920
Who here isn't freaked out by what I just said and can help?

311
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,410
Ester's a doctor.

312
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,890
You're a doctor? Why haven't you --

313
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,550
Veterinarian. Retired.

314
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,180
Blood is blood. Follow us.

315
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,430
Fetal heart rate is still between 130 and 140 BPM.

316
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,450
Contractions 17 minutes apart.

317
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,220
What's happening? Is it my baby?

318
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,190
Viola's BP is 180 over 100.

319
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,790
She may have preeclampsia and an oncoming seizure.

320
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,390
We need to induce labor.

321
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,450
No. He's not being born in here.

322
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,840
We are waiting for quarantine to end.

323
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,730
Your placenta isn't getting enough blood flow.

324
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,160
We need to get him out.

325
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,320
This is going to be your first baby.

326
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,030
And mine.

327
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,770
Start bronchodilators.

328
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,330
Dr. Lim, can you hear me?

329
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,280
O2 SATs are still dropping.

330
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,710
Push paralytics.

331
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,380
Starting intubation.

332
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,920
Hello? What's going on?

333
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,770
What's going on?

334
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,940
Lim's O2 SATs are crashing. Her lungs aren't inflating.

335
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,030
They're filled with fluid and secretions.

336
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,180
- Pick up the phone. - I've got my hands full.

337
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,010
Villanueva, pick up the phone.

338
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,960
Okay, show me what's going on.

339
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,670
She's in full respiratory failure.

340
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,340
She needs more pulmonary support.

341
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,370
Get her on BiPAP.

342
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,800
That might buy us some time.

343
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,780
Or we take her lungs out of the equation.

344
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,840
We put her on ECMO,

345
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,170
oxygenate her blood outside her body...

346
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,590
her lungs will have time to heal.

347
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,810
We can't do ECMO in the E.R.

348
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,440
We aren't supposed to do abdominal surgery

349
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,580
in the E.R., either.

350
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,190
Please, walk me through it.

351
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,170
Prep an area over her femoral vein.

352
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,560
That's very loud.

353
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,240
Any crowning, Dr. Murphy?

354
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,770
No, she's dilated at 6 centimeters,

355
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,950
and I don't feel the head.

356
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,350
It's been seven hours since her water broke.

357
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,880
The baby's stuck. Use Leopold's maneuvers

358
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,840
to identify the location of the baby.

359
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,660
The fetus is transverse.

360
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,070
He's lying roughly thirty degrees to the left side.

361
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,500
We can't deliver the baby.

362
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,750
What?! Why not?

363
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,770
We need to turn the baby.

364
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,600
We need to do an external cephalic version.

365
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,510
Or a C-section.

366
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,120
I have assisted on several...

367
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,070
In operating rooms with an experienced attending.

368
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,280
We are not doing a C-section here.

369
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,210
Tilt her bed. I'll grab the gel.

370
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,260
Okay.

371
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,670
So when...?

372
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,880
What? When what?

373
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,770
I get not telling him when he's in quarantine.

374
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,260
He's got enough on his plate, but...

375
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,230
Never.

376
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,060
You told him when you were first diagnosed.

377
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,790
Yes, and that was a mistake.

378
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,300
He forced you take tests that saved your life.

379
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,870
Well, no, as it turns out, it didn't.

380
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,300
And he became so obsessed and distracted

381
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,440
that he nearly killed a patient.

382
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,930
He's your friend.

383
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,570
I'm his mentor. It's not his job to take care of me.

384
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,770
Make sure you turn the needle

385
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,510
so you're getting marrow from all sides.

386
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,140
Aspirate slower.

387
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,920
If you pull fast, it's more painful.

388
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,140
Hang in there, Bob.

389
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,700
I deserve a little pain.

390
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,130
You're his dad. You're saving his life.

391
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,190
I took off before my son even knew who I was,

392
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,550
traveled in crappy vans

393
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,260
to s-stay at crappy hotels

394
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,600
and play crappy music,

395
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,700
all so I could earn enough to get high.

396
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,140
You're here now.

397
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,180
By the time I got up the nerve to face them,

398
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,130
my ex was dying.

399
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,660
God willing I did it in time to save my son.

400
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,780
Dr. Melendez, Chris's vitals are bottoming out.

401
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,360
His secretions and lung sounds are worse.

402
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,050
I don't know how much longer we can wait.

403
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,510
Administer Levophed, and prep him for transplant.

404
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,000
Dr. Park, Chris's in hypotensive crisis.

405
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,990
- Go faster! - Fast as I can.

406
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,460
You ready, Dr. Murphy?

407
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,220
Yes. I can feel the head.

408
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,550
We need to rotate in the same direction.

409
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,590
Deep breaths, Viola.

410
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,250
Okay.

411
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,520
Oh, I can't -- I can't do this!

412
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,390
Squeeze my arm hard as you can.

413
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,820
The fetus is moving.

414
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,880
The head is facing the cervix.

415
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,840
One more push.

416
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,110
- We just need - Stop!

417
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,620
Placental abruption.

418
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,090
She's hemorrhaging.

419
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,000
Baby's heart rate is decelerating.

420
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,340
I need 2 large-bore I.V. lines 

421
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,920
and start 2 units PRBC.

422
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,500
Then please page an OB-GYN

423
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,670
to supervise my first solo surgery.

424
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,570
This is terrible.

425
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,210
This is not how it's supposed to --

426
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,710
This is excellent.

427
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,300
Dr. Garcia will be supervising me for the C-section.

428
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,590
She's the director of Obstetrics and Gynecology here.

429
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,300
I'm sure she's much more qualified

430
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,180
than your personal OB-GYN.

431
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,350
Relax. You're gonna be fine. What's the status?

432
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,680
Nerve block is in,

433
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,600
and I gave her a liter bolus of saline.

434
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,150
Throw some ChloraPrep down

435
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,670
and make a five centimeter Pfannenstiel incision.

436
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,770
Ten-blade.

437
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,050
Chris's prepped.

438
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,560
Inserting central line now.

439
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,060
How's he doing?

440
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,790
Pressure is 90 over 50, O2 SATs are 85,

441
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,350
heart rate is at 110.

442
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,820
Ready when you are.

443
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,740
One more and we're good to go.

444
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,200
I'm on my way.

445
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,740
I'm scrubbing in. Call me the second you're ready for the drop.

446
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,160
Abdomen is open. Retraction.

447
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,920
Suction.

448
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,060
Baby's BPM is 110 and dropping.

449
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,130
What's happening?

450
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,380
Dr. Murphy, do you see the uterine wall?

451
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,320
Blood pressure is dropping.

452
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,850
Dr. Murphy, the uterine wall.

453
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,430
Dr. Murphy?

454
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,740
You need to make a gradual shallow incision

455
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,530
and cut through it.

456
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,830
You do not want to nick the baby.

457
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,040
- What's happening? - BPM is 95.

458
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,750
Dr. Murphy, please!

459
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,830
Dr. Murphy, should we turn up her oxygen?

460
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,210
Dr. Murphy, you need to make the cut.

461
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,730
Dr. Murphy. Dr. Murphy.

462
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,360
No!

463
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,920
Quiet! Everyone quiet!

464
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,790
I need to concentrate!

465
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,970
I can see the head.

466
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,030
Is my baby okay?

467
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,990
He's not breathing. We need to start CPR now.

468
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,200
Get a pediatric Ambu-bag

469
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,270
and start two-finger chest compressions.

470
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,800
There's something wrong with Viola.

471
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,960
She's hypotensive and tachycardic.

472
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,070
She's bleeding out.

473
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,430
You should tell him.

474
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,360
Look at that. Another reason why you two

475
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,620
are so good together.

476
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,980
Neither one of you are willing to drop a thing.

477
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,690
He deserves to know.

478
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,940
Deserves?

479
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,900
Is that how things work in your world?

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,860
People get what they deserve?

481
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Shaun deserves to be toyed with?

482
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,070
- Who's toying with him? - You.

483
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,030
I'm his friend.

484
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,220
You whisk him away on a road trip,

485
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,330
kiss him and then leave town.

486
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,580
Now you pop back into his life, move in with him.

487
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,100
Shaun's not some hamster you get to play with

488
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,130
and then not think twice about it when you forget to feed him.

489
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,420
You're gonna hurt him again. You know that.

490
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,430
I know that.

491
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm gonna let that slide because you're dying.

493
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,310
I'm gonna take this outside.

494
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,700
Bubble wrap?

495
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,120
Need to make sure it doesn't break on the trip.

496
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,580
Or the landing.

497
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,670
Dr. Melendez, we're ready.

499
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,790
Copy. Deposit the marrow now.

500
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,640
The marrow is intact.

501
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,730
We're good to go.

502
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,110
My chest...

503
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,070
It really hurts.

504
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,460
He's going into cardiac arrest.

505
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,740
- What can I do? - His I.V. is blown.

506
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,890
The tip broke off.

507
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,120
It must be in his heart.

508
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,920
Come on.

509
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,560
Dr. Murphy, the rules of medical priority are clear.

510
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,050
Focus on saving the mother.

511
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,800
Dr. Murphy, you need to stop now.

512
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,050
Dr. Murphy.

513
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,340
Dr. Murphy?

514
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,560
We can save them both.

515
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,330
Get me a liter of saline, a plastic bag,

516
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,730
some surgical tape and Kerlix gauze, please.

517
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,110
Who knows CPR?

518
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,280
Who knows CPR?

519
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,450
- Um, in Health, they ma-- - Come with me.

520
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,300
Okay, two fingers right here in the middle of his chest.

521
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,430
Press down twice per second,

522
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,790
every fifteen seconds, stop and squeeze the bag.

523
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,390
- Twice... - Yes, don't press too hard,

524
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,960
or you'll crush his heart.

525
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,250
Okay.

526
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,200
You're making a Bakri tamponade balloon for Viola's bleed?

527
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
- Yes. - What is that supposed to do?

528
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,450
It will control the bleeding by applying pressure

529
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,290
- from the inside. - How's the baby?

530
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,460
I don't know if this is working.

531
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,610
- I just... - Don't stop.

532
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,330
Are you ready, Dr. Murphy?

533
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,700
Feed the end of the pack slowly through her cervix.

534
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,030
Once you reach the fundus of the uterus, start inflation.

535
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,500
Clear.

536
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,350
- That's the fourth one. - I have to crack his chest.

537
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,710
- Here? - Get me rib spreaders

538
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,130
and a ten blade from the crash cart.

539
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,760
Marrow's in.

540
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,720
Heart rate's 84, BP's 100 over 60 --

541
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,890
vitals look good.

542
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,570
I'm sorry about before.

543
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,660
Are you gonna tell Shaun you got some good news?

544
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,640
What makes you think it's good news?

545
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,710
Because you apologized.

546
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,500
The cancer's not back.

547
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,770
- That's great. - It's not great.

548
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,300
It's okay. It's not great.

549
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,440
I have meningitis from a CSF leak in my head.

550
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,010
I have to have surgery pretty much immediately.

551
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,850
And, no, I am not telling Shaun.

552
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,450
You're right about one thing.

553
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,600
You're not his friend.

554
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,370
Because friends tell each other everything.

555
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,150
And you're a lousy mentor.

556
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,250
Friends are there for each other, and mentors teach.

557
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,570
They don't hide the truth.

558
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm just looking out for him.

559
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,970
He's not like you. He's not like everybody el--

560
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,090
No, he's not,

561
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,640
but he's also not some helpless child

562
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,310
who constantly needs protection.

563
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,710
He's an adult;

564
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,710
a very smart, caring adult.

565
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,840
And you could really use someone like that right now.

566
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,240
It's not working. She's still bleeding.

567
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,770
Keep injecting saline.

568
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,800
Vitals are 80 over 60. Heart rate's 110.

569
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,090
Stop CPR.

570
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,290
I need to see if he can breathe on his own.

571
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,250
Is everything okay?

572
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,600
No. His lungs are filled with fluid.

573
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,690
He's drowning.

574
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,590
Get the pediatric laryngoscope stat.

575
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,940
Dr. Andrews, she's still --

576
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,180
It's not Andrews.

577
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,180
Can I see her?

578
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,820
MAP is holding steady at 65,

579
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,100
but she was dipping into serious hypoxia for a short bit.

580
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,610
Can I see her?

581
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,160
Good work, taking care of her.

582
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,830
Thank you.

583
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,030
The baby has meconium aspiration.

584
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,310
Suction catheter.

585
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,450
Is that bad?

586
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,200
Fecal matter has settled in his lungs.

587
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,410
It's blocking his airway.

588
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,160
Did I do something wrong?

589
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,830
You most likely dislodged some of it.

590
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,610
Without that, he would've suffocated by now.

591
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,610
Clearing his airway.

592
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,160
It's the most important moment of my life.

593
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,200
And I'm not there with Viola.

594
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,120
This is the way it used to be done.

595
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,290
The men waiting outside.

596
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,960
Now we know better.

597
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,630
Now we know it matters.

598
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,730
Do you think your grandfather loved your father

599
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,510
- any less just beca-- - Shut up.

600
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,760
Ignore him. He's just a grouch.

601
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,190
Is that...?

602
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,070
I think you've got yourself a new alarm clock.

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,490
Congratulations!

604
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,580
Congratulations.

605
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,450
I'm a dad.

606
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,520
He is okay.

607
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,480
A Christmas miracle.

608
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,910
Thank you.

609
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,740
It's Lim.

610
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,670
Could I get some water?

611
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,010
ECMO?

612
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,510
That was a ballsy move.

613
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,070
Ester Blum, Pete Bailey --

614
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,970
your PCR and serology came back negative for the virus.

615
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,410
You're officially cleared.

616
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,500
We're going home.

617
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,500
Only Ester can go home.

618
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,880
You're going to post-op recovery for another day.

619
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,090
I'll keep you company.

620
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
There's someone I want to see up there anyway.

621
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,450
On Dasher, on Dancer,

622
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,390
on Prancer and Vixen.

623
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,940
You are stable,

624
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,900
no sign of marrow rejection.

625
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,170
We will be monitoring you over the next few weeks,

626
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,700
but remission is a very real possibility.

627
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,910
I don't know how to thank you enough.

628
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,170
Guess I should thank my dad too.

629
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,460
Is he here?

630
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,170
There was a complication during extraction.

631
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,170
Bob's heart stopped.

632
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,220
And we did everything we could to revive him, but

633
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,390
he died.

634
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,140
What?

635
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,440
We're so sorry for your loss.

636
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,110
Are you Chris Santos?

637
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,820
My name is Ester.

638
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,870
I was with your father when he...

639
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,920
He mentioned that he had lot of regrets.

640
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,260
But it meant a lot to him that he could help you.

641
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,400
Heard you were a big help during that delivery.

642
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,650
They needed extra hands.

643
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,210
You asked me why I let you and your mom go,

644
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,460
why I didn't fight harder.

645
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,020
It's because I wasn't a good person.

646
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,890
I wasn't a good father.

647
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,360
My dad had this mantra --

648
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,030
Be like stone, never cry.

649
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,700
If I got emotional or upset -- he'd repeat it:

650
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,460
be like stone,never cry.

651
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,480
It made me stronger --

652
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,340
which wasn't always a good thing.

653
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,010
Spent my life living behind a wall --

654
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,010
which meant your mom got to live with that wall as well,

655
00:36:51,490 --> 00:37:01,020
and when we split up, I felt like a failure.

656
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:08,700
Moving away helped me hide from that.

657
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,410
My father's voice is still in my head.

658
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,290
But I'm working on getting it to be quiet.

659
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,300
I love you, Kellan.

660
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,430
Always will.

661
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,180
Kellan!

662
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,980
Mom!

663
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,120
Are you okay?

664
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,570
I'm fine. I, uh --

665
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,110
I helped deliver a baby.

666
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,360
He was amazing.

667
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,410
It's good to see you, Mia.

668
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,080
How was it in there?

669
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,580
The guy I worked on didn't make it.

670
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,530
Merry Christmas.

671
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,410
I don't think I'll forget this one.

672
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,460
Me neither.

673
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,800
The idea of you not being around wasn't okay with me.

674
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,970
Who would I drink bourbon with?

675
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,600
I think my bourbon days are behind me for a little while.

676
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,480
I'll wait.

677
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,070
Shaun!

678
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,660
You must be exhausted.

679
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,510
And hungry.

680
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,350
All the sandwiches they gave us had pickles in them.

681
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,670
Oh, that's no good.

682
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,850
How about we go to that 24-hour breakfast place

683
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,560
and get some pancakes?

684
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,760
I would like that very much.

685
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,300
- Hello, Dr. Glassman. - Hello.

686
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,940
- I delivered a baby. - Yes, we heard.

687
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,570
I'm sorry I couldn't drive you to your appointment.

688
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,720
How did it go?

689
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,270
I have meningitis.

690
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,420
I have to have surgery later today

691
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,900
to fix the CSF leak in my head.

692
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,950
I thought you should know.

693
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,430
That's good.

694
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,540
Meningitis is definitely not as bad as cancer.

695
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,690
It also explains your memory loss.

696
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,130
Now you can get your license back.

697
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,180
Shaun, would you mind if Glassy gave you a hug?

698
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,140
I think that would be very nice.

699
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,730
Very proud of you.
