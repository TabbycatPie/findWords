1
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:11,085
<i>My objective is that by 2010,</i>

2
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:15,405
Force India Formula One team
will rightfully occupy

3
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:16,885
a place on the podium.

4
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:23,685
<i>I'm Vijay Mallya,</i>

5
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:27,405
Team Principal
of Sahara Force India Formula One.

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:32,125
<i>I have always been passionate</i>
<i>about cars and racing cars.</i>

7
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,485
<i>So to acquire a Formula One team,</i>
<i>it's like a dream come true.</i>

8
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,405
<i>Nobody ever thought</i>
<i>that there would be</i>

9
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:42,765
<i>an Indian Formula One team on the grid.</i>

10
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,605
It was just too expensive.

11
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:48,365
<i>And it seemed more like</i>
<i>a pipe dream than a real dream.</i>

12
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:53,605
<i>From where we started</i>
<i>to finish fourth, two years running,</i>

13
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:56,605
<i>there can be no greater satisfaction.</i>

14
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,325
<i>We did it once again, guys!</i>
<i>Once again!</i>

15
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:05,605
<i>Sergio Perez picks up</i>
<i>a very unlikely podium.</i>

16
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,645
<i>Brilliant, Checo!</i>
<i>Absolutely brilliant.</i>

17
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,285
<i>Now there are constant rumors</i>
<i>about offers to buy the team,</i>

18
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:17,645
<i>but I've invested blood,</i>
<i>sweat and tears</i>

19
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,565
<i>into Force India.</i>

20
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,365
<i>So I'm fighting every step of the way.</i>

21
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:36,325
<i>Vijay's always been one of</i>
<i>Formula One's more colorful characters,</i>

22
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,325
<i>known as the king of good times.</i>

23
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:44,685
But Force India's success has come
from making every penny work for them.

24
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,045
<i>They're one of the most efficient outfits</i>
<i>in the sport.</i>

25
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,725
<i>When you look at Force India</i>
<i>and McLaren over the last few years,</i>

26
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,525
they're completely mirror images
of one another,

27
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:59,205
because while Force India
has achieved so much with so little,

28
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,685
<i>McLaren,</i>
<i>one of the biggest names in the sport,</i>

29
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:04,605
seems to be achieving
so little with so much.

30
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:09,165
<i>Oh, not another problem</i>
<i>for McLaren...</i>

31
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:12,085
<i>I lost drive...</i>
<i>I need to park up.</i>

32
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,925
- <i>Copy, Stoffel, copy.</i>
<i>- I don't have the same power.</i>

33
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,765
<i> We can't fix it.</i>
<i>We can't fix it.</i>

34
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:21,765
<i>Mate, I have no brakes, no tires.</i>

35
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,365
<i>We are out of the points.</i>

36
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,525
<i>I will try to do whatever,</i>
<i>but I don't care too much.</i>

37
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,525
<i>Sounded like a driver who wants</i>
<i>to call it a day, didn't it?</i>

38
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:36,965
<i>Fernando Alonso becomes</i>
<i>the first retirement of this Grand Prix.</i>

39
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,565
<i>And Zak Brown not happy.</i>

40
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:42,085
<i>Not where they expected</i>
<i>to be or want to be.</i>

41
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,645
Eric, do you accept any responsibility

42
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,045
for the failings of this car?

43
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,725
And will you resign?

44
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,925
Um, obviously, we are all responsible
for the car performance.

45
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:59,565
Uh, we are not where we want to be,
we are not happy where we are...

46
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:02,685
Do you expect still to be
in your job at Silverstone?

47
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,765
Good morning, Fernando. How are you?

48
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,885
Good. Where are you?

49
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:23,045
So I wanted to let you know,
and we can chat about it further.

50
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:28,725
Uh, last night
I accepted, uh, Eric's resignation.

51
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,885
Lots of pressure on the team,
as we all know,

52
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:33,725
and he's been taking the brunt of it.

53
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:36,805
Obviously it's been a tough
three, four years for him,

54
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:40,045
and he felt, in order
for us to move forward

55
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,445
with all the pressure,
that it was best he stepped aside.

56
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,805
I think we got great people.

57
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:51,445
We're gonna recruit some people
and, you know, get the team, uh...

58
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:55,285
turned around
and make McLaren great again.

59
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:02,845
<i>I think Fernando's one of the best</i>
<i>drivers in the history of Formula One.</i>

60
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:07,125
<i>Two-time world champion,</i>
<i>won over thirty races,</i>

61
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,725
<i>recognized by many</i>
<i>to be the best driver in the world.</i>

62
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,085
<i>When you have a driver</i>
<i>of Fernando's caliber,</i>

63
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,165
<i>you wanna keep them</i>
<i>in your racing team.</i>

64
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,925
At the top, there's
one guy responsible now

65
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,605
and you're talking to him.

66
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,365
So the the buck stops with me.
You're absolutely right.

67
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:33,925
Yeah.

68
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,765
<i>Any time you're responsible</i>
<i>for a large organization,</i>

69
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,805
<i>that comes with a lot of pressure.</i>

70
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:43,805
So I like that first question 'cause
it'll also suck up about five minutes.

71
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:44,925
Yeah. That's good.

72
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,925
How's your search
for a technical director going?

73
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,725
Nope. We've already had it.
So, let's get rid of that one.

74
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,365
<i>It's a huge responsibility.</i>

75
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,285
<i>If you can't cope with the pressure,</i>
<i>you can't take the heat,</i>

76
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,645
<i>get out of the kitchen.</i>

77
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,005
Um, he's asked Zak to address

78
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,405
whether it was a voluntary resignation
by mutual agreement.

79
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:03,325
Yeah. It's inappropriate for me
to get into any details

80
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:07,165
-of the conversation that Eric and I had.
-Yeah. Those are private matters.

81
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,565
<i>Zak Brown hasn't come from a position</i>

82
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,365
<i>of running a big racing team,</i>

83
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,005
so he's got a huge, huge job on his hands,

84
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,925
especially when you consider
he's got a two-time world champion

85
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:23,965
<i>in Fernando Alonso,</i>
<i>who demands nothing but the best.</i>

86
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:30,645
<i>Force India</i>
<i>could never afford an Alonso</i>

87
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,565
<i>or a Lewis Hamilton or a Vettel.</i>

88
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,605
It's not a one man show.
It's a team effort.

89
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:38,885
And I guess I hired the right guys.

90
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:43,725
<i>I hired Otmar</i>
<i>as the Chief Operating Officer.</i>

91
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,965
I think he shares
the same passion and ambition.

92
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,845
<i>Drivers, we have Checo Perez.</i>

93
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,925
<i>He's a gutsy driver</i>
<i>and he's got great race craft.</i>

94
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:56,845
<i>Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>here's a guy who's young,</i>

95
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,725
<i>he's passionate,</i>
<i>he's hungry, and he's got talent.</i>

96
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,925
<i>Nice job, Esteban. Nice job.</i>

97
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:08,005
<i>I think he surprised us all</i>
<i>in his first full year in Formula One...</i>

98
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,925
<i>and did himself proud.</i>

99
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,525
Hi, Carlo.
We are here with Roberta.

100
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,605
And she wanted to let you know

101
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,965
that she deserve a lot of present,
a lot of attention.

102
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,965
Oh, thank you, guys!
Yes!

103
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:26,605
The fact that the team is able
to compete and perform

104
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,325
<i>at such a high level</i>
<i>is absolutely incredible...</i>

105
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:33,205
especially when you consider
the personal difficulties

106
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,805
that Vijay Mallya's
been going through.

107
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,805
<i>Today, it's the fall from grace</i>

108
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:46,565
<i>of one of India's most high profile</i>
<i>businessmen, Vijay Mallya.</i>

109
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:49,765
<i>Prosecution has told the court</i>
<i>that Vijay Mallya avoided attempts</i>

110
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:53,365
<i>to repay loans to banks,</i>
<i>did not disclose assets,</i>

111
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,805
<i>allegedly diverted loan money</i>
<i>to motor racing.</i>

112
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:59,845
The allegations are baseless,
unfounded, deliberate.

113
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:02,205
It doesn't look good
on your Formula One team,

114
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,925
does it, apart from anything else?

115
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:13,805
<i>Right now, I'm in forced exile.</i>

116
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,365
<i>I am absolutely not guilty</i>

117
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:21,965
<i>of any one of these preposterous charges.</i>

118
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,645
<i>That is the truth.</i>

119
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,245
It can't be helpful to Force India

120
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,405
to have Vijay facing such difficulties.

121
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:38,045
<i>And with the banks in India wanting</i>
<i>to get hold of him,</i>

122
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,965
<i>Vijay can't be seen</i>
<i>to be spending loads and loads of money</i>

123
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,045
when other people are chasing him
for loads and loads of money.

124
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,645
<i>There isn't that cash flow</i>
<i>to Force India anymore,</i>

125
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:47,685
<i>so it's going to be having</i>
<i>some form of impact.</i>

126
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:55,045
I'm Esteban Ocon, 22 years old,

127
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,805
racing for Force India Formula One team.

128
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,925
<i>Vijay, for sure</i>
<i>it's a tough situation...</i>

129
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:04,765
<i>for me, for the race team, at the track,</i>

130
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,205
<i>but I can't focus</i>
<i>on all those things.</i>

131
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:13,765
<i>My job is to stick in the race seat</i>
<i>and put the car as high as I can.</i>

132
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:17,405
<i>That's the only thing I can do</i>
<i>to help the team at the moment.</i>

133
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:22,925
Nice view, huh?

134
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,965
From the first race, basically, I'm here,

135
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:41,445
<i>training hard</i>
<i>and just improving all the aspects.</i>

136
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,085
<i>Mentally, physically...</i>

137
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,205
<i>From my point of view,</i>
<i>here is the best way.</i>

138
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,565
<i>There is nothing except sport here.</i>

139
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:56,205
No girls, no drinks, no distractions.

140
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,005
<i>Get ready. Go!</i>

141
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:05,045
<i> The last season,</i>
<i>it's been a very special season for me.</i>

142
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,565
<i>I was very happy with how I progressed,</i>

143
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:10,405
<i>to be the most successful season</i>
<i>of the team.</i>

144
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:13,485
<i>And that feeling,</i>
<i>I want to have it more and more.</i>

145
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:24,005
<i>When I was a kid, it was</i>
<i>a different life then than everyone else.</i>

146
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,565
<i>Tough times. Yeah, for sure.</i>

147
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,765
<i>My parents,</i>
<i>they don't have a lot of of money.</i>

148
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,205
<i>Well, my dad's, yeah, he's a mechanic.</i>

149
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:43,445
<i>It's really hard to describe the hours</i>
<i>he was doing, when I was going to sleep.</i>

150
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,925
<i>Sometimes he was working all night</i>

151
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:48,605
<i>and I still saw him in the morning</i>
<i>on the same thing.</i>

152
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,925
<i>My dad always was saying,</i>

153
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:55,485
<i>"I want a better life for you</i>
<i>than I had for me."</i>

154
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:02,645
For me, it's everything.
Esteban is my whole life.

155
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:08,165
I'm still here today for him.
Esteban is my greatest pride.

156
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,405
<i>That's my son.</i>

157
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,605
<i>My dad had his workshop.</i>

158
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:19,085
<i>I've always been growing,</i>
<i>seeing engines, fuel, rubber, whatever.</i>

159
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:25,245
<i>I used to be there, you know, playing</i>
<i>with little cars and after that,</i>

160
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,965
<i>you know, I always wanted</i>
<i>to be a racing driver.</i>

161
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,885
Silverstone is a tough track, of course,

162
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,925
because, you know,
it's very quick and very technical.

163
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,885
Okay. I have to close the eyes, though.

164
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,405
<i> I'm a very competitive guy,</i>
<i>you know. I want to be world champion.</i>

165
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,645
<i>I'm not gonna lift the throttle</i>
<i>until I get it.</i>

166
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,485
Stay straight, DRS on,
turn one, flat out.

167
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,445
Turn two, 50 meters.

168
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:11,085
Down the gears. Low corner.
Have to get on the power.

169
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:17,565
Bumpy arrival through there.
Brake. Third gear.

170
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:23,605
Long, long left. Turn seven.
Up on the curb.

171
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:25,645
Back on the power.

172
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,325
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.

173
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:35,125
On the curb.
Flat out for cross.

174
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,285
<i> All the races give</i>
<i>the same amount of points,</i>

175
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:51,125
<i>but there are certain races</i>
<i>that you really want to do well.</i>

176
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,485
<i>Silverstone is very special</i>
<i>as a race for everybody.</i>

177
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,205
<i>Formula One is British.</i>

178
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,885
<i>It's a fantastic event, you know.</i>
<i>You have so many fans.</i>

179
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:10,125
<i>The passion here amongst</i>
<i>the British audience is just exceptional.</i>

180
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:13,205
<i>Silverstone is an iconic Grand Prix.</i>

181
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,405
<i>It's a great circuit.</i>

182
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,845
<i>It is one of the core Grand Prix</i>
<i>that you wanna have success at.</i>

183
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:26,565
<i>Silverstone is always one of the races</i>

184
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,925
<i>that we all want to win one day.</i>

185
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:34,085
<i>A win in Silverstone</i>
<i>makes you feel part of Formula One.</i>

186
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,605
<i>Difficult to explain by words,</i>
<i>but when you are driving</i>

187
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:42,765
<i>and when you are the paddock...</i>
<i>you know, it's the place to be.</i>

188
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,365
<i>It's the home of Formula One.</i>

189
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,245
It feels special, 'cause it's home
and it's the one race of the year

190
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,045
you can drive from your house to.

191
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:59,685
I got your note... this afternoon.
I've gotta do the...

192
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,885
FIA and--

193
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,965
You're important,
but you're not morning important.

194
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,965
You're more, like, afternoon important.

195
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:12,605
Why Eric Boullier was not
the right guy to make McLaren great again?

196
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:17,565
These look like appointments which
have been made on the instruction of

197
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:21,445
or with the intention
of pleasing Fernando above anything else.

198
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,525
Is that fair or unfair?

199
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,925
Oh, it's totally inaccurate.

200
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:29,645
Some things, maybe,
I tried to, you know, give my feedback.

201
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,085
The most important thing is
to improve the car

202
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:35,685
and to be more competitive
and, you know,

203
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:38,805
hopefully from this weekend,
we see a step forward.

204
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:43,805
There is a feeling in the paddock that
Fernando's influence over McLaren

205
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:46,685
is all-telling and all-important.

206
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,485
<i>You know, people will whisper--</i>

207
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,765
<i>Well, it used to be a whisper.</i>
<i>It's not even a whisper anymore...</i>

208
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,805
that, you know,
it's sort of Team Fernando,

209
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,765
um... that he's making the decisions.

210
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,725
And everyone'll be wondering, what have
you done to your hand? Are you all right?

211
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:58,885
Yes. Super.

212
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,565
You haven't been punching
the wall again?

213
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,285
- Not yet.
- Thanks, Fernando.

214
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:08,045
What do you like the most
about the track, which is legendary?

215
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,845
The fast corners.
To drive here in a Formula One car is--

216
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:17,365
It's experience that... you don't get it
in many other tracks.

217
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:18,805
Uh, this is very special.

218
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,805
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you.

219
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:21,845
Thank you, Checo.

220
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,125
Thank you.

221
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,565
What are your thoughts Checo,
on all the shit

222
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,125
that's going on
with McLaren at the moment?

223
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:29,925
Ooh, difficult, no?

224
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:33,725
They are putting in all the people
that Fernando likes and that like him.

225
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,005
For me, it can be an option,

226
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,565
that he could become
a sort of owner of the team.

227
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,525
That's what happens
when a driver controls so much.

228
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,685
How do you do? Hi.

229
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,245
- How do you do? Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

230
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,365
<i>I am the subject</i>

231
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:02,285
<i>of one of the greatest</i>
<i>political witch-hunts in Indian history.</i>

232
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,085
<i>Things are flying at me fast and furious.</i>

233
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,765
<i>And I don't know what</i>
<i>the government is going to do next.</i>

234
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,445
<i>It clearly seems to be getting</i>
<i>more serious behind the scenes.</i>

235
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,205
Vijay's unable to leave the UK
for fear of being arrested,

236
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,205
so the British Grand Prix is the only race

237
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,805
<i>that Vijay can actually physically attend</i>
<i>to watch his own team.</i>

238
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:22,805
Take care.

239
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,445
<i>But he doesn't want</i>
<i>to give up Force India.</i>

240
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,885
- Hi, Vijay.
<i>- It's his pride and joy.</i>

241
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,525
Question to Vijay.

242
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:33,965
There has been renewed speculation

243
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:36,365
about your future ownership
of Force India.

244
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:39,525
How do you respond to that speculation,
the team is for sale?

245
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:46,285
In your question you said,
"Renewed speculation," right?

246
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,165
People have been writing

247
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:55,925
about the ownership of my team
for years now.

248
00:15:56,565 --> 00:16:01,485
I'm sure you will not see anybody
in Force India, indeed myself,

249
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:04,245
walk around with a "for sale'' sign.

250
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,925
Speculation remains speculation.

251
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,325
<i>It's a Saturday,</i>

252
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,525
<i>and the final practice</i>
<i>before qualifying begins.</i>

253
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,365
<i>Silverstone is a brilliant track</i>

254
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:20,845
<i>with the fastest, most exhilarating</i>
<i>corners anywhere on the calendar.</i>

255
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,845
<i>Hamilton is pushing hard!</i>

256
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:32,965
<i>Now, Vettel would love pole position</i>
<i>on British soil.</i>

257
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:36,245
<i>And here comes Brendon Hartley...</i>

258
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:45,285
<i>And a big crash there for the </i>Toro Rosso.

259
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:48,125
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Suspension failure.

260
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:51,245
<i>And we thought we'd have</i>
<i>20 drivers going for pole today,</i>

261
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,685
<i>but we've got 19.</i>

262
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,605
<i>Here is Stoffel Vandoorne.</i>

263
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,285
<i>Is the car okay, Stoffel?</i>

264
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,565
<i>Seriously, the car</i>
<i>is so tricky to drive.</i>

265
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,485
<i>Stoffel Vandoorne</i>
<i>driving very aggressively.</i>

266
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,045
<i>Too much curb, I think, for Vandoorne,</i>
<i>who's damaged his car.</i>

267
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,605
<i>There's a bit of carbon fiber debris now</i>
<i>down at turn six.</i>

268
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:23,165
<i>Alonso, meanwhile,</i>
<i>is on his first timed lap of the session,</i>

269
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,485
<i>flying through Copse Corner.</i>

270
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,845
<i>Seriously,</i>
<i>we were losing time on the straights.</i>

271
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:28,925
<i>Okay, Fernando.</i>

272
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:31,285
<i>Thirteenth for Fernando Alonso.</i>

273
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,965
<i>Vandoorne in 17th place.</i>

274
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,165
<i>Maybe that bit of debris</i>
<i>came off the car</i>

275
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,805
<i>and lost him a lot of performance.</i>

276
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,165
<i>It's been a tough weekend</i>
<i>for him and McLaren.</i>

277
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:56,045
<i>Now, here comes Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>in the Force India.</i>

278
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:03,085
<i>Struggling for traction a little bit</i>
<i>coming out of Village,</i>

279
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,365
<i>the tight right-hander,</i>

280
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,525
<i>but looked much neater</i>
<i>through turn four.</i>

281
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,885
<i>Esteban, so you're totally clear ahead.</i>

282
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,045
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

283
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,445
<i>He's picked up time, Ocon.</i>

284
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,085
<i>Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>
<i>Nice one.</i>

285
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,605
<i> Ocon will start tomorrow's</i>
<i>race in the front half of the grid,</i>

286
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,445
<i>with his teammate, Perez, just behind.</i>

287
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,645
<i>Both McLaren drivers are further back.</i>

288
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,845
-Hi, Vijay.
-How are you?

289
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,885
Very good. Very good. And you?

290
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:36,845
Good.

291
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:40,085
You squeezed a lot out of that car
in qualy today.

292
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,565
Little bit makes
massive difference in the end.

293
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,005
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome your Force India drivers,</i>

294
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,885
<i>Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez.</i>

295
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:02,765
When during the weekend, if ever,
do you think the car's been right?

296
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:08,885
Um... I-- I feel
like we've always struggled...

297
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,485
going into qualifying.

298
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:16,685
As soon as the speed kind of scrubs off,
it's like driving on ice.

299
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,605
<i>What's going wrong with McLaren?</i>

300
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:23,205
There's a lot of politics involved.
There's a lot of money.

301
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,845
<i>It's a lot of decisions that were taken...</i>

302
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,885
<i>that have</i>
<i>become very difficult to reverse.</i>

303
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:32,445
<i>And I think that's</i>
<i>what McLaren are struggling with.</i>

304
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,405
Who's got a really good question?

305
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,525
- Little kid here.
- Can I have your hat?

306
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,685
You got it.

307
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,085
You know, we're sort of
running out of things to check.

308
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,245
Certainly all the suspension internals
are okay.

309
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:51,125
All the suspension externals.

310
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,885
There's nothing obvious to find.

311
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,925
Do you think that the ride
was any different in qualifying?

312
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,005
No.

313
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:00,605
Uh... any thoughts
on the roll stiffness change we made?

314
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,405
- No. No difference.
- Uh, okay.

315
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,285
Three...

316
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,645
Two, one, go!

317
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:23,605
I think we lost performance, as we know,
in the last couple of races.

318
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:29,125
Always Formula One car improves
with headwind, but this year's,

319
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:32,565
it seems that
it is a huge step worse in tailwind.

320
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:37,445
I know you were testing in Barcelona...
all the ideas, but...

321
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,565
we are in the middle of July,
and we didn't saw any of those.

322
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:43,645
So... need to speed up.

323
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:54,365
Enjoy the race tomorrow.
It's coming home!

324
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:08,445
<i>Welcome along to round ten</i>
<i>of the Formula One World Championship</i>

325
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:12,845
<i>in front of a record crowd</i>
<i>of 140,000 people.</i>

326
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:20,885
<i>Every time I see</i>
<i>Sahara Force India Formula One</i>

327
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,485
<i>on the World Championship grid</i>

328
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:27,845
<i>with Ferrari, with Mercedes,</i>
<i>you know, it's a great sense of pride.</i>

329
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:32,485
<i>As a kid,</i>
<i>I was watching Formula One on TV,</i>

330
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,725
<i>and I was dreaming, you know,</i>
<i>about being there on the race track.</i>

331
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:40,045
<i>But now, as a driver, you can't say,</i>
<i>you know, "He's better than me."</i>

332
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,245
<i>You always think you are the best.</i>

333
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:46,765
<i>I think if you don't start thinking</i>
<i>like that, that's a loss already.</i>

334
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,925
<i>To be fourth</i>
<i>in the championship again,</i>

335
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:56,525
<i>Toro Rosso, Renault, McLaren,</i>

336
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:59,685
<i>you gotta beat them. That is the task.</i>

337
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:05,965
<i>I think this season</i>
<i>really revealed</i>

338
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:08,325
<i>that maybe we're not as good</i>
<i>as we thought we were.</i>

339
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,165
<i>We should be the best</i>
<i>of the rest right now,</i>

340
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,605
<i>and we're the worst of the rest right now,</i>
<i>which is not good.</i>

341
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:20,045
<i>Somebody's gotta be accountable.</i>
<i>And right now, it's Zak.</i>

342
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:24,285
-I'd like to get some points today.
-Fernando's-- Yeah.

343
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:26,805
-Well, he's got a big chance.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:31,165
<i>Ultimately, we're a Grand Prix</i>
<i>team that's been bred to win races,</i>

345
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:34,685
<i>so the pressure will be on</i>
<i>for on-track results.</i>

346
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:36,125
Come on, boys.

347
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:41,485
<i> When the lights come on,</i>
<i>the adrenaline is pumping...</i>

348
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:45,525
<i>and the heart certainly misses a beat.</i>

349
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:51,365
<i>Away we go</i>
<i>at the British Grand Prix!</i>

350
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,885
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Contact between Perez and Alonso.</i>

351
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:00,805
Ooh.

352
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:03,405
<i>Yeah, I think</i>
<i>we got shoved off at the start.</i>

353
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,685
<i> I think he damaged the front wing.</i>

354
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:07,885
<i>And Perez is off!</i>

355
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,565
<i>Checo, give us feedback. Give us feedback.</i>

356
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:16,245
<i>Yeah, someone hit me.</i>

357
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,485
<i>How's the front wing? Did you hit tires?</i>

358
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,245
<i>No, I think it's okay.</i>

359
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,605
<i>Kimi Raikkonen</i>
<i>on the outside, Vettel from Bottas.</i>

360
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:26,765
<i>They touched!</i>

361
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,045
<i>Hamilton's gone round. He's crashed!</i>

362
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:32,685
<i>That is massive disappointment</i>
<i>for the British crowd.</i>

363
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:36,405
<i>What's going through my mind</i>
<i>when I crash?</i>

364
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,765
<i>Avoid. Nothing else.</i>

365
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:44,285
<i>Choose a direction as quickly as possible</i>
<i>and yeah, try not to hit it.</i>

366
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,445
<i> Fernando Alonso's picked up</i>
<i>a place on Kevin Magnussen.</i>

367
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:59,205
<i>Great work. Now though, Magnussen</i>
<i>is the car behind you. He could be quick.</i>

368
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,245
<i>Magnussen's coming back at Alonso.</i>

369
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:08,205
<i>They're going wheel-to-wheel.</i>

370
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:12,005
<i>What I see from Magnussen,</i>
<i>I never saw in my life.</i>

371
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,605
He pushed me wide at turn seven,
ten, eleven, and turn twelve.

372
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,805
<i> Understood, Fernando. Head down.</i>

373
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,765
It's ridiculous.

374
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:28,765
Ridiculous!

375
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,565
<i> And someone's had</i>
<i>a big off as well.</i>

376
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:43,885
Ooh.

377
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:47,605
-Who's that? Sainz.
-Sainz.

378
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,245
-Sainz!
-Sainz!

379
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:50,925
<i>Sainz and Grosjean.</i>

380
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:58,845
<i>Gunter must be absolutely ready</i>

381
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:00,405
<i>to put his fist through the wall.</i>

382
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:04,525
<i>Now, Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>Kevin Magnussen right behind him.</i>

383
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,965
<i>Oh, look who's in tenth and in the points,</i>
<i>Fernando Alonso right in there.</i>

384
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:12,525
<i>We could be in</i>
<i>for a massive 11-lap scrap now.</i>

385
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,045
<i>Oh, Verstappen's off!</i>

386
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:23,005
<i>We have lost Verstappen,</i>

387
00:25:23,085 --> 00:25:27,285
<i>Grosjean, Sainz, Ericcson,</i>
<i>Leclerc, and Hartley from this race.</i>

388
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:31,685
<i>Nico Hülkenberg is</i>
<i>about 1.7 seconds clear of Esteban Ocon.</i>

389
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,885
<i>Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>is ahead of Fernando Alonso.</i>

390
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,885
<i>He's got DRS to attack him with.</i>

391
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,845
<i>Alonso's not giving up.</i>
<i>He's back on the inside of Magnussen.</i>

392
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,765
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Got him.

393
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,605
He's relentless, isn't he?

394
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:44,205
-He's a monster.
-Yeah.

395
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:48,605
<i>Alonso, Magnussen, Gasly,</i>
<i>Perez, all in a huge scrap there.</i>

396
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:51,925
<i>Alonso ahead of Magnussen.</i>
<i>Eighth place at the moment for McLaren.</i>

397
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,845
<i>Well, if you have someone</i>
<i>like Alonso behind you, for sure,</i>

398
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:58,085
<i>you know he's gonna try hard.</i>

399
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:01,445
<i>As soon as you do a little mistake,</i>
<i>he will try to get you.</i>

400
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,445
<i>I remember where I come from.</i>

401
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,565
<i>A lot of sacrifices.</i>

402
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:12,605
<i>So I'm not gonna let anything stop me.</i>

403
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:18,565
<i>You need to trust your skill,</i>
<i>trust the car and be one.</i>

404
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,765
<i>Ocon crosses the line ahead of Alonso.</i>

405
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:26,685
<i>Awesome job, guys. Really good.</i>

406
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:30,885
<i>Really tough race, but good points.</i>
<i>We're really happy.</i>

407
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,685
<i>Great job, mate. Great job.</i>

408
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:37,925
<i>We could be finished sixth.</i>

409
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:40,925
<i>We were flying now.</i>

410
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:43,485
<i>What a shame.</i>

411
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:50,885
<i>Any time</i>
<i>you haven't maximized the weekend</i>

412
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:53,685
<i>or you think maybe</i>
<i>you've left something on the table,</i>

413
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:57,445
that can be frustrating, 'cause points,
especially right now for us,

414
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:59,445
<i>are very hard to come by.</i>

415
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,445
<i>Eighth is--</i>
<i>is probably not enough</i>

416
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,405
with the performance
we had in the car today.

417
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:11,205
<i>I would've like to achieved more,</i>

418
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:14,805
but I think I can say that
about every Grand Prix so far this year.

419
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:21,685
<i>Fantastic results, you know,</i>
<i>P-7. We are really happy with that.</i>

420
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,005
<i>It was very, very tough race.</i>

421
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:27,645
Uh... I have to say, you know,
keeping Fernando and Kevin

422
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:29,725
in the back was not an easy task,

423
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:33,085
and we're improving,
so that's why I am smiling now.

424
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:37,885
<i>It is always good to have</i>
<i>a double-points finish,</i>

425
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,845
<i>particularly at home in Silverstone.</i>

426
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,725
<i>I'm extremely proud of my entire team</i>
<i>and all my employees as well.</i>

427
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,445
- How are you, big man?
- I'm good, and you?

428
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:55,845
Good to see you.
Very well, thank you. Welcome along.

429
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,125
You still gonna be around
by the end of the season?

430
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:00,845
Why do you ask?

431
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:03,005
Well, I'm hoping you're not
leaving, that's why.

432
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:05,005
No, no. Absolutely not.

433
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:08,285
What you don't want is
for the guys back at the factory

434
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,405
thinking, "Shit, my job's under threat."

435
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,285
If the team's getting sold,
that's not fair on them.

436
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:15,765
No. I have a famous saying

437
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:19,925
that I have been saying for decades.

438
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:23,965
I will believe it when the fat lady sings.

439
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,685
Okay.

440
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,925
Pensions.
We haven't paid 'em in forever.

441
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:41,805
So if it all gets across...

442
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:44,925
all the pension stuff will be paid,
so that's all part of the employer stuff.

443
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,245
-You should come up to date.
-It'll get sorted through.

444
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,045
Good. Those are
the only questions they have.

445
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,885
-All the pension stuff will--
-Salaries and pension.

446
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:52,085
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,045
Is everyone here?

448
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,525
Good morning, everyone,
and, uh, thanks for coming.

449
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,645
As you know,
from what you saw in the press

450
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:09,485
and in the media that on Friday
there was a case in London.

451
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:13,245
I cannot answer so many questions.
Please, please.

452
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:18,245
And our team and company
has been put into administration.

453
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:20,805
Thank you very much. No further questions.

454
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,365
-Nothing! That's all.
-Force India in administration, sir--

455
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:27,445
Control of the company sits
with ourselves as administrators

456
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:32,485
whilst we try and find
a solution that gives you a future

457
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,765
with new owners or new investment.

458
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:38,765
I am not going to answer any questions.
I've been advised not to.

459
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:41,925
I know that probably
the most pressing thing

460
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:46,005
that everyone will be wanting to know is,
are you going to get paid on Wednesday?

461
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,125
And the answer to that is, yes.

462
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:57,365
<i>When I heard the news that Vijay left,</i>

463
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:01,285
of course it was difficult, you know,

464
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,925
because I'm--
Vijay, I was very close to him.

465
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:05,805
Thank you very much.

466
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:07,965
<i>It's been one of the people</i>

467
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,645
<i>that picked me up in Force India,</i>
<i>basically in the beginning.</i>

468
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,445
-I got myself one in my house.
-Oh, you practice now?

469
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:14,365
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

470
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,085
<i>He had always been very nice to me,</i>

471
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,925
<i>and he used to send me a message,</i>
<i>you know, before the race.</i>

472
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:23,205
<i>"Yeah, Esteban, score points there.</i>
<i>Good luck, and I'm cheering for you."</i>

473
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:25,525
<i>And I will miss him definitely.</i>

474
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:29,165
<i>I will miss that passion for the sport,</i>
<i>but I think everyone in F1</i>

475
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,165
<i>wants Force India to keep racing.</i>

476
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:36,525
<i>The problem is that the last two teams</i>
<i>that this happened, they disappeared.</i>

477
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:42,525
<i> Force India, that's the big story.</i>

478
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,525
<i>Could the team rise from the ashes</i>
<i>with Lawrence Stroll as the new boss</i>

479
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,085
<i>and his son as their driver?</i>

480
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:50,005
<i>I'm going into the family business.</i>

481
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:53,885
<i>Who's going to be out</i>
<i>of a seat for next season? Perez or Ocon?</i>

482
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,365
If you do a strong job on the team,
they can't skip you.

483
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:00,445
<i>Into the wall goes Esteban Ocon!</i>
