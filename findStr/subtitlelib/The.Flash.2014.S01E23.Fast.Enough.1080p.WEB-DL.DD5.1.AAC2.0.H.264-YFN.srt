My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,946
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,115
by something impossible.

5
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,151
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,321
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,558
To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,962
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,497
and find others like me.

10
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,999
And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother

11
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,568
and get justice for my father.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,604
That day is today.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,545
What?
No Big Belly Burger?

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,447
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

15
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,982
We're out of cows
where I come from.

16
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,185
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

17
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,121
Not sure where to start...
Thawne.

18
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,358
That is your real name...
Eobard Thawne.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,060
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

20
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,594
136 years from now.

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,698

Ask it.

24
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,940
Why did you kill
my mother?

25
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,042
Because I hate you.

26
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,211
Not you now.
You years from now.

27
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,281
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

28
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,183
We're enemies, rivals,
opposites,

29
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,451
reverses of one another.

30
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,186
Why?
Wh-why were we enemies?

31
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,788
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,524
It doesn't...
matter anymore.

33
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,593
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

34
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,362
to defeat the other.

35
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,099
Until I learned your secret.

36
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,835
I learned your name.

37
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,504
Barry Allen.

38
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,374
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

39
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,278
Travel back in time,
kill you as a child.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,148
Wipe you
from the face of the earth.

41
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,085
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

42
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,020
and we fought.

43
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,858
We both landed
some pretty solid shots.

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,829
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

45
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,599
I was so mad.

46
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,370
But then I thought...

47
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,207
what if you were
to suffer a tragedy?

48
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,911
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

49
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,514
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

50
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,049
Then you would not become
The Flash.

51
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,253
And so I stabbed your mother
in the heart,

52
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,854
and I was free.

53
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,725
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

54
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,996
only to realize
that in traveling back

55
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,698
I'd lost my way home.

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,068
Lost my ability to harness
the speed force.

57
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,505
And without it,
I was stuck here.

58
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,542
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

59
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:01,180
And the only way back
was The Flash.

60
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,716
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

61
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,024
Why train me?

62
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,593
Why help me save
so many people?

63
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,330
Because I needed you
to get fast.

64
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:23,001
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

65
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,970
and create
a stable wormhole

66
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,973
through which
I could return home.

67
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,575
Why would I
ever do that?

68
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,043

You can go back

You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,405
[thermometer beeps]

178
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,008
(Caitlin)
98.6. Normal.

179
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,077
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

180
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,712
Me neither.

181
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,980
I know Barry
really appreciates you

182
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,648
coming back to help him
stop Wells.

183
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,284
That's not the only reason
I'm back, Cait.

184
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,152
I'm here now.
For good.

185
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,721
But I thought...

186
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,256
I thought too...
I thought too much

187
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,093
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

188
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,562
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

189
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,765
If we hurt you.

190
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:39,804
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

191
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,474
I'm not whole
unless I'm with you.

192
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,643
I love you, Cait.

193
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,515
- Are you sure?
- I am.

194
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,320
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

195
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,322
you agreed to marry me.

196
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,189
Yes, I did.

197
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,525
What do you say
we do that?

198
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,169
Thought I might find you here.

199
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,041
I needed to get
out of the lab.

200
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,045
[sighs]

201
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,280
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

202
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,682
Oh, it is.
Trust me.

203
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,719
I've done a lot
of thinking up here.

204
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,454
When I wasn't having
clandestine meetings

205
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,057
with the mysterious
"streak."

206
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,692
[both chuckle]

207
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,228
Yeah, not mad
we lost that name.

208
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,631
Hey, I thought that
had pizzazz.

209
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,533
[both laugh]

210
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,902
- No.
- Uh-uh.

211
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,674
[gentle music]

212
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,077
So are you gonna do it?

213
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,650
It's just so... huge.

214
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,185
It's the biggest decision
of my life,

215
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:04,422
and if I'm wrong,
I can't undo it.

216
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,091
Why would you
want to?

217
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:12,163
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

218
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,100
have a great career,

219
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,002
even get married.

220
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,006
Iris West-Allen, huh?

221
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,776
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

222
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,946
Must be a 2024 thing.
[chuckles]

223
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,016
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

224
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:37,455
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

225
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,657
that's why things
are different there?

226
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,727
Growing up together and...

227
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:47,866
knowing so much
about each other...

228
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:52,036
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

229
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,142
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

230
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,249
But living with you
and Joe...

231
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,854
I've had a great life,
Iris.

232
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,692
Come here,
Barry.

233
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,535
What do you think
I should do?

234
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,637
I need someone to tell me.

235
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,811
I think...

236
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,447
that for once in your life,
Barry Allen,

237
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,917
you should stop thinking
about other people.

238
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,353
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

239
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,889
Do what you need to do
for yourself.

240
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,033
(Wells)
Ah!

241
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,069
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

242
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,637
it took you a whole hour
longer to decide

243
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,639
than I thought it would.

244
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,409
So how does this work?

245
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,045
Your grand plan?

246
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,414
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

247
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,082
In fact, it's rather simple.

248
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,617
We use
the Particle Accelerator.

249
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,085
[laughs]
The Particle Accelerator.

250
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,955
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

251
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,690
that hurt a lot of people.

252
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,893
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

253
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,528
the way it was designed to.

254
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,099
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

255
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,101
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

256
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,770
we're only going
to inject one particle

257
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,806
into the accelerator.

258
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,942
And I'm what
it collides with.

259
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,211
And if you can go fast enough,
Barry,

260
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,915
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

261
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,118
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,222
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

263
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,958
to infinite times.

264
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,293
A wormhole.

265
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,897
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

266
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,067
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

267
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,670
my time.

268
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,873
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

269
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,475
What happens if I don't?

270
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,312
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

271
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,747
you'll die.

272
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,788
According to
Wells' calculations,

273
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,491
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

274
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,027
Once Barry
reaches optimum speed,

275
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,764
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

276
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,234
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

277
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:40,471
opening a gateway
into time itself.

278
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,874
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

279
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,710
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

280
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,212
I'm uncommitted.

281
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,615
What do you think?

282
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,584
[sighs]
I mean, on the one hand,

283
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,620
it does make a kind of sense.

284
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,355
On the other hand,

285
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,690
why?

286
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,459
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

287
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,027
You know why.

288
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,863
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

289
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,834
By my estimates,
Mach Two at a minimum.

290
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,903
You've never gone that fast.

291
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,872
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

292
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,408
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

293
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,510
How far off am I?

294
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,546
Not very far,
I'm afraid.

295
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,983
Let me worry about
how fast I have to go.

296
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,150
We're gonna need
something else too.

297
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,219
Really?
And what's that?

298
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,088
'Cause I don't know
about you guys,

299
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,992
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

300
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,362
I need you to build
a time machine.

301
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,864
Go on.

302
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,733
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

303
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,735
what's he need
a time machine for?

304
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,270
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

305
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,007
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

306
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,274
He can't fully
control it.

307
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,709
So I was right
about the wheelchair.

308
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,244
He was using it
to charge himself.

309
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,546
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

310
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,949
to travel back
to the future.

311
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,851
He's been squirreling away
the parts.

312
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,652
Now we just need
to put it together.

313
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,856
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

314
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
not a bookcase from IKEA.

315
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
We got a problem.

316
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,994
These tiles...
They're made of tungsten.

317
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,362
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

318
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,764
of any other element.

319
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,899
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

320
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,534
The pressure exerted
from the wormhole...

321
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,969
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,105
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

323
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,408
It could explode.

324
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,043
Any ideas?

325
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,745
Let me ask Dr. Evil.
[chuckles]

326
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,681
Which used to be
a name that made me smile.

327
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,389
(Wells)
Something on your mind,
Cisco?

328
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,591
No.

329
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,793
Yes.

330
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,595
How did you fit
your Reverse-Flash suit

331
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,963
into that little ring?

332
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,099
Is it some sort
of compressed micro tech?

333
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,702
Or actually, forget it.
I don't care.

334
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,406
Maybe a little.

335
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,908
Ronnie's right.

336
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,876
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

337
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,179
Glad we're still good
for something.

338
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:05,183
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

339
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,417
Or Ronnie's.

340
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,019
As a matter of fact,

341
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,689
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

342
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,024
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

343
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,258
It would have been
a lot more fun.

344
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,159
Yeah?

345
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,961
Well, doesn't change the fact

346
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,664
that your nifty little
Time Sphere...

347
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,065
Is that what you're calling it?

348
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,834
Whatever it's called.
It's gonna blow.

349
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,836
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

350
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,372
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

351
