343
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,610
Every architect can point to that
one design that changed their career.

344
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,050
For me,it was around the
time of my 31st birthday.

345
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,560
It wasn't a museum or a
concert hall or a skyscraper.

346
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,050
It was something else.

347
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,430
We're opening a restaurant called Rib
Town,and we want it to be shaped...

348
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,710
Like a cowboy hat.

349
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,370
Look,I need the work.

350
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,750
I don't have any other options.

351
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,180
Well,there's always that teaching job.

352
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,420
Yeah,I didn't work this hard toe stuck
in some crappy,dead-end teaching job.

353
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,630
No offense,Lily.

354
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,930
I got peed on three times
today. No arguments here.

355
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,570
I just gotta nail this hat building
so,I'll see you all in three days.

356
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,290
For the next three days,I worked
harder than I'd ever worked in my life.

357
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,270
And I got... nowhere.

358
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,310
Hey,Ted,whatcha doing?

359
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,700
Designing a building shaped like a hat.

360
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,540
- Now a good time to chat?
- No.

361
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,460
So,what do you think of Robin?

362
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,950
Barney,I really need
to get to work,so...

363
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Great.Say you and I went suit-shopping,

364
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,620
and you happened upon a beautiful
suit,a beautiful Canadian suit.

365
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,260
Double-breasted.

366
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,010
You try it on,but it's not
exactly the right fit for you.

367
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,000
So,you put it back. Then I try it on.

368
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,110
I don't really want to take the
same suit that you had your eye on,

369
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,710
but at the same time,I
really like that suit.

370
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,660
Buy the suit,Barney. You
clearly care about it.

371
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,020
Tell the suit how you feel.

372
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,720
Okay.

373
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,630
But Ted,remember that that
was your answer because...

374
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,290
The suit is Robin. I know!

375
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,530
Right?

376
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,550
- I'm with you,buddy.
- You are now.

377
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,390
Because I explained it to you.

Mother Season04 Episode24</font>

381
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,030
Come on,dude,you've been at this
for three days without a break.

382
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,120
Now,it's your birthday.

383
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,540
Come up to the roof
and have a beer with me.

384
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,500
No can do. Presentation is tomorrow.

385
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,490
Hat buildings don't design themselves.

386
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,870
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.

387
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,370
Just make sure the doors are wide
and the chairs are reinforced.

388
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,500
Now,birthday beer on the roof. Let's go!

389
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,620
Why do you want me to
come up to the roof so bad?

390
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,720
What,are you throwing
me a surprise party?

391
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,710
What? Ted,we threw you a
surprise party last year.

392
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,650
Okay,you don't get two
surpse parties in a row.

393
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,260
I mean,the fact that anyone showed up at
the first one was surprise enough,right?

394
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,340
Two surprise parties in a row!

395
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,270
That is rich! That is rich!

396
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,940
Classic! He still won't come up.

397
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,640
Come on. What the crap?

398
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,720
I knew having a second
surprise party was a bad idea.

399
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,850
Yes,Robin,I know.

400
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,200
This party is... it's a
disaster. It was my idea.

401
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,920
I take responsibility.

402
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,170
And there's really only
one thing to do about it.

403
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,830
- Oh,Marshall,no.
- Lily,I have to do this!

404
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,330
No point in putting it off any longer.

405
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,600
I should explain.

406
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,890
You see,a few years earlier...

407
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,680
No,uh-uh,forget it. This
is so not pimped out.

408
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,790
If anything,this is pimped in.

409
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,530
You know who knows how
to live? Those people.

410
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,340
Ah,the rooftop patio one
building over from ours.

411
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,650
Across a chasm of just six or seven
feet awaited a landscaped paradise.

412
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,630
And best of all...

413
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,670
That looks to be one hot tub.

414
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,930
Great. How do we get over there?

415
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,780
What are we gonna do? Jump?

416
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,500
I can jump that far.

417
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,470
Marshall,lately it takes you
two tries to get off the sofa.

418
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,350
You can't jump that far.

419
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,910
- Really?
- Really.

420
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Watch me.

421
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,550
But he didn't jump.

422
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,450
<i>******</i>

423
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,390
This actually is kind of nice.

424
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,580
Right? Right?

425
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,550
Okay...

426
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,880
And in the years that
followed,he kept almost jumping.

427
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,190
Okay... Okay!

428
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,300
But each time,without fail...

429
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,930
Okay. Here we go.

430
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,750
He didn't jump.

431
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,870
But don't worry.

432
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,680
'Cause if I can make this jump
tonight,it's totally gonna save the party.

433
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,880
Honey,please get down from there.

434
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,240
Lily,when Evel Knievel sat astride his star-spangled
rocket on the rim of Snake River Canyon,

435
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,760
do you think his wife
said,Honey,get down from there?

436
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,180
For the last time,I
am not Linda Knievel!

437
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,160
I will never be Linda Knievel!

438
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,640
You don't need to remind me.

439
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,610
Marshall,please don't do this.

440
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,870
Lily,but I gotta do this.

441
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,190
- You can't do this.
- Why?

442
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,920
You want a reason? I'll give
you a reason. I'm pregnant.

443
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,970
Oh,my God!

444
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,140
Oh,my God,really?

445
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,880
Lily,I mean,I noticed that you
gained some weight lately...

446
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,780
I was lying,you jerk!

447
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,100
Oh,go ahead and jump. I hope you die!

448
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
That's all the permission I need.

449
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,410
Listen,Robin...

450
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,490
- There's something I have to tell you.
- But wait.

451
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,340
Before you do,I have to
tell you something first.

452
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,000
What is it?

453
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,530
I think I'm in love with you.

454
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,270
It's Ted. Everybody shh!

455
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,850
Hey,Ted,what's up?

456
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,350
It's here,Lily.

457
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,490
It's looking at me.

458
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,060
What is?

459
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,480
The goat.

460
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,220
Now,I've told you some of
the story of the goat already.

461
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,120
How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer to come
talk to her class,and how he brought a goat,

462
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,230
and how he told the whole class what he
was gonna do to the goat later that day.

463
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,560
And how Aunt Lily,in a fit of mercy,bought the
goat off the guy in order to commute its sentence.

464
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,790
Lily,something amazing has happened.

465
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,950
I was talking to Robin,I was
all set to tell her how I feel,

466
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,320
but before I could,you'll
nev believe what she said.

467
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,430
I think I'm in love with you.

468
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,460
What did you say?

469
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,660
What do you think I said? What would
anyone say to something like that?

470
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,990
Yeah... Robin,listen.

471
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,980
You're great. I mean,you're really
awesome,but I mean,we're friends.

472
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,450
It's probably a bad idea.

473
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,260
I-I guess you're right.

474
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,960
Uh,have a good party.

475
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,630
You too,kiddo.

476
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,210
What?

477
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,320
It's like,as soon as she
said that,no more feelings.

478
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm not in love with her anymore.

479
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,020
So,you've been in love with
this girl for the past year,

480
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,660
and the second she reciprocates those
feelings,just like that,you're over her.

481
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,390
How great is that?

482
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,690
No! No! This is a washcloth. Not food.

483
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,260
What the...

484
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,440
Okay... this is it.

485
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,180
Here we... Go!

486
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,350
This is it.

487
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,950
Tracey,Tracey,tell Lily
what you just told me.

488
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,710
Um,that I just moved to New York?

489
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,520
No,no,but tell her how you got here.

490
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,420
I just got off the bus from Iowa.

491
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,240
Just got off the bus from Iowa!

492
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,870
How lucky is it that an aspiring dancer

493
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,560
just off the bus from Iowa runs
into the producer of the Rockettes?

494
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,890
I feel like I'm in one of
those classic show biz stories.

495
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh,honey,you are. You really are.

496
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,540
Hey,Tracey,why don't you make me one of those
rum and beers that your dad loves so much?

497
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,470
Sure thing!

498
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,030
- Damn it.
- What?

499
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,140
Everybody always says,Don't tell Lily.

500
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,000
Lily can't keep a secret.
And,usually,they're right.

501
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,000
But this time,I kept the secret.

502
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,930
And then you come along with this crap and
you force me to pull an old classic Lily

503
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,930
and spill the beans!

504
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,940
What beans? There's beans?

505
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,610
There's beans.

506
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,600
The suit is Robin.

507
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,750
I know! Right?

508
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,450
I'm with you,buddy.

509
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,340
You are now.

510
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,470
Because I explained it to you.

511
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,330
There you go.

512
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,680
Oh,crap.

513
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,040
He said that? Oh,my God!

514
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,070
What a tremendous
ground-breaking surprise!

515
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,680
- How long have you known?
- Eight months.

516
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,440
And you've kept it a secret
since then? Good for you.

517
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,310
Yeah. Good for you,Lily.

518
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,880
I mean,what a bombshell.
Who saw that coming?

519
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,470
- How long have you known?
- Seven months,29 days.

520
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,490
God,what am I going to do?

521
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,210
I don't know. What are you going to do?

522
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm going to marry Barney
in a big church wedding.

523
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,480
And we're going to move to some sleepy New
Hampshire town and open a bed-and-breakfast.

524
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,290
- Aww,really?
- No!

525
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,870
It's Barney. I mean...

526
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,900
it's Barney. But it's Barney.

527
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,340
I got to tell him no.

528
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,950
Oh,man,you're going to break his...

529
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,940
Whatever it is that pumps that
black sludge through his veins.

530
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,730
Crap. You're right.

531
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,990
The first time Barney expresses
feelings for a girl and she rejects him?

532
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,830
And not just any girl. I mean...

533
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
It will destroy him.

534
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,400
Okay,well,first of all...

535
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,640
Second of all,there is a maneuver you can
try. It's high-risk,but it's also high-reward.

536
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,810
For lack of a better
term,I'm going to call it...

537
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,690
The Mosby.

538
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,530
- The Mosby?
- No,she couldn't Mosby him.

539
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,940
She could Mosby the crap out of him.

540
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,080
What's the Mosby?

541
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,130
Robin,you remember your
first date with Ted?

542
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,450
You wanted to hop on the
T-train and take a ride downtown.

543
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,760
I was ready to jump that turnstile.

544
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,520
What changed all that?

545
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,780
- I think I'in love with you.
- What?

546
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,140
The Mosby!

547
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,840
That is genius. And,um... excuse me.

548
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,230
I mean,you're very pretty,but you're
freakishly tall,and you don't believe in ghosts.

549
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,990
So,when she said she thinks she's in
love with me,she meant the opposite.

550
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,370
Exactly. And look how well it
worked. You're back to normal.

551
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,570
Yes. Yes,I am.

552
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,290
And it is great. It's awesome.

553
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,320
- So,Robin's not in love with me.
- Nope.

554
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,810
Why not?

555
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,470
Mr. Goat?

556
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,720
Mr. Goat?

557
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,320
Okay. That's it.

558
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Stupid goat.

559
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,400
I do not understand your
fascination with this washcloth.

560
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,050
I guess at's what happen when
you have a brain thsize of a...

561
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,680
No,no,no!

562
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,290
Okay,okay,okay...

563
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,120
Hey,Marshall,can you just go get Ted?

564
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,710
Lily,I was just about to jump.

565
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,620
Didn't you hear me saying
"Okay" over and over again?

566
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,340
Oh,I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.

567
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,170
No,it's fine. Sorry,everybody.
Lily won't let me jump.

568
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

569
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,160
Thank God.

570
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,440
Hospital!

571
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,100
So,what happened exactly?

572
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,320
What happened is you let a freaking
wild animal into our apartment.

573
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,370
I was savaged.

574
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,330
That is the sweetest,cutest
little goat in the whole world.

575
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,220
Sweetest,cutest little
goat in the whole world?

576
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,990
I was prettyleep-deprived
at this point,

577
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,810
so this probably isn't how it really
happened,but here's how I remember it.

578
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,180
So,you're the guy who tried
to make it with a goat?

579
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,110
Hey,if anything,that goat
tried to make it with me.

580
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,630
- Can I go,please?
- Sure,you can go.

581
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,810
But remember,buddy,"baa" means "baa."

582
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,000
Great. Great. Now I'm going
to be late for my presentation.

583
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
Thanks a lot,Mr. Goat.

584
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,980
Mr. Goat? Ted,that goat's
a girl. Her name's Missy.

585
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,970
You got beat up by a girl.

586
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,540
- So. You're in love with me.
- What?

587
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,570
Oh,yeah. Very much.

588
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,520
Okay,you can knock it off. Lily told me.

589
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,820
Damn it. Lily!

590
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,560
I can't believe you would do that.

591
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,200
It's just... Like,I care
about you,Barney. And...

592
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,360
This kind of stuff,the emotional stuff?

593
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,320
It's not your thing. I thought
I'd save you the trouble.

594
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,980
Well,maybe I don't want
to be saved the trouble.

595
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,250
Maybe I want the trouble.

596
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,690
I haven't wanted the
trouble in a long time.

597
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,980
But with you,the trouble
doesn't seem so. troubling.

598
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,840
I don't know. I thought...

599
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,300
I guess I thought you felt the se way.

600
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,130
Maybe I do. I don't know.

601
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm not exactly the biggest
confronter of feelings.

602
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,150
I mean,clearly,there's
something between us.

603
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,360
Maybe my head was saying,"Nip it in the bud"
because my heart was saying something else.

604
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,130
Look... I have feelings for you,Barney.

605
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,210
Maybe I even love you.

606
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,660
- This is going pretty fast,don't you think?
- What?

607
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,640
We have a really good friendship going.

608
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,610
Why screw up a good thing?

609
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,020
- Friends?
- Friends.

610
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,580
Oh,my God. You just did it
again. You just Mosby'd me.

611
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,060
- I did not.
- You did. You little minx.

612
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay,you're right. I did just Mosby you.

613
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,290
Why are you so afraid
of giving this a chance?

614
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,340
Because I am scared
of how much I like you.

615
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,100
Whoa,this is a bad idea.

616
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,580
You're right. This is a mistake.

617
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,400
- Yes. No.
- I love you.

618
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,190
- Let's be friends.
- Okay,friends,then.

619
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,740
- I love you.
- Let's get married.

620
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,000
- No,you're smothering me.
- Okay,forget it.

621
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,110
You know what? We can
sort this out later.

622
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,720
- Yeah,that sounds good.
- That sounds good.

623
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,700
It had been a long and
crazy night,but that morning,

624
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,630
against all odds,I made
it to my presentation.

625
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,780
Here you have it,gentlemen. Rib Town.

626
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,870
Right? Right?

627
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,440
Yeah.

628
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,970
Ted,listen. You're great,and
you've done a real...

629
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,260
special job here,and you're going to make
some other restaurant very happy someday,

630
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,110
but,uh,we have,uh,decided to go...

631
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,910
- another direction here.
- What?

632
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Feast your eyes on...

633
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,080
- Rib Town!
- Rib Town!

634
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,080
Sven.

635
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,840
I'll tell you one thing.

636
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,430
I'm never eating ribs again.

637
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,620
Yeah,right.

638
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,150
I am never... eating ribs... again!

639
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,700
In front of Ted!

640
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,740
This is a disaster.

641
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,940
How am I going to come back from this?

642
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,640
Okay,I'm just going to ask this.

643
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,940
Do you really want to
come back from this?

644
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,210
What's that supposed to mean?

645
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,530
Architecture is killing you,Ted,and
it's killing us to watch it killing you.

646
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,790
You're like that goat
with the washcloth.

647
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,680
You want it so bad,and every time the world tries
to take it away from you,you keep grabbing it.

648
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,140
But you know what? It's just a
washcloth. Why do you even want it?

649
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,070
Because I... I have to
be an architect. That's...

650
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,860
that's the plan.

651
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,340
Screw the plan. I planned
on being a famous artist.

652
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,020
Marshall planned on being
an environmental lawyer.

653
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,770
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

654
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,530
I am a TV reporter. I'm on
every morning at 4:00 a.m.

655
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,360
Is that still on? Oh,good for you.

656
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,770
Somebody watch it,please.

657
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,860
Barney planned on being a violinist.

658
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,500
- Lily.
- Don't tell me things.

659
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,340
Look,you can't design
your life like a building.

660
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,620
It doesn't work that way.

661
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,620
You just have to live
it,and it will design itself.

662
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,660
So,what,I should just do nothing?

663
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,900
No. Listen to what the world is
telling you to do and take the leap.

664
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,230
You're right. You're absolutely right.

665
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,880
I love you,Lily.

666
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh,no. Metaphorical
leap. Metaphorical leap!

667
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,060
- This is not cool.
- Don't do it.

668
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,050
No!

669
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
- I did it!
- Baby,you did it.

670
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,410
- I can do anything!
- Yes,you can.

671
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm getting a motorcycle!

672
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,200
- You absolutely are not!
- Okay,sorry. Guys,me on over.

673
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,620
That was the year I
got left at the altar.

674
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,080
It was the year I got knocked
out by a crazy bartender.

675
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,290
The year I got fired.

676
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,550
The year I got beat up by a goat.

677
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,810
A girl goat,at that.

678
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,100
And damn it if it wasn't
the best year of my life.

679
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,170
Because,if any one of those
things hadn't happened,

680
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,100
I never would have ended up in a which
turned out to be the best job I ever had.

681
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,030
But more importantly,I
wouldn't have met your mother,

682
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,060
because,as you know...she
was in that class.

683
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,670
But of course,that story
is only just beginning.
