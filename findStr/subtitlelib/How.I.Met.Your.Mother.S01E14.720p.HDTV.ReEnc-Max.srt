<i>OLDER TED: When you meet someone
special suddenly life is full of firsts.</i>

3
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,627
<i>The first kiss.</i>

4
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,389
<i>The first night together.</i>

5
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,440
<i>The first weekend together.</i>

6
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:26,214
<i>For me, all those firsts happened
within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.</i>

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,355
They've gotta come out soon. It's Monday.

8
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:31,789
Do you think they've been in there
the whole time?

9
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:34,641
I don't know whether to be proud
or concerned.

10
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:37,349
Maybe they're not even in there.

11
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:41,847
- Morning.
- Hey, guys.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,086
- I'm just gonna ignore that.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:47,297
- I wish you could stay.
- I know. Me, too.

14
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,347
But I have to go to work,
and you have that meeting.

15
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:53,993
- Call you afterwards?
- I'll inappropriately text you during.

16
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:55,307
- Bye.
- Bye.

17
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,101
- Bye.
- Oh, Victoria. You're here...

18
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:59,118
Toodle-oo!

19
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,099
Two days straight!

20
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,951
Wow! Your room must smell
like a monkey cage.

21
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,682
Come on, give us a number.
Lily guessed eight,

22
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:09,885
- but I know my boy got the double digits!
- Zero.

23
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,942
- What?
- What?

24
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,416
Guys, we just met.

25
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:15,332
And we both screwed up relationships
in the past by jumping in too quick.

26
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:17,575
So we taIked about it
and we decided to take this one slow.

27
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,010
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!

28
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,997
But I don't know. I'm really into this girl.

29
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:28,133
And if going slow is what it takes
to make this happen, I say, bring it on.

30
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:29,974
I don't feel so good.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,987
It's like my testicles
mixed pop rocks and soda.

32
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,293
I can't believe she's making you wait
a whole month.

33
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,640
I would never put up with that.

34
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,690
You've only had sex with one girl
in your whole life.

35
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:39,972
Burn!

36
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,118
Ted, the only reason to wait
a month for sex...

37
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:45,193
is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.

38
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,565
Good news! I don't have to cover
the cat show tomorrow night.

39
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,815
Who's up for hanging out?

40
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:50,833
Oh, I can't.
I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.

41
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:53,748
Oh, we can't.
It's our nine-year anniversary.

42
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,089
Wow! Nine years?
Your relationship's a fourth grader.

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,964
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,880
We're going to the Berkshires
for the maple syrup harvest.

45
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:06,661
<i>It's one of New York magazine's
top five romantic getaways on a budget.</i>

46
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:09,532
Who says sexual can't be sensible?

47
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:12,396
Well, looks like it's gonna be
just you and me.

48
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:13,998
Really?

49
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,196
Actually, I was taIking to my martini.

50
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:19,782
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,592
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

52
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,219
Nothing better than a weekend
at a good bed-and-breakfast.

53
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:28,233
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m. Sharp.

54
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:32,293
Complimenting the owners
on their collection of needlepoint geese.

55
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,376
Awkward conversations
with middle-aged couples...

56
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,757
trying to stave off divorce.

57
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:41,361
Yeah, well, we'd better get going.
It's like a four-hour drive.

58
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:44,232
And it's supposed to rain tonight.

59
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,249
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV?

60
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:51,358
- Order in some Chinese.
- Szechwan Garden.

61
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,024
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell, yeah.

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,732
Good, 'cause this thing's empty.

63
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:04,383
$100 says
when you turn around I say, 'Wow!'

64
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:08,210
Barney, this is the third time
you've hit on me by accident!

65
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,645
It's one of the many risks
of the blind approach.

66
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:14,138
It's usually a two-man operation
where Ted signals if the target is hot.

67
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,407
But Ted's too busy
being in a lesbian relationship.

68
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:21,187
Why don't you just check out
the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?

69
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,807
You can't... Wow!

70
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:26,374
Hey! What's taking so long?

71
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,123
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, Scherbatsky.

72
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,427
I like the way you think. That mirror thing.

73
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,443
Simple. Elegant.

74
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,126
Okay, limited time offer.

75
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,572
I need a bro,
for my bro-ings-on about town.

76
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,443
How would you like to be said bro?

77
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,993
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

78
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:47,428
I'm hanging out with my friend
who just got dumped.

79
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:53,156
She really needs some support,
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.

80
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:55,468
That seems healthy.

81
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:57,717
All right! Guess I'm in.

82
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:04,049
So, one more week and it'll be a month.

83
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:08,439
Really, are you sure? Wow.
That snuck up on me.

84
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:09,953
Oh, come on!

85
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,548
The 18th can't get here fast enough.

86
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,310
Wait, the 18th?

87
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:18,635
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this.
I'm gonna be out of town on the 18th.

88
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:23,342
Oh, well, we can just wait
until you get back.

89
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,262
I mean, the whole point
was not to rush into this.

90
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:28,536
Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.

91
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,553
75th and Amsterdam.

92
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,616
I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.

93
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,442
Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?

94
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:43,653
We'd be just getting there now,
all tired and cranky.

95
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,409
And yet, we'd feel obligated to have sex.

96
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:50,014
Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it.

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,995
I would like to propose a toast...

98
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,764
to the most
awesomely mellow anniversary ever.

99
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,125
I'm so glad you have to go
to your parents next weekend.

100
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,137
I'm so glad your roommates
are out of town.

101
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,995
(WHISPERING)
Oh, my God! What are they doing home?

102
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,050
They think we went away.

103
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:21,106
Oh, it is on for my boy Ted!

104
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,511
But we didn't go away.
We're in the bathroom.

105
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,427
Well, they don't know that.
All we have to do is hide out in here...

106
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:29,599
until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.

107
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,874
But I don't want to hide out in here.

108
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,237
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind
waiting for this.

109
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,641
If we go out there and spoil the mood,
it's not gonna happen.

110
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,595
Then one of us is gonna
have to have sex with Ted.

111
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:42,140
(SCOFFS) And, not gonna be me.

112
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
Okay, fine.

113
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:48,192
I guess I'll actually floss.

114
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:55,872
You suited up!

115
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,589
Well, I figured if I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do this right.

116
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,447
Emilio, the woman will have...

117
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:03,786
I'll have a Johnnie WaIker Blue, neat,

118
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:06,494
and a Montecristo No. 2. Thanks.

119
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,473
The No. 2. A.k. A the Torpedo.

120
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,517
Or, as the rulers call it, Piramide.

121
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:18,621
My father was a cigar fanatic.
It was the only way to get his attention.

122
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,021
Father issues. Hot.

123
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,242
I know.
I was this close to being a huge slut.

124
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,720
Slut would have been better.
But I'll settle for bro.

125
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:31,405
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria
and can't drink.

126
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:35,018
Because he's pregnant.
'Cause he's the girl.

127
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:40,825
Oh, come on. Ted can't be pregnant.
You need to have sex to get pregnant.

128
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:43,772
What up! Freeze frame, high five!

129
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:50,465
I think this may be a perfect moment.

130
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:54,435
- I wish we could hold on to it forever.
- No.

131
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,195
Because the beauty of a moment
is that it's fleeting.

132
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,209
By its very nature,
it slips through our fingers.

133
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:05,648
Making it that much more precious.

134
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,768
That is bad.

135
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:12,863
That is like
high-school-literary-magazine bad!

136
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,401
(WHISPERING) And they're not even high.

137
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,515
And it's actually working.

138
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:21,511
Yeah, super slowly.
God, close the deal already.

139
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,596
It's been like 45 minutes.
We could've had sex three times by now.

140
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,896
- Yeah, try five!
- What up.

141
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:30,363
Hey, maybe we should just go out there.

142
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,895
No way! We can't go out there now.

143
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:35,811
They'll know that we've been
sitting in the bathroom the whole time.

144
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:38,192
- It'll be too weird.
- Fine.

145
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:43,661
But if we're stuck in here,
I'm turning up the volume.

146
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:51,124
I want to know you.

147
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:53,939
Like, know your soul.

148
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,270
Ted, what makes you cry?

149
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:02,973
Honey, could you hold my hair back?
I think I'm gonna hurl.

150
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,498
So, what do you and Ted
usually do after the cigar bar?

151
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:10,446
Are you kidding? Ted's never been here.

152
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:14,291
You've already flown higher and faster
than he ever did.

153
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:16,308
- Still.
- What?

154
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:24,230
There is one other thing we could do.
If you're up for it.

155
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,991
I had no idea laser tag still existed!

156
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,042
Yeah, well, enjoy it
before it becomes cool again.

157
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,189
- I give it two months.
- Oh, I believe it. This is awesome!

158
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,886
Okay, follow my lead, stay low,

159
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,578
and never underestimate
a 12-year-old with a...

160
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:41,041
Scherbatsky! You gotta focus!

161
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,762
- You just saved my life, didn't you?
- Thank me later.

162
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,254
Let's keep moving.
These little bastards are everywhere.

163
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,271
(YELLING)

164
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,367
He's just staring into her eyes!

165
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:58,764
I don't know. We used to be
even more nauseatingly into each other...

166
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,961
than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.

167
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:05,460
Yeah, now we just make fun
of people like that.

168
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,515
It's the circle of life.

169
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,783
I'm serious, Marshall.

170
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,861
I mean, we couldn't even get it up
to go on our big trip.

171
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:16,257
And now we're celebrating our anniversary
stuck in a bathroom.

172
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:18,949
Well, it's not fair to compare us
to Ted and Victoria.

173
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,160
I mean, this is their first time.

174
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:24,172
Yeah, but we could still have
some more romance.

175
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:28,349
Now you just say, 'Wanna do it,'
and I say, 'Yeah.'

176
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,058
- Wanna...
- No!

177
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,481
Maybe we're just out of firsts.

178
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,455
Looks like they're about to have theirs.

179
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,802
Should we take this to the bedroom?

180
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,819
- Yes!
- Yes!

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,038
Yes.

182
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:00,055
- Yes!
- Yes!

183
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,650
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

184
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,771
No! No, don't answer it.

185
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,932
You can answer it. We have all night.

186
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:14,122
- You're answering it? He's answering it!
- No! Do her! Do her now!

187
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:16,340
Sure. Good luck with that.

188
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
Sorry about that.

189
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,749
How about a little more wine?

190
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,538
- I'll get another bottle.
- Okay.

191
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:29,930
I need a drink.
Do we have any cough syrup in here?

192
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:32,064
(SHUSHING)...

193
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,018
- Ambush! Ambush! Ambush!
- Oh, God!

194
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,293
These brats have us
completely surrounded!

195
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,511
I counted nine, maybe ten.

196
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,619
I'll lay down some cover fire.
You make a run for it.

197
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,900
No! Leave no man behind.

198
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,855
Either we all get out of here,
or no one does.

199
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,578
- But, I...
- Don't be a hero, Scherbatsky!

200
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,796
See you on the other side.

201
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,785
Mother!

202
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,078
(GUNS FIRING)

203
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,771
Damn. Wanna go get a soft pretzel?

204
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,788
- Yeah.
- All right.

205
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:11,539
Marshall, what happened to us?

206
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:15,896
I mean, we used to just stare
into each others' eyes all night long.

207
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,913
Have we lost that?

208
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,765
Maybe.

209
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,968
But I think I just found it.

210
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,455
Right here.

211
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:34,893
Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering
with just-a-hint-of-crazy eyes.

212
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:41,080
Okay, well,
get ready for my sex-ray vision.

213
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,930
Did you remember to pick up
the dry cleaning?

214
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,244
- Oh, damn it!
- It's all right.

215
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,992
- We can do this. We can do this.
- Let's just hold hands.

216
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,957
This is nice.

217
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:01,168
Yeah.

218
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,964
You love that move!
It's the classic Marshall.

219
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,729
Great. We totally suck at this.

220
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,551
And we really,
really need to get out of here!

221
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,567
Well, we can't.

222
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:17,094
Baby, there's something I have to do.
And if I do it in front of you,

223
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,650
it'll change the entire nature
of our relationship.

224
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:23,532
- What is it?
- I have to pee.

225
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,648
This is bad.

226
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:31,915
We've gone nine years
without peeing in front of each other.

227
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,959
You always think there'll be more time.

228
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,306
Look at us.

229
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:40,470
We're basically an old married couple
and we're not even married yet.

230
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,553
The flame of our romance is flickering...

231
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,398
and if I pee all over it,
it might go out forever!

232
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,448
How much longer do you think
you can hold it?

233
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:53,767
<i>I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew
during that Quantum Leapmarathon.</i>

234
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,783
Oh, boy.

235
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,239
Playing laser tag really takes me back.

236
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:04,436
And you know what game I really miss?
Battleship. I've never lost a game.

237
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,609
- Neither have I. Of course, I cheat.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

238
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:10,364
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier
so it makes an 'L.'

239
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,735
I always just stacked the ships
on top of each other.

240
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,100
Nice! You know,
we should have a cheaters grudge match.

241
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,236
I think I still have a...

242
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,906
Hello. Target acquired.
Hottie by the jukebox.

243
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,372
Oh, good eye, Scherbatsky.

244
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,305
I got someone for you. Two o' clock.
Blue shirt.

245
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,979
That's a woman.

246
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,079
Oh, my mistake. Or is it?

247
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,829
- Let's just focus on your target.
- Right.

248
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:39,294
There. I got this one.

249
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:46,279
Oh, my God! I love your jeans!

250
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:50,575
Okay, is this a lesbian bar?
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...

251
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:53,364
Oh, no. I am all about the dudes.

252
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,125
Although, pickings are pretty slim tonight.

253
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:59,418
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit,
and he's playing hard to get.

254
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:04,085
(LAUGHS) Really?
'Cause he's totally vibing me right now.

255
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,723
Must be the jeans.

256
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:11,798
Well, jeans will only get you so far.
I'm going home with him.

257
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,444
We'll see about that.

258
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:28,191
Oh, my God, I hate Ted!
I hate him so much!

259
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,434
Baby, why don't you just go?

260
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,548
Tons of other couples have
peed in front of each other.

261
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:33,894
I know, but we haven't...

262
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,290
because I want to keep
some of the mystery alive.

263
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:43,089
- Well, you have farted in front of me.
- Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.

264
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,105
You always do.

265
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,253
- Hey.
- Hey.

266
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,919
Let's get outta here.
Let's go somewhere else.

267
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,328
Well, what happened?

268
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:58,053
Sometimes I like to do
a little catch-and-release.

269
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,251
- But why?
- Leave no man behind.

270
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,966
Either we all score, or no one scores.

271
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,472
Right on.

272
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:10,996
- Hey, you wanna go play Battleship?
- Hit!

273
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:27,231
Ted, I can't wait any longer.

274
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:32,153
- Should we move to the bedroom?
- There's no time for that.

275
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:34,971
So, they can suck on each others' fingers
for an hour,

276
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,598
but there's no time
to take two steps to the bedroom?

277
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:41,449
Baby, I can't hold it in any longer!
It's time!

278
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,428
I know.

279
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:47,723
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, Lily.

280
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:54,452
Here we go.

281
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:57,784
You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly
good time bro-ing out tonight.

282
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,956
Well, you make a good bro.
You're a better Ted than Ted.

283
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:05,634
Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself
an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.

284
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,652
And you don't even have
to come out of the cake.

285
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,582
Thanks. And thanks
for sticking around tonight.

286
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,829
I hope you're ready
for some hardcore Battleship.

287
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,846
Come on, boys.

288
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:21,356
'Hardcore'? That's the only way I play.

289
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:34,129
Oh, I found it. Are you ready to...
What the hell are you doing?

290
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:38,711
I'm birthday-suiting up. I'm sorry.
Did you want to undress me?

291
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,402
No! I thought we were
just hanging out as friends!

292
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:44,574
Oh, come on! You have been
throwing yourself at me all night!

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,714
What? I did the opposite!
I threw some other girl at you!

294
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,367
You invited me up to your apartment
to 'play Battleship'!

295
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:54,154
Is that not an internationally
recognized term for sex?

296
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,170
No!

297
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,384
Great.

298
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,990
I hope you're happy.
You sunk my battleship.

299
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,958
I'm okay. Are you okay?

300
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:15,491
I feel the same.
And, yet, strangely different.

301
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:20,587
Yeah, I'm happy for my bladder,
yet sad for us.

302
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,589
Look, you had to do it, sweetie. For Ted.

303
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:28,694
And, hey, look, at least now
we can stay in here as long as it takes.

304
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,091
Yeah, I guess our relationship
had to take a hit,

305
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:35,207
so a new one out there could blossom.

306
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,325
Oh, crap!

307
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,380
They must've heard that.

308
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:46,368
Well, I guess we can come out now.

309
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,249
I don't believe it, they're gone.

310
00:17:57,345 --> 00:18:00,065
Good.'Cause I gotta take a whiz.

311
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,706
Okay. You and me? That's insane.

312
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,405
If you even thought about it
for one second...

313
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:10,353
But I have thought about it for
three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense.

314
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,276
We both think
the marriage-commitment thing's a drag.

315
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:17,434
We both want something casual and fun.
And we clearly get along really well.

316
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,477
Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense.

317
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:24,001
- But what about Ted?
- I checked with Ted.

318
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,244
Hey, Ted. So now that things
with you and Victoria are going pretty well

319
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,648
I assume you're probably over
all the girls you were into before, right?

320
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,122
I take your silence as a yes,
so, ergo, therefore,

321
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,076
say I were to hook up with someone,
say, I don't know, Robin,

322
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:35,504
- you'd be cool with that, right?
- Sure, good luck with that.

323
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,138
Totally gave us his blessing.

324
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:39,409
- Really?
- Really.

325
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,419
So, Ted didn't care
that you wanted to make a move on me?

326
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:45,435
Didn't care at all.

327
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,490
- What?
- You like Ted!

328
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:59,054
- I didn't say that I liked Ted, I...
- You like Ted!

329
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,936
Wow! This is huge.

330
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:05,398
Barney, I don't like Ted.
He's moved on and I'm really happy for...

331
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:09,901
Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna
play Battleship or what?

332
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:20,270
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

333
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:24,747
No. That's the bro code.

334
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,678
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro
that a third bro has a crush on him.

335
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:33,049
Just like the third bro
doesn't tell the mutual bro...

336
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:37,247
that the original bro
went bare pickle in front of her.

337
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,263
It's quid pro bro.

338
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:41,348
A7.

339
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:43,364
- Miss.
- Of course.

340
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,735
Well, we still have one frontier left.
Still got the deuce.

341
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,980
You're not making me feel better.

342
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,014
Well, it certainly was a first.

343
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:00,314
It was, wasn't it?

344
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,527
- We still have firsts.
- Of course we do.

345
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:08,101
And you know what?
I actually feel closer to you now.

346
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,118
I wanna know you.

347
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,282
Like, know your soul.

348
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:17,546
Marshall, what makes you cry?

349
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,325
This moment is fleeting...

350
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,118
because it's being chased
by another moment.

351
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:29,870
Oh, just grab my boob already!

352
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,311
Come on, guys. Get a room.
