1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,048
.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,745
- Excuse me, do you...

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,573
excuse me.

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,839
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Sergeant Platt?

5
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,102
- Front desk.

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,455
- Sergeant Platt?
I'm Officer Vanessa Rojas.

7
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,370
I've been assigned
to Intelligence.

8
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,676
They said I should
come see you first.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,069
- You moving in?

10
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,853
- No, ma'am.

11
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,986
Am I in the right place?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,596
- Only time will tell.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,164
You have some
paperwork to fill in.

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,514
- Cool.
When do you need it by?

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,516
- Before you start
your tour of duty today.

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,041
But first on the agenda,
go to Headquarters

17
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,043
for your brand new
undercover ID.

18
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,827
Give this to the guys at OCD.

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,221
I've already put your
new name into the system.

20
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,745
- Maria Lopez?
- Is there a problem?

21
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:53,444
- Honestly, it's like the most
cliché Latina name there is...

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,926
and I'm part black.
Afro Latina, actually.

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,797
- Officer Rojas...

24
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,105
If you make
it in Intelligence--

25
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,846
and that is a big "if."

26
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,544
But if you do,
you will be working undercover.

27
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,808
Now, most of the bad guys
in the city have not undergone

28
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:11,332
racial sensitivity training,

29
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,029
so they will
assume you are Latina

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,988
and should they Google your ass
to make sure that you are

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,860
the person
you are pretending to be,

32
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:20,167
the fact that there's
a thousand Maria Lopezes

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,474
in Chicago will work
in your favor, right?

34
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,390
- Copy that.
- Vanessa,

35
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,392
how about I give you
a ride to Headquarters?

36
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,699
Morning Sergeant.
- Detective.

37
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,747
- Oh, uh, what about my locker?
- Ah, ah, ah--later.

38
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,227
Talk about that later.

39
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,142
Let's get a cup of coffee.

40
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,405
- So what the hell was
Platt's deal?

41
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,451
- The deal is--
do not mess with Trudy Platt.

42
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,627
Under no circumstances.
She ain't playing.

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,498
- I thought Voight
was our boss.

44
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,805
- Right, he is, but we work
in Platt's house, right?

45
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,415
So she controls the weather.

46
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,461
Piss her off, she can make
it rain all day, every day.

47
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:56,464
- She sounds old school.
I'll get her to lighten up.

48
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,943
- [screaming]
Help! Help me!

49
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,380
- Move, move!

50
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,253
- Someone please help!
- Let's go--stay close.

51
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,429
Stay close.
- Hey, stop that--

52
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,605
- Wait! All right!
Take cover, take cover.

53
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,565
Let her go!
Let her go--do not--

54
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,176
- Back up, back up!
Stop the vehicle.

55
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,352
Stop--I will shoot you.
Stop!

56
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,267
[tires screeching]

57
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,313
- Rojas, take my radio.

58
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,315
Call backup and an ambo--
and get those plates!

59
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,273
- We need an ambo here,
1200 Washburn.

60
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,188
- Copy that.

61
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,234
- Ma'am, look at me.
Okay--help is on the way.

62
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,627
- Stop the car!

63
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,892
Hey, get out now!

64
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:42,466
Driver, passenger--
out of the car.

65
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,295
Out of the car, now.
Hands where I can see them.

66
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,168
Hands high!
Turn around slow.

67
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,868
Driver, turn the car off.

68
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,921
Chicago PD.
Everybody stay where you are.

69
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,228
Don't get out of the car.

70
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,940
Stop or I'll shoot!

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,204
- [grunts]

72
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,870
This is Officer Rojas
of Intelligence.

73
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,872
We have a carjacking
at 1200 Washburn,

74
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,483
multiple victims injured.

75
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,486
- Officer,
what's your call sign?

76
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,052
- I haven't been
assigned one yet.

77
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,576
I just started.

78
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,412
- The whole thing
is a mess, Sarge.

79
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,065
We're basically
looking at three crime scenes.

80
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,937
It started back there
on Washburn with a carjacking

81
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,678
that Atwater and Rojas
responded to.

82
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,854
- The two offenders fled
and crashed into that car.

83
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,943
Then one offender
took off in the car,

84
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:11,294
the other one Rojas chased down
and he was impaled by rebar.

85
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,731
- So that's our DOA.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,081
Carjacking victim?
- Yeah, she's a young woman.

87
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,736
She was beaten pretty bad.
She's on her way to Med.

88
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,565
- Listen, did the responding
backup units pick up anything

89
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,219
'cause I was on the zone
and I didn't hear any chatter.

90
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,526
- That's the thing, Sarge.
They didn't call for backup.

91
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,008
- Huh.

92
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,227
- All right, do me a favor.

93
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
See if you can
tie this thing up?

94
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,622
- Yeah.
- Talk to me.

95
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,410
- Oh, he don't look too happy.
- That's just how he looks.

96
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,673
- All right,
walk me through this, Kev.

97
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,806
Why didn't you call for backup?

98
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,721
- It was a hot pursuit, Sarge.
Heat of the moment--

99
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,375
everything just
happened real fast.

100
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,073
- Look, Atwater told me
to radio for backup,

101
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,335
but the offender was fleeing.

102
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,858
And if I had stopped,
I would've lost him.

103
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,599
- Hmm.

104
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,427
You know there's
a lot of officers out there

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,516
monitoring that radio,
ready to help.

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,736
- I know.
It was instinct.

107
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,564
- Instinct.

108
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,609
Well your instinct
just caught us a carjacking,

109
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,656
an officer-involved death,
and a pile of paperwork.

110
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,094
Not a good look
on your first day.

111
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,057
- You all right?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,324
- What you doing?

113
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,022
- I'm updating the board.
Voight's orders.

114
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,243
- [groans] Boss.
- Huh?

115
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,593
- This is for real?

116
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,116
Antonio's moving
to Puerto Rico for sure?

117
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,988
- It's what he wants.
He's got family there.

118
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:40,427
Look, end of the day,
it's probably a good decision.

119
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:45,345
You all know Officer Rojas?
Welcome to Intelligence.

120
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,129
- Thank you.

121
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,478
Okay, I hope
this isn't the part

122
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,175
where I have to make a speech.

123
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,655
- Nothing like that.

124
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,789
Okay, what do we got?

125
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,399
- Straight-up
aggravated carjacking.

126
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,705
The victim's name
is Ruby Garcia.

127
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:58,923
She's 24.

128
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,708
She's at Chicago Med
with head trauma.

129
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,884
We lodged a BOLO on her
stolen car, nothing yet.

130
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,973
- We ran prints
on our DOA John Doe.

131
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,192
He's not in our system.
No wallet or ID.

132
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:10,587
- That means we gotta ID his
partner, so talk to your CIs.

133
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,459
Let's get a list
of everyone previously arrested

134
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,591
for carjacking in that area.

135
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:18,073
Kev, reach out to Major
Accidents, start the paper.

136
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,683
- Yes, sir.

137
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,686
- We've been chasing
a major cartel supply

138
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,209
and we're dropping that
for a carjacking?

139
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,386
- The offender died
while we were chasing him,

140
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,257
so we own it.

141
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,260
Let's just tie it off cleanly
and quickly and move on.

142
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,218
- Sergeant?

143
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,046
What would you
like for me to do?

144
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,092
- I want you to head to Med
and get a victim statement

145
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,093
from this Ruby.

146
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,399
And ride with Upton.

147
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,791
You two are going
to be partnering together.

148
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,489
Jay, you'll ride with Kim.

149
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,199
- Sarge, what just happened?

150
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,854
It takes a lot
of time and trust to build

151
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,073
a partnership that works
and Jay and I are working.

152
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,467
- I know.
- Then why split us up?

153
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,730
- Because I need
to evaluate Rojas

154
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,993
and I know you'll
shoot me straight.

155
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,954
Look, there are a lot
of red flags.

156
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:16,523
We don't need anybody
out there playing hero ball.

157
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,916
- Sounds like you
have your answer.

158
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919
- Yeah, well,
I talked to my guys

159
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,923
over at the Academy
and Rojas checked every box.

160
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,405
Top gun, high scores--
I mean, she killed it.

161
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,494
And she's got street
you can't teach.

162
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,278
- But...

163
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:36,064
- All those accomplishments
are individual.

164
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:39,459
We gotta know she can
work with this team.

165
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,550
You ever wonder
why you and Halstead

166
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,856
are the only detectives
to join this unit?

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,989
Everybody else came in raw.

168
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,688
It's always better
to find the right person

169
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,474
before they learn
the wrong habits.

170
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,866
You understand?

171
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,960
- Then, right as I
pull in the parking lot,

172
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,049
this guy reaches
in my car and pulls me out

173
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,616
and then one of them
was punching me.

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,836
- Did you see
where they came from?

175
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,056
- They came from behind me.
I saw them running.

176
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,233
Did you guys find my car yet?
- No, I'm afraid we didn't.

177
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,801

Come on.

178
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,195
This can't be happening.

179
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,327
- What were you doing
in that neighborhood?

180
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,894
- I was going to work.

181
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,679
- And what kind
of work do you do?

182
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:29,160
- I'm a waitress.
- Like, legit waitress?

183
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,554
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying

184
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,774
you got a nice ride for
a waitress from Little Village.

185
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,645
- Yeah, and how would you know?

186
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,125
- 'Cause that's
where I grew up.

187
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,042
- Oh--all right,
and look at you now.

188
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,698
In answer to your question,
I'm a legit waitress.

189
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,613
I work at Pescado.

190
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,747
- Okay, well you give us a call
if you think of anything.

191
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,402
- Hey, um...

192
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,838
maybe we can get some coffee

193
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,840
and you can give
me some advice?

194
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,539
I want to try
something new with my life.

195
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,628
- Sure.

196
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,023
- According to our victim,
Ruby, she saw the offenders

197
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,156
running from
the street behind her.

198
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,114
Assuming these geniuses
didn't drive their own car

199
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,204
to a carjacking,
we checked the nearest L.

200
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,815
- Right, and that
takes you to the Pink Line,

201
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,425
which is three blocks south.

202
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,601
This is ten minutes
before the jacking, Sarge.

203
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,735
That's our John Doe right there
during happier times...

204

That's karma for you.

facial rec on the partner?

211
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,934

you're scared, Felix.

212
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,418
You should be.

213
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,899
You're looking at carjacking,

214
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,380
you're looking at battery...

215
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,428
And you're looking at murder.

216
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:07,955
- No...it wasn't supposed
to go down like this, I swear.

217
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,783
- What's your
partner's name, Felix?

218
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,741
- His name's Miguel.
I think he's from Guatemala.

219
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,047
- Last name?
- Not sure--

220
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,918
I didn't hardly know him.

221
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,441
- You knew him well enough
to jack a car with him.

222
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,921
- He said he'd give me $500

223
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,749
to help him pick up a car.

224
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,621
I didn't know there was
gonna be somebody in it.

225
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,144
- So you were
stealing a specific car?

226
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,189
- Yeah, it was for somebody
that Miguel knew.

227

I was just along for the ride.
- Look at me.

Then who did you
give the car to?

229
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,762
- Nobody.
I parked it in the street

00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,258

235
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,347

I'm still running it
to see if it's hot.

241
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,619
- It's definitely hot.

242
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,926
- Yo, Ruz, come check this out.

00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,406
You see where the fire
burned back the upholstery?

244
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,712
- Yeah, bro.

- No...

251
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,341
- Hey, Sarge.
So, turns out Ruby's car

252
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,909
was fitted with a high-end,
fireproof drug trap,

253
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,346
which is lucky for us
because it preserved

254
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,870
the drug residue inside,

255
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,393
which the field test
confirmed was heroin.

256
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,569
- So this wasn't a carjacking,
it was a dope rip.

257
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:41,918
- Exactly.
The Lab told us that

258
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,485
the fingerprint
found inside this trap

259
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,008
is definitely Ruby Garcia's.

260
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,749
- Okay, which means Ruby
wasn't some innocent girl

261
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,969
who got her car jacked.
She's a drug runner.

262

scoop her up.

263
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,190
- Copy that.

264
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,591
- Ten to one she's not home.

265
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,984
- No bet.

Just a guy in a hoodie.

we'll talk to the roommate

- At Pescado.

She worked there.
We just kind of hit it off.

We talked about how we
wanted to live in Lincoln Park,

too expensive, so,

together and we moved in here.

It's such a tragedy.

time you saw Ruby?

- Two days ago.

She was supposed
to come into work yesterday.

- How long has she worked here?

- Maybe six months or so.

319
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,688
- We ran Ruby's
social security number, though,

320
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,822
and there's no record of her
employment at your restaurant.

00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,103

Looks like the letter, "F."

347
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,669
- Mm-hmm.
All right,

the Detective Bureau,

00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,282

across anything similar.

350
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,414
- Well, I spoke
to the Crime Lab--Hailey.

351
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,896
They, uh, pulled the data
from Ruby's GPS.

352
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,072
Mostly non-descript, normal
driving around the city stuff,

353
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,901
but there's one outlier--this
neighborhood in the Wild 100s.

354
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,164
She went there four times
in the last month,

355
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,427
including right
before she got jacked.

356
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,994
- Well that's gotta
be where the weight is kept.

357
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,430
She was picking up
dope from a source.

358

talk to your CIs.

Find out who's moving
heroin in that area

360
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,567
and find out who
Ruby was working for,

361
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,525
'cause right now he's looking
good for her murder.

362
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,266
- All right.

363
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,054
- Ruby's made
four trips to the bar--

364
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,751
it's owned by Jose Soto.

365
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,449
DEA's got an open case.
They think Soto's bringing

366
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,843
bulk heroin into the country
for the Cali Cartel.

She was a mule for the buyer.

00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,374
- So who was the buyer?

412
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:37,159
- Never met him.
- You never met him?

413
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,813
- We only do business by text.

414
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,687
- So you're saying you know
nothing about the buyer?

415
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,689
- I know his money's green

416
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,605
and he always sends girls
to pick up the product.

417
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:51,913
- So you hired
the bangers to jack the car?

You knew it was loaded

What was I supposed to do?

But I didn't kill nobody.

424
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,235
- You got an alibi
for 6:00 last night?

425
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,411
- I was at Frank's soccer game.

426
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:12,803
He lost.

427
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,895
- We checked Soto's alibi.

428
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,593
Three people put him
at his brother's game.

429
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,072
- He could've hired the hit.
- Maybe,

any proof of that.

- Boss--yeah, thank you.

432
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,688
All right, so Soto gave us
the number he was using

00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,342
to communicate with
this mystery dealer.

434
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,648
It was a burner phone.
It went dark, so I wasn't able

435
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,259
to track that,
but I did track where it was

so we can take a better look?

442
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,887
- Yes, I remember two men
bought phones that day...

443
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,238
uh, here...is the first one.

444
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,632
- Who's the second guy?

445
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,112
- Uh...this guy.

446
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,071
- Eh, not likely.
- Can you rewind?

447
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,464
Go back, yeah.

00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:07,118
- Okay, stop.

449

- We're looking for a man.

00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,472
- Says who?

453
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,920
- The burner used to do
the drug buys was purchased

454
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,661
by Alexa Rivera--42,
she's not on

455
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,140

00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,446
Based on the amount
of heroin we think

457
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,013
she bought from Soto,
she should be.

458
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,493
- Before she started
a restaurant,

459
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,451
Alexa was a social worker--
she taught

460
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,540
a vocational training class
for at-risk youth.

461
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,194
Ruby was one of her students.

462
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,587
- She got two priors.
One for possession,

463
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,197
one for agg-battery.

464
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,025
She broke the eye socket
of her live-in girlfriend.

465
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:46,941
- So, what are we waiting for?
Let's bust her.

466
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:49,291
- All right--based on what?

467
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,293
- Ruby was running drugs
for Alexa,

468
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,948
who has a history of violence,
so when Ruby lost her load,

469
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,819
it makes sense she killed her.
Street justice.

470
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,126
- Well, it's a very good
theory,

471
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,129
but so far we got no evidence
Alexa murdered Ruby.

472
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,263
What we do know
is Alexa's in the drug trade.

473
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,177
So let's catch her dirty.

474
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,267
We'll take her off the street,
then build a murder case.

475

being her supply
just got ripped.

477
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,227
- Right, there's an opening,

478
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,663
which means
she's looking for product.

00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,632
- Hmm...
- You know, you could call him.

518
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,329
He'll vouch for me.

519
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,638
- I'll be right back.

520
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,773
- This deal ain't happening.
Not with you.

521
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,384
- [groans]

522
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,213
- Take a look around.
It's all women.

523
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,172
She only hires women.

524
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,611
- Well,
we're gonna play it out.

525
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,396
We'll see how it goes, okay?

526
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,790
- I've got an angle.

527
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,923
Grab me.
- What?

528
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,317
- Grab me--make it seem
like we're in a fight.

529
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,581
- What is she talking about?
- Let go of me!

530
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,758
- Hey--hey!
What the hell is going on here?

531
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,237
This is my place of business.

532
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,414
- I apologize.
Would you like to do this?

533
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,806
- No!

534
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,852
I don't know a Jose Soto, okay?

535
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,462
So you need to leave, now.

536
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,551
- Alexa, listen.
- Go--out.

537
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:47,948
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

538
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:51,473
- What the hell happened?
- I mean, we laid the bait,

539
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,257
she just wasn't gonna bite.

540
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,998
- Vanessa, I was clear--
you were supposed to follow

541
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,783
Adam's lead.
Why'd you go off book?

542
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,786
- Because it wasn't gonna work.
- How do you know that?

543
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,484
- I know Alexa's type.
She's only got women around.

544
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,355
Vulnerable ones--
ones who need her.

545
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,532
She wasn't gonna
talk to this guy.

546
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,359
- Sarge, me and Burgess
sat on Soto the whole time.

547
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:09,752
Alexa never called him.

548
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:13,103
- Yeah, for whatever reason,
she got cold feet.

549
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,366
Rojas is right.
She wasn't gonna do the deal.

550
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,630
- Hey, tell them your idea.

551
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,589
- Sergeant,
I know how to get to her.

552
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,379
- Oh--no, no, no, no.
Wait, uh-uh.

553
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,295
Take that to my office.
Miss Bodyguard,

554
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:34,516
I told you to leave
and I want you to stay away.

555
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,607
What happened to you?

556
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,568
- He got mad at me
for messing up the deal.

557
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,529
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah...

558
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,358
yeah--it's not the first time.

559
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,709
- All right,
well why did you come here?

560
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:59,062
- I know where
he's got the dope.

561
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,586
Two keys.

562
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,588
I can steal it
and sell it to you.

563
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,721
Look, I'm in a really
bad place right now,

564
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,941
so I'm willing
to give you a deal.

565
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:11,379
We both know it's worth 100.
I'll give it to you for 25.

566
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,338
- [scoffs]
- 20.

567
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,776
Please--look,
I just need some running money.

568
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,345
- Where are you
going to run to, hmm?

569
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,130
Do you have family?

570
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,307
No?

571
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,747
[sighs]
- [winces]

572
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,578
- You have no idea how angry

573
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,754
it makes me
to see you like this.

574
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,802
- Are we gonna do this or not?

575
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:48,329
- Yeah--yeah,
we're gonna do this.

576
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,592
But just you and me.

577
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,638
Nobody else involved.
Do you understand?

578
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,080
What's your name?

579
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:01,603
- Maria.

580
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,649
- Maria.

581
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,433
- Maria Lopez.

582
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,574
Now she's late.

583
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,664
- Don't worry,
we got all night.

584
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,626
- Got a blue Nissan Altima
approaching from the south.

585
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,327
- All right,
wait for the exchange,

586
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,547
then move in on my signal.

587
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,905
- You Maria?
- Who are you?

588
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,865
- I'm picking up a package
for Miss Alexa.

589
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,389
- Got a visual of the driver.

590
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,610
It's Karla Moore.
It's Ruby's roommate.

591
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,396
- Oh, man.
Alexa doesn't disappoint.

592
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,093
- Look, that wasn't
part of the deal.

593
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,183
Alexa's supposed to meet me.
My ass is on the line for this.

594
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:01,707
- I'm just supposed
to pick it up.

595
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,534
- Nah, screw that--
I don't even know you.

596
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,232
Call Alexa--okay,
we're supposed to meet here--

597
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,668
her and I.
That's what she promised.

598
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,805
- We don't have
ears on that call.

599
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,983
- I have to go.

600
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:18,593
Miss Alexa changed her mind.

601
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,682
She said she doesn't want
the sea bass.

602
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,684
- Sea bass?
What are you talking about?

603
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,251
- She said you can keep it.

604
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:26,514
- Wait--whatever, okay,

605
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,342
if that's what she wants,
I can sell this to you.

606
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,301
- I'm sorry, that won't work.
- We can still do the deal.

607
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,390
- Nope--deal's off.

608
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:34,827
- Sarge, you want us
to snatch her up?

609
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,655
- No, we don't wanna
tip off Alexa.

610
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,745
I've got another idea.

611
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,316
- What was Rojas thinking?
She makes the deal,

612
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,405
we follow the drugs,
we bust Alexa.

613
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,798
- She's just following
the terms that were laid out.

614
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,713
She didn't know
it'd go sideways.

615
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,239
- What are you doing?

616
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,502
[screams]

617
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:09,209
.

618
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,777
- We went over this earlier.

619
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,563
I know that was scary, but we
did that for your protection

620
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,870
because we don't Alexa to know
you're talking to the police.

621
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,480
- You don't think
I'll tell her?

622
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,526
- We don't think
it's in your best interests,

623
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,919
given the circumstances.

624
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,921
- All right, Karla,
I'm gonna lay it out for you.

625
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,273
We believe Alexa killed Ruby

626
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,101
because she lost
her load of heroin.

627
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,408
- Are you crazy?
Alexa didn't kill Ruby.

628
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,931
She would never do that.

629
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:39,674
- Right...
Alexa's a drug dealer.

630
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,329
She used young women
to traffic her drugs

631
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:45,114
and we know that
you're one of them.

632
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:49,118
- Her drug supplier,
Jose Soto--

633
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:54,297
he picked your face
out of a photo array.

634
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:57,039
He admitted to giving
you dope in the past.

635
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,695
Karla, that puts you
on the hook

636
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,088
for felony trafficking.

637
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,960
- That's 15 to 30 years.

638
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:11,445
- We understand Alexa
took advantage of you, okay?

639
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,969
We can make
the drug charges go away.

640
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:18,017
But the only way that's gonna
happen is if you work with us.

641
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,064
You have to wear a wire.

642
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:25,154
You gotta get Alexa
to confess to murder.

643
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,073
- Like I told you before,

644
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,162
I have nothing
to say to you.

645
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,701
- All right,
what's the deal with Karla?

646
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,268
- She drank the Kool-Aid.
She doesn't believe

647
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,314
that Alexa's capable of murder.

648
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:57,665
- Yeah, the only person
Karla trusts is Alexa.

649
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,841
All right, so we need
to find some evidence to break

650
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,321
that trust.
What do we got?

651
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,976
- Well, we could bring
Alexa in, sweat her,

652
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,760
get her out
of her comfort zone.

653
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,284
- If she doesn't roll,
then we've tipped our hand.

654
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,634
The only reason we never heard
of her is 'cause she's smart.

655
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:13,028
- Sarge, we got something.
We sent that brand marking

656
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,422
to Detectives Bureau.
We got a hit from Homicide.

657
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,859
- Julissa Cruz.
Her body was discovered

658
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,382
in Armour Park nine months ago.

659
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:22,298
Same branding on her
torso as Ruby--letter "F."

660
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,300
- So we pulled
the Homicide file.

661
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,563
Alexa is a person of interest,
but they couldn't make a case.

662
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,827
- So what's Julissa's
connection to Alexa?

663
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,612
- Julissa took Alexa's
vocational training class.

664
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,006
Same as Ruby, same as Karla.

665
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,225
- Maybe let me take a shot?

666
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,020
Hi, Karla.

667
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,936
- Wait, you're a cop?
- I'm Officer Rojas.

668
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,111
- Well, what
the hell do you want?

669
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:55,027
- I just wanna talk--please.

670
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,127
- You can't trust
anybody in this world.

671
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,522
- Look, and I get
why you feel that way.

672
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,004
You bounced
around foster homes...

673
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:19,007
but they ain't even your homes

674
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,140
and they sure as hell
ain't your family.

675
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,751
So of course there's
gonna be trust issues.

676
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,971
- And how would you know?

677
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,976
- Foster care is bad
when you're in it,

678
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,282
but it's worse
when you age out.

679
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:36,416
'Cause all of a sudden
you're out in the world

680
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,984
and you ain't
got nowhere to go.

681
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,900
And these predators
come in all shapes and sizes

682
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,424
and they find you.

683
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,947
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

684
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,601
- Hmm.

685
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,385
You know, mine was a man.

686
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:53,128
Some older dude.
He had game.

687
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,262
He made me feel good,

688
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:59,656
bought me nice things,
let me crash at his place.

689
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,009
And he'd tell me
I was his favorite.

690
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:10,145
And then he burned his freaking
cigarette into my shoulder.

691
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,060
- That sounds like a creep
who wanted

692
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,149
to have sex with a girl.

693
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,760
Alexa's the opposite
of what you're saying.

694
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,067
- Is she?

695
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,330
Then what the hell
is that on your belly?

696
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,854
- This was my choice.
- That's a brand.

697
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,552
That's what they do to cows.

698
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,510
You know,
she's making you her property

699
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:29,599
and she ain't never
letting you go.

700
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:32,515
She didn't let Ruby go...
or Julissa.

701
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:37,738
- Julissa--what do you mean?
- You don't know?

702
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,740
- Julissa's in Seattle.
She moved there last year.

703
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,133
She got a really good job.

704
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,961
- Well,
Julissa's not in Seattle.

705
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,875
She's in a casket.

706
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,486
- What are you talking about?

707
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,880
- They found her body
in Armour Park nine months ago.

708
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,665
- No, that's not true.

709
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,450
Alexa spoke to her
on the phone last week.

710
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,020
- She was stabbed
multiple times in the heart,

711
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,327
just like Ruby.

712
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,549
- No...

713
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:11,815
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

714
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,605
- They still haven't
found her killer,

715
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,173
but you know who
it was, don't you?

716
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:26,221
- [breathing heavily]

717
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,322
- Remember,
we're waiting for an admission

718
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,542
to Ruby's murder
before we move in.

719
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,067
- Copy--we're in position.

720
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,374
- Got a visual
on the button cam.

721
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,550
- Hey, where were you?
I was calling you.

722
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:53,031
- I'm sorry, my phone died.

723
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,685
I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

724
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,252
- I'm just confused
about Ruby--

725
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,601
I don't understand
what happened.

726
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,257
- I told you--
Ruby got caught up in drugs

727
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,085
and she started hanging
with the wrong people.

728
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,913
- But I never saw her do
drugs.

729
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,220
- Yeah, because she was
being sneaky, mama.

730
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,918
She hid it from you.
From us.

731
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,615
- She said she was
going to meet you.

732
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,402
- No, that's wrong.
Ruby was going to the police

733
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:20,145
and she betrayed us.
She betrayed our familia.

734
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,279
- So is that why
you killed her?

735
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,501
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

736
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:31,417
- Alexa, I just want
to know what happened.

737
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,723
I tried to call Julissa.
- Really?

738
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,769
When was that?

739
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,206
- Right before I got here,
but the line was disconnected.

740
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,079
- I thought you said
your phone was dead.

741
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,950
- It is.

742
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,735
I called her before--
I called her before it died.

743
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,215
Alexa, please.

744
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,434
I just wanna know
what happened.

745
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:51,654
Please.
- Come here, mami.

746
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,179
Mira.

747
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,311
Don't get stressed.
- Okay.

748
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,183
- Okay?
Everything's fine.

749
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:01,229
Mira, come.
Come here.

750
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,799
You were always my favorite.

751
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,192
- She's gonna kill her.
- There's no weapon,

752
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,845
so we wait for the safe word.

753
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,458
- But I think
you're lying to me.

754
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,937
- I'm telling you--
she's gonna kill her.

755
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,765
- Wait, wait, wait.
- If you're lying to me...

756
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,071
- She's got a weapon.

757
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,638
- I'll keep eyes
till you breach.

758
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,813
- I'm gonna cut your
freaking heart out.

759
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,162
Understand, bitch?

760
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:25,123
.

761
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,298
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

762
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,082
Okay.

763
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,389
- Chicago PD!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

764
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,695
Whoa.

765
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,568
Everybody put your guns down.

766
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,527
Everybody relax.
Let's stay calm.

767
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,963
All right, Alexa,

768
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,183
I'm Sergeant Hank Voight
and I'm putting my gun away.

769
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,446
I'm here to help you.
Take it easy.

770
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,102
Look, obviously...
there's nowhere to go, okay?

771
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,104
So let's you and I figure out

772
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,280
a peaceful solution--
you and me.

773
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,152
- This is entrapment.
I didn't do anything.

774
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:57,764
- Nobody is saying
you did, okay?

775
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,636
Now Alexa, just put the--
put the knife down.

776
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,377
- I will cut this bitch!
- Okay, relax.

777
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,989
- I'll cut you, bitch!
- Come on--hey, hey, hey.

778
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,949
- [crying]
- Alexa, put the knife down,

779
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,560
walk outside,
we'll have a conversation here.

780
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,128
- I want my lawyer first.
- Okay.

781
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,651
okay, I'll get you your lawyer,

782
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:18,001
but you have
to let Karla go first.

783
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,438
Okay?

784
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,136
- Do you know how much
I've done for this girl?

785
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,878
Remember how much
I've done for you?

786
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,967
She was homeless.

787
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,143
I took her off the streets.

788
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,145
- [crying]
- And now she's confused.

789
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,495
You've poisoned her against me.

790
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,151
- Alexa...I hear you,

791
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,242
but we gotta focus
on right now, okay?

792
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,158
I'm willing
to work with you, okay?

793
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,552
But we gotta build trust.
The best way to do that

794
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:48,293
is to let Karla go.

795
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,338
- You don't get it.
Karla's a victim.

796
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,905
She's mentally ill.

797
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:55,822
She makes up stories
to protect herself to survive.

798
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,215
You can't believe
anything she says.

799
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,390
- We know that.

800
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,001
We know--and it all works
in your favor.

801
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,959
- [breathing heavily]
- Now, don't blow it.

802
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,614
Be smart.
Come on, let her go.

803
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,703
It's the only way.

804
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,532
Come on, Alexa.
Put the knife down.

805
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,273
Put it down.
Let her go.

806
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:15,929
- [gasps]
- Hey, hey, hey--look at me.

807
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,975
It's over--it's over.
Walk to me.

808
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,543
Put the knife down--come on.

809
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:25,373
Put the...
put the knife down, now.

810
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,506
Now, walk to me.

811
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,334
- Karla, no!

812
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,292
- Drop the knife!

813
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,120
- 5021 Eddie--
we have a stabbing victim.

814
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,991
Roll an ambulance
to 1360 State Street

815
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:37,298
right now--right now.

816
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,517
- Copy that.

817
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,083
Ambo dispatched.

818
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,401
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

819
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,185
- Alexa didn't make it.

820
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,318
- Get the knife
to the Crime Lab.

821
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,319
- Yeah, it's on its way.

822
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,886
What do you
wanna do with Karla?

823
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,496
Anybody looks
at that video is gonna know

824
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,889
Alexa wasn't armed.

825
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,891
- What video?

826
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,331
- I just heard
from the Crime Lab.

827
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,202
They dismantled the knife
Karla used to kill Alexa

828
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,204
and they found
Ruby's DNA in the hilt.

829
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,077
- All right, good,
so that case is closed.

830
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,079
Now...

831
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,777
I need to know
your assessment of Rojas.

832
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,868
- [sighs]

833
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,262
She went off book twice.

834
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,004
Her instincts were right,
but one day they won't be.

835
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,660
You live by your instincts,
eventually you die by them.

836
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,575
- Or someone else does.

837
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,012
- Exactly.

838
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,494
- So, it's a no?

839
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:48,326
[water running]

840
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,332
- So you really did
get burnt with a cigarette.

841
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,945
- Something like that.

842
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:01,861
You know,

843
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,776
Platt said they
couldn't give me a locker--

844
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,299
said there were some issues.

845
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,041
Pretty sure
that's not a good sign.

846
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,224
- Look, Vanessa.

847
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,748
the way they jammed you
into Intelligence--

848
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:23,099
they didn't do you any favors.

849
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,015
I was also in deep undercover.

850
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,496
Transition's a bitch.

851
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,369
You live by your lights,
your instincts...

852
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:34,415
because that's how you survive.

853
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,112
But here?

854
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:38,201
It's a different game.

855
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:42,031
It's about teamwork and trust.

856
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,252
And it takes time.

857
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,214
- I get it.

858
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,349
Thank you.

859
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,526
I hope we can stay
in touch, if that's cool.

860
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,442
- Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

861
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,879
We're gonna
be working together.

862
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,362
- What are you talking about?
- You're in.

863
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,885
- I'm in?

864
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,453
- Yeah, Voight just
signed off on you.

865
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,025
We just have one final hurdle.

866
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,114
Platt says you didn't
fill out your address.

867
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:23,551
- No, I'll--I'll do that.

868
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:30,036
- You don't have
an address, do you?

869
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,650
- Not yet.

870
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:39,262
They pulled me out
of my undercover apartment.

871
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,265
I just haven't had time
to look for a new place.

872
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,402
- Honestly, with this job,

873
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,579
you're not gonna have any
free time any time soon, so...

874
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,062
Why don't you stay with me?

875
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,890
- You mean that?

876
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:01,415
- Yeah, we'll work it out.

877
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,463
Let's go.

878
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,511
