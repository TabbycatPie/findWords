1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,048
.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,745
- Excuse me, do you...

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,573
excuse me.

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,839
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Sergeant Platt?

5
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,102
- Front desk.

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,455
- Sergeant Platt?
I'm Officer Vanessa Rojas.

7
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,370
I've been assigned
to Intelligence.

8
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,676
They said I should
come see you first.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,069
- You moving in?

10
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,853
- No, ma'am.

11
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,986
Am I in the right place?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,596
- Only time will tell.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,164
You have some
paperwork to fill in.

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,514
- Cool.
When do you need it by?

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,516
- Before you start
your tour of duty today.

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,041
But first on the agenda,
go to Headquarters

17
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,043
for your brand new
undercover ID.

18
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,827
Give this to the guys at OCD.

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,221
I've already put your
new name into the system.

20
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,745
- Maria Lopez?
- Is there a problem?

21
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:53,444
- Honestly, it's like the most
clichÃ© Latina name there is...

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,926
and I'm part black.
Afro Latina, actually.

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,797
- Officer Rojas...

24
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,105
If you make
it in Intelligence--

25
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,846
and that is a big "if."

26
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,544
But if you do,
you will be working undercover.

27
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,808
Now, most of the bad guys
in the city have not undergone

28
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:11,332
racial sensitivity training,

29
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,029
so they will
assume you are Latina

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,988
and should they Google your ass
to make sure that you are

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,860
the person
you are pretending to be,

32
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:20,167
the fact that there's
a thousand Maria Lopezes

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,474
in Chicago will work
in your favor, right?

34
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,390
- Copy that.
- Vanessa,

35
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,392
how about I give you
a ride to Headquarters?

36
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,699
Morning Sergeant.
- Detective.

37
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,747
- Oh, uh, what about my locker?
- Ah, ah, ah--later.

38
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,227
Talk about that later.

39
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,142
Let's get a cup of coffee.

40
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,405
- So what the hell was
Platt's deal?

41
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,451
- The deal is--
do not mess with Trudy Platt.

42
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,627
Under no circumstances.
She ain't playing.

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,498
- I thought Voight
was our boss.

44
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,805
- Right, he is, but we work
in Platt's house, right?

45
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,415
So she controls the weather.

46
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,461
Piss her off, she can make
it rain all day, every day.

47
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:56,464
- She sounds old school.
I'll get her to lighten up.

48
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,943
- [screaming]
Help! Help me!

49
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,380
- Move, move!

50
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,253
- Someone please help!
- Let's go--stay close.

51
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,429
Stay close.
- Hey, stop that--

52
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,605
- Wait! All right!
Take cover, take cover.

53
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,565
Let her go!
Let her go--do not--

54
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,176
- Back up, back up!
Stop the vehicle.

55
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,352
Stop--I will shoot you.
Stop!

56
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,267
[tires screeching]

57
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,313
- Rojas, take my radio.

58
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,315
Call backup and an ambo--
and get those plates!

59
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,273
- We need an ambo here,
1200 Washburn.

60
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,188
- Copy that.

61
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,234
- Ma'am, look at me.
Okay--help is on the way.

62
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,627
- Stop the car!

63
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,892
Hey, get out now!

64
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:42,466
Driver, passenger--
out of the car.

65
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,295
Out of the car, now.
Hands where I can see them.

66
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,168
Hands high!
Turn around slow.

67
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,868
Driver, turn the car off.

68
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,921
Chicago PD.
Everybody stay where you are.

69
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,228
Don't get out of the car.

70
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,940
Stop or I'll shoot!

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,204
- [grunts]

72
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,870
This is Officer Rojas
of Intelligence.

73
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,872
We have a carjacking
at 1200 Washburn,

74
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,483
multiple victims injured.

75
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,486
- Officer,
what's your call sign?

76
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,052
- I haven't been
assigned one yet.

77
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,576
I just started.

78
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,412
- The whole thing
is a mess, Sarge.

79
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,065
We're basically
looking at three crime scenes.

80
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,937
It started back there
on Washburn with a carjacking

81
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,678
that Atwater and Rojas
responded to.

82
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,854
- The two offenders fled
and crashed into that car.

83
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,943
Then one offender
took off in the car,

84
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:11,294
the other one Rojas chased down
and he was impaled by rebar.

85
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,731
- So that's our DOA.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,081
Carjacking victim?
- Yeah, she's a young woman.

87
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,736
She was beaten pretty bad.
She's on her way to Med.

88
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,565
- Listen, did the responding
backup units pick up anything

89
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,219
'cause I was on the zone
and I didn't hear any chatter.

90
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,526
- That's the thing, Sarge.
They didn't call for backup.

91
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,008
- Huh.

92
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,227
- All right, do me a favor.

93
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
See if you can
tie this thing up?

94
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,622
- Yeah.
- Talk to me.

95
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,410
- Oh, he don't look too happy.
- That's just how he looks.

96
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,673
- All right,
walk me through this, Kev.

97
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,806
Why didn't you call for backup?

98
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,721
- It was a hot pursuit, Sarge.
Heat of the moment--

99
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,375
everything just
happened real fast.

100
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,073
- Look, Atwater told me
to radio for backup,

101
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,335
but the offender was fleeing.

102
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,858
And if I had stopped,
I would've lost him.

103
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,599
- Hmm.

104
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,427
You know there's
a lot of officers out there

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,516
monitoring that radio,
ready to help.

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,736
- I know.
It was instinct.

107
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,564
- Instinct.

108
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,609
Well your instinct
just caught us a carjacking,

109
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,656
an officer-involved death,
and a pile of paperwork.

110
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,094
Not a good look
on your first day.

111
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,057
- You all right?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,324
- What you doing?

113
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,022
- I'm updating the board.
Voight's orders.

114
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,243
- [groans] Boss.
- Huh?

115
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,593
- This is for real?

116
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,116
Antonio's moving
to Puerto Rico for sure?

117
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,988
- It's what he wants.
He's got family there.

118
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:40,427
Look, end of the day,
it's probably a good decision.

119
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:45,345
You all know Officer Rojas?
Welcome to Intelligence.

120
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,129
- Thank you.

121
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,478
Okay, I hope
this isn't the part

122
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,175
where I have to make a speech.

123
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,655
- Nothing like that.

124
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,789
Okay, what do we got?

125
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,399
- Straight-up
aggravated carjacking.

126
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,705
The victim's name
is Ruby Garcia.

127
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:58,923
She's 24.

128
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,708
She's at Chicago Med
with head trauma.

129
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,884
We lodged a BOLO on her
stolen car, nothing yet.

130
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,973
- We ran prints
on our DOA John Doe.

131
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,192
He's not in our system.
No wallet or ID.

132
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:10,587
- That means we gotta ID his
partner, so talk to your CIs.

133
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,459
Let's get a list
of everyone previously arrested

134
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,591
for carjacking in that area.

135
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:18,073
Kev, reach out to Major
Accidents, start the paper.

136
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,683
- Yes, sir.

137
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,686
- We've been chasing
a major cartel supply

138
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,209
and we're dropping that
for a carjacking?

139
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,386
- The offender died
while we were chasing him,

140
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,257
so we own it.

141
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,260
Let's just tie it off cleanly
and quickly and move on.

142
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,218
- Sergeant?

143
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,046
What would you
like for me to do?

144
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,092
- I want you to head to Med
and get a victim statement

145
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,093
from this Ruby.

146
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,399
And ride with Upton.

147
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,791
You two are going
to be partnering together.

148
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,489
Jay, you'll ride with Kim.

149
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,199
- Sarge, what just happened?

150
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,854
It takes a lot
of time and trust to build

151
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,073
a partnership that works
and Jay and I are working.

152
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,467
- I know.
- Then why split us up?

153
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,730
- Because I need
to evaluate Rojas

154
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,993
and I know you'll
shoot me straight.

155
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,954
Look, there are a lot
of red flags.

156
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:16,523
We don't need anybody
out there playing hero ball.

157
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,916
- Sounds like you
have your answer.

158
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919
- Yeah, well,
I talked to my guys

159
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,923
over at the Academy
and Rojas checked every box.

160
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,405
Top gun, high scores--
I mean, she killed it.

161
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,494
And she's got street
you can't teach.

162
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,278
- But...

163
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:36,064
- All those accomplishments
are individual.

164
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:39,459
We gotta know she can
work with this team.

165
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,550
You ever wonder
why you and Halstead

166
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,856
are the only detectives
to join this unit?

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,989
Everybody else came in raw.

168
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,688
It's always better
to find the right person

169
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,474
before they learn
the wrong habits.

170
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,866
You understand?

171
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,960
- Then, right as I
pull in the parking lot,

172
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,049
this guy reaches
in my car and pulls me out

173
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,616
and then one of them
was punching me.

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,836
- Did you see
where they came from?

175
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,056
- They came from behind me.
I saw them running.

176
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,233
Did you guys find my car yet?
- No, I'm afraid we didn't.

177
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,801
- [groans]
Come on.

178
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,195
This can't be happening.

179
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,327
- What were you doing
in that neighborhood?

180
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,894
- I was going to work.

181
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,679
- And what kind
of work do you do?

182
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:29,160
- I'm a waitress.
- Like, legit waitress?

183
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,554
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying

184
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,774
you got a nice ride for
a waitress from Little Village.

185
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,645
- Yeah, and how would you know?

186
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,125
- 'Cause that's
where I grew up.

187
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,042
- Oh--all right,
and look at you now.

188
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,698
In answer to your question,
I'm a legit waitress.

189
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,613
I work at Pescado.

190
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,747
- Okay, well you give us a call
if you think of anything.

191
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,402
- Hey, um...

192
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,838
maybe we can get some coffee

193
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,840
and you can give
me some advice?

194
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,539
I want to try
something new with my life.

195
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,628
- Sure.

196
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,023
- According to our victim,
Ruby, she saw the offenders

197
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,156
running from
the street behind her.

198
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,114
Assuming these geniuses
didn't drive their own car

199
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,204
to a carjacking,
we checked the nearest L.

200
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,815
- Right, and that
takes you to the Pink Line,

201
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,425
which is three blocks south.

202
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,601
This is ten minutes
before the jacking, Sarge.

203
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,735
That's our John Doe right there
during happier times...

204
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,172
before he was impaled.
That's karma for you.

205
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,522
- Why don't you run
facial rec on the partner?

206
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,219
- Already on it.

207
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,221
Felix Rodriguez.
19 with a juvie rap.

208
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,136
Lives in Englewood
with his mama.

209
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,182
- Drag his ass in.

210
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,879
- Let's go.

211
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,934
- I can tell
you're scared, Felix.

212
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,418
You should be.

213
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,899
You're looking at carjacking,

214
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,380
you're looking at battery...

215
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,428
And you're looking at murder.

216
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:07,955
- No...it wasn't supposed
to go down like this, I swear.

217
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,783
- What's your
partner's name, Felix?

218
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,741
- His name's Miguel.
I think he's from Guatemala.

219
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,047
- Last name?
- Not sure--

220
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,918
I didn't hardly know him.

221
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,441
- You knew him well enough
to jack a car with him.

222
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,921
- He said he'd give me $500

223
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,749
to help him pick up a car.

224
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,621
I didn't know there was
gonna be somebody in it.

225
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,144
- So you were
stealing a specific car?

226
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,189
- Yeah, it was for somebody
that Miguel knew.

227
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,322
I was just along for the ride.
- Look at me.

228
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,673
Then who did you
give the car to?

229
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,762
- Nobody.
I parked it in the street

230
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,156
in Pilsen,
like we were supposed to.

231
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,770
I'm telling you, man.

232
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,729
I was just trying
to make some money.

233
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,299
- A little late
to the party, ain't we?

234
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,258
- Yeah...

235
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,347
afternoon, Officer.

236
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,392
Hey--Ruzek, Intelligence.

237
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,264
What do we got here?
- Just what you see.

238
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,961
The plates were popped,
VIN is scraped.

239
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,746
They tried to make
the car disappear.

240
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,399
I'm still running it
to see if it's hot.

241
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,619
- It's definitely hot.

242
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,926
- Yo, Ruz, come check this out.

243
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,406
You see where the fire
burned back the upholstery?

244
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,712
- Yeah, bro.

245
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,453
- Let me see that
Halligan, my man.

246
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:15,109
There you go.
Appreciate it.

247
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,764
[grunts]

248
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,506
Pretty sure Beamers
don't come factory-equipped

249
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,725
with drug traps.

250
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,292
- No...

251
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,341
- Hey, Sarge.
So, turns out Ruby's car

252
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,909
was fitted with a high-end,
fireproof drug trap,

253
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,346
which is lucky for us
because it preserved

254
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,870
the drug residue inside,

255
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,393
which the field test
confirmed was heroin.

256
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,569
- So this wasn't a carjacking,
it was a dope rip.

257
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:41,918
- Exactly.
The Lab told us that

258
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,485
the fingerprint
found inside this trap

259
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,008
is definitely Ruby Garcia's.

260
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,749
- Okay, which means Ruby
wasn't some innocent girl

261
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,969
who got her car jacked.
She's a drug runner.

262
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,840
- Have Jay and Kim
scoop her up.

263
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,190
- Copy that.

264
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,591
- Ten to one she's not home.

265
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,984
- No bet.

266
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,986
- Somebody help!
Help!

267
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,206
[dramatic music]

268
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,556
âª

269
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,471
- Body.

270
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,559
Hey!
- What'd you see?

271
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,257
- Somebody ran that way.

272
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,998
- Ruby?

273
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,440
- 5021 George--roll one ambo
to the 7300 block of Hamilton.

274
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,877
- Copy that.
5021 George--

275
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,227
- Cancel the ambo.

276
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:39,367
.

277
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,847
- COD?
- Deep puncture wounds

278
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,065
to the chest--M.E. says

279
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,414
it looks like a serrated blade.

280
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,416
No evidence of robbery,
sexual assault, struggle.

281
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,767
It was a purposeful,
quiet kill.

282
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,378
- Only the one witness
so far--neighbor who discovered

283
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,076
Ruby's body says he saw
someone running away.

284
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,730
- Give a description
of the offender?

285
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,124
- It was too far away.
Just a guy in a hoodie.

286
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,821
- All right,
we'll talk to the roommate

287
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,910
and search the apartment.
Meanwhile, I want you guys

288
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,607
to keep working the area.

289
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,697
Surveillance cameras,
suspicious person reports...

290
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,352
and let's find the prick
who killed this girl.

291
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,661
- It's horrible.
I just can't believe it.

292
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,315
This is Ruby's room.

293
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,100
Was...oh, my God.

294
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,536
- How long have
you lived with Ruby?

295
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,061
- Um...we've been
roommates for about a year.

296
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,410
- And no one came to the door?

297
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,238
You didn't see her
leave with anyone?

298
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,413
- Uh, I haven't seen
her since yesterday.

299
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,328
- She involved with anyone?

300
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,373
A boyfriend or a guy
you saw her with?

301
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,811
- No...no,
she didn't have a boyfriend.

302
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,377
- Anyone shady in her life?

303
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:34,944
Someone that
could've threatened her?

304
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,294
- Not that I know of.

305
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,907
- How'd you meet Ruby?

306
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,430
- At Pescado.

307
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,867
She worked there.
We just kind of hit it off.

308
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,130
We talked about how we
wanted to live in Lincoln Park,

309
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,611
but it was way
too expensive, so,

310
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,614
um...we put all of our money
together and we moved in here.

311
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,576
We were living the life.

312
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,404
That's what
we would always say...

313
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:07,455
- Oh, my God.
It's such a tragedy.

314
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:10,762
- When was the last
time you saw Ruby?

315
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,634
- Two days ago.

316
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,680
She was supposed
to come into work yesterday.

317
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,769
- How long has she worked here?

318
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,903
- Maybe six months or so.

319
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,688
- We ran Ruby's
social security number, though,

320
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,822
and there's no record of her
employment at your restaurant.

321
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,172
Do you have a reason for that?

322
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,872
- Not trying
to jam you up, Alexa.

323
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,699
We just wanna make sure we tie
this off the right way, so...

324
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,919
- Good.

325
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,095
Okay...

326
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,316
look, I...I've got
a soft spot in my heart

327
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,100
for girls who've had it tough,

328
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,363
so I let them
work here for straight tips.

329
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,104
This way they can keep
collecting benefits

330
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,584
from the state.

331
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,499
I mean, the whole system's
rigged against them, you know,

332
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,631
so I just--I try to help.

333
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,330
And sometimes it...
sometimes it works

334
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,899
and sometimes it bites me
in my ass, you know?

335
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,641
- I hear you.

336
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,557
- We ran Ruby Garcia.
She's got two priors.

337
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,820
One was coke, one was selling
joints to an undercover

338
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,171
when she was 16.
She spent time in Juvie.

339
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,869
- What else?
- Um, okay...

340
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,958
no biological family,
given up for adoption,

341
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,699
grew up in foster care.

342
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,440
It looks like
she had a hard life.

343
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,659
- And a short one.
- M.E.'s confirmed that Ruby

344
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,531
was stabbed with
a serrated knife.

345
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:27,535
They also found
this on her torso.

346
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,103
- That's a brand.
Looks like the letter, "F."

347
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,669
- Mm-hmm.
All right,

348
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,280
run this through
the Detective Bureau,

349
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,282
see if they've come
across anything similar.

350
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,414
- Well, I spoke
to the Crime Lab--Hailey.

351
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,896
They, uh, pulled the data
from Ruby's GPS.

352
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,072
Mostly non-descript, normal
driving around the city stuff,

353
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,901
but there's one outlier--this
neighborhood in the Wild 100s.

354
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,164
She went there four times
in the last month,

355
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,427
including right
before she got jacked.

356
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,994
- Well that's gotta
be where the weight is kept.

357
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,430
She was picking up
dope from a source.

358
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,215
- Right, so dig in,
talk to your CIs.

359
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,304
Find out who's moving
heroin in that area

360
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,567
and find out who
Ruby was working for,

361
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,525
'cause right now he's looking
good for her murder.

362
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,266
- All right.

363
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,054
- Ruby's made
four trips to the bar--

364
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,751
it's owned by Jose Soto.

365
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,449
DEA's got an open case.
They think Soto's bringing

366
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,843
bulk heroin into the country
for the Cali Cartel.

367
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,976
Bar is legit.
Real business happens upstairs.

368
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,761
- All right, Adam, Kevin,
Upton, you're with me.

369
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,589
Jay and Kim,
breach through the west side

370
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,286
of the building,
but on my orders.

371
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,245
Let's move.
- Sarge...

372
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,464
- I want you to stay outside,
keep eyes on the bar.

373
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:28,988
Try to avoid the windows.

374
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,482
Hey, hey, hey.

375
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,571
Nice and easy.
Walk this way.

376
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,834
Eyes one me, hands on the
bar.

377
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:52,837
[dramatic music]

378
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:59,801
âª

379
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,068
- Chicago PD, move forward.
Nobody move--hands up!

380
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,549
- Head's up--runner!
- I got him, I got him.

381
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,246
- Go, go, go, go, go.

382
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,031
- On the ground. Everybody on
your knees-- right now.

383
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,694
- Chicago PD.
Hands in the air.

384
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:26,654
Put your hands in the air!
- Hey--listen to her.

385
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,569
- Now get on your knees.
- Don't look like she playing.

386
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,005
- Get on your knees.

387
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,575
- 12 kilos of heroin, Jose.

388
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,317
That's super
Class X felony, bro.

389
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,970
It's game over.

390
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,798
- Then why are we talking?

391
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,497
- We need you to help us clear
up the murder of Ruby Garcia

392
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,846
who was stabbed
to death last night.

393
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,240
- What's in it for me?
- For you?

394
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,111
Nothing.

395
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,504
There may be something in it

396
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,549
for your kid brother,
Frank, though.

397
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,467
Yeah, we rolled him up, too.

398
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,687
- Come on, man.

399
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,211
My brother ain't
got nothing to do with it.

400
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:05,649
- Boy was he in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

401
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,527
- I'll tell you
what you need to know...

402
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,572
you don't squeeze
my kid brother.

403
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,880
- Start talking.

404
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:21,709
- I didn't kill her.
I didn't even know her.

405
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,406
- Dude, she was at your bar.

406
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,712
She had your heroin
in her vehicle.

407
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,453
She lost your drugs.

408
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,411
- Wasn't my drugs anymore.

409
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,240
Deal was done.
I got my end.

410
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,633
She was a mule for the buyer.

411
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,374
- So who was the buyer?

412
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:37,159
- Never met him.
- You never met him?

413
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,813
- We only do business by text.

414
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,687
- So you're saying you know
nothing about the buyer?

415
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,689
- I know his money's green

416
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,605
and he always sends girls
to pick up the product.

417
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:51,913
- So you hired
the bangers to jack the car?

418
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,481
You knew it was loaded
and who's gonna suspect the guy

419
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,700
who sold the drugs
to steal the drugs?

420
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,269
- They made it too easy.

421
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,184
Sending cute girls
to pick up drugs?

422
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,620
What was I supposed to do?

423
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,754
But I didn't kill nobody.

424
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,235
- You got an alibi
for 6:00 last night?

425
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,411
- I was at Frank's soccer game.

426
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:12,803
He lost.

427
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,895
- We checked Soto's alibi.

428
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,593
Three people put him
at his brother's game.

429
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,072
- He could've hired the hit.
- Maybe,

430
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,291
but we don't have
any proof of that.

431
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:25,076
- Boss--yeah, thank you.

432
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,688
All right, so Soto gave us
the number he was using

433
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,342
to communicate with
this mystery dealer.

434
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,648
It was a burner phone.
It went dark, so I wasn't able

435
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,259
to track that,
but I did track where it was

436
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,479
purchased at Jin's Market
in Pilsen three days ago.

437
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,915
- Okay, call Jay and Kim

438
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,178
and have them
pay this Jin a visit.

439
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,618
- Jin, can you step out here
so we can take a better look?

440
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,794
So this is all the surveillance
of three days ago--

441
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,448
people buying
pay-as-you-go phones?

442
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,887
- Yes, I remember two men
bought phones that day...

443
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,238
uh, here...is the first one.

444
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,632
- Who's the second guy?

445
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,112
- Uh...this guy.

446
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,071
- Eh, not likely.
- Can you rewind?

447
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,464
Go back, yeah.

448
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:07,118
- Okay, stop.

449
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:10,034
Her.
- We're looking for a man.

450
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,472
- Says who?

451
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,519
- Do you recognize her?
- I do--that's Ruby's boss.

452
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:23,657
.

453
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,920
- The burner used to do
the drug buys was purchased

454
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,661
by Alexa Rivera--42,
she's not on

455
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,140
DEA's or Narcotic's radar.

456
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,446
Based on the amount
of heroin we think

457
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,013
she bought from Soto,
she should be.

458
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,493
- Before she started
a restaurant,

459
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,451
Alexa was a social worker--
she taught

460
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,540
a vocational training class
for at-risk youth.

461
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,194
Ruby was one of her students.

462
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,587
- She got two priors.
One for possession,

463
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,197
one for agg-battery.

464
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,025
She broke the eye socket
of her live-in girlfriend.

465
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:46,941
- So, what are we waiting for?
Let's bust her.

466
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:49,291
- All right--based on what?

467
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,293
- Ruby was running drugs
for Alexa,

468
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,948
who has a history of violence,
so when Ruby lost her load,

469
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,819
it makes sense she killed her.
Street justice.

470
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,126
- Well, it's a very good
theory,

471
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,129
but so far we got no evidence
Alexa murdered Ruby.

472
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,263
What we do know
is Alexa's in the drug trade.

473
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,177
So let's catch her dirty.

474
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,267
We'll take her off the street,
then build a murder case.

475
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,616
- She might not be holding,

476
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,834
being her supply
just got ripped.

477
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,227
- Right, there's an opening,

478
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,663
which means
she's looking for product.

479
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:14,882
I say we lay somebody under

480
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,405
with the bait, Sarge.
See if she bites.

481
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,015
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,585
[indistinct chatter]

483
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:25,893
- Something to drink?
- I'm looking for Alexa Rivera.

484
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:28,199
Tell her we're
associates of Jose Soto.

485
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,332
- I'm sorry,
Miss Alexa's not around.

486
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,508
- Hmm...

487
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:35,206
maybe she's in back?

488
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,599
Maybe you could go...

489
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,342
check for me?

490
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,344
- Who did you say
your friend was?

491
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,998
- Jose Soto.

492
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,263
- Thank you.

493
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,573
[clears throat]

494
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,706
Looks like we're a go.

495
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,013
Here she comes.

496
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:01,537
- Hi, is there something
I can help you with?

497
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:02,973
- Alexa, my name is Jake.

498
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,671
I'd like to talk
some business with you.

499
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,456
- Well, you don't look
like a fish supplier.

500
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,892
[laughter]

501
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,241
- I'm Jose Soto's partner.

502
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,418
- I'm sorry,
Jose...Soto?

503
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,942
- Jose Soto.
I believe you know who he is.

504
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,945
- Uh...mm-mm.
And you are?

505
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,686
- This is my body guard.

506
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,123
- Oh...really?

507
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,388
- Um, look, I understand
you've had some bad luck

508
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,086
since your supply
got disrupted.

509
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,524
I can replace what you lost.

510
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,962
I can give you credit until
you get back on your feet.

511
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,574
- I think you've
made a mistake.

512
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,141
I'm sorry.

513
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,143
- Alexa, Jose--
he can't help you.

514
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,407
He's skipped town.
He's gotta lay low for awhile,

515
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,235
so he asked me
to reach out to you.

516
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,368
He values your relationship.

517
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,632
- Hmm...
- You know, you could call him.

518
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,329
He'll vouch for me.

519
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,638
- I'll be right back.

520
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,773
- This deal ain't happening.
Not with you.

521
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,384
- [groans]

522
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,213
- Take a look around.
It's all women.

523
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,172
She only hires women.

524
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,611
- Well,
we're gonna play it out.

525
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,396
We'll see how it goes, okay?

526
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,790
- I've got an angle.

527
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,923
Grab me.
- What?

528
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,317
- Grab me--make it seem
like we're in a fight.

529
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,581
- What is she talking about?
- Let go of me!

530
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,758
- Hey--hey!
What the hell is going on here?

531
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,237
This is my place of business.

532
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,414
- I apologize.
Would you like to do this?

533
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,806
- No!

534
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,852
I don't know a Jose Soto, okay?

535
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,462
So you need to leave, now.

536
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,551
- Alexa, listen.
- Go--out.

537
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:47,948
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

538
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:51,473
- What the hell happened?
- I mean, we laid the bait,

539
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,257
she just wasn't gonna bite.

540
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,998
- Vanessa, I was clear--
you were supposed to follow

541
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,783
Adam's lead.
Why'd you go off book?

542
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,786
- Because it wasn't gonna work.
- How do you know that?

543
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,484
- I know Alexa's type.
She's only got women around.

544
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,355
Vulnerable ones--
ones who need her.

545
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,532
She wasn't gonna
talk to this guy.

546
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,359
- Sarge, me and Burgess
sat on Soto the whole time.

547
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:09,752
Alexa never called him.

548
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:13,103
- Yeah, for whatever reason,
she got cold feet.

549
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,366
Rojas is right.
She wasn't gonna do the deal.

550
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,630
- Hey, tell them your idea.

551
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,589
- Sergeant,
I know how to get to her.

552
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,379
- Oh--no, no, no, no.
Wait, uh-uh.

553
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,295
Take that to my office.
Miss Bodyguard,

554
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:34,516
I told you to leave
and I want you to stay away.

555
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,607
What happened to you?

556
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,568
- He got mad at me
for messing up the deal.

557
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,529
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah...

558
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,358
yeah--it's not the first time.

559
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,709
- All right,
well why did you come here?

560
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:59,062
- I know where
he's got the dope.

561
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,586
Two keys.

562
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,588
I can steal it
and sell it to you.

563
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,721
Look, I'm in a really
bad place right now,

564
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,941
so I'm willing
to give you a deal.

565
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:11,379
We both know it's worth 100.
I'll give it to you for 25.

566
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,338
- [scoffs]
- 20.

567
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,776
Please--look,
I just need some running money.

568
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,345
- Where are you
going to run to, hmm?

569
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,130
Do you have family?

570
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,307
No?

571
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,747
[sighs]
- [winces]

572
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,578
- You have no idea how angry

573
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,754
it makes me
to see you like this.

574
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,802
- Are we gonna do this or not?

575
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:48,329
- Yeah--yeah,
we're gonna do this.

576
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,592
But just you and me.

577
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,638
Nobody else involved.
Do you understand?

578
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,080
What's your name?

579
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:01,603
- Maria.

580
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,649
- Maria.

581
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,433
- Maria Lopez.

582
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,574
Now she's late.

583
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,664
- Don't worry,
we got all night.

584
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,626
- Got a blue Nissan Altima
approaching from the south.

585
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,327
- All right,
wait for the exchange,

586
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,547
then move in on my signal.

587
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,905
- You Maria?
- Who are you?

588
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,865
- I'm picking up a package
for Miss Alexa.

589
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,389
- Got a visual of the driver.

590
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,610
It's Karla Moore.
It's Ruby's roommate.

591
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,396
- Oh, man.
Alexa doesn't disappoint.

592
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,093
- Look, that wasn't
part of the deal.

593
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,183
Alexa's supposed to meet me.
My ass is on the line for this.

594
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:01,707
- I'm just supposed
to pick it up.

595
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,534
- Nah, screw that--
I don't even know you.

596
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,232
Call Alexa--okay,
we're supposed to meet here--

597
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,668
her and I.
That's what she promised.

598
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,805
- We don't have
ears on that call.

599
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,983
- I have to go.

600
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:18,593
Miss Alexa changed her mind.

601
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,682
She said she doesn't want
the sea bass.

602
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,684
- Sea bass?
What are you talking about?

603
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,251
- She said you can keep it.

604
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:26,514
- Wait--whatever, okay,

605
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,342
if that's what she wants,
I can sell this to you.

606
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,301
- I'm sorry, that won't work.
- We can still do the deal.

607
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,390
- Nope--deal's off.

608
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:34,827
- Sarge, you want us
to snatch her up?

609
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,655
- No, we don't wanna
tip off Alexa.

610
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,745
I've got another idea.

611
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,316
- What was Rojas thinking?
She makes the deal,

612
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,405
we follow the drugs,
we bust Alexa.

613
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,798
- She's just following
the terms that were laid out.

614
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,713
She didn't know
it'd go sideways.

615
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,239
- What are you doing?

616
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,502
[screams]

617
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:09,209
.

618
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,777
- We went over this earlier.

619
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,563
I know that was scary, but we
did that for your protection

620
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,870
because we don't Alexa to know
you're talking to the police.

621
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,480
- You don't think
I'll tell her?

622
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,526
- We don't think
it's in your best interests,

623
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,919
given the circumstances.

624
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,921
- All right, Karla,
I'm gonna lay it out for you.

625
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,273
We believe Alexa killed Ruby

626
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,101
because she lost
her load of heroin.

627
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,408
- Are you crazy?
Alexa didn't kill Ruby.

628
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,931
She would never do that.

629
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:39,674
- Right...
Alexa's a drug dealer.

630
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,329
She used young women
to traffic her drugs

631
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:45,114
and we know that
you're one of them.

632
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:49,118
- Her drug supplier,
Jose Soto--

633
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:54,297
he picked your face
out of a photo array.

634
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:57,039
He admitted to giving
you dope in the past.

635
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,695
Karla, that puts you
on the hook

636
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,088
for felony trafficking.

637
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,960
- That's 15 to 30 years.

638
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:11,445
- We understand Alexa
took advantage of you, okay?

639
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,969
We can make
the drug charges go away.

640
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:18,017
But the only way that's gonna
happen is if you work with us.

641
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,064
You have to wear a wire.

642
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:25,154
You gotta get Alexa
to confess to murder.

643
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,073
- Like I told you before,

644
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,162
I have nothing
to say to you.

645
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,701
- All right,
what's the deal with Karla?

646
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,268
- She drank the Kool-Aid.
She doesn't believe

647
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,314
that Alexa's capable of murder.

648
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:57,665
- Yeah, the only person
Karla trusts is Alexa.

649
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,841
All right, so we need
to find some evidence to break

650
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,321
that trust.
What do we got?

651
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,976
- Well, we could bring
Alexa in, sweat her,

652
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,760
get her out
of her comfort zone.

653
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,284
- If she doesn't roll,
then we've tipped our hand.

654
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,634
The only reason we never heard
of her is 'cause she's smart.

655
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:13,028
- Sarge, we got something.
We sent that brand marking

656
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,422
to Detectives Bureau.
We got a hit from Homicide.

657
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,859
- Julissa Cruz.
Her body was discovered

658
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,382
in Armour Park nine months ago.

659
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:22,298
Same branding on her
torso as Ruby--letter "F."

660
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,300
- So we pulled
the Homicide file.

661
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,563
Alexa is a person of interest,
but they couldn't make a case.

662
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,827
- So what's Julissa's
connection to Alexa?

663
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,612
- Julissa took Alexa's
vocational training class.

664
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,006
Same as Ruby, same as Karla.

665
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,225
- Maybe let me take a shot?

666
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,020
Hi, Karla.

667
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,936
- Wait, you're a cop?
- I'm Officer Rojas.

668
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,111
- Well, what
the hell do you want?

669
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:55,027
- I just wanna talk--please.

670
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,127
- You can't trust
anybody in this world.

671
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,522
- Look, and I get
why you feel that way.

672
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,004
You bounced
around foster homes...

673
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:19,007
but they ain't even your homes

674
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,140
and they sure as hell
ain't your family.

675
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,751
So of course there's
gonna be trust issues.

676
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,971
- And how would you know?

677
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,976
- Foster care is bad
when you're in it,

678
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,282
but it's worse
when you age out.

679
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:36,416
'Cause all of a sudden
you're out in the world

680
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,984
and you ain't
got nowhere to go.

681
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,900
And these predators
come in all shapes and sizes

682
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,424
and they find you.

683
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,947
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

684
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,601
- Hmm.

685
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,385
You know, mine was a man.

686
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:53,128
Some older dude.
He had game.

687
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,262
He made me feel good,

688
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:59,656
bought me nice things,
let me crash at his place.

689
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,009
And he'd tell me
I was his favorite.

690
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:10,145
And then he burned his freaking
cigarette into my shoulder.

691
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,060
- That sounds like a creep
who wanted

692
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,149
to have sex with a girl.

693
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,760
Alexa's the opposite
of what you're saying.

694
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,067
- Is she?

695
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,330
Then what the hell
is that on your belly?

696
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,854
- This was my choice.
- That's a brand.

697
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,552
That's what they do to cows.

698
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,510
You know,
she's making you her property

699
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:29,599
and she ain't never
letting you go.

700
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:32,515
She didn't let Ruby go...
or Julissa.

701
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:37,738
- Julissa--what do you mean?
- You don't know?

702
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,740
- Julissa's in Seattle.
She moved there last year.

703
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,133
She got a really good job.

704
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,961
- Well,
Julissa's not in Seattle.

705
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,875
She's in a casket.

706
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,486
- What are you talking about?

707
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,880
- They found her body
in Armour Park nine months ago.

708
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,665
- No, that's not true.

709
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,450
Alexa spoke to her
on the phone last week.

710
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,020
- She was stabbed
multiple times in the heart,

711
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,327
just like Ruby.

712
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,549
- No...

713
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:11,815
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

714
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,605
- They still haven't
found her killer,

715
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,173
but you know who
it was, don't you?

716
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:26,221
- [breathing heavily]

717
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,322
- Remember,
we're waiting for an admission

718
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,542
to Ruby's murder
before we move in.

719
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,067
- Copy--we're in position.

720
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,374
- Got a visual
on the button cam.

721
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,550
- Hey, where were you?
I was calling you.

722
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:53,031
- I'm sorry, my phone died.

723
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,685
I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

724
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,252
- I'm just confused
about Ruby--

725
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,601
I don't understand
what happened.

726
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,257
- I told you--
Ruby got caught up in drugs

727
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,085
and she started hanging
with the wrong people.

728
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,913
- But I never saw her do
drugs.

729
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,220
- Yeah, because she was
being sneaky, mama.

730
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,918
She hid it from you.
From us.

731
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,615
- She said she was
going to meet you.

732
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,402
- No, that's wrong.
Ruby was going to the police

733
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:20,145
and she betrayed us.
She betrayed our familia.

734
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,279
- So is that why
you killed her?

735
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,501
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

736
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:31,417
- Alexa, I just want
to know what happened.

737
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,723
I tried to call Julissa.
- Really?

738
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,769
When was that?

739
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,206
- Right before I got here,
but the line was disconnected.

740
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,079
- I thought you said
your phone was dead.

741
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,950
- It is.

742
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,735
I called her before--
I called her before it died.

743
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,215
Alexa, please.

744
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,434
I just wanna know
what happened.

745
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:51,654
Please.
- Come here, mami.

746
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,179
Mira.

747
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,311
Don't get stressed.
- Okay.

748
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,183
- Okay?
Everything's fine.

749
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:01,229
Mira, come.
Come here.

750
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,799
You were always my favorite.

751
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,192
- She's gonna kill her.
- There's no weapon,

752
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,845
so we wait for the safe word.

753
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,458
- But I think
you're lying to me.

754
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,937
- I'm telling you--
she's gonna kill her.

755
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,765
- Wait, wait, wait.
- If you're lying to me...

756
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,071
- She's got a weapon.

757
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,638
- I'll keep eyes
till you breach.

758
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,813
- I'm gonna cut your
freaking heart out.

759
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,162
Understand, bitch?

760
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:25,123
.

761
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,298
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

762
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,082
Okay.

763
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,389
- Chicago PD!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

764
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,695
Whoa.

765
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,568
Everybody put your guns down.

766
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,527
Everybody relax.
Let's stay calm.

767
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,963
All right, Alexa,

768
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,183
I'm Sergeant Hank Voight
and I'm putting my gun away.

769
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,446
I'm here to help you.
Take it easy.

770
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,102
Look, obviously...
there's nowhere to go, okay?

771
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,104
So let's you and I figure out

772
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,280
a peaceful solution--
you and me.

773
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,152
- This is entrapment.
I didn't do anything.

774
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:57,764
- Nobody is saying
you did, okay?

775
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,636
Now Alexa, just put the--
put the knife down.

776
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,377
- I will cut this bitch!
- Okay, relax.

777
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,989
- I'll cut you, bitch!
- Come on--hey, hey, hey.

778
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,949
- [crying]
- Alexa, put the knife down,

779
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,560
walk outside,
we'll have a conversation here.

780
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,128
- I want my lawyer first.
- Okay.

781
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,651
okay, I'll get you your lawyer,

782
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:18,001
but you have
to let Karla go first.

783
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,438
Okay?

784
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,136
- Do you know how much
I've done for this girl?

785
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,878
Remember how much
I've done for you?

786
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,967
She was homeless.

787
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,143
I took her off the streets.

788
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,145
- [crying]
- And now she's confused.

789
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,495
You've poisoned her against me.

790
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,151
- Alexa...I hear you,

791
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,242
but we gotta focus
on right now, okay?

792
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,158
I'm willing
to work with you, okay?

793
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,552
But we gotta build trust.
The best way to do that

794
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:48,293
is to let Karla go.

795
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,338
- You don't get it.
Karla's a victim.

796
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,905
She's mentally ill.

797
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:55,822
She makes up stories
to protect herself to survive.

798
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,215
You can't believe
anything she says.

799
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,390
- We know that.

800
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,001
We know--and it all works
in your favor.

801
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,959
- [breathing heavily]
- Now, don't blow it.

802
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,614
Be smart.
Come on, let her go.

803
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,703
It's the only way.

804
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,532
Come on, Alexa.
Put the knife down.

805
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,273
Put it down.
Let her go.

806
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:15,929
- [gasps]
- Hey, hey, hey--look at me.

807
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,975
It's over--it's over.
Walk to me.

808
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,543
Put the knife down--come on.

809
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:25,373
Put the...
put the knife down, now.

810
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,506
Now, walk to me.

811
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,334
- Karla, no!

812
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,292
- Drop the knife!

813
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,120
- 5021 Eddie--
we have a stabbing victim.

814
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,991
Roll an ambulance
to 1360 State Street

815
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:37,298
right now--right now.

816
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,517
- Copy that.

817
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,083
Ambo dispatched.

818
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,401
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

819
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,185
- Alexa didn't make it.

820
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,318
- Get the knife
to the Crime Lab.

821
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,319
- Yeah, it's on its way.

822
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,886
What do you
wanna do with Karla?

823
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,496
Anybody looks
at that video is gonna know

824
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,889
Alexa wasn't armed.

825
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,891
- What video?

826
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,331
- I just heard
from the Crime Lab.

827
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,202
They dismantled the knife
Karla used to kill Alexa

828
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,204
and they found
Ruby's DNA in the hilt.

829
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,077
- All right, good,
so that case is closed.

830
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,079
Now...

831
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,777
I need to know
your assessment of Rojas.

832
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,868
- [sighs]

833
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,262
She went off book twice.

834
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,004
Her instincts were right,
but one day they won't be.

835
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,660
You live by your instincts,
eventually you die by them.

836
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,575
- Or someone else does.

837
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,012
- Exactly.

838
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,494
- So, it's a no?

839
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:48,326
[water running]

840
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,332
- So you really did
get burnt with a cigarette.

841
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,945
- Something like that.

842
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:01,861
You know,

843
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,776
Platt said they
couldn't give me a locker--

844
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,299
said there were some issues.

845
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,041
Pretty sure
that's not a good sign.

846
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,224
- Look, Vanessa.

847
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,748
the way they jammed you
into Intelligence--

848
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:23,099
they didn't do you any favors.

849
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,015
I was also in deep undercover.

850
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,496
Transition's a bitch.

851
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,369
You live by your lights,
your instincts...

852
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:34,415
because that's how you survive.

853
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,112
But here?

854
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:38,201
It's a different game.

855
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:42,031
It's about teamwork and trust.

856
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,252
And it takes time.

857
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,214
- I get it.

858
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,349
Thank you.

859
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,526
I hope we can stay
in touch, if that's cool.

860
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,442
- Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

861
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,879
We're gonna
be working together.

862
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,362
- What are you talking about?
- You're in.

863
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,885
- I'm in?

864
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,453
- Yeah, Voight just
signed off on you.

865
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,025
We just have one final hurdle.

866
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,114
Platt says you didn't
fill out your address.

867
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:23,551
- No, I'll--I'll do that.

868
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:30,036
- You don't have
an address, do you?

869
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,650
- Not yet.

870
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:39,262
They pulled me out
of my undercover apartment.

871
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,265
I just haven't had time
to look for a new place.

872
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,402
- Honestly, with this job,

873
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,579
you're not gonna have any
free time any time soon, so...

874
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,062
Why don't you stay with me?

875
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,890
- You mean that?

876
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:01,415
- Yeah, we'll work it out.

877
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,463
Let's go.

878
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,511
