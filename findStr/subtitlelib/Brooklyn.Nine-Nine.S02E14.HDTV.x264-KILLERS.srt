00:00:00,548 --> 00:00:02,549
Ant. Ant. Ant.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,550
Ant. Ant.

3
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:04,952
God,
they're everywhere.

4
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,086
Are we sure that
we've cleaned up

5
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:08,422
all the food
and crumbs?

6
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:10,390
Why is everyone
looking at us?

7
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:12,059
We're the ones who
eat up all the crumbs.

8
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,460
Yeah,
we're the solution.

9
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,095
Well, there are no ants
on my desk

10
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:17,030
because I sanitize
it daily.

11
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,031
What do you
call that?

12
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:19,566
Ah!
Those are your ants!

13
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,002
They're using a monitor cable
as a land bridge.

14
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:25,906
Now they're destroying
our technology.

15
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,775
This is an invasion.

16
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:28,909
They're in my yogurt.

17
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,277
Now it's personal.

18
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,079
All right, that's it.
We have gotta fight back.

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,580
This is our planet!

20
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:35,949
Just use Boyle's cologne.
It's repulsive to everything.

21
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,618
<i>Ah! Not cool.</i>

22
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,286
You're going to Penn Station
to buy me a new one.

23
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:41,021
<i>The ant infestation?</i>

24
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,856
<i>It's bad.
They bite now, sir.</i>

25
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:44,758
<i>I think they're just trying
to avoid the cold weather.</i>

26
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,695
We should freeze them out.

27
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,930
The plan is working,
Captain.

28
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,299
Yes.
We won.

29
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,468
Oh my God.
They're in the coats.

30
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,370
They're in our coats!

33
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:20,060
Okay.
I don't want Sophia to know

34
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,862
that I'm waiting
for her, so...

35
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,732
Should we pretend to have
a heated argument that I win?

36
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,167
Oh, or better yet:
a physical contest that I win.

37
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:28,602
What's going on?

38
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:29,970
I thought things were good
with you and Sophia.

00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,105
Jake.

40
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:32,573
Did you do
something dumb?

41
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:34,074
That's a really good question,
but actually no,

42
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,242
I don't think so.

43
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:36,276
It's just been
a little weird lately.

44
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:37,277
She's acting
kind of distant.

45
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,412
Have you talked to her?

46
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,913
No, I don't want to
seem desperate.

47
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:40,981
Talking to her
is desperate?

48
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,716
Well, it's not breezy.

49
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:44,852
<i>Jake? Hey.</i>
Hey.

50
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:46,286
What are you guys
doing here?

51
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,255
Oh, just arguing
about America.

52
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:49,990
Did you know that
the Sarge doesn't think

53
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,125
we should have given women
the right to vote?

54
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,893
That is not true.

55
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,194
Oh, sure, you say
that now that she's here.

56
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,896
But, hey, now that we've
accidentally

57
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,431
bumped into each other,
what are you doing tonight?

58
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:58,699
You want to hang out?
Oh, I can't.

59
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,900
I have that event
for The Association

60
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,368
of The Brooklyn
Public Defenders

61
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,537
Remember, you called it
"Satan's Charity Ball,

62
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,873
colon, Rise of the Demons?"
Oh yeah.

63
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,175
Defense attorneys are monsters.
Oh.

64
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:11,045
Uh, except for you.
No, you're fine.

65
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,579
Oh, that's so sweet.

66
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:14,415
Right, right.
But I have a minute right now.

67
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,883
You want to go take
a walk in the park?

68
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,685
Oh, a walk in the park.
How romantic.

69
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,219
And I know where
all the murder spots are.

70
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:21,055
Oh. Do you want to see them
or avoid them?

71
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,456
The choice is yours,
m'lady.

72
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,692
Terry, don't wait up.

73
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:26,226
It's 10:00 A.M.
Yep.

74
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,130
Deputy Chief Wuntch
is here to see you.

75
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,465
Oh, please stay, Diaz.

76
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,400
I need a witness in case
her head starts spinning around

77
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,902
or if she turns into
a she-wolf.

78
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,070
Hello, Raymond.

79
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,339
No flaccid rejoinder?

80
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,506
Hmm.
What's going on?

81
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,709
I'm here on
important business.

82
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,211
I'm a frontrunner for a job
in the Boston PD.

83
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:46,413
Boston?
But it's so close to Salem.

84
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,749
You do know what they do
to witches up there, don't you?

85
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:51,618
This is amazing.
The job is Chief of Police.

86
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:54,254
I see.
So you've come to brag.

87
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,391
No.

88
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,259
The only blemish on
my record

89
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,729
is our long history
of interpersonal turbulence.

90
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,796
The Boston Commissioner
would like

91
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:03,897
to speak with you
about it.

92
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:07,901
I've come to ask
for your help.

93
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,236
The commissioner
will be calling you.

94
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:13,173
Wait.
Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh.

95
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:15,075
Oh. Moment savored.

96
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,745
So, where were we?
Ah yes, you were talking

97
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:21,782
about how I hold your fate
in the palm of my hand.

98
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,118
<i>Oopsie.</i>

99
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,020
<i>Oh my God.</i>

100
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,188
Oh, I'm sorry.
I lost my balance.

101
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,791
You think I'm bothered
by a little spilled milkshake?

102
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,027
I'm a food blogger,
I'm stained all over.

103
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,396
Okay, what is going on
with you two?

104
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,430
Well, you know how
our parents have been

105
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,531
tender-sexing each other?

106
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,733
Ew.
Precisely, Amy. Ew.

107
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,468
Boyle and I made a pact
to break them up,

108
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:44,204
and now this sticky little
gummy bear is backing out.

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,974
Look, I know you don't want
our lives intertwined,

110
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,075
but things have changed.

111
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,810
My father want to marry
your mom.

112
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,646
So you choose your dad
over me,

113
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,281
your coworker
who hates you.

114
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:55,616
Papa's a gentleman.

115
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,484
He won't propose
until he gets Gina's blessing

116
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:58,986
And she won't
give it to him.

117
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,255
Who says "papa?"
Are you a little French boy?

118
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,423
Oh ho-ho-ho.

119
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:03,557
I think maybe
I can help.

120
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:09,129
I took a seminar
on conflict resolution and...

121
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,600
I have been waiting weeks
to bust this bad boy out.

122
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,502
New binder smell.

123
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,471
Mm-mm.
Amy don't do this.

124
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:21,041
I'm gonna throw
a milkshake in your face.

125
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,010
This is nice.

126
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,311
I feel like
old people.

127
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:28,015
Should we sit here?

128
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,584
Jake, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

129
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,152
So, my boss hasn't been
assigning me

130
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,587
any of the good cases,

131
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,589
and I found out it's because
I'm dating a cop.

132
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:36,724
What?

133
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:37,858
Did he actually
say that?

134
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:40,194
No, but my colleagues did.

135
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,428
You know, everybody
I work with

136
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,997
think of cops
as the enemy.

137
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,765
That's crazy.
They're the enemy.

138
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,267
I see what you mean.

139
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:48,102
Jake, I really like you,

140
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:51,238
but my job's really
important to me, too.

141
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,040
Can we press pause
on this?

142
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,308
Press pause?

143
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:56,610
Just until I figure out
what to do with my boss.

144
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,546
Is that okay?

145
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,915
So this is just
about your boss?

146
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,750
Okay.
Yes, let's press pause.

147
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,785
Let's pause
the hell out of this.

148
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:05,953
Let's pause this
like I pause

149
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,621
Jamie Lee Curtis
in<i> Trading Places.</i>

150
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:09,490
I haven't seen that movie,
but I'm assuming she's naked.

151
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:10,524
Mm-hmm.

152
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,393
"Pause" seems bad, Jake.

153
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:13,727
Why aren't you more upset?

154
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,462
Because Sophia's problem
isn't with me,

155
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,730
it's with her dumb boss.

156
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,165
That's something I can fix.

157
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm gonna make him
like me.

158
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,069
Here is the target...
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

159
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:23,604
Now, according
to the internet,

160
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,706
his interests are:
skiing, his terrier,

161
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:28,309
Atlantic City, the film
<i>12 Years a Slave,</i> and nature.

162
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,843
Obviously nature
is super boring,

163
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,213
and the slave film
is a little bit dicey.

164
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,848
It's real dicey.
Yeah.

165
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,750
So I will focus mainly on
skiing and Atlantic city

166
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,485
when I talk to him tonight
at the fundraiser

167
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,521
for The Association
of Brooklyn Public Defenders,

168
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:43,057
A.K.A.
The Chamber of Asses.

169
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,358
No, wait.
That's too sexy.

170
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,659
The Chamber of Snakes.

171
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,760
Anyway, it starts at 8:00,

172
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:47,995
so you should probably
get dressed.

173
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,197
What?
I am not going to that.

174
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,799
Please, Sarge.
Just come.

175
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,934
Do it for me.
Do it for love.

176
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,904
Damn, Jake.
You know Terry loves love.

177
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,172
I'm in.
All right!

178
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,707
Now put on
your phoniest smile

179
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,343
'cause we're going into
the belly of the beast.

180
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:03,644
Phonier.

181
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:04,845
Phonier!

182
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:07,114
Ah, there it is.
Into the beast!

183
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:09,884
♪ I go to work ♪

184
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:15,222
♪ ♪

185
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,258
♪ I go to work ♪

186
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:20,733
All of our worst enemies
are here.

187
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,735
Brown hair guy.
Pony tail lady.

188
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,470
Asian Don Cheadle.

189
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,638
I refuse to learn
their names

190
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,106
because it
humanizes them.

191
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:29,909
But you'll never forget
their smug lawyer faces.

192
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,512
Each one brings back
a specific, horrible memory.

193
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,680
<i>Like courtroom PTSD.</i>

194
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,983
Incompetent!

195
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,551
Idiot!

196
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,154
Mint?

197
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,755
I could have choked
on that mint

198
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,991
Even the nice ones
are psychopaths.

199
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:46,192
All right.
Let's get fired up.

200
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:47,860
Pound on my shoulders.
That's my stuff.

201
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:49,195
Wait! Wait!
No, don't hurt me!

202
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,496
Ah, that was a bad idea.
I'll bang my own sulders.

203
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,698
Let's go.

204
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,067
<i>Detective, have a seat.</i>

205
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:58,037
I am grappling with
a highly vexing conundrum.

206
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,739
What to do about
Deputy Chief Wuntch?

207
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Precisely.

208
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,442
I could torpedo
her promotion.

209
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,077
Just saying it
brims my soul with joy.

210
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:06,646
But to do so

211
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,247
would mean would mean that
she stays here in New York City

212
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:11,784
hanging over me like
an albino bat.

213
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:14,854
On the other hand,
if I "praise" Wuntch,

214
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:16,923
she will leave this city,
the clouds will part,

215
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:18,958
and the children will sing
"Wuntch is gone."

216
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,560
What children?

217
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,096
All the children.
Right. That was a stupid question.

218
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,530
What was
Sarge's advice?

219
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,733
Oh, you and I both know what
Mother Jeffords would say.

220
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,968
"Take the high road."
But I asked you,

221
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:33,606
Detective Diaz, because you
understand vengeance.

222
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:36,976
Yes, I do.

223
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:38,578
I had a nemesis once:

224
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:39,946
Carla Bianchi.
Mm.

225
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,681
She wronged me,

226
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:44,217
and I crushed her
like a gnat

227
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,852
between my fingers.

228
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,787
I got her suspended
from the second grade.

229
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:51,290
Second grade?
That little turd hoarded all the good markers.

230
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,693
But eventually,
she came back to school.

231
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:57,029
And she made
the next ten years

232
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,232
of my life miserable.

233
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,800
It's not worth it.

234
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,201
Be nice to Wuntch.

235
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,837
"Be nice to Wuntch?"

236
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,906
You may go now,

237
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:09,275
Mother Diaz.

238
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:15,114
I hate this.
Everyone is looking at us.

239
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:18,151
Only because we're equally
massive, beautiful men in tuxes.

240
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:20,753
Yeah.
Sophia.

241
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:23,823
Heeeeeeey,
girlfriend.

242
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,792
That came out saucier
than I was expecting.

243
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,628
Yeah. Hey, Jake,
What are you doing here?

244
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,563
I thought we agreed
to press pause.

245
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,331
We did.
I'm not here to see you.

246
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm here to see your boss,
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

247
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,835
We're gonna bond.
Oh, God.

248
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:37,937
Oh, good indeed.
You misheard me on purpose.

249
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:39,806
Possibly.
Look, I'm gonna charm him.

250
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,407
He's going to start giving you
the good cases again.

251
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,210
This is gonna work.
No, it's not.

252
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,512
How can I explain this?
Oh, Okay.

253
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,248
Imagine this room is full
of super-intelligent robots...

254
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,551
Oh.
Hell-bent on ending humanity,

255
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,186
and you are
a working-class human

256
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,420
who just entered
their swarm-hive.

257
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,322
Okay, love this,
love you, keep going.

258
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,024
Oh, that's a really
weird moment

259
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,826
to say you love me
for the first time.

260
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,194
Oh no.
Was it?

261
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:02,428
I'm just gonna blow past that.
Yeah.

262
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,565
Look, the point is,
you can't charm robots.

263
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:08,167
So you should go before they
pod you and harvest your brain.

264
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,003
Look, I've done my research
on Hoytsman:

265
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:13,406
Skiing, nature, Atlantic City,
I'm ready for him.

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,509
Sophia.
Sergeant Jeffords.

267
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,877
Detective Peralta.

268
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,313
Please, my friends call me
Jakey Snowpants,

269
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:21,914
because I'm skiing so much.

270
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:23,983
Carving moguls on
a black diamond.

271
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,718
I prefer cross-country
skiing.

272
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,987
It's not a sport if gravity
does the work for you.

273
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,223
Yeah.
Gravity sucks.

274
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:32,191
Not the movie, the theory.
Anyway, I've been spending

275
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:33,726
most of my weekends
in Atlantic City these days.

276
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,862
Oh, that place is a dump.
No.

277
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:39,532
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to steal Sophia away.

278
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:42,235
You can't charm
the robots.

279
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,037
What in the frig
was that?

280
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,005
He's always
in Atlantic City.

281
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,740
Why would he go someplace
he hates so much?

282
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,909
Unless there was something
there he loves.

283
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,911
I bet he loves gambling.

284
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,813
Just like I'm here
in this dump

285
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,648
because of Sophia,
who I now love.

286
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,283
You're really going hard
on this love thing.

287
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:58,685
Well, I said it out loud.
It's on the record.

288
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:01,688
I can't take it back
Just get on board, Terry.

289
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,456
Hello, Gina.
Ah!

290
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:04,724
What are
you creeps doing?

291
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,759
You made me look
away from my phone.

292
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,561
You better pray
I didn't miss a text.

293
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,797
In your two seconds
you looked away?

294
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,599
17 texts.
All of them important.

295
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,635
Amy suggested
we negotiate terms,

296
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:18,004
so if you agree
to give my dad his blessing,

297
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,305
here's what I'll do
for you.

298
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:22,475
"You will never see me
in my pajamas on a family trip.

299
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:23,710
"We will never share
a bunk bed.

300
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,645
"And I won't force you
to participate

301
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,514
in our annual themed
Christmas cards."

302
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,883
This year my dad was Mary
and I was the baby Jesus.

303
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,286
Yeah, I know.
Got one. Lived the nightmare.

304
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,854
Well, the list goes on.
I signed it.

305
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,556
Amy notarized it.
I'm a notary.

306
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:38,491
No big deal.
I met the comptroller.

307
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,892
Okay, you know what?

308
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:42,061
This isn't about out lives
getting intertwined, okay?

309
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,830
I'm actually worried
about my mom

310
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,965
'cause she's been
hurt before.

311
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,867
This is all moving
way too fast.

312
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,103
Wow.
Gina.

313
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,237
That's really sweet.

314
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,872
And the only reason
I didn't tell you guys

315
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,574
is 'cause I don't
value you as people,

316
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,509
so it's, like,
why be honest?

317
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:58,378
Yeah, you just went back
and ruined what you said.

318
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,545
Right.
Mm-hmm.

319
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,048
Look, I know I'm
a stage five player,

320
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,284
just mowing down chicks
left and right,

321
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:05,919
but my dad's not like that.

322
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:07,620
He would never hurt
your mom.

323
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:10,757
Just talk to him,
you'll see.

324
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:12,559
Fine.
I'll talk to him.

325
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,093
Just to ask him
some questions.

326
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,495
But go get him
before I change my mind.

327
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,529
Okay.
Okay.

328
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,431
Oh.
I already changed my mind.

329
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,999
Aww.
All right, I'm back.

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,834
Oh.
Oh. I'm back.

331
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:24,370
<i>After that, the judge just
threw it out on the spot.</i>

332
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,208
That judge has
a deep voice, right?

333
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,844
I'm gonna go, uh,
check out the food.

334
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,313
Hey.

335
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:34,714
Bet you five buck
you can't guess

336
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:39,152
three of the hors d'oeuvres
they're serving.

337
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:41,054
I'll take that action.

338
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,422
Chicken satay,

339
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:43,990
tuna tartare,

340
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,692
shot glasses
of gazpacho.

341
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,528
Satay, tartare...

342
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,496
no 'szpach.

343
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,599
Where the 'szpach,
Hoytsman?

344
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,868
Yes!
'Szpach!

345
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,604
No!
Well played.

346
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,805
Unless you want
to go double or nothing.

347
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,708
I'm listening.

348
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,411
<i>Oh, nothing but glass!</i>

349
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:08,581
I'll bet you can't tell
how tall the Sarge is.

350
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,250
In eggrolls.

351
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:15,121
24.
Exactly 25 eggrolls tall.

352
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,823
Celebration eggroll.

353
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,291
Hey, man,
that was on the floor.

354
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:19,959
You're on the floor.

355
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,362
60 bucks says you can't
remove one glass

356
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:24,497
without knocking
the whole thing over.

357
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:30,069
You didn't say
I couldn't grab the top one.

358
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,506
Yes!

359
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,242
100 bucks says I can jump
from the roof and survive.

360
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,978
Oh, I don't think
you can...

361
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,747
Just messing with you, Peralta.

362
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,415
I gotta hit the head.
Oh, then we'll bet on

363
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,550
who can shove more shrimp
in his mouth.

364
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:45,051
You're on.
I got a big mouth though.

365
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:46,519
You're in trouble.

366
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,887
I thought you
were leaving.

367
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,022
Were you just talking
to Hoytsman?

368
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,257
Talking. Bonding.
Betting.

369
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:53,726
Oh, I should bet him that I can
pee for longer than he can.

370
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,162
Ugh.
The trick is to pinch it.

371
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,230
All right.
I'll be right back.

372
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:01,935
Oh.
Gotta fill up the tank.

373
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,803
Ah!
Hello Geoffrey.

374
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,338
Hello.

375
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,975
And that's cocaine.

376
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,272
This night is making me
incredibly anxious.

377
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,107
Oh hey,
Stay close.

378
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,642
Someone messed with
the champagne tower.

379
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,676
You're all I've got.

380
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,212
Jake is stupid,
but he's smart.

381
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,947
I think his plan
is actually working.

382
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:24,284
Oh God.
Hey, so,

383
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,753
No big deal,
but I arrested your boss,

384
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:27,787
and I never should have
come here.

385
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,088
Well I read that
wrong.

386
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,324
Oh, this is insane.
This is so insane.

387
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:32,925
I wasn't doing anything.

388
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,127
He was snorting cocaine
in the bathroom.

389
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,663
Okay, for the last time,
that is not what happened.

390
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:39,265
And that's cocaine.

391
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,401
Are you sure?

392
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:43,002
Five dollars
says you're wrong.

393
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:44,437
Let me get in there.
Take a good look and smell.

394
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,339
No, don't.

395
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,107
Okay.
It was cocaine.

396
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,976
Turns out I was accidentally
doing some cocaine.

397
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,144
Not on accident.

398
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:52,745
You put it in your nose
on purpose.

399
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:55,014
I don't even think
I have a nose, Peralta.

400
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,016
I certainly cannot
feel it.

401
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,051
The defense rests!

402
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,652
Shh.
Keep your voices down.

403
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,687
What is going on here?

404
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:01,888
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

405
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,891
Sophia's cop boyfriend
is arresting me

406
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,793
in front of my friends
and colleagues.

407
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:11,631
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jake.

408
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,902
So who here saw
<i>12 Years A Slave?</i>

409
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:17,637
Best picture.

410
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,505
<i>Well, Diaz,</i>

411
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,573
the deed is done.

412
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,041
You torpedoed
her promotion?

413
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:23,376
Sadly, no.

414
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,079
I gave that goblin
a good recommendation.

415
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,548
Your story about the marketer
really hit me.

416
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,617
I began to realize
that if even you thought

417
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,352
I should take the high road,
that was probably

418
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:33,486
the right choice.

419
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,355
I'm sorry you didn't
get your vengeance.

420
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,624
Mother Holt.
Good one.

421
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,460
But I am still planning
to get some retribution.

422
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:43,429
I got her
a parting gift.

423
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,431
Tickets to<i> Wicked?</i>

424
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:46,933
In Boston.

425
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,268
She's moving to
a second-class city,

426
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,603
and I wanted
to rub her nose in it.

427
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,338
Enjoy the understudies,
Madeline.

428
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,741
Have fun watching
some chubby Chenoweth knock-off

429
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:59,145
warble her way
through<i> Popular.</i>

430
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,547
Hello, Lynn.

431
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:01,681
Hi, Regina.

432
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,349
Don't play games
with me, boy.

433
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,185
This is a bad idea.

434
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,786
No, it's okay.
Dad's got this.

435
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:08,154
He's a real
sweet talker.

436
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,822
Let's cut the crap.

437
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,158
Okay.
What are your intentions with my mother?

438
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:15,028
To make love to her
every morning until we die.

439
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,096
So it's just physical?

440
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,431
What are you nuts?

441
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,066
I'm a divorced,
retired florist

442
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,367
with a terrible
gluten allergy.

443
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:25,371
Your mom is a beautiful,
brilliant travel agent.

444
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:26,940
She talks to people
on the phone

445
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,575
who've seen
the whole world.

446
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,743
I'll never meet anyone
half as good as her.

447
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:32,712
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

448
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:36,082
You mean other
than Charles?

449
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,350
No.

450
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:39,319
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

451
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:41,621
That's okay, Pop.

452
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:43,223
You did what you had
to do.

453
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,457
I love her.

454
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,560
All I want is to make
her happy forever.

455
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:49,696
Fine.
I give you my blessing.

456
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:52,198
But if you hurt my mom
in any way,

457
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,200
so help me God,
I will cut off

458
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,502
your son's testicles.

459
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,670
Snip, snip, snip.
And I'm not playing.

460
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,806
Deal.

461
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,342
Way to go, Dad!

462
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,610
You bagged a babe.

463
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,678
The Boyle boys
are planning a wedding!

464
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:07,480
Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!

465
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,816
Both: Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!

466
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,118
Both:

467
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,853
You screwed this up,
buddy.

468
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:15,688
You thinks she's gonna
still love you after this?

469
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:16,923
She'll see who
you are now.

470
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,992
Hey, you don't know anything
about me and Sophia.

471
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,560
What?
I'm talking to myself

472
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:21,828
about my wife.

473
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,196
She is not gonna
like this.

474
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,064
Who cares about you
and your gross life?

475
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,100
Jake, heads up.

476
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,636
Oh, hey, Sophia.
Thank God you're here.

477
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:31,237
I was just gonna find you
so we could talk.

478
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,605
Jake, I'm not here
to talk to you.

479
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,706
I'm here
as Geoffrey's attorney.

480
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,208
Oh, I can do it myself.
Watch this.

481
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,575
Objection, objection, objection,
objection, objection!

482
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,045
Five!
Five objections.

483
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,182
Maybe this "cocaine"
isn't so bad after all.

484
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,516
Okay.
Geoffrey, I'm gonna have to

485
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,151
advise you to stop
talking/confessing

486
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:46,286
in front
of the detectives.

487
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,687
Okay, look,
I know that you're mad,

488
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,256
but I talked to the D.A. and
he agreed to drop the charges.

489
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,459
Geoffrey just had to do a little
bit of community service,

490
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,993
and nothing will even go
on his record.

491
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:55,295
Not good enough.
You have no evidence.

492
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:57,831
Sophia, there's cocaine
on his collar right now.

493
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:59,299
Oh, not anymore.

494
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,800
Whoo!

495
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,702
You're really not
reading the vibe right at all.

496
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:03,937
Tell you what,
that's the cocaine.

497
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,505
I'm usually very tuned in.

498
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,006
Shh.
I had to arrest him.

499
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,541
I had no choice.
Really?

500
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,076
'Cause I could think
of 50 other ways

501
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,311
you could've handled
this scenario.

502
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:13,046
Oh my God,
you are such a lawyer.

503
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,414
You are such a cop.

504
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,182
I tell you I need some space
to figure things out

505
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,550
and you come kicking
down the door

506
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:19,352
with the first plan
that pops into your head.

507
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:20,787
How is it my fault
that your jerk boss

508
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,655
put his jerk nose
into a pile of jerk cocaine?

509
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,957
You followed him
into a bathroom

510
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,992
at a party you weren't even
invited to.

511
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:28,061
Hey, you know what?
We're done.

512
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,596
All right, fine.
I'll talk to the D.A.

513
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,364
I'll see if I can cut
the community service in half,

514
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,466
how's that?
No, Jake. Not with the case.

515
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,769
You and I are done.

516
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,421
Jake, what are
you doing?

517
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,456
I wanted to stop you.

518
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,258
Grand gesture.
I took the stairs.

519
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,593
A little winded there, buddy?
Yeah.

520
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:48,528
Romance is hard!

521
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,996
Can you just talk for,
like, 20 minutes

522
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,064
while I catch my breath?

523
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:52,332
I don't have anything
to say.

524
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,400
Oh come on.

525
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:54,968
This is just a stupid fight
about nothing.

526
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:56,903
I'm not gonna let us
break up over this.

527
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,105
Jake, our jobs
are incompatible.

528
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,573
Our lives
are incompatible.

529
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,108
Look, we'll just never
talk about work,

530
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,576
or interact with
each other's friends,

531
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:03,844
or acknowledge each other
in public,

532
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,378
and I know this sounds like
I'm describing enemies,

533
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,713
but we can
make this work.

534
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:07,814
We're Romeo and Juliet.

535
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,616
It didn't work
for Romeo and Juliet.

536
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:11,918
That play ends in a tragic
double suicide.

537
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,086
That's how it ends?

538
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,221
Why do people
like it so much?

539
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,490
All right, look.
Jake, you're fun, okay?

540
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:17,824
And we've only been dating
for three months.

541
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,693
It's just not that serious.

542
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,294
Well, it's kinda
serious to me.

543
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,662
I've accidentally said,
"I love you," like,

544
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:23,630
four times already.

545
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,031
I know.
I-

546
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:27,000
I just don't think
I accidentally love you back.

547
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:30,771
Look, it's just... it's just
so much work.

548
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,773
That's work I'm willing
to do.

549
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,475
I'm not.

550
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,144
I'm sorry.

551
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,918
Double suicide?

552
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:47,954
<i>Hello, Madeline.</i>

553
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,357
Raymond.
I was just about to call you.

554
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,025
I wanted to thank you
for your kind recommendation.

555
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,628
And I wanted
to give you this.

556
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:57,164
<i>Wicked.</i>

557
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,132
Starring Beth Danube.

558
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,001
Well played, Raymond.

559
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,969
Sadly, I won't be able
to use them.

560
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,038
Since I'm not going to Boston.
What?

561
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,674
I was only interested
in the Boston offer as leverage.

562
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:10,143
I used it to get
a promotion from the NYPD.

563
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,312
I have never had more power
over you

564
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:13,980
than I do at this
very moment.

565
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:17,117
I wanted to give you these
as a thank you.

566
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,653
You're joking.

567
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:20,654
I'm gonna call
the commissioner.

568
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,390
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

569
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:24,725
I know you never
would have recommended me

570
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,660
for that Boston post
if deep down

571
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,129
you didn't think
I deserved the job.

572
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:39,172
What the...

573
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,208
A thank you round
of drinks

574
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,944
and a toast to Amy.
Oh.

575
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,779
Your conflict
resolution skills

576
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,914
has made my childhood dreams
come true.

577
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,116
I'm gonna be
a ring bearer.

578
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,751
You don't think your dad
will make you best man?

579
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:53,553
Oh, I just assumed
he'd ask Jake.

580
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:57,057
Mm. Move over, please.
I do have a wedding to plan.

581
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,425
'Cause if this thing
is happening,

582
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,360
it's not going to be
a Boyle brothers event.

583
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,262
For starters,
all the bridesmaids

584
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,563
are gonna be dressed
like Roseanne

585
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:05,198
from the television show,
<i>Roseanne.</i>

586
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,266
Oh, I like that show.

587
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,402
A certified shaman
will conduct the ceremony,

588
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:12,039
and the ring bearer
will be an actual wolf.

589
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,341
Oh man, I could do it,
but I wouldn't be as majestic

590
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:15,509
on all fours.

591
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,877
This wedding sounds weird.
I'm into it.

592
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,578
To Lynn and Darlene Boyle.

593
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,180
All: Cheers.

594
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:22,049
Yuck.

595
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,317
My lady left me.

596
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:26,086
My lady stayed.

597
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,287
Come on, sir.

598
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,555
Focus on the good.

599
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:30,157
You can hold your head up:

600
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,992
you took the high road
with Wuntch.

601
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,360
Not entirely.

602
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,963
When I was alone in her office,
I changed her auto-correct.

603
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,599
Now when she types "Wuntch,"
it gets replaced with "Butt."

604
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,602
Ah, I should not have gone
to that party.

605
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:43,837
I shouldn't have gone
to that bathroom.

606
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:45,405
I should not have
arrested her boss.

607
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:46,807
I don't see it that way.

608
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:49,076
You did everything right.
You were a good cop.

609
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,544
Good lonely cop.

610
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,512
Hey, man, you put yourself
out there.

611
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,647
You weren't breezy.

612
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:56,350
You like Sophia,
you fought for her.

613
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,517
You should be proud.

614
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,419
No, you should be
changing her auto-correct.

615
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,554
What's her last name?

616
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,922
Perez.
No.

617
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,023
It's "Butt" now.

618
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:04,992
Sophia Butt.

619
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:07,027
That's feels good,
doesn't it?

620
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,128
Not really.

621
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:10,163
Okay.

622
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,331
Then let's get soused.

623
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:13,033
Ah, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

624
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,235
Mine.
Mine.

625
