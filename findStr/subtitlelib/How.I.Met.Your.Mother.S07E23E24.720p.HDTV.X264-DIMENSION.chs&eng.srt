在有那么一点远的大西洋城

00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:11,429
尤达是《星球大战》中培养战士的大师 喜欢倒着说话

Plus, we're in no shape to drive. So, a car's out...

孩子们 我无论如何都想不起
Kids, for the life of me, I can't remember

They won't admit me until my contractions

29
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:19,985

I have got you covered. When I was 13, my father caught me

32

马驹从产道里面挤出来的景象
for foaling season. Once you see a baby horse

34
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:31,792
可以让人性致全无
erupt through that birth canal, you stop even touching yourself.

35
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:34,578
总之 因为我胳膊细 所以我把手肘都埋了进去
Anyway, I had skinny arms, so I got up there elbow deep.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,180
小黑出生的过程中我的手表不见了

50
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,747
不许你发这封邮件
You are not sending that to anyone, ever.

51
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:13,718
我现在需要从疼痛中转移注意力
So what I need right now is distraction from the pain.

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,386
给我讲个故事就好

我只要求一件事作为回报
I ask only one thing in return.

66
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,792
让我来选孩子的中间名
Let me choose your child's middle name.

67
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:57,545
因为我已经想好了一个惊天地泣鬼神的名字
Because I have thought up the most awesome name of all time.

68
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,180
什么名字

我说了我等着呢
I said I'm waiting.

73
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,805
-慢着  -到底是中间名
-Wait for it. -What's the middle name?

74
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,241
"慢着"就是中间名
No, the middle name is "Wait For It."

75
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,727
比如说他的教名是 呃 巴尼
Let's say his first name is, oh, I don't know, Barney.

76
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:17,264
他的全名就叫 巴尼・慢着・埃里克森
He'd be Barney "Wait For It" Eriksen.

77
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,467
那样有多帅啊

我有一个让我们回纽约的计划

我们只要拿到那辆摩托车就可以了
All we have to do is get our hands on that motorcycle.

83
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:39,020
而且我已经想好该怎么办
And I know just the way to do it.

84
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,043

不 我不担心我城里产的窄臀
No, I am not worried my city hips are too narrow,

88
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,606
会卡住你的孙子
and-and your grandson's going to get stuck.

89
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,157
我先挂了
I got to go.

90
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,693
我以为你把那蠢邮件删了
I thought you deleted that stupid e-mail.

91
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,895

93
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,565
继续讲故事
Just keep telling me stories!

94
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:13,421
尼尔・杨是加拿大著名音乐人

95
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:13,421
好的 好的 我想到一个 和尼尔・杨上二垒
Okay, okay, I got one for you: second base with Neil Young.

96
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,339

97
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:20,211
我一般不会 呃 到处宣传我的二垒事迹
I don't normally go to, um, second base and tell,

98
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:25,249
不过这可是和尼尔・杨的激情一夜
but I just spent a magical night with Neil Young.

99
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,134
他现在还在我房里
He's still in my room.

100
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,719
开什么玩笑 哦 天啊
Seriously? Oh, my God.

101
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,521
轻点 别把他吓跑了
Be quiet, don't scare him off.

102
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,257

00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:48,657
噢 我们在互相抖料么 我有料可抖啊
Oh, we're busting apple bags? I can bust apple bags.

107
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,784
泰德 记得我们约会时候办的那个派对吗
Ted, remember when we were dating and we threw that party

108
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,136
其中有道开胃菜不大对头
and one of those appetizers just didn't sit right?

109
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:57,056
呃 听上去没有印象
Ah... doesn't sound familiar.

110
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:01,126
我把这个故事叫做"泰德与古巴三明治危机"
I call this story "Ted and the Cuban Sandwich Crisis."

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,097
泰德走出卫生间的时候
Ted came out of that bathroom looking like

112
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,100
马尼拉是拳击史上的重要比赛 乔弗雷泽输给了巅峰时期的拳王阿里

113
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,100
看起来像是乔弗雷泽输掉马尼拉大战之后的样子
Joe Frazier after the Thrilla in Manila.

114
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:11,487
喔 那是什么味道
Oh, what is that smell!?

115
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,406
啊
Ugh!

所以我 作为一名优秀的女友 试着帮他解围
So I, being a great girlfriend, tried to help him out.

117
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:24,200
你们都中什么邪了 我什么都没闻到
You guys are all crazy; I don't smell anything.

118
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,285
总之 谁想去屋顶
Anyway, uh, who wants to go up on the roof?

119
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,286
但是当时
But then...

120
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:31,173
她这是做贼心虚
She, who denied it, supplied it.

121
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:34,938
没错 肯定是那个古巴三明治 对吧宝贝儿
Yeah, must have been that Cuban sandwich, huh, babe?

122
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,347
那实在是很没劲啊 泰德
That was not cool, Ted.

123
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,682
也有变短的意思 所以后面robin把说法缩短了

124
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,682
子宫收缩
Contraction!

125
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,801
那实在没劲 泰德
That wasn't cool, Ted?

126
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,603
继续说故事啊
Just keep going with the stories.

127
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,354
我都不在乎我是不是已经听过
I don't even care if I've heard it before.

128
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:48,190
就说那个 呃 "那扇门通向哪"的故事
Just tell me, uh, "Where Does That Door Go?"

129
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,375
好的
Okay.

130
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:53,162
嗨 我以前从来没注意过那扇门
Hey, I've never noticed that door before.

131
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,400
很好奇它通向哪里
I wonder where it goes.

132
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,688
泰德 泰德

136
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,505
罗宾

137
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,397

138
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,149

140
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,054
让我猜猜 你收到泰德的邮件了
Let me guess, you got Ted's e-mail.

141
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:38,390
-小公主 我这就上路 -爸爸 等一下 不 不要
-I'm on my way, Princess.  -Dad, wait, no, not...

Damn it, Ted.

143
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:43,779
你发邮件给我的阿姨 我的表兄妹们 你的表兄妹们
I was okay with you e-mailing my aunt, my cousins,

144
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,415
还有那个罗宾误认成尼尔杨的哥们 这都不算什么
and your cousins, and the guy that Robin thought was Neil Young.

145
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,369
但是我爸爸是任何医患状况下
But my father is the absolute worst person to have around

146
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,755
的绝对最差伴侣
in any sort of medical situation.

147
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,573
我七岁的时候
When I was seven, I needed

148
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:55,891
要做一个扁桃体切除手术
to have my tonsils out.

149
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,843
爸爸 我害怕
Daddy, I'm scared.

150
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:01,681
嗷 小公主 要是我也会怕 我对这个手术做了些研究
Aw, Princess, I would be too. I've researched this surgery.

151
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:04,850
什么都可能发生 你可能流血过多而死
Anything can happen. You could bleed to death...

152
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,436
你可能因为感染需要把下巴卸了
...you could have your jaw removed due to infection,

153
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:10,422
而且麻醉可能会突然失效
and the anesthesia could suddenly just stop working,

154
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:12,308
就像你妈妈和我的婚姻一样
much like your mom's and my marriage.

155
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,430
你知道我们要离的吧
You do know that we're getting a divor...

156
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:21,283
先别担心这个 等做完手术我们再聊
Don't worry about it. We'll talk about it after the surgery.

157
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,602
淡定 丫头
Calm down, girl.

158
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:26,205
好的 最后再说一次 我不是一匹
Okay, for the last time, I am not...

159
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,041
其实吧 接着梳
Actually, keep going.

160
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:32,078
好的 我承认这套"赢辆摩托车计划"很蠢
Okay, I admit the whole "Win a motorcycle plan" Was stupid.

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,432
尤其是因为我们连该在哪台机器上玩都搞错了
Especially because we've been playing on the wrong machine.

162
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,587
五分钟之后在出口处等我
Meet me at the entrance in five minutes.

163
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:49,762
上来吧 马修 今晚出发 我们骑它
Hop on, Marshall. Tonight, we ride!

164
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,564
你赢来的
You won that?

165
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,433
还真不能这么说  你看啊  我
Not exactly. You see, I...

166
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,818
给我下来
Get off!

167
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:03,034
我希望马修快到了 给我块方糖
I hope Marshall's close. Cube me.

168
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,178
我正在赶路 小百合
I'm on my way, Lily Pad.

169
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:10,964
孩子们 你们的马修叔叔
Kids, your Uncle Marshall

170
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,234
一生中面对过很多挑战
has faced many challenges in his life.

171
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,236
但是他还是觉得在醉到这个程度的情况下
But he still considers getting up these two steps

172
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:17,988
上这两级台阶是最最难的一次挑战
when he was this drunk to be the hardest one of all.

173
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,956
给我说个马修的故事 我想他
Tell me a Marshall story. I miss him.

174
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,044
有了 "受诅咒裤子"的故事
Got it. "The Tale of the Cursed Pants."

175
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:43,047
嗨 哥几个
Hey, guys.

176
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,883
我现在开始担心我的裤子了
So, I'm starting worry about these pants.

177
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:46,934
现在才开始
Starting to?

178
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,802
不 自从我买了这裤子之后
No, ever since I got them, terrible things

179
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,721
可怕的厄运一直发生在我身上  我戳了脚趾头
have been happening to me: I stubbed my toe,

180
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:53,006
-错过了火车  -你穿上了这条裤子
-I missed my train... -You put on the pants.

181
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:56,009
而且旧货店的那位大姐告诉我
And then the lady at the thrift store said that for years,

182
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,694
多年来都没有人试穿过这裤子  你能相信么
no one so much as tried them on. Can you believe that?

183
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,314
能
Yes.

184
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,981
你知道这意味着什么吧
You know what this means?

185
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,301
这条裤子被诅咒了
These pants are cursed.

186
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,188
口袋里的是什么
What's this in the pocket?

187
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,793
一个线索
A clue.

188
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:15,212
马修找人翻译了纸条上的字
Marshall had the writing translated.

189
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:18,465
这让他深入到了中国城的内心地带
It led him deep into the heart of Chinatown.

190
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,945
是你
It is you.

191
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,430
那个人出现了
The One has arrived.

192
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,340
干洗费21.5刀
Dry cleaning, $21.50.

193
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:45,993
我记得那件西服 他看上去像
I remember that suit. He looked like

194
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,829
一个小小孩儿的假想朋友
a little kid's imaginary friend.

195
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,731
他在哪儿啊
Where is he?!

196
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,816
现在 马修叔叔知道他只有一个机会
Now, Uncle Marshall knew he had only one chance

197
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,568
离开大西洋城
of getting out of Atlantic City:

198
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,870
贿赂一个出租车司机
bribing a cab driver.

199
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,922
会吐钱的机器
Machine that gives money!

200
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,547
现在 马修是挺醉的
Now, Marshall was pretty drunk,

201
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:09,450
但是他发誓自动提款机变成了这样
but he swears the ATM started to do this.

202
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,102
别打我了 就凭这个
Stop hitting me. Just for that,

203
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:31,822
你就不能回家见证你儿子的出生
you're never getting home for the birth of your son.

204
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,918
不
No!!

205
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,553
咋了 哥们
What's up, bro?

206
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,289
等下 你是怎么  那些保安
Wait, how did you... with the security?

207
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,624
我会解释的
I'll explain.

208
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,979
你说说 我们是不是该通知主管部门呢
-Tell me why we shouldn't call the authorities...

209
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:59,066
就现在  你倒是去通知啊
-right now? -Go ahead, call 'em.

210
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:02,302
但是 你能先给我看看
But first, can you show me the rule that says you can't

211
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,988
禁止在赌场骑摩托的法规吗
drive a motorcycle on the casino floor?

212
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,160
里面没这条
It's not in here.

213
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,617
孩子们 直到今天 这个告示都一直贴在这
And, kids, that sign is still there to this day.

214
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:19,536
我出来的时候正好碰上这家伙
When I came out, I ran into this guy.

215
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,121
他开往纽约的巴士
Two seats just opened up

216
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:24,157
上面空了两个座位
on his bus to New York!

217
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,794
巴尼 你太有才了
Barney, you're a genius!

218
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,262
还有 最绝的是
Plus, here's the best part.

219
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:30,681
爷跟奎恩基本上玩完了 爷现在是单身
This Quinn thing is probably done, so I'm basically single.

220
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:34,385
Senior有老人的意思 也有大四(高三)学生的意思

221
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:34,385
他说车上全都是性感的在校大四生哦
He said the bus is full of hot college seniors.

222
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,354
好吧 也许他没说"学校"
Okay, maybe he didn't say "College."

223
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:38,972
也没说"性感"
Or "Hot."

224
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,392
我好想奎恩啊
I miss Quinn.

225
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:43,811
马修在搞毛啊
What is taking Marshall so long?

226
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:44,645
舔两口盐巴
Salt lick?

227
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,930
赶紧把门那故事说完
Just finish the door story!

228
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:02,713
哇哦
Oh, wow.

229
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,584
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

230
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,720
好了好了 到四分钟了
Okay, okay, that's four minutes!

231
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,921
我们这就去医院
We're going to the hospital.

232
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:12,389
等等 马修还没回来呢
W-Wait, but Marshall's not here yet.

233
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,425
没有马修 我不能去医院
I can't go to the hospital without Marshall!

234
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:15,809
放着我来 莉莉 腿张开
I'm on it. Lily, spread your legs.

235
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,511
我要看看蹄子露出来没
I'm gonna see if we can see the hooves--

236
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:19,146
额不  是猪鼻子 额不  是脑袋
uh, the-the snout-- uh, the head.

237
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,931
来吧  现在就带我去医院
Here we go. Take me to the hospital now.

238
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,766
好 走走走
Okay. Come on, come on.

239
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,884
不好意思 师傅
Excuse me, sir.

240
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:25,903
我老婆要生了
My wife is in labor, and I really need to

241
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,070
我得去圣马库斯医院
get to Saint Marcus Hospital.

242
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:29,940
这车在纽约哪儿停啊
So where exactly in New York does this bus drop off?

243
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,425
水牛城（在纽约州 不是纽约市）
Buffalo.

244
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:38,573
我为什么不能用硬脊膜外麻醉啊
What do you mean I can't have an epidural?

245
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,145
已经过了麻醉时机了
You're too far along.

246
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:42,912
你这情况发展的比原先预料的快多了
Things are moving much faster than expected.

247
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:46,916
听着  你要是怕惹麻烦
Look, if your hands are tied medically,

248
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:49,469
就把麻醉剂放桌子上 我自个来
just leave the epidural on the table and walk away.

249
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,004
别担心
Don't worry.

250
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:53,173
宝宝一会就出来了哈
The baby slide right out, huh?

251
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,758
嗖一声就出来了
It's like a whoosh.

252
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,142
就像水滑梯一样哦
Like a waterslide.

253
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,313
稍稍有点疼的水滑梯
Slightly painful waterslide.

254
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,349
赶紧讲个故事
Tell me a story now!

255
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:04,467
额 额
Uh... Uh...

256
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,602
哦 你记得那回不
Oh! Remember the time Barney

257
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:07,158
巴尼搞成终结者那样 跟妞搭讪
tried to pick up girls as the Terminator?

258
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:09,183
嗯
Yes.

259
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,505
想爽就跟我来
Come with me if you want to bang.

260
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,341
换一个
Another.

261
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:31,110
啊 泰德和他那根那根巨长的臂毛
Oh, uh, Ted and the freakishly long arm hair!

262
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,595
我倒不这么想 我觉得肚子饱不饱
No, I disagree, because the filling--

263
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:35,131
还是取决于你吃了啥 对吧
It depends on what you're eating, right?

264
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:35,998
你要是吃了
If it's...

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,934
喔 这是毛啊
Whoa. What the...?

266
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,019
喔
Whoa.

267
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:43,356
那就讲那个巨长臂毛的穿帮故事
The debunking of the freakishly long arm hair.

268
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:46,843
等下 这就是根线而已
Wait, it's-it's just a thread.

269
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,279
我羡慕嫉妒恨 行不
I was jealous, okay?

270
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:50,864
今天巴尼那个终结者的噱头
Barney's getting all the attention today

271
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,982
实在出尽了风头
with this Terminator thing.

272
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:55,568
哼 这招儿居然没法儿把妞骗上床
Huh. Can't believe I'm not getting laid in this thing.

273
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,572
看来我得换一个电影桥段
Maybe I need to pick a different part of the movie.

274
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,965
再换一个故事
Tell me another story!

275
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,184
哦对了 那个门的故事还没讲完呢
Oh, hey, we never finished "Where does that door go""

276
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,552
来吧
Come on.

277
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,037
我们看看去
Let's check it out.

278
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,555
额亲爱的 他们都不见了
You know what, baby, they're gone.

279
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:18,858
咱俩也撤了吧
It's time for us to move on.

280
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,679
莉
L-Lil...

281
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,903
哦老天
Oh, my God.

282
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,072
新故事啊
New story!

283
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:34,407
额 那回我们做试验
Uh, the time we tested

284
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:35,971
看香蕉皮是不是真滑
if banana peels are really slippery.

285
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:36,710
对
Yes.

286
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,027
好了么
Ready?

287
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:41,364
这玩意根本不可能真滑
There's no way that's really slippery.

288
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:44,868
嗷嗷嗷
Ow! Ow! Ow!

289
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,287
额 那年万圣节 我们打算装扮成"早餐俱乐部"
Uh, the Halloween we decided to go as The Breakfast Club,

290
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,505
但是没分派好角色
but failed to coordinate our costumes!

291
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,506
额 这
Uh... Does...

292
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,175
哦
Oh.

293
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,545
开玩笑吧
Really?

294
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,579
对  那次是很搞笑
Yeah, that was funny.

295
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,580
接着讲
Keep going!

296
00:14:57,582 --> 00:14:58,965
额 额
Oh, uh, uh...

297
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,301
那回巴尼救了一个女人一命
the-the time Barney saved a woman's life.

298
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,585
好了么
Ready?

299
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:05,755
这玩意根本不可能真滑
There's no way that's really slippery.

300
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,711
额 那回莉莉生孩子
Uh, the time Lily went into labor!

301
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:12,946
就是这回啊
That's now!

302
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,147
抱歉 我没故事了
Sorry, I'm running out of stories.

303
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,148
算了
Forget it!

304
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,699
说这些反正也没用了
They're not working anymore!

305
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,484
好了 莉莉 我知道这肯定不是你想象中的样子
Okay, Lily, I know this isn't how you imagined it,

306
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:19,652
但我希望你知道
but I want you to know

307
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,288
我就在这里 我是你坚强的后盾
that I am here for you and I am rock solid!

308
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,324
哦 我看到宝宝的头了
Oh, I can see its head.

309
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,794
哦 感谢老天 桑亚医生
Oh, thank God, Dr. Sonya!

310
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:28,778
你
You!

311
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,948
把地上那摊东西从我的产房里弄出去
Get that thing out of my delivery room!

312
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,167
我受不了软弱的女人
Weak women disgust me.

313
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,118
好了 莉莉 把腿抬起来
All right, Lily, legs up!

314
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,503
我们现在开始 成么
We push now, yes?!

315
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,339
不行啊 马修还没来呢
I can't. Marshall's not here yet.

316
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,506
莉莉
Lily!

317
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:43,309
如果你不使劲儿的话
If you don't push, I will shove that baby

318
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,179
我就把孩子推进你的喉咙 然后从你嘴里拽出来
up your throat and pull it out of your mouth!

319
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,965
马修这个死人到底在哪里
Where the hell is Marshall?!

320
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,634
没有马修 我做不到的
I can't do this without Marshall!

321
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:55,838
孩子们 有时候上天会遂你所愿送来你需要的人
Kids, sometimes the universe sends exactly what you ask for.

322
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,275
也有时候 上天会送来莉莉的爸爸
Other times, it sends Lily's dad.

323
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:01,277
哦
Oh...

324
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,646
记得你那次做扁桃体手术的时候么
Remember the time you had your tonsils out?

325
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,147
当然 当然
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,699
你把我吓得七荤八素的
You scared the crap out of me.

327
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,501
是的哇 不是么
Yes, I did, didn't I?

328
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,454
哦 我的个天呐
Oh, my.

329
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,940
但你记得之后发生的事情么
But do you remember what happened next?

330
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,324
别担心 我的小公主
And don't worry, Princess,

331
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,543
如果你永久的失去了说话的能力
if you permanently lose the ability to speak,

332
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,012
我们就送你一块小黑板
we'll give you a chalkboard.

333
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:22,331
你可以找根小绳子把它挂在脖子上
You can hang it around your neck on a little string.

334
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,718
护士姐姐 我不认识这个陌生人
Nurse, I don't know who this strange man is.

335
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,103
保安
Security!

336
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,105
你说什么呐 我可是你爸爸
What are you talking about? I'm your daddy.

337
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:30,056
你这是干什么
What do you mean...

338
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,324
嘿 伙计们 别这样
Hey, fellas, come on!

339
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,693
当我在一堆医疗垃圾里醒来
I woke up in a Dumpster of medical waste,

340
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:36,145
感觉再自豪不过了
and I couldn't have been prouder.

341
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:39,315
因为你就像那堆垃圾一样
Because, much like that Dumpster,

342
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,701
guts既有勇气又有内脏的意思

343
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,701
很有勇气
you had a lot of guts.

344
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:46,188
而那种勇气伴着你度过每一天
And you've used that bravery every day of your life.

345
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,741
所以不论马修在不在
With or without Marshall.

346
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:51,544
你都要生下这个宝宝
You're having this baby.

347
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,362
谢谢 爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

348
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,998
这个故事还真帮上忙了
That story actually helped.

349
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,382
哦 很好 我很欣慰
Oh, good, I'm glad.

350
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,751
而且 你知道的 只有极少数人的的阴道会被撕裂
And, you know, few women have vaginal tearing severe enough

351
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,219
到需要手术修补的地步
to need surgical reconstruction...

352
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,921
-保安   -哦 别这样嘛
-Security!   -Oh, come on.

353
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,056
不必这样吧
That's not necessary.

354
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,223
宝贝儿 别...
Sweetheart, please...

355
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:05,925
哦 伙计们 别这样
Oh, fellas, come on.

356
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,343
求求你了 先生
Please, sir, all you have to do

357
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,678
您只要在下个出口离开高速公路去趟曼哈顿
is take the next exit to Manhattan.

358
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,396
20分钟之内您就可以重回这条高速公路
You'll be back on the road in 20 minutes.

359
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:11,431
我已经告诉你了
I already told you,

360
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,715
我没有权力停车
I'm not allowed to stop.

361
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:16,719
先生 这个人今晚就要当爸爸了
Sir, this man is having a baby tonight.

362
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:19,322
现在他应该去圣马克斯医院
And instead of going to Saint Marcus Hospital,

363
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,690
而不是水牛城
we're going to Buffalo.

364
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:23,576
我见过那儿的女人 她们市的市名真是恰如其分
And I've seen women from there; the city's aptly named.

365
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,896
你看 我是根废柴
Look, I'm a screwup.

366
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:28,915
我对一个叫奎恩的女孩儿认了真
I had something special with this girl Quinn,

367
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,033
但我却毁了这一切
and I ruined it.

368
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:33,669
但是这个人 他每件事都做的恰如其分
But this guy-- he's done everything right.

369
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:36,456
他18岁就开始用心经营这段感情
He's been loving and devoted since he was 18 years old.

370
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,093
这个世界上如此可敬的人仅有几个
There are only a few truly great people on this planet,

371
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,594
而他就是其中之一
and he is one of them.

372
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:45,298
亲眼看着孩子出生是他应得的报偿
He deserves to be at the birth of his son.

373
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,767
所以...你认为呢
So... what do you say?

374
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,020
除非发生紧急情况 不然我不能停车的
Unless there's an emergency, I'm not allowed to stop,

375
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:52,213
现在你给我坐下
so sit down,

376
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:55,191
闭上嘴乖乖地看天茧回归2(传说中的烂片)
watch Cocoon 2 and shut up.

377
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,814
对不起哥们儿 我尽力了
I'm sorry, buddy, I tried.

378
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:04,817
之后 奇迹发生了
And then, something wonderful happened.

379
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,436
我心脏病发了
I'm having a heart attack!

380
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,958
我心脏病也发了
I'm having a heart attack!

381
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,876
我也犯心脏病了
I'm having a heart attack!

382
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,963
而且我的医生就在圣马克斯医院
And my doctor is at Saint Marcus Hospital!

383
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,548
我的也是
So is mine!

384
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,665
我也是
Mine, too.

385
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,284
我的儿子是心脏病科的主任
And my son is head of Cardiology.

386
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,337
我们知道了
We know!

387
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:26,589
使劲儿
Push!

388
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:29,125
要是马修在这儿就好了
I wish Marshall were here!

389
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:30,760
我就在这儿宝贝
I'm here, baby.

390
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:31,677
马修
Marshall!

391
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,646
我不知道我为什么昏过去了
I don't know why I passed out.

392
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:36,516
我接生过12个宝宝  个个完全健康
I have delivered 12 perfectly healthy babies,

393
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,484
其中甚至有个人类小孩儿
and one of them was even human.

394
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,136
这个 如果你爱着那个人 事情就不一样了
Well, it's different when it's someone you love.

395
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:41,988
当那个头从你最好的朋友身体里出来的时候
When that head was coming out of your best friend.

396
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,823
哦 停停停 我又晕乎了
Oh, stop. I'm feeling woozy again.

397
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,108
别介
Don't.

398
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,475
要舔盐巴不
Salt lick?

399
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:50,446
作为对巴尼送我过来的回报 我可能答应了他
In return for him getting me here, I may have promised Barney

400
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:54,450
把我们儿子的中间名定为 慢着等一下
that our son's middle name will be Wait For It.

401
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,786
我等不及了 告诉我 到底是什么
I can't wait, just-- what is the name?

402
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:59,455
名字就是 慢着等一下
The name is Wait For It.

403
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:05,661
这是有史以来最帅气的中间名了
That is the coolest middle name of all time!

404
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:07,130
听我说 嗯

405
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:11,050
我知道最近这几个月以来 我们俩的关系有点儿怪
I know things have been weird between us the last few months,

406
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,385
但是
but...

00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:14,470
马修和莉莉就要有宝宝了

你明白的 我希望这个宝宝生在一个
And, you know, I want this baby to be born

00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,510
我俩能融洽相处的世界里
into a world where we're okay.

411

-好朋友  -你
-Friends.  -You...

同志们 走廊那边有好消息

00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,878
这真是好消息啊
It's like, I don't even care

419
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,963
今天别的事 我都不在乎了
what happens for the rest of the day.

420
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:42,582
我
I...

421
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,083

你来到这个陌生的地方
? You were born into a strange world ?

433
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:19,502
如烛光一般将它点亮
? Like a candle, you were meant to share the fire ?

434
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:23,239
虽然我去来无方 不知所往
? I don't know where we come from, I don't know where we go ?

435
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:25,541
可我会拥你在怀
? But my arms were made to hold you ?

436
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:27,409
今生不放
? So I will never let you go ?

437
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:30,746
因为你的降临
? 'Cause you were born ?

00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:34,016
改变了我人生的航向
? To change this life, you were born. ?

439
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:57,898

巴尼叔叔要结婚了
Uncle Barney was getting married.

444
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:14,033
我们到底是怎么走到这一步的
How the hell did we get there?

445
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:19,154
我喜欢马文这名字
I love the name Marvin.

446
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,489

听来像个中年小矮子

下周末打高尔夫吧 马尔夫
Golf next weekend, Marv?

449
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,212
税报得怎么样了 马尔夫
How's that tax report coming, Marv?

450
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,946
在你这岁数 有性功能障碍

451
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:30,082
没啥不好意思的 马尔夫
is nothing to be ashamed of, Marv.

452
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,619
美好的一刻啊
It was a beautiful moment.

453
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,971
但紧接着一个想法撞进我的脑袋里  孩子们
But then a thought popped into my head, kids.

454
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:37,923
等你们第一次看到你们挚友抱着宝宝
The same thought that will pop into your heads

455
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:40,976
这个想法也会撞进你们脑袋的
the first time you see your best friend holding their baby.

456
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,980
我很好奇这能有多疼
Wonder how much this would hurt.

457
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,453
这货居然当爹了
That guy's a dad.

458
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,442
哦 我猜他是饿了
Oh, I think he's hungry.

459
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,694
额 我们先回避一下
Oh, we'll give you some privacy.

460
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,831
哇哦 你看他们一家三口
Wow. Seeing them in there all together like that,

461
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,750
老婆孩子热炕头啊
they're a family, you know?

462
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,335
我就想要这样的生活
That's what I want.

463
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:09,171
泰德  我很高兴我们又是朋友了
Oh, Ted, I'm glad we're friends again.

464
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,256
我也是
Me, too.

465
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,925
因为作为你的朋友 我不得不告诉你
Because as your friend, I have to tell you:

466
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:14,093
你这是扯淡
You're full of crap!

467
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,794
你说你要成家
You say you want a family,

468
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:18,180
你要"真命天女"
you say you want to meet "The One,"

469
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:21,133
可是你追的妞根本不是啊
but you are always chasing the wrong women.

470
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,351
不是这样的
That is not true.

471
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,686
瞅瞅你那些女朋友
Look at the women you date,

472
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,020
从我开始
starting with me:

473
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:27,156
我当时就说了 我不婚不要孩子
I told you right away I didn't want marriage or kids.

474
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:30,776
斯黛拉跟一个男人藕断丝连还有个孩子
Stella had a child with another man who she still loved.

475
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:34,463
佐伊已婚 还试图毁掉你的事业
Zoey was married and trying to sabotage your career

476
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,699
而且她还总戴着死丑的帽子
and wore a lot of stupid hats.

477
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:39,151
你要是真想成家
If you really wanted a family,

478
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:41,153
你就别追那些你自己都知道
you would stop pursuing women

479
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,988
根本没戏的女人
you know that there is no future with.

480
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,710
成 首先 帽子算是那年的时尚
Okay, first of all, hats were in that year, kind of.

481
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:49,995
其次 我也不能算是总在追
Secondly, I don't always choose women

482
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:52,715
完全没戏的女人
there's no future with, kind of.

483
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:54,300
请举反例
Name one exception.

484
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:56,502
维多利亚
Victoria.

485
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:58,870
维多利亚很好
Victoria was great.

486
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,806
没错 然后你就甩了她
Exactly, and you threw it all away

487
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,092
去追别的惹火尤物了
to chase after some hot piece of ass.

488
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:05,561
-你这是在说自己么  -谢谢咯
-You mean you?   -Thank you!

489
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:08,731
维多利亚是你所有女友里
Victoria is the only woman you've dated

490
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,132
唯一可能成为"真命天女"的了
who could've been "The One."

491
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,400
你应该跟她联系
You should call her.

492
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:14,886
一个小障碍  上次我见她  她就要订婚了
Tiny thing, last time I saw her, she was getting engaged.

493
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:16,038
那是八个月前
That was eight months ago.

494
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,573
你怎么知道她现在不是单身啊
For all you know, she's single again.

495
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:18,574
万一她结婚了呢
What if she's married?

496
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:19,608
万一她没结呢
What if she's not?

497
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,076
你实际上本有机会
Then you would actually have a chance

498
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:23,862
过上你自称想要的生活 结果你却怕了
to get what you say you want, and it terrifies you.

499
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:27,166
为什么呢 因为要是我偷个解剖刀把你开膛破肚
Why? Because if I stole a scalpel and I cut you open,

500
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:31,420
就能看见里面根本是一团哆哆嗦嗦  吓坏了的的破烂
all I would find inside is a scared, trembling pile of crap.

501
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:34,173
你瞧  我就怀念这样的对话
See, I've missed these talks.

502
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,541
我也是
Oh, me, too.

503
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,010
-唉 -哇哦
-Yeah.-Whoa.

504
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,262
怎么啦
What's wrong?

505
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,080
我毁了和我奎恩的恋情
I ruined things with Quinn.

506
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,099
我坚决要求她不要再跳脱衣舞了
I insisted she stop stripping,

507
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,051
我们为此大吵了一架
we got in a huge fight about it,

508
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:49,271
然后我跑到大西洋城两天都不联系她
then I ran off to Atlantic City for two days without calling.

509
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:51,890
我简直不知道回家后会面对什么
What the hell am I coming home to?

510
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:58,430
让我们和我六个火辣的脱衣舞娘朋友一起玩8P吧
Let's have an eight-way with my six hottest stripper friends.

511
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:00,532
额 这哪里是惩罚
Um, how is that a punishment?

512
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:01,734
听我说完
Wait for it.

513
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,118
但是我要罚你不准你用
But I forbid you from filming it

514
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,319
那个会给叫床最大声的人特写镜头的
with your overhead camera

515
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,455
吊式摄像机录下这个过程
that zooms in on whoever's being the loudest.

516
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:11,744
天哪 不要
Nooooo!

517
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,079
不行 这太残忍了
No, that's too cruel.

518
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:18,067
或者 可能奎恩已经搬出去了
Or, you know, maybe Quinn's moved out.

519
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:21,754
我完全没想到这个
I didn't even think of that!

520
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:28,644
哎
Hi.

521
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,730
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

522
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:35,684
"美国杀人魔"是一部小说 曾改编为电影

523
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:35,684
我觉得这个地方有点儿过于"美国杀人魔"风格了
I decided the place was a bit too "American Psycho" For me,

524
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:38,303
所以你离开的时候 我雇了个装潢师
so while you were gone, I hired a decorator

525
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:39,304
然后问他
and I asked him,

526
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:40,572
奇妙仙子的阴道里面
"What would the inside

527
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:42,825
看起来会是怎样的呢
of Tinkerbell's vagina look like?"

528
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:45,094
然后那个小孩就开始自由发挥了
And the kid just ran with it!

529
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,781
那么..你觉得怎样
So... what do you think?

530
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:52,451
感谢老天你还在这里
Thank God you're still here!

531
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:58,173
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

532
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:03,846
莉莉和马修选择罗宾做他们的摄影师
Lily and Marshall asked Robin to be the photographer

533
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:06,331
来拍摄宝宝的生日通告卡相片
for Baby Marvin's Birth Announcement card

534
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,133
却没选择我
instead of me.

535
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:09,134
管他们呢
Whatever.

536
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:10,469
唯一的问题就是
The only problem?

537
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,778
这些都糟透了 罗宾
These are terrible, Robin!

538
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,751
嘿 在这小破公寓里
Hey, it is not easy getting a good shot

539
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,399
照张好照片可不容易
cooped up in this apartment!

540
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,516
看 这就是我和罗宾的不同
See, two different styles:

541
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:28,353
我寻找素材  罗宾寻找借口
I make compositions, Robin makes excuses.

542
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,354
咔嚓
Click!

543
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:30,689
耻辱照相啊
Photo burn!

544
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:32,624
好吧 要不这样
Okay. How about this?

545
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,127
明天我们在日落之时去中央公园
Tomorrow, we go to Central Park at sunset

546
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:38,046
我们就可以在最好的景色里照到最好的照片
and we get the perfect picture in the perfect setting.

547
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,548
噢 我喜欢这个主意
Oh, I like that.

548
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,417
这将是小马文第一次出门走向世界
It'll be Marvin's first outing into the world.

549
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,086
你会爱上那公园的 小家伙
You're gonna love the park, buddy.

550
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:46,138
那是个邂逅美女的好地方
It's a great place to meet chicks.

551
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,423
或者小伙子
Or-or dudes.

552
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:49,675
或者两者
Or both.

553
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:52,060
噢 无论如何我们都爱你
Oh, we love you no matter what!

554
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:55,664
孩子们 当我看着你们莉莉阿姨抱着她儿子的时候
And kids, as I watched your Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,

555
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,699
另一个想法窜入我脑中
another thought popped into my head.

556
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:00,102
虽然你什么都没买
Even though you didn't buy anything,

557
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:02,521
我想感谢你的到来
I want to thank you for coming in.

558
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:03,822
送你一个泰迪熊
Here's a free teddy bear.

559
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:05,891
你打算给这个小家伙起什么名字
What are you gonna name the little guy?

560
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:08,994
六瓶酒
Six Pack.

561
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,532
快发动 混蛋们
Gun it, bitches!

562
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,285
这丫头居然当妈了
That girl's a mom!

563
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:25,627
那啥 我在地铁上遇到一个女孩
Okay, so I met this girl on the train,

564
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:27,679
我短信她 "最近可好"
and I texted her, "What's up""

565
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,599
她回复 "嘿" 加感叹号
She texted, "Hey," Exclamation point.

566
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,352
这是在说 "快约我" 还是 "就.."
Does that mean, "Ask me out" Or "Just..."

567
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:37,806
泰德 我们现在要对另一个人的生命负责
Ted, we are responsible for a whole other human life now,

568
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:42,761
所以 新规矩是 你要是没有至少值八分的事情
so new rule: You can't come to us with any issue unless

569
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:43,813
就别来烦我们
it's an "8" Or higher.

570
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:45,147
明白
Got it.

571
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,233
所以我寻思着回复她一个眨眼的笑脸
So I'm thinking of texting back a winky smiley face.

572
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,068
至少八分  兄弟
Eight or higher, bro.

573
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,069
不是的 我是应该――
Well, no, what should I--

574
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:52,321
至少八分  兄弟
Eight or higher, bro.

575
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,655
不是的 我只是在想如果――
No, yeah, I'm just wondering if--

576
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:55,407
至少八分  兄弟
Eight or higher, bro.

577
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,326
那你说我这个事儿算几级
Well, where do you rate this?

578
00:26:57,328 --> 00:27:00,746
这和现在小马文的裤子里的事件级别一样
This is the same as what's in little Marvin's pants right now:

579
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,564
二减
a soft two.

580
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:07,052
不好意思了 兄弟
Sorry, bro.

581
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:10,439
别再和那个女的短信了 快去打给维多利亚
Stop texting the bimbo and call Victoria.

582
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:11,757
我和她已经结束了
That chapter's over.

583
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,625
我们注定不能在一起的
W-We just weren't destined to be together.

584
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:18,814
注定 你难道还没有厌倦坐等命运么 泰德
"Destined." Aren't you tired of waiting for destiny, Ted?

585
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:21,800
现在不该是你自己主宰命运的时候么
Isn't it time to make your own destiny?

586
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:24,636
嘿 假警报
Hey, false alarm.

587
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,439
我闻到的只是上次的便便味
What I was smelling was the previous poop,

588
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:30,514
而且很明显上次的便便还残留在
which, apparently, is still somewhere on my

589
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,539
我衣服或者头发上的某处
clothes and/or in my hair.

590
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,747
-帮我抱一下 好么 -哦 好的
-Hold him, would you? -Oh. Here.

591
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:40,202
噢 对的 明智的选择
Ooh. Yeah, smart.

592
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:46,408
哼 这张照得倒很不错 哈
Oh, sure, that one turns out great. Ugh.

593
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,261
然后令一个想法窜了出来
And then another thought popped out

594
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:52,497
这个家伙离当爹还早着呢
That guy's nowhere near being a dad.

595
00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:59,671
喂
Hello?

596
00:27:59,673 --> 00:28:02,858
嘿 维多利亚 我是泰德
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.

597
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,776
额 是这样的 我在想
Um, listen, I was just wondering

598
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:08,013
你愿不愿意出来聊聊 挺久没见了
if you wanted to catch up sometime; it's been a while.

599
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,314
听起来不错
That sounds nice.

600
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:11,950
我下午正好在附近
I'm actually around this afternoon.

601
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:14,953
噢 哇 嗯 真好
Oh, wow, uh, great.

602
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:16,738
要不就两点在麦凯伦酒吧见
MacLaren's at 2:00?

603
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,540
1点半可以么
Is 1.30 okay?

604
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,158
我之后有事
I might have a thing later.

605
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,527
好的 好的 一会儿见
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.

606
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,046
一会儿见
See you then.

607
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:26,915
与此同时 巴尼和奎恩第一次以情侣的身份
Meanwhile, Barney and Quinn were off to Hawaii

608
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,034
踏上了去夏威夷旅途
for their first getaway as a couple.

609
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:31,253
这位女士 我需要你开下箱子
Ma'am, I need you to open your suitcase.

610
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:32,654
这个是我的
It's mine.

611
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:34,923
你连我的行李箱都要换吗
Did you have to replace my luggage, too?

612
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,226
下次再逃的话 你得穿粉红细高跟咯
Run away on me again, you'll be wearing hot pink stilettos.

613
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:40,679
那是什么
What's that?

614
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:41,730
对啊 到底是什么呢
Yeah, what is that?

615
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,565
这是一个魔术
It's a magic trick.

616
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:46,217
听好了 我也算得上一个魔术师
You see, I'm something of a magician.

617
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:47,218
先生 把盒子打开
Open the box, sir.

618
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,604
哦 我不能打开
Oh, I can't do that.

619
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:53,542
先生 这里面有毒品么
Sir, are there drugs in that box?

620
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:55,694
哦 不是的 他叫大概是
Oh, no. He's probably just barking

621
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:56,995
因为有爆炸物吧
because of the explosives.

622
00:28:56,997 --> 00:28:59,331
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

623
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,466
快告诉我们这盒子里装了什么
Tell us what's in the box right now!

624
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,784
我不能
I can't.

625
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:05,187
魔术师守则
Magician's Code.

626
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:10,125
好 我得知道维多利亚到底有没有订婚
Okay, I need to figure out if Victoria ever got engaged.

627
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:14,079
我得瞄一下看她有没有戴订婚戒指
I'll have to very subtly check for an engagement ring.

628
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:18,884
这个吗 左手怎么看不见
Hmm, can't see the left hand.

629
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,625
立刻打开箱子
Open the box now!

630
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,860
不行
I can't.

631
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,111
魔术师守则
Magician's Code.

632
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:32,031
到底什么是魔术师守则
What the hell is the Magician's Code?!

633
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:34,550
魔术师不得透露魔术之密
"A magician never reveals his tricks."

634
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:36,535
法兰纳甘先生 我的魔术导师
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor

635
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:39,205
来自神圣的史坦顿岛大商场的魔术道具店
from the hallowed Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,

636
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:41,574
告诉我这个守则的重要性
taught me the importance of the Code

637
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,742
那是1993年的一个历史性的秋夜
one fateful autumn night in 1993.

638
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:45,618
真不错啊 一边被人用枪指着
Always good to tell a long story while people

639
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:47,164
一边讲故事
are aiming guns at you.

640
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:50,282
那是个改变了我的一生的夜晚
'It was a night which would changed my life...

641
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,254
你好 法兰纳甘先生
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.

642
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,973
你 你在这里做什么
Wh-What are you doing here?

643
00:29:57,975 --> 00:30:01,177
这个 我来看看你
Um... I'm checking up on you.

644
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,480
看看你有没有在好好练习你的技术
Just to make sure you're practicing your craft

645
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:05,731
还有那什么的
or whatever.

646
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:08,350
不胜荣幸 先生
That is an honor, sir.

647
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,986
而且我保证 我在刻苦训练
And yeah, I promise, I'm practicing.

648
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,354
不过等会儿
But wait.

649
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,490
你刚才去我妈妈房间干嘛的
Why were you, why were you going in my mom's room?

650
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:17,693
唔 你老妈现在正帮我完成一个新魔术
Uh... your mom's actually helping me with a new trick.

651
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:19,445
超级酷啊
That is so cool!

652
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:20,646
是什么魔术呢
What is this trick?

653
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:21,997
是把女人锯成两半吗
Is it sawing a lady in half?

654
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,783
唔 不是锯
Well, not sawing.

655
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:25,985
事实上呢
But actually,

656
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:27,286
魔术师守则不准我
the Magician's Code forbids me

657
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:29,988
告诉你这个魔术的任何细节
from telling you anything else about the trick.

658
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,458
韦恩桑 快回床上来
Wayne, come back to bed!

659
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,376
好吧 魔术和床有关
Okay, it involves a bed.

660
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:37,513
等一下 你能至少告诉
W-W-Wait. Can you at least

661
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:39,148
我这个魔术叫什么吧
tell me the name of this trick?

662
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,500
好的 孩子
Sure, kid.

663
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:42,851
它叫
It's called--

664
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,987
消失的意大利香肠
The Disappearing Salami.

665
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,090
在法兰纳甘的老婆射死他之前
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him

666
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:50,993
我们仍未知道那天所听说的魔术是什么
before he could ever tell me what the trick was.

667
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:52,415
好吧 那男人在上你的老妈
Yeah, that guy was banging your mom.

668
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:53,312
是的
Yup.

669
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,446
绝对的
Totally.

670
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,532
法兰纳甘先生没有在上――
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--

671
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,534
额滴神 他还就真的
Oh, my God, he was.

672
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,870
等会儿 你为什么要把你的魔术带到夏威夷呢
Wait, why are you bringing a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?

673
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:05,324
我本来打算抽时间去火奴鲁鲁
I was hoping to shoot up to Honolulu

674
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,293
参加世界魔术大会的
for the Worldwide Magic Convention.

675
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,194
别担心 你不会发现我走了的
Don't worry. You'll never notice I was gone.

676
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,196
也就三天 一天14个小时吧
It's only three 14-hour days.

677
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,881
你是说在这次用来帮助我忘掉
So on our romantic getaway

678
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:15,634
你跑路事件的浪漫旅途中
to help me forget about you skipping town on me,

679
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:17,336
你要继续跑路
you're skipping town on me?!

680
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:20,872
听着奎恩 你对我来说真的很重要
Look Quinn, you're very important to me,

681
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:26,044
但我心里还有一位同样重要的女士
but you're sharing my heart with an equally important Miss.

682
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:29,982
那位
Miss...

683
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,984
方向小姐（女魔术师）
Direction.

684
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,152
这个
What?

685
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,321
怎么(做到的)
How...

686
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:37,072
射了他
Shoot him.

687
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,725
那 你要点些什么
So what did you order?

688
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,111
黑咖啡就可以了
Oh, just black coffee.

689
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,329
我也喜欢这样
I like it that way, too.

690
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,913
对 我觉得这样更好喝
Yeah, it just tastes better to me.

691
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:46,699
我发现如果咖啡豆足够好的话
I find that if the coffee beans are good enough,

692
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,401
真心不需要- 你为什么穿着婚纱
you really don't need-- Why are you in a wedding dress?!

693
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:52,904
嗯 我差不多应该在
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...

694
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:55,624
今天结婚的
get married today.

695
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,242
你所有的朋友和家人现在都在
All your friends and family are waiting for you

696
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:58,427
某个教堂等着你吧
in some church right now?

697
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:02,131
也不是所有人啦 有五个人翘掉了
Well, not all; we had five last-minute no-shows.

698
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:03,582
好吧 六个人
Well... six.

699
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,385
不错啊 泰德
Mazel tov, Ted.

700
00:32:06,387 --> 00:32:08,887
我还以为这再也不可能了呢
I was starting to think this would never happen.

701
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:09,972
哦 不 马德森太太
Oh, no, Mrs. Madsen--

702
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:11,890
我告诉你他是直的了吧
I told you he wasn't gay.

703
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,592
等会儿 说啥呢
Wait, what?

704
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:17,479
去年秋天我差点就为了你离开克劳斯
I was tempted to leave Klaus for you last fall.

705
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:20,816
我唯一的顾虑是罗宾
The only thing holding me back was the Robin of it all.

706
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,935
我知道 而且你是对的 但是那些都已经过去了
I know, and you were right, but... but that's all over now.

707
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:27,406
她搬走了 我是说 我们仍是朋友  但不再纠结了
She moved out-- I mean, we're still friends, but that's over.

708
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:31,226
这些年我从来没有停止想念你  泰德
All these years, I never stopped thinking about you, Ted.

709
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:34,163
我的车在外面
I've got a car outside

710
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:37,800
如果你准备好了一起开向夕阳
if you're ready to drive off into the sunset together.

711
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:42,504
但是如果你对我没有同样的感觉
But if you don't feel the same way,

712
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:45,457
如果你已斩断我们之间的可能
if you've closed the door on us,

713
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,176
只要说出那个词
just say the word...

714
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,727
我自会离开
and I'll go.

715
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:51,597
巴尼  把你的魔术告诉他们
Barney, tell them the trick.

716
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,233
我只能把我的魔术告诉
The only person I could possibly reveal the trick to

717
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:55,267
另一个魔术师
is another magician.

718
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:58,804
那个  我是个魔术师
Well, I'm a magician.

719
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:00,572
空口无凭
Prove it.

720
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,030
喔喔
Whoo-hoo!

721
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,841
这是巴尼的版本
That's Barney's version.

722
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:20,843
奎恩说实际是个简单的纸牌小魔术
Quinn said it was a simple card trick.

723
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:23,512
谁知道哪个版本是真的
Who's to say which version was true?

724
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:25,347
奎恩的  奎恩的版本是真的
Quinn's. Quinn's version was true.

725
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,517
好吧
Okay.

726
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,719
我告诉你
I'll tell you.

727
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:35,524
哇  这真的很酷
Oh, that's really cool.

728
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:38,277
到底诀窍是什么
So what's the trick?

729
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,329
我不能说  魔术师守则
I can't say. Magician's Code.

730
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,181
塔哒
Ta-da...

731
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:45,484
哒哒哒哒哒哒
da-da-da-da-da-da.

732
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:48,404
喂
Hello.

733
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:51,123
你干嘛要我打给维多利亚
Why did you make me call Victoria?

734
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,708
她现在在这儿还穿着婚纱
She's here in a wedding dress.

735
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,043
我马上就要毁掉一个婚礼了
I'm the verge of ruining a wedding!

736
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,412
而且马德森太太的朋友以为我是同性恋
And Mrs. Madsen's friend thinks I'm gay,

737
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:57,996
但是这事儿以后再说
but let's put a pin in that till later.

738
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:00,165
哦天哪  维多利亚和在酒吧  正和泰德在一起
Oh, my God. Victoria's at the bar with Ted.

739
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,667
这事儿只够打个七分
That's a seven.

740
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,302
而且她正穿着婚纱
And she's in a wedding dress.

741
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,220
那就是十分了
That's a ten.

742
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:07,389
我们有个十分事件
We got a ten!

743
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,709
你要怎么办  她在哪里
What are you gonna do? Where is she right now?

744
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:12,177
那这件婚纱  是哪种类型
So this dress, what's the cut?

745
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,263
公主裙(拖地式) 晚礼服(蓬蓬裙) 还是直筒式
Are we talking princess, ball gown, column?

746
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:17,766
对了  因为喜欢婚纱是联邦罪行
Right, 'cause it's a federal crime to love weddings.

747
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,268
她在洗手间  我猜
She's in the bathroom, which I guess

748
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,987
穿着那么个宽大的蓬蓬裙一定要很久
takes forever with that giant poufy skirt thing.

749
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,239
那就是晚礼服  谢谢
Ball gown. Thank you.

750
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,324
四杯龙舌兰
Four shots of tequila.

751
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:26,742
泰德  冷静
Ted, calm down.

752
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,660
或者反过来  这是你得到落跑新娘的机会
Or not. This is your chance to get the one who got away.

753
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:30,195
你想要她  她想要你
You want her, she wants you,

754
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:31,580
还有什么问题
what's the problem?

755
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:34,166
问题就是维多利亚正处在巨大的慌乱之中
The problem is Victoria's in the middle of a giant freak-out.

756
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:36,234
要是她以后后悔了这个决定怎么办
What if she winds up regretting this decision?

757
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:38,253
她追的是泰德莫斯比
She's going after Ted Mosby.

758
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:40,439
这是她这辈子做的最英明的决定
That's the best decision she's ever made.

759
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,257
给你
There you go.

760
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:49,781
哦  你在干啥呢  怎么了
Whoa. What was that? What?

761
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,184
你不是说要张小马文首次出门的照片吗
You said you wanted a picture of Baby Marvin's first outing.

762
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:55,687
我们孩子第一次出门
Our baby's first outing

763
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:56,922
是去一个酒吧
was to a bar.

764
00:34:58,025 --> 00:35:00,726
我把凯尔弗 (龙舌兰的一种)洒在马文的脑瓜上了
I dribble Cuervo on Marv's soft spot.

765
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:01,527
她来了  快
Here she comes! Quick!

766
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:02,928
哦 耶
Oh, yeah.

767
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,262
蛋壳白还是奶油白
Eggshell or cream?

768
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:06,448
到底是蛋壳白还是奶油白
Is it eggshell or cream?

769
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:08,901
那个
So.

770
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:12,488
你  我  开向夕阳
You... me... riding off into the sunset.

771
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,272
有异议吗
Any thoughts?

772
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:16,558
有个问题
One question:

773
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,794
罗斯福大道还是西区高速
FDR or Westside Highway,

774
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,546
哪条路到夕阳最快
what's the quickest way to the sunset?

775
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,302
我说  我还真是总跑到这种地方来啊
Man, I wind up in these rooms a lot.

776
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:30,222
如果我们因为这个错过了夏威夷
If we miss Hawaii because of this, guess who's not doing

777
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:32,457
某人就再也不要演"消失的意大利香肠"了
The Disappearing Salami anytime soon?

778
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:36,228
我需要问你们两人几个问题
I need to ask you both a few questions.

779
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,629
从你开始
Let's start with you.

780
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:38,630
姓名
Name?

781
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:39,898
奎恩・加唯
Quinn Garvey.

782
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,983
职业
Occupation?

783
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,601
无业
Unemployed.

784
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:43,936
瞧瞧  瞧瞧  瞧瞧
Well, well, well.

785
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,237
看看现在谁在掩饰
Look who's keeping secrets now.

786
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,689
先生  我来告诉你她的职业  脱衣舞娘
Sir, I'll tell you her occupation: stripper.

787
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:49,324
她坚持说她为此骄傲
She insists she's proud of it,

788
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:51,810
但是显然没有骄傲到能告诉你的地步
but apparently not proud enough to tell you.

789
00:35:51,812 --> 00:35:55,414
巴尼  我本来打算在我们旅行途中给你惊喜的
Barney, I was going to surprise you with this on our trip,

790
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,933
但是  我辞职了
but... I quit.

791
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,087
你  为我辞的
You... did that for me?

792
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,572
是的
Yes.

793
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:05,958
现在你知道我为你做了什么
And now that you know what I did for you,

794
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,093
还有我有多在乎你
and how much I care for you,

795
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,929
拜托你告诉他魔术的真相吧
would you please show him the trick?

796
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:18,620
抱歉  魔术师守则
Sorry. Magician's Code.

797
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:24,843
我们要去哪儿
Where should we go?

798
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,344
你家
Your place?

799
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:27,512
我家
My place?

800
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:28,847
我们可以继续我的蜜月
We could go on my honeymoon.

801
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,349
开玩笑啦
Just kidding.

802
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,435
其实已经付过钱了
Although, it is paid for.

803
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,205
我知道我们应该去哪儿  哪儿
I know where we should go. Where?

804
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,991
你的婚礼
Your wedding.

805
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,192
我把你送回去
I'm taking you back.

806
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,289
我不明白
I don't understand.

807
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,590
我以为这是你想要的
I thought you wanted this.

808
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:52,958
我是想要这样
I do want this.

809
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,811
我时常想起你
I've thought about you so many times.

810
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,397
想起可能发生的那些事
What might have been...

811
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,466
但后来我在圣坛上被甩了 那心痛的感觉简直要人命
But I got left at the altar, and it nearly killed me.

812
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,270
你现在是别人的未婚妻
You're someone's fiancé,

813
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,105
我应当尊重这个事实
and I have to respect that.

814
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,774
这样吧 咱们找个汽车旅馆 打个快炮
So let's hit a motel, jam in a quickie,

815
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:09,808
然后把你送回你的婚礼
and get you back to your wedding.

816
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,078
这才是对的
It's the right thing to do.

817
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:16,031
我确实有一点点想听你说
Some part of me needed to hear you say

818
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,000
不要和你私奔
that running away together wasn't an option.

819
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,536
而现在我明白了
And now that I know that...

820
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,755
就好像刚醒酒了一样
it's like I'm sobering up.

821
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:26,876
有没有可能
Is there any way

822
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,428
我们假装这一切都没有发生过
that we can just pretend this never happened?

823
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,731
这一切没有发生过
This never happened.

824
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,840
法兰纳甘先生没有上我的老妈
Mr. Flanagan wasn't banging my mom.

825
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,842
好吧
Well.

826
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,644
你的航班起飞了
Your flight left.

827
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:48,981
我们要扣留斯丁森先生进行进一步问讯
We need to hold Mr. Stinson for further questioning.

828
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,515
但你可以走了
But you're free to go.

829
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,254
也许我真的该走了
Maybe I should.

830
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:58,741
等等
Wait!

831
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:00,993
我把魔术表演给你们看
I'll show you the trick.

832
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,866
先生
Sir!

833
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,501
能把那块丝绸手帕
May I please have the silk handkerchief

834
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:10,836
从你左胸的衣兜里拿出来吗
in your top left breast pocket?

835
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:13,005
呃  我没有
Well... I don't have...

836
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:29,721
天灵灵  地灵灵
Sim salabi ma... sim salabi ma...

837
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:33,993
放轻松点 没事儿 这是魔术的一部分
Relax, relax, it's part of the trick.

838
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,744
你怎么揣着它通过X光机的
How did you get that through the X-Ray machine?

839
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,529
不接受观众提问 谢谢
No questions from the audience, please!

840
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:52,344
那是什么
What is that?

841
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,512
这位女士
Madam, may I please have

842
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:57,182
噢
Oh!

843
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,891
那玩意是要爆炸吗
Is that gonna explode?

844
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,259
什么
What?

845
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,815
咳咳
Ahem.

846
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:17,319
啥
What?

847
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,129
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

848
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,066
我愿意
Yes.

849
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,273
快点 伙计们
Come on, guys.

850
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:55,410
待会儿外面就天黑了
We're losing the light

851
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,226
宝宝的第二次首次出门照就拍不了了
for Baby's Second First Outing.

852
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,255
虽然我不想承认 但罗宾干的太棒了
I hate to say it, but Robin nailed it.

853
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,827
-嘿 -伙计们 我们要宣布一件事
Hey. Guys, we've got something to tell you.

854
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,546
八分或者更高 兄弟
Eight or higher, bro.

855
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,048
我们订婚了
We're engaged.

856
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,800
那可是...十分
That's a... that's a ten.

857
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:23,802
又来一个十分的
We got another ten!

858
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:25,471
喔...真是个大日子啊
Oh... Wow, big day!

859
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,890
-恭喜你们 -谢谢
-Congratulations!- Thank you.

860
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,674
这怎么发生的
How did this happen?

861
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:31,894
喔...魔法
Oh... magic.

862
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,396
喔
Oh.

863
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,781
我不想破坏气氛
Uh, not to ruin the moment,

864
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:39,068
不过显然小马文也被这个消息震惊了
but apparently little Marvin is quite stunned by the news.

865
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,537
呃
Well...

866
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,871
-好吧 -喔啊 -S啊
Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

867
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,040
你们俩想对着这个尿布小神
Do you guys mind recounting this romantic tale

868
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,458
讲讲你们的爱情故事吗
next to a Diaper Genie?

869
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,530
喔 马文 这会是你听到的第一个爱情故事
Oh, Marvin, you're about to hear your first love story!

870
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,864
很久以前
Once upon a time,

871
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:56,085
有个恶心变态的魔法师上了巴尼的妈妈
this creepy magic dude was boning Barney's mom...

872
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,425
这是我们最后一次私奔的机会了
It's our last chance to run away together.

873
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,476
门就在那儿
Door's right there.

874
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,095
是的 我们会开始一段新生活
Yes, we'll start a new life.

875
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,563
-冲向国境 -加拿大
Head for the border! Canada!

876
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,515
呃 去墨西哥 加拿大算个屁
Eh, Mexico. Canada sucks.

877
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,316
好吧 你知道的 你是四分之一的加佬
Okay, well, you're one-quarter Canadian,

878
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:13,152
依此逻辑 你就是个四分之一个屁
so by that logic you one-quarter suck.

879
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:14,520
哥百分百的牛逼
I'm 100% awesome

880
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,021
你懂的
and you know it.

881
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:18,490
是的 没错
Yeah, I do.

882
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,998
听着 我希望 我们之间不要尴尬或者怎么样 因为
Look, I-I hope this isn't weird, or anything, because...

883
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,866
巴尼
Barney...

884
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,369
我 我真心为你高兴
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

885
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,204
真的
Really?

886
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:33,872
? 我侧耳倾听 ?
? I listen to the wind ?

887
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:34,757
真的
Really.

888
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,409
? 来自心之谷风声 ?
? To the wind of my soul ?

889
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:40,745
? 只有上天知道  ?
? Where I'll end up well I think ?

890
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:44,650
? 我未来的旅程 ?
? Only God really knows ?

891
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,805
? 我坐在 ?
? I've sat upon ?

892
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,306
? 夕阳之上 ?
? The setting sun ?

893
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,109
? 但永远永远永远 ?
? But never never never... ?

894
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,278
你刚刚开过了教堂
You just drove right by the church.

895
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,096
我知道
I know.

896
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,099
? 我永远不会感到焦灼 ?
? I never wanted water once ?

897
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,369
? 不 永远永远不会 ?
? No, never, never, never ?

898
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:13,829
? 我倾听我的心声 ?
? I listen to my words ?

899
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,365
? 而它们却离我而去 ?
? But they fall far below ?

900
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,834
看看我们走过的路
The road to this day has had

901
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,452
还真是兜兜转转啊 是吧
a few twists and turns, hasn't it?

902
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,387
对 其实也还好啦
Yeah. Just a few.

903
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:23,922
? 我心之所向 ?
? My heart wants to go ?

904
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:26,508
奇怪的是 这一切也在情理之中 是吧
In a weird way, it all makes sense, though, doesn't it?

905
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,560
嗯
Yeah.

906
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:29,845
是啊 还真没错
