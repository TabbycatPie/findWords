13
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,860
My name is Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,200
After five years in hell,

15
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,430
I have come home with only one goal--

16
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,640
to save my city.

17
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,720
Now others have joined my crusade.

18
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,910
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

19
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,100
To the rest of Starling City,

20
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,430
I am someone else.

21
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,750
I am something else.

22
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,840
Previously, on "Arrow"...

23
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm going to find whoever did this.

25
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,560
There's something about Malcolm that both you

26
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,130
and Oliver need to know. Malcolm is--

27
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,030
I don't want to hurt, or get hurt,

28
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,490
and you seem like someone who could teach me how not to.

29
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,680
You are my family. I need you.

30
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,730
Looks like you're going home.

31
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,030
Did Thea seem... different to you?

32
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,440
Where is she?

33
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,170
Where is Sara?

34
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,620
She came here for the League two weeks ago.

35
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,080
We've not heard from her since.

36
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,590
There's something I have to tell you.

37
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,800
Sara's dead?

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm so sorry.

39
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,560
It was an arrow, wasn't it?

40
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,920
How do you know that?

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,280
- Where's her body? - Nyssa...

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,410
Where?

43
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,650
We buried her in her grave from seven years ago.

44
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,290
She knows something.

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,900
I want you to follow her, but be careful.

46
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,250
I have to meet Thea.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,540
Sorry I'm late.

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,390
Late is your "On time," Ollie.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,900
So much for my promise that things would be different, right?

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,670
Relax, it's fine.

51
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,810
Dinner is on me.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,270
With what money?

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,770
Aren't you broke?

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,200
Um...Aren't you?

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,030
Not so much, actually.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,710
When I decided to come back,

57
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,490
I had no idea what I wanted to do,

58
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,160
and realized I kind of missed the club.

59
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,340
And turns out, a lot of other people do, too.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,530
I have investors.

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,880
And they're going to help me buy back the foundry

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,250
from Queen Consolidated.

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm thrilled for you, that's fantastic.

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,780
You seem changed.

65
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,230
Stronger.

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,020
After last year, I...

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,200
don't see any other way it could have turned out.

68
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,330
And that's it?

69
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,360
You're not... seeing someone, or...

70
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,570
Hoping Roy didn't put you up to asking that.

71
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,090
No. I'm just trying to figure out why you're so different.

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,450
How about just being my big brother instead?

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,720
Ok.

74
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,850
Target's on the move. He's headed north.

75
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,890
He's stopped.

76
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,110
What's he doing?

77
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,950
He's buying ice cream.

78
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,350
He doesn't look like a terrorist.

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,330
The best ones never do.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,650
Why does Waller want me to take this guy out?

81
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,030
You ask too many questions.

82
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,870
Follow orders and eliminate the target.

83
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,550
Or is this one your best friend, too?

84
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,340
Oh, so I'm just a gun that she can point at things

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,290
she doesn't like?

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,340
That's exactly what you are.

87
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,300
He's moving.

88
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,050
Best not to waste time, then.

90
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,580
Nyssa.

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,030
You have my condolences.

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,800
And that of my father, Ra's Al Ghul.

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,020
I don't want your condolences.

96
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,500
And I definitely don't want your father's.

97
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,570
She died with arrows in her chest.

98
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,330
Do you think that would have happened

99
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,660
if she hadn't met you?

100
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,820
You were the one that showed her the darkness inside.

101
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,780
You, and your father.

102
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,310
I know you grieve.

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
But so do I.

104
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,850
I didn't show Sara the darkness, Laurel.

105
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,710
It was already inside of her when we met.

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,480
When I found her, alone,

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
starving and terrified, I protected her.

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,310
I took Sara into my heart

109
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,640
and I loved her with all of my soul.

110
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,460
And that jacket...

111
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,860
I gave it to Sara as a gift.

112
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,020
You are not fit to wear it.

113
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,170
She's moving.

114
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,650
- Where? - She went to visit Sara's grave

115
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,120
and now she's on the top floor of some dump on Amsterdam.

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,890
Could be where she's crashing.

117
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,460
League of Assassins safe house or something.

118
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,790
Text me the address.

119
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,980
Are you ready to talk?

120
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,080
We have nothing to discuss.

121
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,970
The trail for Sara's killer has gone cold.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,170
And I could use your help.

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,840
Whereas I don't need yours.

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,570
Really?

125
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,970
We've gathered evidence, we're working leads.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,110
You're visiting cemeteries

127
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,900
and hiding in League safe houses.

128
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,520
I am not hiding.

129
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,930
And this is not my safe house.

130
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,340
It was Sara's while she was in Starling.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
These were her favorites.

132
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,700
Ok.

133
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,560
You said Sara was in Starling for the League.

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,810
That suggests her target is also her killer.

135
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,930
Agreed. Except it wasn't her target.

136
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,720
Sara came to Starling to confirm rumors--

137
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,730
- whispers, really, that an enemy of the League was here. - Who?

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,640
Malcolm Merlyn.

139
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,800
He's alive.

140
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,810
Merlyn was a member of the League of Assassins.

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,330
My father released him from his obligation to us

142
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,240
with the understanding he would abide by its code of conduct.

143
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,320
You guys are professional killers.

144
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,340
That is a pretty low bar.

145
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,830
Merlyn's undertaking

146
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,090
violated the League's principles.

147
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,060
When you killed him, we considered the matter settled.

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,190
But then we receive word from a reliable source that Merlyn faked his demise.

149
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,110
- What source? - Oliver's mother.

150
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, well, Oliver's mom wasn't exactly known for her honesty.

151
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,380
No offense, I just can't believe that a guy everyone thinks was dead

152
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,060
suddenly isn't.

153
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,480
Neither did I.

154
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,980
Then we found these.

156
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,350
Sara took them two weeks ago.

157
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,430
Didn't the police, you know, find his body?

158
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,460
Merlyn had resources all over Starling.

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm willing to bet one of them was in the coroner's office.

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Since learning Merlyn was alive,

161
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,500
the League has hunted him all over the globe.

162
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,620
Running down every rumor, following every whisper.

163
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,080
And one of those whispers put Merlyn back in Starling.

164
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,420
She tracked him here.

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,460
We are going to retrace her steps.

166
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,140
You said you found evidence on her person?

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,570
Yeah, Roy.

168
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,440
We found a blank piece of paper in Sara's boot,

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,990
but why would she be carrying a blank piece of paper?

170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,510
Do you have a flame?

171
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,400
Unbelievable.

172
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,910
My father had a notebook with hidden writing just like this.

173
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,280
The notebook he received from Merlyn, I imagine.

174
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,640
This is ghost ink.

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,040
One of the means the League employs for concealing secrets.

176
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,320
It's Sara's handwriting.

177
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,410
Notes from her surveillance of Merlyn.

178
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,260
Oliver, there's not much to go on here.

179
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,390
There's a couple of things.

181
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,520
Jansen, question mark.

183
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,080
Dad help, question mark.

184
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,400
Sara reached out to Lance.

185
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,530
If Lance knew Merlyn was alive,

186
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,480
don't you think he would have told you?

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,790
Only if she told him.

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,400
What matters is what he told her.

189
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,140
And how do we find that out?

191
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,170
So, gentlemen, word of advice,

192
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,610
next time you arrest a bookie,

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,660
please make sure the chief is not one of his clients.

194
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,830
Now, that's what the chief told me to tell you, ok,

195
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,780
but as far as I'm concerned,

196
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,140
you just keep doing your jobs.

197
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,260
First round tonight's on me. Please, get out of here.

198
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,580
- Buying rounds? -Buying love.

199
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,020
The fastest way to a cop's heart is through his liver.

200
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,340
How you feeling?

201
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,020
- I’m fine. Do you have a minute? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,450
I have to talk to you. It's about Sara.

203
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,680
She,

204
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,280
she called me.

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
She said that she was looking into something.

206
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,770
Something called Jansen?

207
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,410
Yeah, someone.

208
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,340
Ken Zhi Jansen.

209
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,690
I hooked her up with his last known address.

210
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,940
Sara was here.

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
She asked me not to say anything to you,

212
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,420
and I should have.

213
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,010
Maybe I should have, I'm sorry.

214
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,540
It's ok. She was--

215
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,310
she's in a mysterious line of work.

216
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,960
Oh, yeah. One I hope you're not getting mixed up with.

217
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,380
No. I'm just doing Sara a favor.

218
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,690
And her?

219
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,220
I'll be right back.

220
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,320
What are you doing here?

221
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,060
Oliver told me of his plan to involve you

222
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,480
in the hunt for Sara's killer.

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,830
I have a handle on it.

224
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,990
Your father doesn't know, does he?

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No. He doesn't.

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,980
And he can't. He has a heart condition.

227
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,240
He has the right to avenge his daughter.

228
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,520
That is none of your business.

229
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,340
Sara was everything I hold dear in this life,

230
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,850
which is every bit of my business.

231
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,990
And what would she say if she was here now?

232
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,550
Hey. I almost didn't recognize you

233
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,160
without your Halloween costume.

234
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,190
Is Sara back in town, too?

235
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,490
No, she is not.

236
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,150
But she told me to tell you

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,330
that she misses you very much.

238
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,300
The address I gave your sister for Jansen.

239
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,480
Now she promised me there wouldn't be any,

240
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,930
you know, assassinating.

241
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,180
Is that still the case?

242
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,720
I assure you, Mr. Lance,

243
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,000
the only objective here is justice.

244
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,280
This was the next lead Sara was going to follow?

245
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,280
Jansen's a buddhist monk.

246
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
Nine years ago, he was facing deportation in China.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Merlyn bankrolled his defense.

248
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,830
And Jansen returns the favor

249
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,640
by giving Merlyn asylum in his garden.

250
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
Monastery.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,480
We should divide our forces, take our flanking positions.

252
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,010
I agree, but not--

253
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,160
Never understood what Sara saw in her in the first place.

254
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Split up, but be careful.

255
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,750
Copy that.

256
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,350
Oliver, we found Jansen.

257
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,860
Negative.

258
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,560
I have eyes on him.

259
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,760
Whoever's up there is not Jansen.

261
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,310
Jansen sensei, I am Nyssa,

262
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,780
daughter of Ra's Al Ghul. Heir to the demon.

263
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,350
You will tell me

264
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,660
where I can find Malcolm Merlyn

265
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,990
or I will kill you where you sit.

266
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,120
Hello, Nyssa.

267
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,110
Where is he?!

268
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,540
What's going on?

269
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,210
Did you find Sara's killer?

270
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,650
We have a suspect.

271
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,430
Malcolm Merlyn's alive.

272
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,370
Sara was here looking for him.

273
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,240
We think he found her first.

274
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
And where is he now?

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
We're working on that.

276
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,130
He got away from us earlier tonight.

277
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,360
But not before

278
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,550
I hit him with an arrow laced with particulate nanotechnology.

279
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Felicity wrote a program that tracks the nanites using GPS.

280
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,350
- The tracer arrow. - Yeah.

281
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
You had a shot at Merlyn and you didn't kill him?

282
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,220
I tagged him.

283
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,580
With a flesh wound!

284
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,070
He's marked.

285
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,720
There's nowhere in the world he can go where I can't find him.

286
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,870
And when you do?

287
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,640
I'm not a killer anymore, Laurel.

288
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,030
Merlyn is.

289
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,750
He killed Tommy and 502 other innocent people.

290
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,410
How many more people are going to have to die before you put him down?

291
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,470
Do you think that's what your sister would want?

292
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,470
Yes. I do.

293
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,090
Let me speak with her.

294
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,570
Merlyn may try to contact Thea.

295
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,290
I'm on it.

296
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,760
The tracer arrow program...

297
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,420
You have Felicity monitoring remote from Central City?

298
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,700
No, she told me an idiot could run it.

299
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,120
I will try very hard not to take that personally.

300
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,610
I'll be on the streets.

301
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,080
Talk me in when you have his location.

302
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,070
Copy that.

303
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,010
It's done.

304
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,430
Laurel.

305
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,760
I just found out that Malcolm Merlyn isn't only alive,

306
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,650
but that he killed my sister.

307
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm sure you can understand why I don't want to talk right now.

308
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,460
I understand.

309
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,940
I loved her, too.

310
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,300
Sorry for your loss.

311
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,820
I promise Sara,

312
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,380
and I promise you--

313
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,420
we will find Malcolm Merlyn.

314
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,300
Apparently you already did.

315
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,870
- And Oliver should have killed him. - Yes.

316
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,630
If Oliver catches up with Merlyn,

317
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,880
he's going to let him live or let him go.

318
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,910
You can't let that happen.

319
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,470
You need to get Merlyn.

320
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,660
You have to do whatever it takes.

322
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,210
Grand reopening's not for another three weeks.

323
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,400
Well, looks like you've still got a lot more work to do.

324
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,940
Need some help?

325
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,050
Thanks. But don't really think that's a good idea.

326
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,890
No. Just as friends.

327
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,760
And former co-workers.

328
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Bonsai green, October mist,

329
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,270
or avocado?

330
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,520
Merlyn stopped. I've got his position.

331
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,250
Go.

332
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,480
Air conditioner factory, eightieth and Nelson.

333
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,050
You want me to share this with Nyssa?

334
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,110
No. She's liable to put an arrow in him before I get any answers.

335
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,510
Agreed.

336
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,810
This place is empty.

337
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,360
He's not here, Diggle.

338
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,690
Hello, Oliver.

339
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
You're absolutely right.

340
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,070
I'm not at the-- what is it, the air conditioning factory?

341
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,210
It's a very neat trick you have,

342
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,600
but I'm sorry it didn't work out.

343
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,950
When I find you...

344
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,460
You absolutely will.

345
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,320
We need to talk.

346
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,840
But I prefer a venue less conducive to conflict.

347
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,360
Nelson Plaza at Coldwater and fifth, bottom of the stairs.

348
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,260
It's a very public place;

349
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,300
You'll want to leave your mask behind.

350
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,610
I think this should remain between the two of us,

351
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,910
so if I even see one of your associates,

352
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,740
I promise you, you will not see me.

353
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,790
Hello, Oliver! How are you?

354
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,940
You've accomplished a lot with this city, I see.

355
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,060
I'm not here to discuss Starling.

356
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,070
You think I killed Sara Lance.

357
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,800
How else would you know she's dead?

358
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,150
These streets were mine long before you laid claim to them.

359
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,010
This is still my city.

360
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,060
I chose this place because of the crowds.

361
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,230
Besides, I understand you're not killing people these days.

362
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,430
Seriously considering making an exception.

363
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,820
Ra's Al Ghul has placed a blood bounty on my head.

364
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,790
Why would I try to get it

365
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,160
lifted by killing the love of his daughter's life?

366
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,410
It's illogical!

367
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,010
Sara comes back to Starling.

368
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,820
You come back to Starling. Sara's murdered.

369
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,430
I came back for the simplest and most noble of reasons--

370
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,560
Thea.

371
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,270
Six months ago, during the siege,

372
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,720
she was almost killed by one of --

373
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,480
one of Slade Wilson's Mirakuru soldiers. I protected her!

374
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,720
You're lying.

375
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,020
Thea made it out before the attack.

376
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,660
Unfortunately, she didn't make it out.

377
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,930
But you wouldn't know that, because you were out being--

378
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,810
what are you calling yourself these days? "The Arrow."

379
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,460
That was the night I realized that Thea needs me!

380
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,090
Stay away from her.

381
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,710
Don't worry. I've kept my distance.

382
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,070
But the world is a dangerous place.

383
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,450
And you're too distracted to protect her.

384
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,880
- You're a killer. - Yes, I am.

385
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,380
But I swear.

386
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,870
I swear to you on Thea's life...

387
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,030
I am not Sara Lance's killer.

388
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,000
From the look on your face,

389
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,830
you need something stronger than coffee.

390
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,880
You ok?

391
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah, are you?

392
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
Back in Corto Maltese,

393
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,070
I promised you there would be no more secrets.

394
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,280
No more lies. And I'm trying to honor that.

395
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,370
Ok...

396
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,000
I learned something last night

397
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,200
that's going to be difficult for you to hear.

398
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,000
I think that it's what mom was trying to tell us

399
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,180
the night she died, right before...

400
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,150
The night of the siege, you were at the train station.

401
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,380
Yeah. I... it wasn't fun.

402
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,520
I got attacked by one of those crazy masked things

403
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,270
and he tried to strangle me.

404
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,220
But he got shot by a cop, I think.

405
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,360
Did you see him?

406
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,180
No.

407
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,370
Why are you asking?

408
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,790
It wasn't a cop, Thea.

409
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,640
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

410
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,440
He's dead.

411
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,760
How do you know this?

412
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,710
One of Sara's friends saw him.

413
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,220
She's sure.

414
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,030
If he was going to try to contact you,

415
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,050
he would have done it by now. Ok?

416
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,600
Thank you.

417
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,450
For telling me.

418
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,380
It's one of my investors. I--

419
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,910
Are you ok?

420
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,400
Yeah. I'm--

421
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm fine. I--

422
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,970
It's like you said, if he was going to contact me,

423
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,950
he probably would have done it by now.

424
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,140
Where's Oliver?

425
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,090
Out, taking care of some family business.

426
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,990
As if there weren't more pressing matters at hand.

427
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,110
He's not doing nothing.

428
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,890
He tracked down Merlyn last night.

429
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,560
Did he kill him?

430
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,230
No.

431
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,870
He swore to me he didn't kill Sara.

432
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,810
And you know all of his words are lies.

433
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,000
I believe him.

434
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,290
Because he swore to me on his daughter's life.

435
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,930
We had heard rumors Merlyn fathered another child.

436
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,020
We couldn't confirm them.

437
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,590
You know who it is.

438
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,630
I do.

439
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,440
If you put me through the effort of finding out on my own...

440
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,810
I might have to exact a price

441
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,700
from whoever it is you're protecting.

442
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,580
It's Thea. My sister is Merlyn's daughter.

443
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,360
And that is the reason he came back to Starling City.

444
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,780
Because she did.

445
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,470
He's protecting her.

446
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,740
And that is why you spared Merlyn. Twice!

447
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,700
It had nothing to do with that.

448
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,150
He explained to me-- in his own twisted way--

449
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,890
that he loves her.

450
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,430
And then he swore to me on her life.

451
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,170
And I swore an oath of my own

452
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,110
that I would see Sara's killer brought to justice.

453
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,400
Nyssa... Nyssa!

454
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,540
Oliver, wait.

455
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,680
- We need to stop her! - Do we?

456
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,790
Listen, I understand why you can't kill Merlyn,

457
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,020
all of the reasons.

458
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,240
Maybe he killed Sara, maybe he didn't.

459
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,900
- He didn't. - Either way!

460
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,170
The world is a better place without Malcolm Merlyn in it.

461
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,580
You made a vow not to kill.

462
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,890
Nyssa didn't.

463
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,160
Where's your wife?

464
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,380
Tatsu? She needed to be someplace else.

465
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,870
She doesn't like me.

466
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,180
You're wrong. She hates you.

467
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,480
She's not happy that I'm here.

468
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,240
Neither am I.

469
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,800
I killed a man today.

470
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
I don't even know the reason.

471
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,320
Sometimes it's better that way.

472
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,080
What, blindly following orders is better?

473
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,530
I'm not blind, Oliver. I'm focused--

474
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,350
On what's most important.

475
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,140
You should do the same.

476
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,190
It's not our place or our burden

477
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,660
to know why we carry out our missions.

478
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,450
I didn't realize having a conscience was a burden.

479
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,490
What are you playing?

480
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,940
A reading game.

481
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,900
Oh, yeah? Do you mind if I try?

482
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,670
I want to work on my Cantonese.

483
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,060
My dad said I shouldn't let you use my computer.

484
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,090
Ok.

485
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,140
Why don't we make a deal, then?

486
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,530
You don't have anything. You're a bum.

487
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,350
Well, this bum has something that you don't have.

488
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,120
Height.

489
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,700
You know that candy that your parents keep in the cupboard above the fridge?

490
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll swipe you two pieces.

491
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,490
- Five. - Three.

492
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,810
- Five. - Fine, five.

493
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,070
Give me the computer.

494
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,450
I need a meet with Waller.

495
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,860
How did you--Akio!

496
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,880
It's not his fault.

497
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
I need a meet. Make it happen.

498
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,420
Waller's going to want a reason.

499
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,790
Ferris Air flight 637.

500
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,460
She'll know what I mean.

502
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,550
Thanks for your help. I mean,

503
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,070
you really didn't have to do all that.

504
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,290
I like painting.

505
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,520
It actually helps me turn my brain off.

506
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,090
It's just kinda zen.

507
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,200
You know, I actually wish you were

508
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,430
still trying to get into my pants,

509
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,790
because this whole zen helpful Roy thing is

510
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,730
really freaking me out.

511
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,460
Get away from him.

512
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,980
I'm not here for him.

513
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,390
Thea...

514
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,560
Thea?

515
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,020
Thea, are you here?

516
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,110
So Malcolm Merlyn is alive,

517
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,330
and Thea's father.

518
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,020
Anything else you haven't told me?

519
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,360
What did you get at the precinct?

520
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,400
Not much.

521
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,530
But I did get this off a traffic camera.

522
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,450
It was recorded 10 minutes ago.

523
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,640
After I struck out on anything related to Nyssa or Thea,

524
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,990
I just looked for strange.

525
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,120
Well, that definitely counts.

526
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,750
Sara.

527
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,500
She never said much about the League.

528
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,370
But she did say that their communication system

529
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,600
was a little outdated.

530
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,410
Smoke signal.

531
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,950
Nyssa's sending Malcolm a message.

532
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,860
I don't know about the cipher,

533
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,060
but I'm willing to bet my wallet

534
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,380
that means "we got your daughter."

535
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,070
Doesn't matter.

536
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,770
Video gives me her location.

537
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,430
You mean "us" on location, right?

538
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,040
No. I need you to secure the perimeter.

539
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,310
- Can't risk Thea seeing you. - Copy that.

540
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,320
She already knows I know about the Arrow.

541
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,530
Not with a dose of league tranquilizer in your system.

542
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,080
Oliver. This is my fault.

543
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,080
I told Nyssa to go after Merlyn.

544
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,880
I told her to do whatever it takes.

545
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,730
It's ok.

546
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,380
I know you're not a killer.

547
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,640
But he is.

548
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,870
Whatever else he means to you or to Thea...

549
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,760
Know that.

550
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,140
I'm going to get free of this,

551
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,380
and when I do, I'm going to kill you!

552
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,750
I apologize for involving you in this.

553
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,790
My quarrel is with your father.

554
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,960
My father's been dead for years, you crazy psycho bitch.

555
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,430
Not Robert Queen. Your true father--

556
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,870
Al Sa-her. "The magician."

557
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,950
Known to the uninitiated as Malcolm Merlyn.

558
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,270
Then you know what he's going to do to you

559
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,450
when he gets here.

560
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,650
I know he'll die.

561
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,080
My father taught me ways to cut a man

562
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,950
to make his death last for days.

563
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,650
Sounds like father of the year.

564
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,310
My father may be the demon...

565
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,820
but yours is the devil.

566
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,450
Run!

567
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,990
Apparently we both handle grief differently.

568
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,350
There's a misunderstanding

569
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,240
the three of us need to clear up.

570
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,260
A conversation I am eager to have...

571
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,390
over your rotting corpse.

572
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,910
Do it, Oliver.

573
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,960
He killed Sara.

574
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,900
Tommy.

575
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,570
He will corrupt your sister.

576
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,850
There is blood on my hands.

577
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,550
Almost too much to contemplate.

578
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,630
But none of it is Sara's.

579
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,760
Kill him!

580
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,740
I did not kill your beloved!

581
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,550
Your father doubted Sara's loyalties

582
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,630
the moment you brought her home.

583
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,870
You know your father.

584
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,500
What he is capable of.

585
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,290
He will kill without hesitation.

586
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,360
Do you really need me to tell you

587
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,830
what he would do to the degenerate

588
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,860
who would steal his daughter's heart?

589
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,300
Nyssa doesn't believe me, Oliver.

590
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,900
If you don't believe me...

591
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,120
listen to her.

592
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,800
Kill me.

593
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,250
You may not have killed Sara...

594
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,110
but you're still a murderer.

595
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,580
What are you going to do?

596
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,240
Arrest me?

597
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,560
I could have SCPD here

598
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,060
in three minutes.

599
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,540
And in half that time, I will escape

600
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,100
from whatever prison they put me in.

601
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,980
You know that, so does she.

602
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,770
We were trained by the league,

603
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,560
no prison can hold us!

604
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,370
Not even your one on Lian Yu.

605
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,870
Which leaves you with only

606
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,840
one option.

607
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,330
To break your vows...

608
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,380
and kill me.

609
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,580
Kill your sister's father.

610
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,430
Is Thea ok?

611
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,940
I just spoke to her. She's fine.

612
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,430
Doesn't know who took her or why.

613
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,030
I may have deserved that.

614
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,700
He deserve worse.

615
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,820
What's going on?

616
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,500
Merlyn didn't kill Sara.

617
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,840
Which means whoever did is still out there.

618
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,570
You're a fool

619
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,560
who insults the memory of a woman he once loved.

620
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,270
I will honor Sara's memory by finding and punishing

621
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,130
the person who did this.

622
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,580
The real person.

623
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,210
Nyssa.

624
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,130
So as long as Malcolm Merlyn is in my city,

625
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,170
the league will make no move on him.

626
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,150
He's under my protection.

627
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,060
You would incur the wrath of the League of Assassins?

628
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,290
I would do...

629
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,650
what I have to

630
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,060
in order to buy the time necessary

631
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,360
to find out what really happened with Sara.

632
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,230
You have made an enemy tonight.

633
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,330
One with a long memory.

634
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,790
Oliver.

635
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,090
Are you sure?

636
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,760
If I wasn't sure, I never would have let him go.

637
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,510
I promise.

638
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,690
What did I miss?

639
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,090
I hate Hong Kong.

640
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,070
And I hate transpacific flights.

641
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,490
And do not even get me started on the topic

642
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,910
of being summoned by one of my operatives.

643
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,000
Ferris Air Flight 637.

644
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,980
Paris to Hong Kong nonstop.

645
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,500
You prevented that flight from being shot down over Lian Yu.

646
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,540
Were you watching me?!

647
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,690
Via Keyhole Hexagon Satellite.

648
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,040
How else was I supposed to know you

649
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,480
possess the capabilities I require?

650
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,980
That business with the freighter last year...

651
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,160
impressive.

652
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,090
Are we done?

653
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,310
Just getting started, actually.

654
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,180
Adam Castwidth

655
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,890
the man you had me murder.

656
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,380
He was Edward Fyers' handler.

657
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,950
And he worked for you.

658
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,680
You're out of your depth, Mr. Queen!

659
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,020
I don't think I am.

660
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,860
I think Mr.Castwidth had a USB drive

661
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,310
on him detailing everything.

662
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,190
I think he knew that you told Fyers to shoot the plane down.

663
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,970
And I think that you wanted him silenced!

664
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,800
And the world thinks you dead, Mr. Queen.

665
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,170
The convenient thing about dead men

666
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,070
is that no one tends to believe them.

667
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,690
Yeah, well, what about dead men who make arrangements

668
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,860
to get the information on that USB drive

669
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,460
in the hands of every blogger

670
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,130
and journalist in this hemisphere.

671
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,550
If anything happens to Maseo's family,

672
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,720
then you're going to spend a long time

673
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,850
testifying in front of the senate sub-committee.

674
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,920
The world's a much more complicated place

675
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,360
than you realize.

676
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,270
Edward Fyers thought he was to shoot down that plane

677
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,730
to destabilize the Chinese economy.

678
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,380
In truth, I wanted to take out a single target.

679
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,060
So you blow up a plane full of innocent people

680
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,380
to take out one man.

681
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,510
No.

682
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,820
To take out one woman.

683
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,700
Chien Na Wei.

684
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,710
Two years ago, we had our only chance at her.

685
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,640
And you saved her life.

686
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,790
And now she's in Hong Kong.

687
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,810
I need to know why.

688
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,680
I thought you were going back to your father.

689
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,730
I thought I owed you a good-bye.

690
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,760
I intend to make good on my promise to Sara.

691
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,420
And to you.

692
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,040
It kills me that he's still out there.

693
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,200
Merlyn.

694
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,890
Someone.

695
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,830
It kills me.

696
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,630
It pains me as well.

697
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,920
I see you've been training...

698
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,020
and wearing the jacket.

699
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,050
If you're going to stand there

700
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,810
and tell me I'm not strong enough or tough enough, please...

701
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,320
Don't.

702
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,090
Back at the cemetery, I would have.

703
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,090
But since, you've reminded me that

704
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,670
the strongest metal is forged in the hottest fire.

705
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,430
And what's that supposed to mean?

706
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,570
Don't forget to turn your hips.

707
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,000
It's where the power comes from.

709
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,450
It's Sara. Leave a message.

710
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,820
Sara. Sweetie, it's, uh, it's me.

711
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,610
Look, I know you said only call this number in an emergency.

712
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,210
And it's not. It's not. Everything's fine.

713
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,620
But I--I just...

714
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,140
I just want to hear your voice.

715
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,750
Look, I know wherever you are, you're looking after yourself.

716
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,950
But, you know, that doesn't mean I don't worry.

717
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,390
So, you know, you don't have to call me back or anything,

718
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,670
just, I just want you to remember--

719
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,440
that I love you.

721
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,500
Are you OK?

722
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,810
It's not my first time being kidnapped.

723
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,960
That's not what I meant.

724
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,270
I never imagined you and scrubbing.

725
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,680
Unless a spa treatment was involved.

726
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,450
I spoke to Detective Lance.

727
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,270
He doesn't think that woman's going to bother you again.

728
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,800
Why did she come after me in the first place?

729
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,970
Maybe she thought the Queens still had money.

730
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,900
I wish.

731
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,860
But thank you for checking in on me.

732
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,620
I'm always going to watch out for you.

733
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,360
Always.

734
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,810
Sorry, guys, I didn't mean to interrupt.

735
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,910
I was just leaving.

736
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,580
Take care of yourself.

737
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,610
I thought you had guys for that.

738
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,210
It's kind of zen.

739
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,320
But you've got that same worried look on your face my brother had.

740
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,140
And really, I'm fine.

741
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,360
Good.

742
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,770
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.

743
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,240
And I wanted to apologize.

744
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm sorry I couldn't stop her.

745
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,480
You tried. Really...

746
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,620
Those were some nice moves back there.

747
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,100
Whatever you're doing with the Arrow

748
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,050
is clearly paying off.

749
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,860
You know, maybe I should apply for a job here

750
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,350
as one of your bouncers.

751
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,310
I think I got that covered.

752
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,010
But I could use an assistant manager.

753
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,630
For real?

754
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,460
I need somebody who knows the place as well as I do.

755
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,670
- Absolutely. - Purely platonic.

756
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,830
Understood.

757
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,240
Oh, it's my designer Kurt.

758
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,010
I should probably take this.

759
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,000
Are you safe?

760
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,770
I am now.

761
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,490
Is that woman gone?

762
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,140
For now.

763
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,310
And your brother?

764
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,060
He's completely in the dark.

765
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,470
He doesn't know a thing.

766
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,090
But, thank you, Dad.

767
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,290
For what?

768
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,930
For taking care of me.

769
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,670
I promised you, Thea.

770
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,550
I will never let anyone hurt you.

771
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,840
The rumors were true.

772
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,270
Malcolm Merlyn is in Starling City.

773
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,690
There is a sadness in your voice.

774
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,750
Ta-er Al Sah-fer.

775
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,810
She has fallen.

776
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,600
Sara Lance is dead.

777
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,940
Yes.

778
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,980
Struck through the heart with an arrow.

779
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,310
At Merlyn's hand?

780
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,550
It appears.

781
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,370
I have vowed a blood oath to avenge her.

782
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,810
Al Sa-her will face the league's justice.

783
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,770
But for his crimes against our code.

784
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,750
But Sara--

785
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,950
was never truly one of us.

786
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,910
And what of Queen?

787
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,800
He has sworn to protect Merlyn at any cost.

788
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,530
If that is true,

789
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,040
then Oliver Queen courts war with us.
