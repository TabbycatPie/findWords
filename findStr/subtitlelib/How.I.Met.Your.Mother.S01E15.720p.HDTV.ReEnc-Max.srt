<i>OLDER TED: Kids, something you...</i>

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:05,564
<i>might not know about
your Uncle Marshall...</i>

4
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,723
<i>is that he's always been good at games.</i>

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,109
<i>I mean unbeatable.</i>

6
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,136
Gin!

7
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,164
Yahtzee!

8
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,357
Poker!

9
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:18,581
You don't have to shout out 'poker'
when you win.

10
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:20,932
I know. It's just fun to say.

11
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:22,093
<i>OLDER TED: We all finally agreed,</i>

12
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,896
<i>Marshall should be
running our game nights,</i>

13
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,217
<i>instead of playing in them.</i>

14
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:28,310
<i>Which he took to mean,
'Invent your own game.'</i>

15
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:30,878
It's called 'Marshgammon.'

16
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,884
It combines all the best features
of all the best games,

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,107
Candyland, I Never, Pictionary.

18
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,750
- Backgammon, obviously.
- No.

19
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,329
Backgammon sucks.

20
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,745
I took the only good part of
'backgammon,' the 'gammon,'

21
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,482
and I left the rest of it in the trash
where it belongs.

22
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,866
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

23
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,735
I'm gonna go get another round.

24
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,344
Okay. I wanna lay down
some ground rules for tonight, Barney.

25
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:55,044
I actually like Victoria a lot.

26
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:58,759
So, don't say anything...
Don't say anything.

27
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:01,817
And, guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria...

28
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:03,813
that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin,

29
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,421
- so if we could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well, how rich.

30
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:11,675
You make me promise to be on
my best behavior around your girlfriend,

31
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,864
yet you have been lying to her
since day one.

32
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,892
Excuse me.

33
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,086
Hi, Leg Warehouse?

34
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:20,599
Yeah, my friend Ted
needs something to stand on.

35
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:24,819
So, nothing for him to stand on?
Okay, thanks so much.

36
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,964
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know
that you once had the hots for Robin?

37
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:33,110
I have half a mind
to tell the story of the re-return.

38
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,655
(WHISPERING) No,
I swore you to secrecy on that.

39
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:39,361
I am smelling dirt.
What is the story of the re-return?

40
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,068
Nothing. It's nothing.

41
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:42,679
And, speaking of digging up dirt,

42
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,966
can I count on you two
to behave around Victoria?

43
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,051
Us? What would we do?

44
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,733
Look, you guys have always been
like the parents that I still have,

45
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,796
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

46
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,856
However, could we skip
the traditional interrogation...

47
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:58,111
of the new girlfriend tonight?

48
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,367
- Fine.
- Fine.

49
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,495
Thank you.

50
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:03,218
- I should go help Robin.
- Okay.

51
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:06,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,871
So, you gonna be okay
hanging out with Victoria tonight?

53
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,898
Oh, sure. She's great.

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,961
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing
where I said I liked Ted?

55
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,636
No. Victoria is great.

56
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,955
She's fun, she's free-spirited. She's great.

57
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,952
I said 'She's great' too many times,
didn't I?

58
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,593
You must really hate the bitch.

59
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:29,072
But if you roll an even number
while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

60
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:32,197
then you 'Marshall Out,'
and all your chips go into the pot.

61
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:35,999
And remember,
if you ever ask the question, 'What,'

62
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,215
then you gotta drink.

63
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:39,800
Got it?

64
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,120
- No idea what you're taIking about.
- No idea what you're taIking about.

65
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:43,215
Okay, okay. All right, no, no.

66
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:45,567
We'll just start. You guys will pick it up.
Newbie goes first.

67
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,634
- MARSHALL: Roll.
- Okay.

68
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,233
Three! You got 'Autobiography.'

69
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,782
Now, that's where you have to answer
a personal question about your dating life,

70
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:56,618
truthfully, in order to move on.

71
00:02:56,715 --> 00:03:01,639
- Marshall, come on.
- Hey. She's the one who rolled a three.

72
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:02,975
Victoria.

73
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,293
'Have you ever cheated
while in a relationship?'

74
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,065
Wow, good question.

75
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:11,319
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

76
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,992
Well, I was in a really crappy relationship
in college,

77
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:18,632
and I wound up kissing this guy
at a party one night...

78
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,735
and I felt terrible about it,
so I came clean and we broke up.

79
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:27,557
Victoria, that was an honest
and mature answer.

80
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,936
You may advance
to the Gumdrop Mountains.

81
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:34,902
So, Victoria,
did you ever re-return to this guy?

82
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:38,281
- What?
- You said what. You gotta drink.

83
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:43,086
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party
in that new building on 82nd,

84
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,728
and the host said she knew you.

85
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,600
- What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?
- Shannon?

86
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,687
Shannon, Shannon.

87
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:53,169
No. Don't remember any Shannon.

88
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,811
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me
a videotape to give you.

89
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,839
Where's the tape?

90
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,320
I'll get it.

91
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,704
Cool. Okay. You know, whenever.

92
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,076
Okay, Robin. Your roll.

93
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,002
Five! Another 'Autobiography.'

94
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,377
For the player to your left which...
Victoria!

95
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,129
Of course.

'How many boyfriends did you have
before you started dating Ted?'

98
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,893
Wait, the card actually says Ted?

99
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,695
Okay. Well, boyfriends,
I guess I've only had two.

100

Prude-alert.

101
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,364
Well, that... That's serious boyfriends.
I've dated other guys in between.

102
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,392
Oh, slut-alert!

103
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:45,012
Oh, great, there it is.
Thanks, Lily, you're a peach.

Thank you. Finally,
somebody understands Marshgammon.

109
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,836
Barney, what was on that tape?

110
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,551
- Too bad you'll never find out.
- Damn it!

111
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:09,837
If only I'd given you a fake tape
and hidden the real tape in my purse.

112
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,189
Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.

113
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:14,216
- What?
- Drink.

114
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:19,502
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it
I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.

115
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,368
- So, should we pop it in?
- Give it to me.

your most humiliating moment, Marshall?

00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:10,572
but instead, I'm out in the world
being awesome 24/7, 365.

341
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:13,541
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.

342
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,983
Plus, here's the mini-cherry,
on top of the regular cherry,

343
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,593
on top of the sundae of awesomeness
that is my life.

344
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,055
After Shannon and I taIked, I nailed her.

345
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,458
- No.
- Yeah.

346
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:25,553
- No.
- Yeah.

347
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,680
Sorry, don't buy it. You're making it up.

348
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,902
You're just trying to cover the fact
that you actually had a profound moment...

349
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:32,190
of doubt about yourself and...

350
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:33,350
<i>(SHANNON MOANING)...</i>

351
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,605
<i>- Oh, my God.
- SHANNON: Oh, Barney, oh.</i>

352
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,699
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?

353
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:38,859
<i>SHANNON: Is your phone on?</i>

354
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:41,662
<i>BARNEY: Oh, no, it just takes a while
to power down.</i>

355
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:43,779
Oh, gross. Just stop it.

356
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,816
(CHUCKLING)

357
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,132
Ladies, gentlemen, Ted.

358
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,424
This has been a wonderful evening.

359
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,065
I got great dirt on all you guys.
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

360
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,996
I finally nailed Shannon!
Told her I'd call her tomorrow.

361
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,865
Yeah, right.

362
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:03,473
And I rediscovered
just how awesomely awesome my life is.

363
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,500
<i>Peace out, hombres.</i>

364
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,790
I think Barney just won game night.

365
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:16,324
<i>OLDER TED: We spend so much effort
trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,</i>

366
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,289
<i>even from our closest friends...</i>

367
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,834
<i>that those rare times when we do open up,
</i>

368
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:25,445
<i>it's amazing how minor those secrets
all end up seeming.</i>

369
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,948
$100 says when you turn around...

370
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>Of course,
not every secret was told that night.</i>

371
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:40,044
<i>But that's getting ahead of the story.</i>
