1
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:09,045
<i>I remember as a kid...</i>

2
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:11,965
<i>I could hear the echo through the city.</i>

3
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:14,925
<i>It's like this scream.</i>

4
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,945
<i>When they</i>
<i>get into a 200-mile-an-hour car...</i>

5
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:26,005
<i>...there's an almost</i>
<i>fighter pilot mentality.</i>

6
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:28,645
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

7
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,045
<i>I always think of my family.</i>

8
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,385
<i>All I do is pray for a safe race.</i>

9
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:38,485
<i>You need to respect the speed.</i>

10
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:42,805
<i>But the second a driver has fear,</i>
<i>you need to retire.</i>

11
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,325
<i>Formula One is the ultimate competition.</i>

12
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,245
<i>- Uncontrolled drama.</i>

13
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,085
- Oh, there's a puncture!
- Oh!

14
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,325
<i>Competitiveness,</i>
<i>high stakes, politics...</i>

15
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,445
How can you call that a fair championship?

16
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,765
<i> It is described</i>
<i>as a traveling circus.</i>

17
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,165
<i>We pack it all up,</i>

18
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:08,925
<i>and 24 hours later,</i>
<i>unpack it in a new part of the world.</i>

19
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,445
<i>We've all got</i>
<i>thousands of employees...</i>

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,925
<i>that all share the desire to win.</i>

21
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,605
<i>The drivers</i>
<i>are the best in the world.</i>

22
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,245
<i>We all believe we are the one.</i>

23
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,645
<i>Your teammate</i>
<i>is your worst enemy.</i>

24
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:31,125
<i> If he beats me every race,</i>
<i>my career's done.</i>

25
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:35,245
The ultimate goal is to be the best.

26
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,005
<i>If you had Lewis Hamilton's</i>
<i>same car, would you beat him?</i>

27
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:41,565
Yes.

28
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,765
<i>The highs are very high.</i>

29
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,005
Whoo-hoo!

30
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,925
<i>Thank you, thank you so much.</i>

31
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:50,405
<i>The lows are very low.</i>

32
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,325
I'm fucking sick of this.

33
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:55,725
<i> It's about making</i>
<i>the correct choices.</i>

34
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,405
<i>Every day I break out</i>
<i>in a cold sweat, thinking,</i>

35
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,205
<i>"Do I have the skill set to do it?"</i>

36
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,245
<i>The risk of death</i>
<i>will never go away.</i>

37
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,045
<i>Massive accident!</i>

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,045
- <i>I'm not worried about dying.</i>
- Whoa.

39
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:09,485
<i>I'm willing to do anything.</i>

40
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,565
<i>Let's see who's the best.</i>

41
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,565
<i>All right,</i>
<i>am I good to, like, sit?</i>

42
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,525
<i>Yeah.</i>

43
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,485
- <i> All right. I'm good to go.</i>
<i>-  Okay.</i>

44
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:30,965
Are you happy with your hair?

45
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,045
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

46
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,365
Prob-- If you've asked me,
then it must look shit.

47
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,485
No, no, no. I'm just...

48
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,125
<i>Am I looking at you</i>
<i>or down the lens?</i>

49
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:37,245
- <i>At me, sorry.</i>
<i>-  Awesome.</i>

50
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,405
Can I get you to tell me who you are
and what you do for a job?

51
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,885
I'm Daniel Ricciardo
and I'm a car mechanic.

52
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,045
All righty, I got this. I'm gonna nail it.

53
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,845
Three, two, one... I am Daniel Ricciardo.

54
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,325
I was born in Perth, Australia,

55
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,765
and I'm a Formula One driver.

56
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,125
Sounds pretty good when I say that.

57
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:02,685
<i> I love that feeling of the car</i>
<i>on</i> <i>the edge at such a high speed.</i>

58
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:07,805
<i>I love the danger.</i>

59
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,005
<i>That adrenaline and that excitement.</i>

60
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:18,525
<i>More than anything,</i>
<i>I love the feeling of winning.</i>

61
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,165
<i>It's a beautiful thing.</i>

62
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,085
<i>And Ricciardo has got the inside line.</i>

63
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:27,025
<i>Lewis Hamilton's brave defense</i>
<i>of second place comes to an end.</i>

64
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:31,125
<i>And down the inside</i>
<i>goes Daniel Ricciardo!</i>

65
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,045
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

66
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,885
<i>That's how it's done, ladies.</i>

67
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:38,005
Whoo hoo!

68
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,965
<i>And Daniel Ricciardo wins</i>
<i>the Hungarian Grand Prix.</i>

69
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,205
<i>I don't think anyone's smile</i>
<i>could be bigger.</i>

70
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:04,525
<i>As a kid, I loved motorbikes.</i>
<i>I loved NASCAR.</i>

71
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:05,805
Oh, shit!

72
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:09,245
<i>But F1, that was</i>
<i>the fastest circuit cars</i> <i>in the world.</i>

73
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,485
<i>That's really why I got into Formula One.</i>

74
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,405
<i>I wanted to try and see if I could be</i>
<i>the best in the world.</i>

75
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,365
<i>Picturing myself on the top step</i>
<i>of an F1 podium,</i>

76
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,485
<i>I had visualized that feeling as a kid.</i>

77
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,005
<i>To be world champion would mean</i>
<i>the world to me.</i>

78
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,925
Look at this geek here standing beside me.

79
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,845
<i>For my family,</i>
<i>my dream involved sacrifices.</i>

80
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,205
<i> Great start</i>
<i>from Daniel Ricciardo...</i>

81
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,485
<i>My dad was building his own business,</i>

82
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,845
<i>but also taking me karting</i>
<i>on the weekends</i>

83
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:52,485
<i>and spending the money he'd made</i>
<i>to then put into me.</i>

84
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,285
Don't forget his helmet.
There you go.

85
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,005
<i>I remember as if it was yesterday.</i>

86
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,725
<i>Daniel said to me that he'd wanted</i>
<i>to give it a go in Europe.</i>

87
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,445
Put it on Uncle Daniel.

88
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,585
<i>And a lot of friends said,</i>
<i>"Oh, how could you let him go?"</i>

89
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>But he was so determined.</i>

90
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,605
That looks great.

91
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,525
How do you do it?
What am I doing wrong here?

92
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:13,485
Rip it off, man.

93
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,405
<i>All the struggles,</i>
<i>all the bad days...</i>

94
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,285
<i>leaving home so young.</i>

95
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:19,605
- Have the rest?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,485
<i>Winning the world title,</i>
<i>it would make it all worth it.</i>

97
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,045
Baa!

98
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,325
<i>When I got into F1,</i>
<i>everyone knew me as the happy guy</i>

99
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:33,845
<i>and the nice guy,</i>
<i>but I do have a kind of killer instinct.</i>

100
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,485
I do believe I can be world champion

101
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:40,245
and for me, it's like,
"Why else would I be doing this?"

102
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,005
<i>And welcome along</i>
<i>for the opening round</i>

103
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,885
<i>of the Formula One World Championship</i>
<i>in 2018.</i>

104
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:53,325
<i>Welcome to the 23rd</i>
<i>Australian Grand Prix</i>

105
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:57,525
<i>held here in Albert Park for</i>
<i>the traditional first race of the season.</i>

106
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,325
<i>No Australian has been classified</i>
<i>in the top three of their home race.</i>

107
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,685
<i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

108
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,125
<i>Is this the year?</i>

109
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:11,725
<i>First race of the season</i>
<i>is my home one.</i>

110
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:17,725
Daniel!

111
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,565
<i> I love having a home race.</i>

112
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,085
<i>But it's wild, you know?</i>

113
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,325
Can I get a photo?

114
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:26,685
<i>There's so much anticipation</i>
<i>being drawn to that first race in March.</i>

115
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,245
Can we get a quick selfie, mate?

116
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,005
-Yeah, of course.
-Cheers, man.

117
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,205
<i>And then, 'cause it's in Australia...</i>

118
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:33,445
We're all cheering for you.

119
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:38,245
<i>I'm the only Australian driver.</i>
<i>I get that two-fold.</i>

120
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,045
- Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
- Oy, oy, oy!

121
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,925
- Let's go, Dan!
- Yay!

122
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,445
How important is this season for you

123
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,365
as being a season in which
you can compete for the championship?

124
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,325
It's super important.

125
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:58,205
This will see where I am personally,
see where we are competitively...

126
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,405
Everybody recognizes
Daniel Ricciardo

127
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,205
as being one of the biggest talents
in Formula One.

128
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,605
<i>But a lot of people think</i>
<i>it's this year or bust</i>

129
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:07,685
<i>for him to take his first world title.</i>

130
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:09,925
I think it's gonna be
a really exciting year

131
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,205
because we've got three teams
that look capable of winning races.

132
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,485
<i>Last season, Lewis Hamilton with Mercedes</i>
<i>and Sebastian Vettel at Ferrari</i>

133
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:18,765
<i>were the top two.</i>

134
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:22,605
<i>This season, we're really excited to see</i>
<i>if Daniel Ricciardo with Red Bull</i>

135
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:25,085
<i>can properly fight with those two drivers.</i>

136
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,365
It's easy to say that a champion

137
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,285
from a previous year is the favorite.

138
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,205
But Red Bull are gonna be
very hard to beat.

139
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,165
- How does it look for you?
- It's looking exciting.

140
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:39,165
I think it should be close at the top
with Mercedes, uh, Ferrari, Red Bull.

141
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,405
<i> In Formula One,</i>
<i>we've got 10 teams,</i>

142
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:47,525
<i>and each team is trying to develop</i>
<i>the best car possible.</i>

143
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:52,805
The more money you spend,
the better your car is likely to be.

144
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:56,845
<i>But there's a massive difference</i>
<i>in budgets in Formula One.</i>

145
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,285
<i>The smaller teams are quite often</i>
<i>operating on a budget</i>

146
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:02,565
<i>that's a fraction</i>
<i>of the size of the very biggest teams,</i>

147
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,125
<i>like Ferrari and Mercedes.</i>

148
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:06,125
<i>So, it's not a level playing field.</i>

149
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:17,325
Guys, I mean, you know the position
we are in here, you know?

150
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,605
If I understood what Walter
told me last night,

151
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:21,205
there was one of everything.

152
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:27,525
I'm Guenther Steiner. I am the team
principal of Haas F1 team.

153
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,405
<i>I love racing, it's my passion.</i>

154
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,205
<i>I started off from the bottom</i>
<i>as a mechanic.</i>

155
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,565
I am doing it a long time,
more than 30 years.

156
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,965
Oh, yeah, and he should be.

157
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,005
Setting up a Formula One team
in the US was my idea,

158
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,685
and I persuaded Gene Haas to do this.

159
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,365
I think at turn one, he had no choice.
He had-- Everybody was going, whatever.

160
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:50,045
<i>Gene has got</i>
<i>a very successful NASCAR team,</i>

161
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,765
<i>and he knows how racing works.</i>

162
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,325
-Seventy-one.
-Did he hit somebody?

163
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,925
Yeah, Yeah. He, hit...
because he...

164
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:58,765
<i>There's a lot of money</i>
<i>in Formula One.</i>

165
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:04,245
<i>Can you compete with the teams</i>
<i>with the big budgets? It's pretty hard.</i>

166
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,805
<i>You know, you're talking</i>
<i>five, six hundred million</i>

167
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,005
<i>to our 140 million.</i>

168
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:11,565
<i>But, you just gotta keep</i>
<i>trying and trying</i>

169
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:15,565
<i>and a lot of success in racing</i>
<i>comes down to just being stubborn.</i>

170
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,925
<i>Haas F1 is the first American</i>
<i>Formula One team in more than 30 years</i>

171
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:25,405
<i>and coming in as a new team in Formula One</i>
<i>is just so difficult.</i>

172
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm not convinced, but
I'm cautiously optimistic, as I call it.

173
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:32,245
In a small team,
we have less parts, less stuff.

174
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,085
We need to do more with less.

175
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,685
And how many people in your team,
all together?

176
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:37,845
Two hundred twelve.

177
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,845
Mercedes have more people
on holiday at any one time.

178
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:43,845
Oh, yeah, yeah.

179
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,605
We are the underdogs.
We are new in here.

180
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,365
But, for sure, we're not here just
to make the numbers up.

181
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,645
We are here to compete.

182
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,445
<i>It's the first Friday practice.</i>

183
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:02,565
<i>Teams have 90 minutes to test their setups</i>
<i>around this three-mile circuit.</i>

184
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,085
<i>One of the most special things</i>
<i>about Formula One</i>

185
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,885
<i>is the way the weekend builds.</i>

186
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:13,885
<i>Friday is practice.</i>

187
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:22,045
<i>That's when the teams and drivers get out</i>
<i>on track to try and set their cars up</i>

188
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:24,205
<i>and make sure</i>
<i>it's performing the best it can.</i>

189
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,445
Saturday, there's qualifying,

190
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,325
<i>to set the order that the cars</i>
<i>will start the race in.</i>

191
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,925
And then on Sunday,
we have the race itself.

192
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,005
<i>Every session is dangerous.</i>

193
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:49,605
<i>Last season at Melbourne,</i>
<i>during practice, there were three crashes.</i>

194
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:03,125
You all right?

195
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,965
Are you happy
with the strategy we are taking?

196
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:05,925
Yeah, fine.

197
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:07,805
The problem is that at some point,

198
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,245
one's gonna be right,
one's gonna be wrong.

199
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,925
-You never know.
-Yeah, yeah, exactly.

200
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:13,645
<i>My name's Christian Horner.</i>

201
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:17,005
<i>I'm the team principal</i>
<i>of Aston Martin Red Bull racing.</i>

202
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,245
So, uh, buck effectively stops with me.

203
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:29,685
<i>Sebastian Vettel,</i>
<i>you are the world champion!</i>

204
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,125
<i>We're a subsidiary</i>
<i>of an energy drink</i>

205
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:40,005
<i>that's come along and won four</i>
<i>back-to-back world championships.</i>

206
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,165
<i>But that's in the past.</i>

207
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,805
What do you reckon?

208
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,725
<i>You know, we've spent five seasons now</i>

209
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,925
<i>where we should have been real contenders.</i>

210
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,805
We need to win races this year.

211
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,645
We need to take the challenge
to the big teams.

212
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,965
You all right?
Get out there and enjoy it.

213
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,725
- I will, thank you.
- Yeah?

214
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,725
Let your driving do the talking.
You'll be fine.

215
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,165
<i> Every team has two drivers.</i>

216
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:11,005
<i>We're fortunate to have Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
<i>He's at the top of his game.</i>

217
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,445
Well, you can see the people who are...

218
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,405
<i>And we've got this exciting,</i>
<i>emerging talent in Max Verstappen.</i>

219
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:20,525
<i>But you can just feel</i>
<i>that anticipation of,</i>

220
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,845
<i>"Have we designed a good car this year?</i>

221
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,165
<i>Is it gonna be successful?</i>
<i>Is it gonna be reliable?"</i>

222
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,725
Okay, well let's see how we go.

223
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,325
I think it looks okay. I suggest we go
and have little up and down.

224
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,445
<i>Okay.</i>

225
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:36,965
Let's go, please.

226
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:54,725
<i> As a racecar driver,</i>
<i>your feeling is so in tune,</i>

227
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:59,405
<i>that you know, after a few laps,</i>
<i>if the car is fast.</i>

228
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,925
<i>A lot of it, for me,</i>
<i>is confidence within the car</i>

229
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,165
<i>and just having a feeling</i>
<i>under the braking.</i>

230
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,605
<i>'Cause your coming up to a corner,</i>
<i>300 and something kilometers an hour.</i>

231
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,085
<i>Your instinct is like,</i>
<i>"Brake now, brake now, brake now,"</i>

232
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,605
<i>and you've gotta push yourself</i>
<i>to brake later</i> <i>and later</i>

233
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,445
<i>and trust that the car will stop.</i>

234
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,285
<i>He's got confidence in that car.</i>

235
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,525
<i>He is ripping the wheels off that.</i>

236
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,525
<i>Whoo!</i>

237
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,365
<i>What's your headline</i>
<i>for today then?</i>

238
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,445
<i>Red Bull , they could easily</i>
<i>find themselves in the front of the grid.</i>

239
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,005
<i>You're doing a good job.</i>

240
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,125
<i> Thanks, guys.</i>

241
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:54,005
<i>We had serious pace today.</i>
<i>The car was performing well.</i>

242
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,685
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>
<i>performance is everything.</i>

243
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,525
<i>I wanna win, because it's</i>
<i>what I believe I can do</i>

244
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,685
<i>and I've worked all these years to do it.</i>

245
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,845
<i>So, no one's gonna put more pressure</i>
<i>on me than myself.</i>

246
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,765
<i>So, who can set the fastest lap today</i>

247
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:21,325
<i>and start tomorrow's race</i>
<i>on pole position?</i>

248
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,605
<i>In qualifying, it's all designed</i>

249
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,685
<i>to set the order</i>
<i>for the start of the race.</i>

250
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,245
<i>Here's the time</i>
<i>that they've all got to beat.</i>

251
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:36,885
<i>Lewis Hamilton crosses the line.</i>
<i>It's a 1:21.1!</i>

252
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,045
<i>If you start in a good position,</i>

253
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,245
<i>you have a much better chance</i>
<i>of winning the race.</i>

254
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,605
<i>Qualifying is the moment that you see</i>
<i>these cars on the absolute limit.</i>

255
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,365
<i>And the driver pushing it to boundaries</i>

256
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,005
that you don't even know quite
where the edge is.

257
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,565
- <i>My God. That's, uh, Bottas!</i>
<i>- That's Valtteri Bottas!</i>

258
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,605
<i>That's Bottas wrecking his qualifying,</i>
<i>wrecking his car.</i>

259
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,365
<i>It's not gonna polish out, is it?</i>

260
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,525
Guys, I just wanted to speak with you
a few minutes

261
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:15,605
before we need to go out on the track
and see what we can do. So...

262
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:19,205
From Gene's and my side, we are confident
that we can do better than last year.

263
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,525
I think on the pit stops, we have got
a few new people and it will be,

264
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,925
I wouldn't say difficult, but we need to
get used to new people in the pit-stops,

265
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:30,085
so, I think we can do it.
Thank you very much, guys.

266
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:33,925
How many minutes?

267
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:37,925
He said it should be really three minutes.

268
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,245
He's warming up the carbon fiber.

269
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,925
<i>My name is Kevin Magnussen.</i>

270
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,685
I am 26 years old
and I drive for Haas F1 team.

271
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,165
<i>Qualifying is really intense.</i>

272
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:58,005
There is a lot of pressure in Formula One
to deliver results and to perform well.

273
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,525
And that's the hardest thing about it.

274
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,325
<i>We're on-board now</i>
<i>with Kevin Magnussen</i>

275
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:08,405
<i>underneath the bridge as we go,</i>
<i>and they touch!</i>

276
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,765
<i>And that could have been</i>
<i>very nasty indeed!</i>

277
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,685
<i>I don't have fear when I drive.</i>

278
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:20,125
<i>I don't ever think about</i>
<i>the consequences</i> <i>of crashing the car.</i>

279
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,765
<i>I'm not worried about dying.</i>

280
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,085
<i>I'll do anything I can</i>
<i>to get the best results possible.</i>

281
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,565
Okay, watch
the traffic light and the white line.

282
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,245
- Did you copy?
- Okay.

283
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:55,645
<i>To drive a lap fast</i>
<i>is all rhythm and feeling.</i>

284
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,925
You feel just like one with the car,
as if it was your body.

285
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:10,085
<i>For me it feels like flying.</i>

286
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,365
It's almost like having superpowers.

287
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:27,765
<i>Here comes Magnussen.</i>

288
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,505
<i>And he's absolutely</i>
<i>nailed sectors one and two.</i>

289
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:32,325
<i>What's his time going to be?</i>

290
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:41,845
<i>A 1:23.1,</i>
<i>and that's a sensational lap from Haas.</i>

291
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:47,565
Well done, son.
He fucking did it. Jesus!

292
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,005
Whoa.

293
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,165
<i> What a performance from Haas.</i>

294
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:55,345
<i>They'll be fifth and sixth</i>
<i>in tomorrow's race,</i>

295
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:58,605
<i>the highest they've ever started</i>
<i>in a Grand Prix.</i>

296
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,285
Great job. I'm really proud of you.

297
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,485
<i>Well done, guys.</i>
<i>Fucking hell. Well done.</i>

298
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,205
Well done, man!

299
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:12,165
Happy.

300
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:13,845
In the mountains!

301
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,565
Thank you.

302
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,565
Hi, Gene. That wasn't bad, though.

303
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,565
Fuck. Yeah, yeah.

304
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,045
Yeah, with the big boys, yeah?

305
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,605
Pretty cool, we start fifth.
Fifth and sixth.

306
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:35,885
<i> When we started,</i>
<i>everybody told us we will fail.</i>

307
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,405
But Gene supported me all the way
and has put a lot of faith in me

308
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,045
and failing in doing this
is not an option.

309
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:42,965
We need to succeed.

310
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:52,405
<i>Twenty drivers, 21 races.</i>
<i>There can only be one world champion.</i>

311
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,965
Welcome along to the Formula One
World Championship.

312
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:00,645
Dan!

313
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,765
<i>I love race day.</i>

314
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,925
<i>That feeling of having</i>
<i>the fans, you know, right there.</i>

315
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,365
- It's ringing.
- Ah...

316
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,165
Um... Hi, Chris, how're you going?

317
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:13,885
This is Daniel Ricciardo, Chris.

318
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:14,885
That's my dad, Dan!

319
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,205
<i>Hometown kid,</i>
<i>so a lot of fans,</i> <i>a lot of support</i>

320
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,285
<i>and let's try and give them</i>
<i>something to cheer about.</i>

321
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,005
-How are you?
-How are you, buddy?

322
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,445
-Good. You just got in? Awesome.
-Good.

323
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:35,385
-Yeah, thank you.
-Awesome. See you.

324
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,205
Wow. Wow.

325
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,445
I know.

326
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:45,565
<i>This is how the grid will line up.</i>

327
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,565
<i>The reigning champion,</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton, on pole.</i>

328
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,325
<i>Kimi Raikkonen in second,</i>

329
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:54,465
<i>out-qualifying his four-time</i>
<i>world champion teammate, Sebastian Vettel.</i>

330
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,285
<i>Max Verstappen starts fourth,</i>

331
00:19:56,365 --> 00:20:00,085
<i>Kevin Magnussen is fifth,</i>
<i>giving Haas their best ever start.</i>

332
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:06,405
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is in eighth,</i>
<i>after receiving a penalty in practice.</i>

333
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:09,805
<i>So, he'll face a huge challenge</i>
<i>to get a podium today.</i>

334
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:20,685
<i>When the race starts,</i>
<i>it's a great moment.</i>

335
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:26,885
<i>To be actually in charge</i>
<i>of one of the teams out there,</i>

336
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,765
<i>that is what I dreamt for</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

337
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:35,605
<i>The atmosphere is tense.</i>

338
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,205
<i>And you can feel</i>
<i>your body is ready to perform.</i>

339
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:45,365
<i>If someone says</i>
<i>they don't get nervous, they're lying.</i>

340
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:49,805
<i>The nerves for me is that anticipation</i>
<i>of what we're about to do.</i>

341
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:57,245
<i>Immediately before a race,</i>
<i>I block out all of the other distractions.</i>

342
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:06,605
<i>I'm very conscious that,</i>
<i>when I look into the driver’s eyes,</i>

343
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,205
<i>the risk that he's taking on.</i>

344
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:14,085
<i>You have a car going in excess</i>
<i>of 200 miles an hour,</i>

345
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,445
<i>racing wheel-to-wheel.</i>

346
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:20,725
<i>These guys have</i>
<i>an almost fighter pilot mentality.</i>

347
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,485
<i>And that's what separates them</i>
<i>from mere mortals.</i>

348
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,365
<i>I remember, when he was little,</i>
<i>going to Melbourne,</i>

349
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,245
<i>we had grandstand tickets</i>
<i>right opposite the pits.</i>

350
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,525
<i>All the drivers are there</i>
<i>and I'm thinking,</i>

351
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,445
<i>"That's somebody's child."</i>

352
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,485
<i>And I was thinking for these poor mothers.</i>

353
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,005
<i>And then I ended up being one of them.</i>

354
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:57,365
<i>I never, ever, ever thought that</i>
<i>I'd be there one day, watching my son.</i>

355
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:06,365
<i>Radio, check, check, check,</i>
<i>check, check, check, check, check, check.</i>

356
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,765
<i>Okay, so the latest info...</i>
<i>wind is stronger today.</i>

357
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,165
<i>So, you've got a head-wind into turn one.</i>

358
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:12,085
<i>Okay.</i>

359
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,845
<i>You've got hundreds of people on the grid.</i>

360
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,645
<i>And then you've got a 30-second warning.</i>

361
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:22,805
<i>Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds.</i>

362
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,765
<i> And then, all the mechanics go.</i>

363
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,805
<i>The grid is then empty</i>
<i>and it's just you and the other drivers.</i>

364
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:19,085
<i>Rushing into the first corner,</i>
<i>it's all instinctive.</i>

365
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,245
<i>Great start</i>
<i>from Kevin Magnussen.</i>

366
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,765
<i>He's managed to get past Max Verstappen.</i>

367
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:31,165
Come on, Max, straighten.
We haven't got time for this.

368
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:36,725
<i>Daniel Ricciardo down the inside.</i>
<i>He's made up a place.</i>

369
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:45,245
<i>Emotionally,</i>
<i>we're sort of always up and down.</i>

370
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:49,805
<i>All I ever do is pray for a safe race.</i>

371
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:52,285
<i>And then everything else is a bonus.</i>

372
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:57,005
<i>It's the biggest thing</i>
<i>that we're always worried about.</i>

373
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,965
<i>Number one thing,</i>
<i>don't even like talking about it now.</i>

374
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:01,805
<i>You know, it makes me nervous.</i>

375
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,245
<i>It's hugely intense.</i>

376
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,245
<i>You're looking an awful lot at numbers,</i>
<i>at split times,</i>

377
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,965
<i>at the sawtooth graphs.</i>

378
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:18,285
<i>Ricciardo's on a charge,</i>
<i>on the outside of Nico Hulkenberg.</i>

379
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:19,445
Nice job, mate.

380
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,605
<i>Hulkenberg fights back.</i>

381
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:24,765
<i>He's got the inside line</i>
<i>but Ricciardo sweeps on by.</i>

382
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,965
<i>It's mentally draining</i>
<i>if you're dealing with two cars,</i>

383
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:30,485
<i>two different outcomes.</i>

384
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:33,285
<i> These tires</i>
<i>are getting really hot.</i>

385
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,365
Max, recommend saving your overtake

386
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:38,085
<i>for the one place you feel</i>
<i>Magnussen is most vulnerable.</i>

387
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:40,245
<i>And he's gone off!</i>

388
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:45,085
No! Fuck, no!

389
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,165
Verstappen just spun.

390
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,125
<i>Grosjean goes past,</i>
<i>Ricciardo goes past.</i>

391
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:54,485
Oh, for fucks sake, man!

392
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,005
<i>All okay, Max?</i>

393
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:56,965
Yeah.

394
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:05,285
<i>This is dreamland for Haas.</i>

395
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:08,445
<i>So, there's</i>
<i>now only Mercedes and Ferraris</i>

396
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,165
<i>in front of the young American Haas team.</i>

397
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:17,165
<i>This is racing.</i>

398
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:21,365
<i>It's realizing it's a big opportunity</i>
<i>to ram home what you're doing.</i>

399
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,485
<i>We've got a massive lock up.</i>
<i>That's Magnussen.</i>

400
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,205
<i>Tires are starting to go, guys.</i>

401
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,445
<i>It's starting to understeer</i>
<i>more and more now</i>

402
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,605
<i>Okay. Box, Kevin.</i>
<i>Box, please confirm.</i>

403
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:36,445
<i>Box, box, box.</i>

404
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,405
<i>In the pit stops,</i>
<i>that is the only time</i>

405
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:41,205
<i>that you really get</i>
<i>in touch with the team.</i>

406
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:44,285
<i>You're on your own on the track.</i>
<i>Everything is depending on you.</i>

407
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:46,925
When you pit, that changes completely.

408
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:50,005
<i>That's when you realize</i>
<i>how much of a team effort it is.</i>

409
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,645
<i> Kevin Magnussen has pitted.</i>

410
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:13,365
-I don't think that's tight.
-Which one? Which one?

411
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:15,765
Left rear. I don't do any other one.

412
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:16,965
Are you sure it's not tight?

413
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,525
<i>Failure, guys.</i>

414
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,965
<i>And who's that going slowly?</i>
<i>It's Kevin Magnussen!</i>

415
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,965
<i>Kevin Magnussen in the Haas,</i>
<i>he's just come out of the pit lane</i>

416
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,845
<i>and now he's grinding to a halt.</i>

417
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,245
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>

418
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:46,365
<i>Magnussen was on</i>
<i>for a sensational result,</i>

419
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:47,525
<i>but now he's retiring.</i>

420
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:05,645
<i>It's heartbreaking.</i>
<i>You don't want it to be true.</i>

421
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,685
<i>And by the looks of things,</i>

422
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:12,645
<i>one of those wheels</i>
<i>isn't attached properly.</i>

423
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:16,725
<i>You just cope with it.</i>
<i>They've got two drivers.</i>

424
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:20,685
<i>You just try to stay as calm</i>
<i>as possible and focus on the race.</i>

425
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:25,005
<i>Box now, Romain. Box now.</i>

426
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:41,685
<i>Romain Grosjean has now pitted</i>
<i>and makes his way back onto the circuit.</i>

427
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,125
<i>So Ricciardo now has clear air.</i>

428
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,365
<i>That's good news for the Red Bull team.</i>

429
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:49,925
<i>As Grosjean--</i>
<i>Is that Grosjean going slowly? It is!</i>

430
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:51,485
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>

431
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:54,765
<i>We have a front left loose.</i>
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>

432
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:58,525
<i>Romain Grosjean pulling over</i>
<i>in the other Haas.</i>

433
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:01,645
<i>So both Haases,</i>
<i>as soon as they leave the pit lane,</i>

434
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:04,245
<i>have ground to a halt.</i>
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

435
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:08,485
<i>What could have been</i>
<i>one of their best weekends on a race track</i>

436
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,965
<i>has turned into absolute disaster.</i>

437
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,205
<i>When you see it happen on the screen,</i>

438
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:23,525
<i>you think, "This cannot happen.</i>
<i>This is not real."</i>

439
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,645
<i>We lost it all in two laps.</i>

440
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:37,045
<i>In Formula One,</i>
<i>the highs are very high,</i>

441
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,725
<i>the lows are very low.</i>

442
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,245
<i>It's easy in my position</i>
<i>to blame somebody,</i>

443
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:57,285
<i>but then in the end,</i>
<i>the buck stops with me.</i>

444
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,285
You've got a horde of media out here.
Are you happy to speak to people?

445
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,445
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They need to hear. That's fine. Yeah.

446
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,565
<i> It's a sad afternoon.</i>

447
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,845
<i>We've seen all your people.</i>

448
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:10,605
<i>They're heartbroken,</i>
<i>as well as the drivers.</i>

449
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:12,885
How is it to be a boss
in a moment like that?

450
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,005
I mean, in the end
as a boss, you need to lead.

451
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:18,085
I am sure my disappointment
is as big as theirs.

452
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:21,565
We need first to see what went wrong
before we can fix it.

453
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:28,845
I just need a bit of a break

454
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:31,005
Otherwise, you'll say
something afterwards?

455
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,605
- I don't know.
- Okay, thanks.

456
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:36,605
<i>We were</i>
<i>in fourth and fifth position.</i>

457
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,525
-Just help me with those guys
-Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,725
<i>And that would've been,</i> <i>by far,</i>

459
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:45,365
<i>the best result for the team</i>
<i>in its history.</i>

460
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:50,245
I don't know, Gene. I don't have to answer
 to that one. We just fucked this one up.

461
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:52,525
Doesn't make it right.
I know that, you know.

462
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,685
Saying I fucked it up,
it doesn't make it right. It's like...

463
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:00,605
Same mistake. It's unbelievable.

464
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,645
The two guys putting the wheel on,
they were new.

465
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:10,445
Fuck! Fourth and fifth, but, Gene,
if we finish fourth and fifth here,

466
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,325
we fucking look like rock stars, huh?

467
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:14,605
And now we're a fucking bunch of wankers.

468
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:16,485
Yeah, a bunch of fucking clowns here.

469
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:21,085
I will do a proper investigation, Gene.
Don't worry, you know that.

470
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,165
I will fix it, trust me.

471
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,125
The wheel just wasn't done enough, huh?

472
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:35,885
It felt tight, but as it dropped

473
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,725
it visually looked as though
it was loose.

474
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:39,885
Not done up properly, sir.

475
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,165
You, did you think we train not enough?
Or...

476
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:46,165
We haven't practiced
this weekend at all. Um...

477
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,325
Tiredness as well...

478
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:52,005
I don't think that will help.

479
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,045
Just on the back foot this weekend.

480
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,645
But the wheels were
not completely on, you know?

481
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,485
I'm devastated and I am truly sorry, sir.

482
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:11,965
<i>Raikkonen running</i>
<i>in third position.</i>

483
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:13,645
<i>Fourth for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

484
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,085
<i>He's fought his way back</i>
<i>from eighth place.</i>

485
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,325
<i>If he can get on the podium today,</i>

486
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:21,005
<i>it would mean so, so much</i>
<i>for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

487
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,725
<i>Hey, that is blistering pace.</i>

488
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,565
<i> I don't wanna let him breathe.</i>

489
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:30,605
Doing the right thing.
Just keep the pressure on.

490
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:31,805
<i>Understood.</i>

491
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:39,365
<i> No Australian has been classified</i>
<i>in the top three of their home race.</i>

492
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:47,565
<i>He will be doing his damnedest</i>
<i>on this final lap.</i>

493
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,045
<i> You might as well</i>
<i>use the battery.</i>

494
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:51,325
<i>Understood.</i>

495
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,405
<i>Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>wins the Grand Prix.</i>

496
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:58,605
Whoo!

497
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:02,405
<i>Hamilton second.</i>
<i>Third across the line...</i>

498
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:06,685
<i>it's just Kimi Raikkonen,</i>
<i>with Daniel Ricciardo in fourth.</i>

499
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:08,525
Oh!

500
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,805
Half a second, isn't it?

501
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:14,845
Right on, mate.

502
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:16,125
Fuck.

503
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:20,085
<i>That was a very good job today, mate.</i>
<i>You did get the quickest lap of the race.</i>

504
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,845
<i>Yeah, I tried.</i>

505
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:31,685
<i>We had serious pace today.</i>
<i>We had a real chance at the podium,</i>

506
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:33,445
<i>and I'd wanted it so bad.</i>

507
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:40,285
<i>I really believe that I should be</i>
<i>winning more frequently.</i>

508
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:42,605
<i>I believe I've got the talent</i>
<i>and I put in the work.</i>

509
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:46,365
<i>So, it's not anger,</i>
<i>but it's frustration that comes through.</i>

510
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:50,765
<i>And the winner, from Germany,</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel.</i>

511
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:55,005
Thanks, Pop.

512
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,605
I'm happy, but I'm pissed.
Probably like you.

513
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:58,805
Yeah.

514
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:01,465
Happy, but fuck.
I nearly threw something at the TV.

515
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,125
Yeah. Food delivery.

516
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:04,565
Anyway, I tried.

517
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,205
Yeah, I know you did.
I know you did.

518
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,445
No, yeah! It was good.
Good result.

519
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:13,005
You got the crowd excited.

520
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:14,285
-Yeah, I tried.
-They were cheering you on.

521
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,205
I tried.

522
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,365
I mean, the pace, when you dropped back
and you banked in at 25.

523
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:18,845
Even I didn't think we were that quick...

524
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:20,925
<i> It's a long season.</i>

525
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,045
<i>You know,</i>
<i>these cars develop so quickly.</i>

526
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,605
<i>You'll know where you'll be starting,</i>

527
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,405
<i>but you don't know</i>
<i>where you will be finishing.</i>

528
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:28,845
<i>Things change.</i>

529
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:34,565
<i> I'd love to be</i>
<i>winning tomorrow, if I could.</i>

530
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,605
<i>That's my ultimate dream.</i>

531
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:39,405
I'm pretty far from that at the moment.

532
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:43,565
<i>I know that things like that</i>
<i>don't happen overnight.</i>

533
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:48,865
<i>I'm in a great team that I can grow</i>
<i>and prepare myself,</i>

534
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:50,925
<i>and hopefully one day</i>
<i>I can get a chance</i>

535
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:52,485
<i>to fight for a championship.</i>

536
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,005
<i>We should have done better.</i>

537
00:33:56,085 --> 00:34:00,125
<i>Everybody in Haas wants to do better,</i>
<i>but so does everybody else.</i>

538
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,205
<i>Why you watch Formula One?</i>

539
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:04,365
<i>You want to see action.</i>
<i>You want to see drama.</i>

540
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,925
<i>You want to see</i>
<i>the underdog making a good result.</i>

541
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,005
<i>A story. Each race should have a story,</i>

542
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:13,485
<i>and the story should not be</i>
<i>all the time Mercedes or Ferrari wins,</i>

543
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:16,085
<i>because that story</i>
<i>gets old pretty quickly.</i>

544
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,525
<i>My teammate, Max,</i>
<i>is becoming more of a threat.</i>

545
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:30,605
<i>He's one of the most exciting talents</i>
<i>in Formula One.</i>

546
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:33,205
<i>I need to be</i>
<i>the faster driver of the two.</i>

547
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,325
<i>There's no more brutal lesson</i>
<i>than what he's just had.</i>

548
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,605
<i>Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>is my racing hero.</i>

549
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:41,805
<i>Okay, Carlos. Alonso behind you.</i>

550
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,885
<i>The stakes</i>
<i>have never been higher for McLaren.</i>

551
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,565
I said, "This guy is not beating me.

552
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:48,685
No fucking way."
