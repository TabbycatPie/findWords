1
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:05,886
I can't believe Metro News 1 is just
forwarding you all this fan mail now.

2
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:09,857
- I know. I quit, like, four months ago.
- Wow, you had more fans than I thought.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,157
And only about 60% of them
are prison inmates.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,162
What are these guys thinking?

5
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,562
I am way past my dating prisoners phase.

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,396
It's like, hello,
I'm not 19 anymore, you know?

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,295
Lottery girl's on.

8
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:27,705
I just feel sorry for these women.
This is where broadcast careers go to die.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,268
Check it out. I make it fun.
I invented a little game.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,044
<i>Tonight's lotto numbers are...</i>

11
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:37,713
<i>...nineteen...</i>

12
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:38,911
Age you moved to New York

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,045
after a photographer "discovered" you
at a food court

14
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:42,884
<i>and said he'd get you in Vogue magazine.</i>

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,049
<i>Fifty-three...</i>

16
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:45,682
Number of semi-nude pictures
he took of you

17
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:49,194
<i>before you realized he had no connection
to Vogue magazine.</i>

18
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:52,198
<i>- Twenty-two...
- Age you claim you are.</i>

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,360
<i>- Thirty-one...
- Age you actually are.</i>

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,562
<i>Forty-five.</i>

21
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,935
Number of minutes it would
take me to get you into a cab,

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,806
<i>- out of your dress, and into my Jacuzzi.
- And the super big ball is...</i>

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,435
What happens after
we get out of the Jacuzzi.

24
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:07,877
What up?

25
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:26,625
<i>Kids, by the winter of 2009,
Robin had been unemployed for months.</i>

26
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:28,393
<i>But there was a glimmer of hope.</i>

27
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,696
- Hey!
- Hey, how'd the audition go?

28
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,271
Well, I went in there feeling really good.

29
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:35,863
I heard it was just me
up against two other girls.

30
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:37,465
Listening.

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,911
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,746
Robin Scherbatsky.

33
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:50,311
And you are?

34
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:54,455
You've obviously
never spent any time in Denver.

35
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,789
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.

36
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,525
We were only the number one station
in the Rockies for five straight years.

37
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,329
I was an anchor here in town
at Metro News 1.

38
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:09,738
Ooh, an anchor.
You must have a killer signoff phrase.

39
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,604
- I'm sorry?
- You gotta have a killer signoff phrase.

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,170
Like Walter Cronkite.
"And that's the way it is. "

41
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,078
So what's yours?

42
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,674
Well, I would just always end
with a simple

43
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,516
"From all of us here at Metro News 1,
have a good evening. "

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,519
Mine is "From all of us here
at Barney's apartment, get out. "

45
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:38,660
You didn't let those reporter bitches
psych you out, did you?

46
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:43,671
And the President's economic team is
hoping to have a proposal before Congress

47
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,331
by the end of the month.

48
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:49,002
From all of us here at News 10,
have a good evening.

49
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,017
So, good night, New York.

50
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:59,315
And may the road ahead
be lit with dreams and tomorrows.

51
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,752
Which are lit with dreams, also.

52
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:09,593
Wow. That's terrible. And bad, also.

53
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:11,790
I wasn't done.

54
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,899
Stand tall, New York.
Trustworthy. Recycling.

55
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,368
Wear a condom.

56
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,573
Wear a condom?

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,973
I'm not gonna be
the new Channel 10 anchor, am I?

58
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,016
This just in. No.

59
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,149
Maybe the problem is your resumé.

60
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,747
See how mine is lean and mean?
Yours is too cluttered.

61
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,418
Like everything on your resumé
is so relevant.

62
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:44,429
"Program Director,
88.1 Wesleyan University Radio?"

63
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,831
- Oh, God.
- Dr. X? You're still bragging about Dr. X?

64
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,301
- Who was Dr. X?
- Nobody knows.

65
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:54,567
- He was this genius mystery DJ.
- It was Ted.

66
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:58,041
- His identity remains a secret to this day.
- It was Ted.

67
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:01,238
But this phantom of the airwaves
changed the very face of college radio.

68
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,838
- It was Ted.
- And your show sucked.

69
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:08,949
<i>Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets
at you from an undisclosed location.</i>

70
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:12,114
<i>Because if they knew where I was,
they'd shut me down.</i>

71
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:16,388
You're on the third floor of the Student
Center next to the game room, you tool.

72
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,520
<i>I've been getting a lot of letters
about my segment</i>

73
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,292
<i>on how racist the school's meal plan is.</i>

74
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,460
How are you getting letters
if no one knows where you are, douche?

75
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,403
<i>That's why I'm organizing a happening
outside the dining hall,</i>

76
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>Monday at midnight.</i>

77
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,206
<i>It's high time
the food service puppet masters</i>

78
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:34,278
<i>took ignorance and injustice off the menu.</i>

79
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,073
<i>Hey, Ted,
we need a fourth for foosball.</i>

80
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,944
<i>What are you doing in here, anyway?</i>

81
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,917
<i>Dude, get out of here!
I'll be there in a second.</i>

82
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,613
<i>So, remember, dining hall,
Monday, midnight.</i>

83
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:47,088
<i>Another Dr. X happening.</i>

84
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:51,355
<i>I'll be there,
because X marks the spot-ot-ot-ot.</i>

85
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:56,321
If you think people liked your show,
they did not-ot-ot-ot.

86
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,424
This is weird. Look what got mixed in

87
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,059
- with your fan mail.
- What?

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,196
It's from the U.S. Department
of Immigration.

89
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,739
It's postmarked two months ago.

90
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,644
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,342
It's about my work visa.

92
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:19,911
Unless I can find a job
in the next seven days,

93
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:22,650
they're gonna send me back to Canada.

94
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,865
I can't believe
you might be kicked out of the country.

95
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,595
I know. My whole life is here.

96
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:37,831
No. We won't let this happen.
I mean, one of us will help you find a job.

97
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,272
Yeah, I bet I can get you
something at my school.

98
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,969
No, guys. It doesn't work that way.

99
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:46,979
Robin only gets her work visa
if she gets a job in her field.

100
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:51,108
I mean, you know what? I guess you
could stay if you married a U.S. citizen.

101
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,483
Yeah, that could work.

102
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:57,820
No, no. They could never process that and
make it official in time. That won't work.

103
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:01,862
I'm screwed. I've been sending out
my reel for three months, and nothing.

104
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,931
Well, maybe there's something in your reel
that people aren't responding to.

105
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,659
Let's take a look at it, right?

106
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,334
<i>That's a good question, Norm.</i>

107
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:16,603
Okay, the first thing is from when I was
a cub reporter for Channel 22 in Red Deer.

108
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,372
In Alberta. In Canada.

109
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,105
Ooh.

110
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,806
- Canada.
- Right.

111
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,146
<i>Well, the snow's coming down pretty hard,</i>

112
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,482
<i>but these intrepid fishermen are
still happy to be out competing,</i>

113
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:34,082
<i>in Lake Athabasca's Bass
Fishing Jamboree, an August 1st tradition.</i>

114
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,922
<i>Back to you, Norm.</i>

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,796
What? That was my first job.
It shows where I came from.

116
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,132
Unless a bear attacks you
in the next three seconds

117
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:48,764
and you snap its neck with your legs,
that has no business being on your reel.

118
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:51,706
No, no, I get it, I get it.

119
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,971
Where you're from
is part of who you're selling.

120
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,309
For instance,
under Special Skills on my resumé,

121
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,279
I mention that back in Minnesota,

122
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,817
I was the 1995 Nicollet County
Slam Dunk Champion.

123
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,410
You put dunk champion on your resumé?

124
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,048
Yeah, why wouldn't you?
A lot of companies have basketball teams.

125
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:08,648
It's good for them to know

126
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,490
that Vanilla Thunder
can still take the rock to the hole.

127
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:15,497
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?
- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.

128
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,090
The Ghost in the Post.
The Human Turnstile.

129
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,966
I didn't play that much D.

130
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:24,336
- You can't still dunk.
- Of course I can.

131
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:28,605
- Well, I mean, I could, until recently.
- Until the injury.

132
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:33,010
- It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.
- Yikes. That sounds bad.

133
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,881
It's more commonly known
as dancer's hip.

134
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,480
Dr. Goodman...

135
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:46,223
Oh, come on! lliopsoas tendonitis.

136
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,093
That's what it's called.
That's all it's called.

137
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:51,732
Iliopsoas tendonitis.

138
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,860
It's a basketball injury.
You know, it's no big whoop.

139
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:57,371
Dancer's hip, Marshall has
something called dancer's hip.

140
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:58,735
Okay, no, no, okay.

141
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:03,504
They only call it that, look, because
it's very common with ballet dancers.

142
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:09,841
So, tell me, do any of the other little girls
in your class have dancer's hip?

143
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:10,918
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,418
- I have more of a technical question.
- Yes?

145
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:15,979
Is it easier to dance
when you don't have external genitalia?

146
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,685
Good, don't build to that,
just go right for it.

147
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:22,025
Guys, come on.
Marshall didn't get this injury from dancing.

148
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,528
Thank you, Lily.

149
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:28,933
Clearly, the stirrups were set a little
too wide during his last trip to the gyno.

150
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:33,336
Guys, guys, I hate to cut you off
before Marshall bursts into tears,

151
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:39,607
but, Robin, check this out. What you need
is an awesome video resumé.

152
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:44,013
Like mine. I present

153
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:47,382
barneysvideoresume. com.

154
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,435
Oh! Hello.

155
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:06,835
<i>Barney Stinson,</i>

156
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,374
<i>you've achieved great success in business,</i>

157
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:14,640
<i>athletics and personal relationships and
have been an inspiration to many people.</i>

158
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,882
Is that you? Are you interviewing yourself?

159
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:22,511
How can it be me? That guy's British.

160
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,749
<i>What would you recommend
to your numerous admirers</i>

161
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,224
<i>who want to reach their highest potential?</i>

162
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,659
And a wee bit Scottish.

163
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:35,755
The first thing you need to know about
success is that it doesn't just come to you.

164
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:41,899
Most people associate success with money
and power, but really, it's a state of mind.

165
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:47,502
You had to be on a motorcycle to say that?

166
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:52,072
And when it comes to success,
the only limit is that there are no limits.

167
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,680
Hey, I didn't know you knew how to
stand near a horse, that's impressive.

168
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:58,948
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do
a damn thing in any of these clips.

169
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,785
Exactly. Because that's who
Corporate America wants,

170
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:06,522
people who seem like bold risk takers,
but never actually do anything.

171
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,326
Actually doing things gets you fired.

172
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:12,492
In fact, I'm writing a book
on this very phenomenon.

173
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:13,694
Really, you're writing a book?

174
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:17,295
No, that would be doing...
Are you even listening?

175
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:23,136
All my life, I have dared
to go past what is possible.

176
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,577
<i>To the impossible?</i>

177
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,808
Actually, past that,

178
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:34,015
to the place where the possible
and the impossible meet to become

179
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:35,818
the possimpible.

180
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,656
The possimpible? Really?

181
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:42,390
Inventing your own word
shows creativity and vision.

182
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,158
Visativity.

183
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:50,265
If I can leave you with one thought,
it's this,

184
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:55,001
nothing and everything is possimpible.

185
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,345
<i>Barney Stinson, Barney Stinson</i>

186
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:00,175
<i>That guy's awesome</i>

187
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:04,240
Is that you again?
Are you singing a song about yourself?

188
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:07,115
Absolutely not. That would be lame.

189
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:12,558
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson
singing this song</i>

190
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,286
<i>That would be really lame</i>

191
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:17,921
<i>One of the many admirers
who think that guy's awesome</i>

192
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,963
<i>Perfect and available</i>

193
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:23,901
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome, awesome</i>

194
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:26,664
<i>Awesome! Awesome!</i>

195
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,765
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome, awesome</i>

196
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,433
<i>Awesome!</i>

197
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,381
That baby got me 11 job offers.

198
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,219
- No. No way.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:50,523
- Barney, that was ridiculous and insane.
- Insane-ulous.

200
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,362
- Make me one.
- What?

201
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,399
- Yes, now you're talking.
- What?

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,162
I'm about to be deported. I'll try anything.

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,431
Okay, we better get started.
There's a lot to shoot,

204
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,098
and I don't think I can use any
of the footage I already have of you.

205
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,041
What footage do you already have of me?

206
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:08,135
Let's just get started.

207
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:14,884
Sweetie, are you still upset
about the dancer's hip jokes?

208
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,509
No.

209
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,783
We were just kidding.
We all know it's a basketball injury.

210
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,619
Yeah, no, totally.

211
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:28,429
- Lily, I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it?

212
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,794
I dance more than you know.

213
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:38,402
- What?
- I dance, more than you know.

214
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,704
I don't know how to respond to that.

215
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:49,283
So, Robin, what does
being a reporter mean to you?

216
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:53,255
- Well, ever since I was a little kid...
- Cut!

217
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,250
Robin, you're getting bogged down
in specifics.

218
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,728
I need you to just say vague,
confident-sounding buzzwords,

219
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,199
like synergy and dynamism.
You can make up a word, like linkativity.

220
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:09,600
How will sounding like an idiot
get me hired anywhere?

221
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,730
Okay, fine. Don't do it.

222
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,071
Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of
exciting stories to cover back in Canada.

223
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,374
I just read that the mayor of Winnipeg's
nephew went ice fishing

224
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,607
and caught himself a 16-pound walleye.

225
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:25,210
"Reporting live from the worst place
in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. "

226
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,446
Okay, fine. Roll camera.

227
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,621
- Connectitude.
- Love it.

228
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,253
- Transformatation.
- Earn it!

229
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,888
Linkativity!

230
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,691
Yeah, linkativity's mine.

231
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:46,568
So, how much dancing
are we talking about?

232
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:51,076
I don't... I guess I'd say medium.

233
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:55,371
Why are you dancing so much,
and why don't I know about it?

234
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:58,815
It's something I do when I'm alone.
You know, like if something good happens,

235
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,909
I get excited and I need to move,
and I just...

236
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,013
I don't know. I don't want to
even talk about this anymore.

237
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,719
So that's how you injured your hip?

238
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:13,992
Hey, did you hear? They're giving us
a half day today. We can leave at 2:00.

239
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,531
Great! Thanks, Herm.

240
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:28,545
Barney, these costumes are ridiculous.

241
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:32,310
Plus, the Amazon warrior princess armor
gave me a rash.

242
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,478
Cards on the table, you weren't
the first lady to wear that in here.

243
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:39,682
But it conveyed power. And so will this.
What I need you to do now

244
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,816
is break these 15 bricks
with your forehead.

245
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,690
What? But you didn't do a damn thing
in your video.

246
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,924
You just stood near a horse
and sat on a motorcycle.

247
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,660
That's because I'm a man.
You're a woman.

248
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,736
The assumption
is that you can't do anything.

249
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:57,934
- But you have to prove society wrong.
- I can't break 15 bricks with my forehead.

250
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:02,470
Robin, it's not 1950 anymore. Yes, you can.

251
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,478
- I'm out of here.
- What? Why?

252
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:10,349
None of this is going to help me get a job.
I'm about to get kicked out of the country.

253
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:12,782
I know what I have to do.

254
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,588
Is this where the lottery girl auditions are?

255
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,424
Yeah, right here.

256
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:28,265
<i>So, kids, your Aunt Robin
had reached her low point.</i>

257
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,032
<i>She was auditioning to be the lottery girl.</i>

258
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,303
- And tonight's lotto numbers are...
- Hold it.

259
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,207
Say the line before you press the button.

260
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,837
- It builds the suspense.
- It builds the suspense.

261
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:40,074
Okay.

262
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,175
And tonight's lotto numbers are...

263
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,279
- Seventeen...
- Stop her.

264
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,359
- Hold it.
- Why did she say it like that?

265
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,157
It's like she's not even happy
about the 17 coming up.

266
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:59,324
- She seems mean.
- Yeah, she seems super-mean.

267
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,003
Can you take another run at 17 for us?

268
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,296
Seventeen.

269
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:08,637
Okay, I don't even understand
what she's doing.

270
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,444
- Let me try something.
- All right.

271
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:13,877
Try being a little more wry.

272
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,483
Wry? About the number 17?

273
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,417
- Wry, with a little bit of a...
- Twinkle.

274
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,920
...twinkle.

275
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,146
Seventeen.

276
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,651
That was great!

277
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,122
Hey, Marsh, I got you a light beer.

278
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,357
I know how you dancers
are always counting calories.

279
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,490
It's not funny, all right?

280
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,262
The doctor says if it gets any worse,
I might need surgery.

281
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,770
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?

282
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,739
You know who didn't do a lot
of operating on vaginas in college?

283
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,036
- Who?
- Dr. X.

284
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,373
- He did just fine!
- You know what?

285
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:50,916
Both of you geniuses need to take
that weak-ass crap off your resumés.

286
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:55,716
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,
and you cannot dunk anymore.

287
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,844
Let it go.

288
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,946
So Marshall and I
are the only people at this table

289
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,389
with weak-ass crap on their resumés?

290
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,427
What are you implying?

291
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,786
Oh. Oh, wow. I don't know!

292
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:09,958
Does the date July 4th, 1995
mean anything to you?

293
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,831
You son of a bitch.

294
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:22,275
Time! And the new champion, with
29 hot dogs, Lily "The Belly" Aldrin!

295
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,079
How is that relevant
to teaching kindergarten?

296
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:36,490
It teaches kids that
I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly.

297
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:40,894
- Yeah, but you can't do it anymore!
- You can't dunk anymore, lady-hips!

298
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:44,262
- How dare you! These hips can...
- Guys, guys!

299
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:48,760
I didn't even get the lotto girl gig.

300
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:51,169
I have to move back to Canada.

301
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,442
I can't believe this.

302
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,972
I remember the night
before I moved down here.

303
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,380
They threw a going-away party for me.

304
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:05,648
They gave me a camera so I could
take pictures and send them home.

305
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:10,623
And everyone was so sure
I was gonna be such a big success.

306
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,861
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

307
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:21,960
- What happened?
- Robin has to move back to Canada.

308
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,970
Oh, my God. How awful.

309
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,635
I mean, for one thing,
it's gonna be a really long commute.

310
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:29,232
What do you mean?

311
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,243
I finished your video resumé on my own,

312
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:33,609
messenger-ed it
to every station in the city.

313
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,842
A guy from Channel 8 called. He loved you.

314
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,613
- He wanted you to come in and audition.
- Oh, my God!

315
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,053
I told him no.
Robin Scherbatsky doesn't audition.

316
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:46,354
- He gives you the job or nothing.
- So I got the job?

317
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,928
No. He cursed me out and hung up.

318
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:53,856
But then Channel 12 called.
They also loved you.

319
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,733
They offered you a job
hosting their new morning talk show.

320
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,031
Barney, that's amazing!

321
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,766
- I told them to shove it.
- Dude!

322
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,638
Which only made them want you more.

323
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,736
So, they jacked up their offer by 10%.
Congratulations, Miss Scherbatsky.

324
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,315
It looks like you're gonna have to stay.

325
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,123
- You're not about to dance, are you?
- No, I'm good. I'll do it later.

326
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,027
Oh, my God. How did you pull this off?

327
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:31,501
- I am the master of the possimpible.
- You really are. Thank you.

328
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,331
<i>So,
thanks to your Uncle Barney,</i>

329
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,375
<i>we got to keep your Aunt Robin.</i>

330
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,568
<i>There's so much stuff in my life</i>

331
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,344
<i>No room for me to grow</i>

332
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:50,348
<i>And the rest of us decided
it was time to let some things go.</i>

333
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,427
<i>Well, except for Lily.</i>

334
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:02,231
- And time!
- What's the count?

335
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,327
Thirty-three!

336
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,961
<i>Under the waterfall</i>

337
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,902
<i>Under the waterfall</i>

338
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,738
<i>It's cool and cold and clear</i>

339
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,063
Why is no one coming to my happenings?
