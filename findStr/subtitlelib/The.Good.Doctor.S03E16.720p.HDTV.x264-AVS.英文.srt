18
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,420
Early 60s, found prone on the sidewalk,

19
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,500
appears to have chest pain, maybe broken ribs,

20
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,950
- possible heart attack. - Did you fall?

21
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,880
She's very disoriented, hasn't said a thing.

22
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,030
Coley?

23
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,590
No, I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

24
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,460
Will you help me, Coley?

25
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,870
I have to -- it's my job.

26
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,660
She has stridor. Checking her pulse.

27
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,710
Radial pulse is normal.

28
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,020
But much weaker in her leg.

29
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,040
She has a descending thoracic aneurysm.

30
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,650
Page Dr. Melendez to the O.R.!

31
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,000
I just woke up on the front campus lawn

32
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,070
covered in blood,

33
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,810
with a skateboard next to me.

34
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,330
But... I can't skateboard.

35
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,460
Obviously.

36
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,850
Were you drinking, Aiden?

37
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,010
Or smoking something?

38
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,790
No to both.

39
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,080
There are actually college students who abstain.

40
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,900
You are incredibly lucky --

41
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,820
half an inch in any direction,

42
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,150
and you would've bled out.

43
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,490
Aortic wall's tearing.

44
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,520
Can't expect pristine

45
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,390
in a 60-year-old possibly homeless woman.

46
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,830
Drop to a 5-0 suture.

47
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,870
Not great, but better.

48
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
Let's see if it holds.

49
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,070
Remove proximal clamp.

50
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,100
No leakage.

51
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,360
Let's finish the repair.

52
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,230
Carly broke up with me.

53
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm sorry, Shaun.

54
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,420
What happened?

55
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,780
I thought you two were doing great.

56
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,330
We were. Then I guess we weren't.

57
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,530
Cross-clamping.

58
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,610
You must really be hurting?

59
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,540
N-no. I'm fine.

60
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,110
We've all been through it.

61
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,200
And, trust me, it helps when you own that you're in pain.

62
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,850
There's nothing for me to own.

63
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,390
She's having epistaxis.

64
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,470
Carotid aneurysm rupture -- two French Foley catheters.

65
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,620
Give protamine stat.

66
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,150
68/44.

67
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,130
Holding pressure on both carotids at the neck.

68
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,800
Inflate.

69
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
41/28.

70
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,980
She's still bleeding internally.

71
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,350
Okay, four units of PRBCs and start TXA.

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,460
Loading 700 milligrams TXA.

73
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,420
No distal perfusion.

74
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,240
We have to clamp her carotids. Ten blades.

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,310
Suction, clamps, let's go!

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,780
I can't see a thing.

77
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,380
Her blood volume's on the floor.

78
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,620
Time of death, 10:22 a.m.

81
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,550
Jane shouldn't have died --

82
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,020
not then, not like that.

83
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,630
Her carotid blew out. What am I missing?

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,660
Patients die, Dr. Murphy.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,620
That's something else we have to own.

86
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,490
Your next patient's waiting in the E.R.

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,610
How are you feeling, Aiden?

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,530
Awesome...

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,770
considering whatever you did to me.

90
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,370
Surgery went well.

91
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,400
Hey, I'm alive, doped up,

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,710
talking to two very attractive doctors.

93
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,030
I guess this is what happens

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,860
when you mix weed with my skateboarding skills.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,670
You said you didn't do drugs.

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Or skateboard.

97
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,180
When did I say that?

98
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,730
When we met you in the E.R.

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,340
I've never seen you guys before in my life.

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,520
Trust me, I'd remember.

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,770
I'd like to order an autopsy on Jane.

102
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,370
We went over this --

103
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,810
there was nothing suspicious about her death.

104
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,450
Oh, I was asking the Chief of Surgery.

105
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,540
I know the case,

106
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,260
and I agree with Dr. Melendez.

107
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,090
I'm not authorizing an autopsy.

108
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,040
Jane's vascular walls --

109
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,500
It's hard to lose a patient.

110
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,650
Almost as hard as losing a girlfriend.

111
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm okay, and I don't know why no one believes me --

112
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,690
isn't it okay to be okay?

113
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,930
Not when something bad happens.

114
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,360
We should feel hurt.

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,320
If you won't approve the autopsy,

116
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,320
I'll get it from Jane's family.

117
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,400
Good luck with that.

118
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,460
According to the files, Jane's last name was Doe.

119
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,740
Y-you're saying I'm having some kind of blackouts?

120
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,870
Which could be caused by head trauma or drug use.

121
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,210
I'm definitely aware of telling you

122
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,010
that I don't take drugs.

123
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,020
I live like a monk --

124
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,640
sleep, class, study, repeat.

125
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,550
That's it.

126
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,850
You've also told us the exact opposite.

127
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,900
I need to find Jane's family

128
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,110
to get their permission to perform an autopsy.

129
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,420
Dr. Lim wished me luck,

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,530
but Jane has no I.D., no purse, no phone.

131
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,570
We know absolutely nothing about her.

132
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,370
This should be interesting to you.

133
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,010
You used to be a detective.

134
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,390
And now I'm a doctor,

135
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,690
and so are you, and we both have a new case.

136
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,960
A boring case.

137
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,010
He has gallstones.

138
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,200
So, you and Melendez sneaking around again?

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,420
I hear he's back to being a good mentor.

140
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,800
Apparently, my complaint changed nothing.

141
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,370
You?

142
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,960
Park said he did it.

143
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,280
Park was lying.

144
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,600
Because he wanted to get you to focus on work.

145
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,170
Good motive, bad judge of character.

146
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,720
And you don't like that Melendez has gone back

147
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,950
to being a good mentor?

148
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,930
I don't like that he likes you.

149
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,930
I don't like that, because he likes you,

150
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,120
Shaun, Park, and I are second-class residents.

151
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,190
For someone as cynical as you are,

152
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,090
you are shockingly naive.

153
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,550
I'll tell you what you did.

154
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,870
You threw a bomb, because you felt slighted.

155
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,990
You made Melendez doubt himself,

156
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,380
doubt his judgment.

157
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,150
You made him resent you, Park, Shaun, and me.

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,130
I like to think it's that easy

159
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,680
to change the status quo.

160
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,670
But I am pretty naive.

161
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,610
I am with Dr. B on this.

162
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,410
Sorry.

163
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,950
Office politics.

164
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,210
Thought you were asleep.

165
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,360
Watching brain waves can't be too thrilling.

166
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
Not when they're as normal as yours.

168
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,650
Except these delta waves.

169
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,630
They mean you're still asleep.

170
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,170
Not planning on doing any cutting, I hope.

171
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,080
Jane had a knee replacement using an LCS system,

172
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
which means it's at least 30 years old.

173
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,620
She also had an abnormal number

174
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,260
of cavities, crowns, and implants.

175
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
These are clues, right?

176
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,540
I don't think this is about you losing a patient.

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,230
I think you're distracting yourself.

178
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,590
You don't want to let Jane go

179
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,360
because you don't want to let Carly go.

180
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,790
What?

181
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,710
You're a doctor now.

182
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,250
You won't find it interesting.

183
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,330
A hummingbird.

184
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,430
Am I right?

185
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,760
The police keep a database of all distinguishing marks.

186
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,100
Jane Doe, homeless --

187
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,290
there's no way she was never in the system...

188
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,990
How's Mr. Ginley?

189
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,020
Your gallbladder case you should be working on?

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Uh, we confirmed the presence of gallstones

191
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,370
and have scheduled a cholecystectomy.

192
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,560
It's a very simple case and requires no work.

193
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,580
With that attitude,

194
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,000
you could end up sending another patient to the morgue.

195
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,160
Focus on the living.

196
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,510
He's right. We need to bail on this.

197
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,570
Hey, Shaun.

198
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,250
You and Carly shared a lot of firsts.

199
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,350
That must make it harder to move on.

200
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,510
I had a lot of firsts with Lea, too.

201
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,850
Yeah, you did. And you moved on.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,250
Didn't you?

203
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,230
How do you move on?

204
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,370
Hey, Kenny, I need a name.

205
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,770
We need to keep this on the DL.

206
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,810
We're going undercover.

207
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,020
Causes of sleepwalking run the gamut

208
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,890
from the serious,

209
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,240
like MS, encephalitis, and brain tumors,

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,170
to the mundane, like alcohol and drug use,

211
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,190
poor sleep hygiene, and stress.

212
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,780
Problem is, to rule some of those out,

213
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,120
we need a full patient history,

214
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,850
but asleep Aiden and awake Aiden each have their own story.

215
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,960
So interview them both.

216
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,650
Take a medical history from a patient when they're asleep?

217
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,470
I've never heard of a lying sleepwalker.

218
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,150
I got to go.

219
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,890
Stress?

220
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,570
I have to maintain a 4.2 GPA.

221
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,290
W-what do you think?

222
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,870
You have to care about something to be stressed, don't you?

223
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,150
And since I'm getting a 4.2 without trying...

224
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,730
Maybe a glass of wine at a party.

225
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,060
I just microdose...

226
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,850
you know, whenever I'm not macrodosing.

227
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,390
Do you nap, exercise before bedtime?

228
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,250
I never nap, I work out five days a week --

229
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,400
never too close to bedtime, which is midnight,

230
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,650
12:30 at the latest.

231
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,460
I am surrounded by 5,000 women.

232
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,390
Yes, right before bedtime.

233
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,240
That explains the headaches I've been waking up with.

234
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,590
I never thought that they were hangovers.

235
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,050
He's a Cro-Magnon.

236
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,530
He's not me.

237
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,650
He can't be.

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,820
Maribel Ventane.

241
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,130
"Sharing the Spirit.

242
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,750
Marco, Maribel, and their 5-year-old son, Jules,

243
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,160
open their doors to host the fourth annual fundraiser 

244
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,620
'Friends in Need.'"

245
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,540
"Maribel Ventane, 33,

246
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,690
was one jump away from a first-place ribbon."

247
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,470
"She suffered severe orthopedic injuries."

248
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,630
"After two years in family court,

249
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,290
Maribel Ventane, 36,

250
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,910
and ex-husband Marco Ventane, 43 ..."

251
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,030
"Mr. Ventane was given full custody

252
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,490
of their 11-year-old son, Jules."

253
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,020
"Marco Ventane, 63, passed away in his home.

254
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,840
He is survived by his son, Jules Ventane, 32."

255
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,300
I found him.

257
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,080
Are you Jules Ventane?

258
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,240
Yes.

259
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,340
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy,

260
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,730
and I recently treated your mother, Maribel.

261
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,140
She died on the operating table.

262
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,180
I would like your permission to do an autopsy.

263
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,850
We're very sorry for your loss.

264
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,230
She came in with a ruptured aortic aneurysm,

265
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,010
and there wasn't much we could do.

266
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,690
But we would like to be absolutely certain

267
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,050
about her cause of death.

268
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,490
I don't care how she died.

269
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,820
Remember we talked about moving on?

270
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,230
This is the time to do that.

271
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,250
Where do we stand with the Aidens?

272
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,420
Between the two alters,

273
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,380
they engage in just about every single behavior.

274
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,330
So, we go back to Dr. Lim's list.

275
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,820
Maybe we should be looking at paraneoplastic syndromes.

276
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,080
May want to consider psychiatric issues --

277
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,160
could be having psychotic or dissociative episodes.

278
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,280
I have a fair amount of personal experience

279
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,150
with people with psychiatric issues.

280
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,020
If he had psychosis, I'd have picked up on it.

281
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,540
How about thyrotoxicosis?

282
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,770
No irritability, agitation.

283
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,480
Paraneoplastic syndromes trigger a loss of coordination,

284
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,030
- which could have caused -- - actually, our personal experiences

285
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,420
make us less effective in spotting symptoms.

286
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,110
You know I always make an effort

287
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,740
to be as objective as possible.

288
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,170
Well, you're not this time.

289
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,870
The vast majority of cases of paraneoplastic syndromes

290
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,350
present with antibodies.

291
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,990
His labs show a normal serum panel.

292
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,570
The "Vast majority" of all diseases

293
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,130
don't present with competing entities day and night.

294
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,570
- I'm just giving an idea. - No, you're undermining mine.

295
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,120
Fine. Your idea's brilliant. Go waste your time on it.

296
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,200
Thank you both.

297
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,840
Get an MRI to rule out brain tumors and MS,

298
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,250
an LP for encephalitis,

299
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,230
and a CSF panel to check for paraneoplastic syndromes.

300
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,020
And a psych consult.

303
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,820
No.

304
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm Dr. Lim.

305
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,900
And you are?

306
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,670
Trinity.

307
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,110
Where are your parents?

308
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,560
My mother's in the maternity ward.

309
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,820
She's having a baby?

310
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,390
Already did. A girl.

311
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
Wonderful.

312
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,700
So, why the wandering?

313
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,540
My mom sent me to the cafeteria to get a snack,

314
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,670
but I got lost.

315
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,090
Three times?

316
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,310
Hey, Lucy. We're looking for, um...

317
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,690
Trinity!

318
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,800
Please call security.

319
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,370
Stop the car.

320
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,000
No.

321
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,900
Shaun! Shaun!

322
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,530
I need your permission!

323
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,770
Don't do this, Shaun! No!

324
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,370
- I need your permission! - Let it go, Shaun!

325
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,740
It can't be over!

326
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,530
- It can't be over! - It's over! You have to let Carly go!

327
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,420
No! No! You have to let Carly go!

328
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,770
No! You have to let Carly go!

329
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,120
It's not about Carly!

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,950
Well, it's not about this, either!

331
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,930
It is not about Carly! He's calling the police!

332
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,700
- No! Open the door! - You'll get arrested!

333
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,950
Open the door!

334
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,630
Shaun, he's calling the police!

335
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,270
Come here!

336
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,920
- No! - Shaun!

337
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,020
Open the --

338
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,790
Oh, my God.

339
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,270
Shaun, are you okay?

340
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,020
It was bad. I missed my surgery.

341
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,150
Well, don't worry about that.

342
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,460
Park's there. Everything there is fine.

343
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,100
Will I have to go back to jail?

344
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,490
No. No.

345
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,550
It's a good thing you were with an ex-cop.

346
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,780
The guy's not gonna press any charges,

347
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,790
but you're not allowed to be anywhere near him ever again.

348
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,960
Here.

349
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
Let's get out of here, huh?

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,380
Park says that you are upset about Carly.

351
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,160
Everyone keeps telling me that,

352
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,460
but I am not upset about Carly,

353
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,950
and they need to stop.

354
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay, so, this isn't about Carly.

355
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
I wish Carly didn't break up with me.

356
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,320
But she did.

357
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,850
And now I have to do what she said.

358
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,260
What do you mean you have to do what she said?

359
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,170
She doesn't get to dictate to you.

360
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,720
She told me to tell Lea I love her.

361
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,830
And you're afraid of what might happen

362
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,910
if you told Lea the truth?

363
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,280
If I tell her I love her

364
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,770
and she tells me she doesn't,

365
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,980
then I can't be her boyfriend.

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,020
And even worse, I...

367
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,060
I don't think I can be her friend, either.

368
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,140
And what if Lea were to say...

369
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,640
"You know what, Shaun? I love you, too"?

370
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,070
Pretty disturbing,

371
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,450
having this weird personality creeping out of me.

372
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,640
Does he represent something I'm suppressing

373
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,020
and need to express

374
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,590
or something I need to bury forever?

375
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,610
If it's any consolation, I kind of like him.

376
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,510
I think he's just trying to enjoy himself.

377
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,900
Except he's sabotaging

378
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,780
all the hard work of his waking self.

379
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,370
It's not sabotage. It's just a part of who he is.

380
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,270
Some parts of who we are suck.

381
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,070
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,960
I shouldn't have ratted on you and Melendez.

383
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,200
I screwed things up.

384
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,780
But this guy needs a drink every now and again.

385
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,580
You see that?

386
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,370
Yeah.

387
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,230
You have an arachnoid cyst compressing your hypothalamus, Aiden.

388
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,590
We basically just need to drain it.

389
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,800
W-will it kill me if you don't?

390
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,410
He knows the risks?

391
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,200
He knows it won't kill him,

392
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,650
which is enough for Jekyll to decide to keep Hyde alive.

394
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,570
What if we ask Hyde?

395
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,210
I'm pretty sure consent needs

396
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,510
to be informed, voluntary, and conscious.

397
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,920
It also doesn't matter. AsleepAiden's a hedonist.

398
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,260
He's not gonna make a decision against his interest

399
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,340
just to help his alter.

400
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,160
Maybe he cares more than you think.

401
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,500
Okay.

402
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,590
Dr. Lim?

403
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,800
Thank you.

404
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,140
Trinity, have a seat.

405
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,870
There's no one in our maternity ward

406
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,570
with a daughter named Trinity.

407
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,610
So, I'm gonna need some information,

408
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,490
and it will be much more efficient

409
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,990
if it's the truth.

410
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,580
First and last name.

411
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,290
Trinity.

412
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,790
Last name?

413
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,380
Okay.

414
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,090
Will you at least tell me what you're doing in this hospital?

415
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,220
I just wanted to meet you again.

416
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,860
Someone left a baby girl at the E.R. about eight years ago,

417
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,110
on Trinity Sunday.

418
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,160
You were so tiny,

419
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,580
so sick, and so helpless.

420
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,500
Killed me not to take you home.

421
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,920
But look at you now, so strong and healthy.

422
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,840
And fast.

423
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,570
You know we need to call your mother

424
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,060
and let her know where you are.

425
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,310
That you're okay.

426
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,890
You know her number?

427
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,980
Yes, but...

428
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,610
But?

429
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,150
Can you adopt me?

430
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,890
Shaunie.

431
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,410
You poor thing.

432
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,570
I'm so sorry about you and Carly.

433
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,780
I want to tell you how I feel.

434
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,970
I know you're hurting.

435
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,270
Carly made a huge mistake.

436
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,020
You're a wonderful man, Shaun.

437
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,860
Maybe the most wonderful man I've ever met.

438
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,870
Lea?

439
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,530
Yeah, Shaun?

441
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,840
I found that in my mother's drawer.

442
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,260
Does she know you're here?

443
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,390
She's been in Campbell Memorial for the last two days.

444
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,980
She thinks I've been in school

445
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,410
and at a friend's.

446
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,160
As long as I'm home by 6:00,

447
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,940
no one knows the difference.

448
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,520
Mm, well, it's past that.

449
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,690
I'm sure she's worried.

450
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,950
She has a new daughter.

451
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,410
It's hard to share your mom, isn't it?

452
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,710
If she loves your sister with all her heart,

453
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,590
it doesn't feel like it'd leave much room for you.

454
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,680
Do you love your mom with all your heart?

455
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,490
How about your dad?

456
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,100
You love him with all your heart, too?

457
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,690
But that doesn't seem possible, does it?

458
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,400
Hearts are amazing things.

459
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,940
I've held one in my hands many times.

460
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,910
You'd never know it by looking at them, but

461
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,700
somehow... they have all the room we need.

462
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,760
Dr. B.

463
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,220
Please tell me you're single.

464
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,230
You have a cyst in your brain.

465
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,790
If we leave it as is, it could expose you

466
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,380
to considerable neurological complications --

467
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,720
potential visual loss,

468
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,870
endocrine abnormalities, depression.

469
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,220
But if we drain and treat the cyst,

470
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,870
there should be no complications.

471
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,670
Including sleepwalking.

472
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,260
The Professor already rejected treatment?

473
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,990
So you're asking the Frat Boy

474
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,100
to fall on his sword for him?

475
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,370
I think the Frat Boy

476
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,360
is more than just a Frat Boy.

477
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,780
We're all complicated.

478
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,990
We're all sometimes superficial, selfish jerks.

479
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,830
But we're also capable of sacrifice.

480
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,640
I think you live in him

481
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,580
the same way he lives in you.

482
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,650
And that won't change,

483
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,760
no matter what decision you make.

484
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,890
Shaun.

485
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,020
Maribel died.

486
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,250
I think she had polycystic kidney disease,

487
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,420
which is associated with dilation of the arteries,

488
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,170
which results in weakened vascular walls,

489
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,050
which in turn contributes to the formation of aneurysms.

490
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,620
I need to do an autopsy.

491
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,340
Dr. Melendez --

492
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,560
Didn't approve. Dr. Lim didn't approve.

493
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,720
- The family said no. - So, what can I --

494
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,290
You're the head of pathology.

495
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,310
Shaun, I'm not going to --

496
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,720
I can't do what you told me I should do.

497
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,930
Until I solve this distraction.

499
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,320
No sign of polycystic kidney disease.

500
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,180
I know that this break-up has been hard on you.

501
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,800
It's been hard on me, too.

502
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,810
But I know what I saw between you and Lea.

503
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,570
I did see something, didn't I?

504
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,620
I love you, Carly.

505
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,420
But you were right. I love Lea more.

506
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,140
Okay.

507
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,730
So...

508
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,350
you know you have to tell her, right?

509
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,570
I'm scared.

510
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,650
I know.

511
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,700
But look at how far you've come with me --

512
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,120
how scared you were.

513
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
How brave you were.

514
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,440
I have to go.

515
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,040
Thank you, Carly.

516
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,530
If you're watching this, it means I'm dead.

517
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,350
And you're waking up from a surgery

518
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,850
you think you didn't consent to,

519
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,930
but I hereby proffer my full and informed consent

520
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,900
to said surgical procedure.

521
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,300
Signed Aiden...Michael... Porter.

522
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,760
The second.

523
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,640
Uh, just one -- one more thing.

524
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,110
My advice...

525
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,650
is to try to chillax a little.

526
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,910
Neither of us is perfect.

527
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,040
But...we're okay.

528
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,590
We are gonna be...

529
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,220
okay.

530
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,890
And that girl

531
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,620
who sits in front of you in Advanced Calculus,

532
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,730
her name is Staci with an "i," and she likes you.

533
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,020
Way more than she likes me.

534
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,870
Peace out...Professor.

535
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,860
You're kidding me, right?

536
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,450
I know why your mother died.

537
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,230
And I said I didn't care.

538
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,660
When I examined her liver,

539
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,160
I found three aneurysms in her hepatic artery,

540
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,080
which is very unusual and made me realize

541
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,290
she has Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

542
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,580
It's a very rare disease

543
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,380
that often goes undiagnosed and can be fatal.

544
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,590
Are you really gonna make me call the police again?

545
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,590
It's hereditary.

546
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,340
No, I don't want to get arrested again,

547
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,260
but do you have an excess of cavities?

548
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,850
You might have inherited Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

549
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,640
from your mother,

550
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,930
and your life could be in danger.

551
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,670
But its symptoms can be treated.

552
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,840
Okay, goodbye.

553
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,180
So, that's all I got from my mother?

554
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,060
A potentially deadly disease?

555
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,280
Did your mother ever call you "Coley"?

556
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,870
Yeah.

557
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,040
Short for "Colibri,"

558
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,250
the French word for hummingbird.

559
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,880
She said I would flit around the house,

560
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,890
always going from one thing to another.

561
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,400
She had a hummingbird tattooed on her body.

562
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,070
And "Coley" was the last word she said.

563
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,870
She loved you.

564
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,170
M-maybe she was just afraid to tell you.

565
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,540
Morgan buy the fight? 

566
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,640
Is it weird how hard we have to work

567
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,430
to hide a platonic friendship?

568
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,920
Very. But it's worth it.

569
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,960
Hi, Mom.

570
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,960
Shaun?

571
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,480
What's up, Shaunie?

572
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,610
Shaun.

573
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,490
Please.

574
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,110
Talk to me.

575
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,120
I love you, Lea.

576
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,880
I want to be your boyfriend.

577
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,850
I love you, too.

578
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,070
But

579
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,110
y-you know me.

580
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,450
I am selfish, and I am so, so needy.

581
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,710
I-I'm...

582
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,140
I mean, listen to me right now.

583
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,930
I can't even put a complete sentence together.

584
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,420
I am a -- I'm a total mess.

585
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,510
How?

586
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,050
How am I supposed to, you know,

587
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,600
just lay all of that on you?

588
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:38,110
Why do you think I can't handle

589
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,210
your selfishness, neediness, and messiness?

590
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,440
I think I can.

591
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,780
It's just...

592
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm a challenge for anyone...

593
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,000
and you're...

594
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,250
you.

595
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,340
And I just know it would be too hard for you.

596
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,070
You need things a certain way.

597
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,300
You work in a certain way and...

598
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,980
Because...

599
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,730
I have autism?

600
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,690
You...

601
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,050
don't want to be my girlfriend

602
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,620
because I have autism?
