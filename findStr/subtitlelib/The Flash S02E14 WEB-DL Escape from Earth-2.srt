1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,935
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:05,938
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,974
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,714
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,649
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,953
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,323
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,559
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,528
<i>Previously, on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,263
<i>His name is Geomancer.</i>

12
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,132
I'm waiting on the man in red.

13
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,967
The Velocity-7's wearing off.

14
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,469
- You hurt?
- Only my pride.

15
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,371
Jesse's my daughter.
Zoom has her.

16
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,839
Daddy, please help me.

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,107
Don't let him take me, Daddy.

18
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,308
I told you we're a team.

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,610
Now you're a part of it.

20
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,211
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

21
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,212
<i>We're not sending you
through alone.</i>

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,547
<i>We're going to Earth-2.</i>

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,949
<i>Just remember what
Jay said, okay?</i>

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,150
<i>Things here are all
sorts of trippy.</i>

25
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,152
Caitlin...

26
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,552
If you knew me at all,

27
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,220
you would know that
I hate the name Caitlin.

28
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,689
I'm Killer Frost.

29
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,891
Look out!

30
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,326
Dad!

31
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,961
You killed my father,
you evil bitch.

32
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,064
You shouldn't have
palled around with a breacher.

33
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,932
- Flash, save us!
- No!

34
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,500
Zoom wanted him alive.

35
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:12,571
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him.

36
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,406
No!

37
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,341
Argh!

38
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,477
Look around, Flash.

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,348
This is the last place
you'll ever see.

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,321
<i>I know you're here,
Harrison Wells,</i>

41
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,991
<i>and you did not come alone.</i>

42
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,496
<i>You can try to hide...</i>

43
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:44,903
<i>But I'm the fastest man alive.</i>

44
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,476
<i>I will scour this city</i>

45
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,812
<i>until I hunt you down.</i>

46
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,681
<i>And when I do,</i>

47
00:01:55,683 --> 00:02:00,018
<i>all of you will feel my wrath.</i>

48
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,059
<i>CCPN is reporting that
Dr. Harrison Wells,</i>

49
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,760
<i>the infamous founder
of S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

50
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,529
<i>who uncharacteristically
has gone unseen</i>

51
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,132
<i>for nearly four months
is now a wanted man.</i>

52
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>These images and messages
went up moments ago</i>

53
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,270
<i>throughout Central City by Zoom.</i>

54
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,872
Have you seen channel 52?

55
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,940
You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.
Zoom's looking for you.

56
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,509
I know what he's doing.
Alert security.

57
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,511
Evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs.

58
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,044
Lock down the facility.

59
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,846
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me, Henry.

60
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,248
Just get everyone
out of here now.

61
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,517
Now! Go!

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,885
Harry!

63
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,253
Don't shoot!

64
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,155
Damn it, Ramon.

65
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,057
Where's Allen?

66
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,359
- Zoom took him.
- What?

67
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,094
We tracked down Deathstorm
and Killer Frost,

68
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,562
met my doppelganger, Reverb...

69
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,631
super evil guy,
super evil powers.

70
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,733
The three of them almost
took down Barry until

71
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,469
Zoom showed up,
killed Cisco-2,

72
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,337
killed Deathstorm for
hurting a speedster.

73
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,273
But then he left
Killer Frost alive

74
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,440
and then took off with Barry.

75
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,775
How are you still alive?

76
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,177
Looks like he cares
even less about me

77
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,179
than you do, Harry.

78
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,679
No, no.

79
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,347
Zoom doesn't do anything
by accident.

80
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,582
Did he follow you here?

81
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,683
I've seen "Heat"
like 50 times, okay?

82
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,884
I know how to shake a tail.

83
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:06,886
He didn't follow me.

84
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:07,819
But check this out.

85
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,154
I jacked these from
my dead ringer.

86
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,189
I think we can
tweak these puppies...

87
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,690
use them to find Zoom.

88
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,292
Damn it, Ramon,
we don't have time for this.

89
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,626
Zoom is hunting us...

90
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,261
Zoom is hunting us!

91
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,362
We need to make
an alternate plan,

92
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,664
because if we don't, Zoom...

93
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,499
Stop thinking like that, okay?

94
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,068
We're gonna find Jesse,
and we're gonna find Barry.

95
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,269
I know we will.

96
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,904
<i>Hello?
Is anyone there?</i>

97
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,473
<i>Okay, whoever's
responsible for this,</i>

98
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,409
<i>oh, ho, ho...</i>

99
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,110
<i>boy, we're gonna have words,</i>

100
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,478
<i>the two of us, okay?</i>

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,347
<i>This is...
this is not okay.</i>

102
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,548
Barry-2.

103
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,320
Dr. Wells,

104
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,955
this is very disappointing.

105
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,157
I mean, the two of you
should be ashamed of yourselves.

106
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,693
You can't just lock someone
in a room like this.

107
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,528
How long was I in here for?

108
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,298
Barely a day.

109
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,733
One day?

110
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,968
One day?

111
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,703
Oh, jeez, my wife's
gonna be worried sick.

112
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,404
- Dr. Wells.
- Yeah?

113
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,006
Doctor, I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

114
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,376
but my wife is
a very well-respected detective

115
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,677
in the Central City
Police Department.

116
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,247
She's got to be very upset.

117
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,249
Whoa, this is heavy.

118
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,251
It certainly is.

119
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,851
And I'm sorry, fellas,

120
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,420
but I demand to know
what the heck

121
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,822
is going on here this instant.

122
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,557
Barry, this is
a very long story.

123
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,891
One that we don't have time
to tell right now.

124
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,493
We're sorry we locked you
in that room

125
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,528
for a day, but right now,
you need to leave.

126
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,531
You need to gather...

127
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,566
He's here.

128
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,139
Do not move.

129
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,582
Ugh!

130
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:47,419
Where are Wells and his friends?

131
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,724
Dr. Wells, hey,
what the heck is going on?

132
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,159
Oh, Zoom's after us.

133
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,328
Zoom? What do...
Why would Zoom be after you?

134
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,329
That's part of that long story

135
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,397
I was telling you about.

136
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,399
I don't know if I can

137
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
deal with something like this.

138
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,167
- You have a time vault?
- Yeah.

139
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,036
I'm an enemy of Zoom,
and I need a place to hide

140
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,304
when something like
this happens.

141
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,505
- Get in!
- Yes, sir.

142
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,614
That's Zoom!
That's Zoom!

143
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,582
Ramon...

144
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,217
Shut him up.

145
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,070
Okay.

146
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,138
Breathe, breathe, breath,
breath...

147
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,440
Fake wall.

148
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,108
He's not gonna fall
for another fake wall.

149
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,142
We need to move.

150
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,544
We need to find
a different place to hide

151
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,778
and make a plan.

152
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,246
Wait, wait...
hey, hey, hey, hey.

153
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,348
No.

154
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,682
I think before we do anything,

155
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,584
you have to explain
to me everything

156
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,052
that is going on here.

157
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,431
You're wasting your time.

158
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,699
I used to think
I could escape too

159
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,501
when I first got here.

160
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,170
There's no way out.

161
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,176
Who is that?

162
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,845
I don't know.

163
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,982
He's been here since Zoom
brought me to this place.

164
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,487
Stop, okay?

165
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,956
Just... just please stop.

166
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,859
Jesse, I think he might
be trying to help us.

167
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,095
Nothing is gonna help us.

168
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,598
That's not true.

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,932
We're gonna get out of here.

170
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,034
Your dad's gonna find us,
I promise.

171
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,536
You sure have a lot of faith

172
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,172
in a man who only
cares about himself.

173
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,578
You know, I actually
thought that

174
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,181
at first too.

175
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,550
It's not true.

176
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,086
Every decision that he's made...

177
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:05,323
every action he's taken
since we've met...

178
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,058
has been to save you.

179
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,163
Your dad hasn't given up
on you, Jesse.

180
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,466
Don't give up on him.

181
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,204
Believe what you want,

182
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:23,141
but the only reason
that you're still alive

183
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,277
is so I can kill you

184
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,878
in front of your father.

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,415
And the only reason
your father's still alive...

186
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,421
Is to get me your speed.

187
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,625
Once he does that,

188
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,261
he will die too.

189
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,735
<i>Up after the break,</i>

190
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,003
<i>earthquake-causing meta-human</i>

191
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,772
<i>leaves citizens shaken
and wondering,</i>

192
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,674
<i>where is The Flash?</i>

193
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:56,741
It's finished.

194
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,510
Breach stabilized again.

195
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,612
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
have 20 hours to get back.

196
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,080
You're amazing.

197
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,049
When it comes to
stabilizing breaches, maybe...

198
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,751
not so much when it comes
to fighting meta-humans.

199
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,487
You were a little rusty.

200
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,888
I was too slow.

201
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,658
Geomancer's still out there,
Caitlin.

202
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,060
He has to be stopped.

203
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,695
I have to be ready in case
he attacks again.

204
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,296
How much longer till
the Velocity...

205
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,298
8.

206
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,066
Velocity-8 is ready?

207
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,801
I need to finalize
the compound...

208
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,170
make sure the extracellular
matrix stays intact

209
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,139
so you don't lose
your speed as fast.

210
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,209
Okay, great.

211
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,312
What is it?

212
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,581
After your last encounter
with Geomancer,

213
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,617
I ran some tests.

214
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,086
The Velocity-7 is reacting

215
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,088
with the damaged cells
in your body.

216
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,323
It's causing more
cellular degeneration.

217
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,425
Well, I have faith
that the next batch

218
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,660
won't do the same thing.

219
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,362
Jay, I can't keep
giving this to you

220
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,130
if it's hurting you.

221
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,965
If it'll help me
defeat Geomancer,

222
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,967
you might have to.

223
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,202
Till Barry gets back,

224
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,905
I may be the only chance
this city has.

225
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,110
I don't know how
this is possible,

226
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,578
but you somehow made basketball

227
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,846
sound more boring than baseball.

228
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,114
Fix this.

229
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,782
Scott Evans, your new editor.

230
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,118
- Oh, Iris...
- West, I know.

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,086
You wrote the story about
the recent Geomancer attack.

232
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,721
- Yeah, I did.
- I'm not running that.

233
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,390
What, why?

234
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,759
It's a fluff piece to try
to make people feel good.

235
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,928
What they need to know
is the truth;

236
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,598
The Flash might not always
be there to save them.

237
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,033
You disagree?

238
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,302
I think that he's saved
a lot of people

239
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,536
in this city.

240
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,571
But where is he now?

241
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,373
I need to run a real story.

242
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,741
Okay, uh...

243
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,243
what if I could get you
an exclusive

244
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,879
with the meta-human
that fought Geomancer?

245
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,049
This... this other Flash.

246
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:47,152
What, you friends with him too?

247
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,555
Just, um, give me a little time.

248
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,524
Fine, but if it's the same

249
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:53,858
as the other crap
that you wrote,

250
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,794
I'm gonna run something
about how The Flash

251
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,530
may not be the hero
we all dreamed he was.

252
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,342
Iris...
hey, Iris.

253
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,577
Barry, where were you
last night?

254
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,678
Oh, my God.

255
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,946
My father died yesterday,

256
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,715
and you never even came home.

257
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,650
I know, I know.
I heard.

258
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,652
I'm so, so sorry.

259
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,752
You... you heard?

260
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,387
You were there, Barry.

261
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,888
I actually was not there.

262
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,423
I'm... I'm gonna...
yeah, okay.

263
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,658
Okay, look.

264
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,993
Come to my lab.
Just come up to my lab.

265
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,394
I'm gonna explain
everything, okay?

266
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,262
I'm gonna explain it.

267
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,633
So the Barry from yesterday
was not you?

268
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,368
No.

269
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,702
No, look, I... I know

270
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,005
that this is hard to believe,

271
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,474
but I mean, it is just like
that sci-fi series,

272
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,409
"Commander Carl, Space Marshal
of the Galaxy,"

273
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,611
where Carl gets sucked
into a black hole

274
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,746
and ends up on another planet

275
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,014
that he thinks is Earth,

276
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,882
but really it's Earth...

277
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,052
of another universe.

278
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,920
Have... have you guys not s...

279
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,921
oh, it's a seminal episode.

280
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,857
You should check it out.

281
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,058
So that's why
you weren't wearing

282
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,693
your wedding ring yesterday.

283
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,061
Well...

284
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,330
And... and that...
that kiss was... was so...

285
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,432
I'm... I'm sorry.
He got frisky with you?

286
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,768
No, no, no, no, no.

287
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,002
Okay, I'm gonna have to
find this guy

288
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,170
and give him a piece of my mind.

289
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,571
Don't give him too much.

290
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,573
Your husband tells us
you've been tracking Zoom.

291
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,175
Yeah, I've been trying to.
Why?

292
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,010
- We need to find his lair.
- Lair?

293
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,578
He's a bad guy;
I'm calling it a lair.

294
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,946
Zoom is looking for you.

295
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,415
Why are you going after him?

296
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,983
Zoom has my daughter

297
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,819
and our Barry, and we need
to rescue them both.

298
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,621
Look, I want to find Zoom

299
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:32,457
just as much as anybody,
but no one can track him.

300
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,860
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

301
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,063
would be a meta that's
worked with him.

302
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,498
A meta like Killer Frost?

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,766
Yeah, maybe.

304
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,035
But Zoom kept her
alive yesterday

305
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,704
because she always obeys him.

306
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,039
There is no way that she's
gonna tell you where he is.

307
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,574
I'm not so sure about that.

308
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,178
If she loved Deathstorm as much
as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

309
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,248
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

310
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,919
Look, finding her is gonna be
just as hard as finding Zoom.

311
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,223
But if anyone can do it...

312
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,694
My husband can.

313
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,895
Right, yes.

314
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,897
I can, actually.

315
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,467
Um, all right.

316
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,906
Okay, well it looks like
Patty Spivot was a CSI tech

317
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,675
on most of
the Killer Frost cases.

318
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,376
She's pretty thorough, so...

319
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,378
What's that?

320
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,046
Oh, this is Killer Frost
meta-data

321
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,981
collected from numerous
crime scenes...

322
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,283
DNA trace movements,
facial recognition,

323
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,686
temperature fluctuations
specific to her.

324
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,921
My algorithm compiles
all the data

325
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,523
and gives us an approximate
location.

326
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,092
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom, of course.

327
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,262
He's too fast...
never leaves a trace.

328
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,563
Okay.

329
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:49,067
Looks like the best bet's
the woodlands.

330
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,802
Best CSI in Central City.

331
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,036
You know where that is, right?

332
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,139
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

333
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,406
Wait, I'm going with you guys.

334
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,808
- You're gonna need some help.
- Okay.

335
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,042
Iris, I...

336
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,577
Barry, Zoom and his followers

337
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,147
are the reason that
my father is dead.

338
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,883
If I can stop him from
killing anyone else,

339
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,885
I'm gonna try.

340
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,821
Okay, then I'm coming too.

341
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,690
- No.
- No.

342
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:17,328
Barry, this is not what you do.

343
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,264
I know that.

344
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,833
But I also know Joseph
didn't like me too much,

345
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,002
but he was my father-in-law.

346
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,070
If you're going,

347
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,705
I am coming with you.

348
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,377
All right.

349
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,513
You can come, but you stay
out of our way.

350
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,823
That's not Morse code.

351
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,294
I know he's trying to
tell us something.

352
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,497
We just have to
find the pattern.

353
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,672
There's no pattern, Barry.

354
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,579
You know, your dad,
who I'm pretty sure

355
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:11,082
is one of the smartest people
to live on either of our Earths,

356
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,819
told me the only person
smarter than him

357
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:18,456
was you.

358
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,724
He said that?

359
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,194
If that's true,

360
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,830
we work together...

361
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,966
I know we can figure this out.

362
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,805
Worth a shot?

363
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,110
Okay.

364
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,754
Well, he never goes past five.

365
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,389
What?

366
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,825
He never goes past five knocks
without pausing.

367
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,827
Right? Listen.

368
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,604
Hey, you're right.

369
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,776
I think...

370
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,244
I think I know what that is.

371
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,514
It's a five-by-five tap code
used by POWs.

372
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,483
That would only get us
to 25 letters,

373
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,084
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

374
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,719
Not if you combine C and K.

375
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,689
They sound the same.

376
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,890
Let's try it out.

377
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,497
- Worth a shot.
- All right.

378
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,934
There it is.

379
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,368
Looks different than before.

380
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,770
That's because I realized
that there was a flaw

381
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,204
with Velocity-8,

382
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,675
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix, and...

383
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,976
Velocity-9.

384
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,110
You know what they say:

385
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,512
ninth time's the charm.

386
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,580
Hey.

387
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,649
Hey, Iris.
You okay?

388
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,752
Yeah, I'm just a little
worried about the time.

389
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,421
Well, don't worry.

390
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,890
They'll make it back before
we close the breach.

391
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,159
Um, actually I was here

392
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,961
to talk to you about
something else.

393
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,262
Oh.
Yeah, sure.

394
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,396
What is it?

395
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,498
Well, my new editor

396
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,867
wants me to write
a scathing article

397
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,937
on The Flash not being able
to protect Central City

398
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,205
from Geomancer.

399
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,573
Really?

400
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,774
Yeah.

401
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,813
I was hoping to write
an article about you instead...

402
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,681
something that would calm people

403
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,917
until Barry got back.

404
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,385
You know, Iris,

405
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,320
I don't know if
that's the best idea.

406
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,989
Well, I think that if people

407
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,658
knew that there was someone
that could protect them,

408
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,959
it would...

409
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,261
it would really help.

410
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,698
Would you just think about it?

411
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,005
Some crazy alarm's going off.

412
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,740
Yeah.

413
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:51,275
<i>Don't even think about running.</i>

414
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,244
<i>There's a new Flash in town.</i>

415
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,247
<i>You know, the one with
the shiny helmet.</i>

416
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,783
<i>Not the speedster
I was hoping to crack,</i>

417
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,386
<i>but let's see just
how fast he is,</i>

418
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,388
<i>Central City.</i>

419
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,529
Give me the Velocity-9.

420
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,031
Jay, we have no idea
how long it will last.

421
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,083
We don't have time to
figure that out, Caitlin.

422
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,349
Jay?

423
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,651
I'm okay.

424
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,919
That just took a lot out of me.

425
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,022
But it sure felt good.

426
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,326
That was amazing, Jay.

427
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,128
Thanks. I kind of
surprised myself,

428
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,097
to be honest.

429
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,665
Caitlin deserves all the credit.

430
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,733
Looks like your Velocity-9's
a winner.

431
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,702
I still need to run some tests.

432
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,738
Iris, about the interview, um...

433
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,175
I think that I have
everything that I need.

434
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,311
Great.

435
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,047
'Cause I could really use a nap.

436
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,915
I'll, uh, be downstairs.

437
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,860
Two down, five across.

438
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,862
- It's J.
- J?

439
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:54,165
That's what you're tapping...
the letter J?

440
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,134
All right, what's next?

441
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,838
A.

442
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,006
All right.

443
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,343
Five down...

444
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,281
Four across.
Y.

445
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,183
J-A-Y?

446
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,485
You're spelling "Jay."

447
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,155
As in Jay Garrick?

448
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,524
He's... he's alive.

449
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,325
But he's on my Earth.

450
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,695
Hey, hey...

451
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,597
stop, stop...
hey...

452
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,698
stop...
look, I'm sorry.

453
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,333
I don't know what you mean.

454
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,470
Jay Garrick didn't come with us.

455
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,872
Look, just keep tapping, please.

456
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,175
We don't understand.

457
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,144
Please.

458
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:45,183
Don't talk to them again.

459
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,205
I'm gonna get out of here.

460
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,873
And I'm gonna destroy you.

461
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:14,879
All I need from you
is your speed, Flash.

462
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,348
And you only need
to be barely alive

463
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,951
for me to get it.

464
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,823
Stop!

465
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,031
Stop!

466
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,675
Barry...

467
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,411
Barry, are you okay?

468
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,980
Yeah.

469
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,216
I'm okay.

470
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,559
Zoom just showed me how to
get out of this thing.

471
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,103
You're sure this is the place?

472
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,476
This is definitely the place.

473
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,444
You lost?

474
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,613
Or just back for more fun?

475
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,282
We just came here to talk.

476
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,284
Oh, really?

477
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,486
Do you bring your little toys

478
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,655
to every conversation you have?

479
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,691
Or do you just want to
see me burn again?

480
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,260
Considering you killed
my father,

481
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,895
the thought has crossed my mind.

482
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,563
Tell us...

483
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,699
where does Zoom
keep his prisoners?

484
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,001
You really don't know
how to use your abilities,

485
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,136
do you, breacher?

486
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,772
It's a work in progress, Elsa.

487
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,612
Zoom killed the love
of your life.

488
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,380
This hurts,

489
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,883
even for somebody with
a heart as cold as yours.

490
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,786
And you think that would
make me turn on Zoom?

491
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,988
Enemy of my enemy
is my friend, right?

492
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,192
What... don't tell me it doesn't
work like that over here.

493
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,927
If I tell you,

494
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,129
he'll kill me.

495
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,165
But if I kill you

496
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,867
and take you to him,

497
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,471
I bet he'd be pretty
pleased with me.

498
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,608
Maybe even let me off my leash.

499
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,677
So take a wild guess.

500
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,946
What do you think
I'm gonna choose?

501
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,181
Move!

502
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,752
Argh!
That did not go as planned!

503
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,153
Her name starts with Killer.

504
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,356
This comes as a shock to you?

505
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,360
- We got to move now!
- Yeah, yeah.

506
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,828
- I will cover you.
- Okay.

507
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,463
No, no, no,
hey, that's a horrible idea.

508
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,398
Hey, no!
Hey, hey, no!

509
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,066
Hey, guys...

510
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,334
Where are we going?

511
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,669
Where are we going?
Oh, God.

512
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,343
Argh!

513
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,317
Argh!

514
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,319
Stop...

515
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,654
or you'll never make
another icicle again.

516
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,739
I can't believe it.

517
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,008
What is it?

518
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,944
I think I figured out
how to save Jay's life.

519
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,181
Hey, Jay...
uh, wake up.

520
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:40,251
Come to the cortex.
It's important.

521
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,720
It certainly is.

522
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,324
What do you want?

523
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,895
I like to watch heroes fall

524
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,696
and never get back up.

525
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,298
He always gets back up.

526
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,568
Hard to do that when the Earth
swallows you whole.

527
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,551
Where is it?

528
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,820
Aw, don't go.

529
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:19,089
We're having so much fun.

530
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,061
Oh, my God!
Caitlin!

531
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,098
Caitlin, are you okay?

532
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,537
Looks like this new Flash

533
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,473
isn't much of a hero after all.

534
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,812
Let's see what a seven
will do to S.T.A.R. Labs.

535
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:54,726
Nice shot.

536
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,727
I was aiming for his leg.

537
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:02,233
Where is Zoom's lair?

538
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,603
Where is it?

539
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,471
If I tell you,

540
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,039
he will kill me.

541
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,075
He'll kill you anyway, Caitlin.

542
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,745
Stop calling me that.
It's not my name.

543
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,380
Yes, it is.

544
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,015
You just don't want to hear it
because it reminds you

545
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,150
of someone you used to be.

546
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,887
Trust me, I know that person
very well.

547
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,089
You don't know anything
about me.

548
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:28,092
I know the Caitlin Snow
on my Earth.

549
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,394
I know that when
she loves someone,

550
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,562
that person is her world.

551
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,831
That person was Ronnie Raymond.

552
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,499
And he died too.

553
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,800
It devastated her,

554
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,769
and I can see it's doing
the same to you.

555
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,675
Zoom took that.

556
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,811
His daughter...
my friend...

557
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,080
he's gonna take them
away from us,

558
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,716
just like he took
Ronnie from you.

559
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,188
Caitlin...

560
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,125
all you have to do is tell us
where he's keeping them.

561
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,860
And then you'll never
hear from us again,

562
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,929
and you can go.

563
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,669
Please.

564
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,839
Fine.

565
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,342
I'll show you where it is.

566
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,811
But that's it.

567
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,480
Uh, where are we going?

568
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,482
Ascension Cliffs.

569
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,291
Argh!

570
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,425
Gah!

571
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,627
Look, are you sure you
want to keep doing that?

572
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,628
You know, if Zoom catches you,

573
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,229
he's gonna hurt you again.

574
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,032
I don't understand why
I can't phase through this.

575
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,468
Well, your body would need
to have the same resonance

576
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,971
as the glass walls.

577
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,672
I should be going
more than fast enough.

578
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,241
It's something else.

579
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,377
Maybe you're resonating
at a different frequency.

580
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,950
Yeah, your Earth vibrates at
a different frequency than mine.

581
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,887
Same reason Cisco can't vibe.

582
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,157
Is there any way to
make up the difference?

583
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,861
Only if I can go faster.

584
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,542
Wow, wow, wow.

585
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,444
We're going up there?

586
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,279
That's where Zoom's lair is.

587
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,348
A place only a speedster
could get to.

588
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,450
There are like
the Cliffs of Insanity.

589
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,287
So how do we get up there?

590
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,492
I can make you something
to climb on, darling.

591
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,793
Are you serious?

592
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,228
You want us to...

593
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,731
what, just climb to the top
of those cliffs...

594
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,434
on ice?

595
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,170
Got any better ideas?

596
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,272
No, ma'am,
I'm just, you know, I...

597
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,608
I've got... you know,
I'm wearing wingtips here.

598
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,810
They, um, don't have much tread.

599
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,011
Barry.

600
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,913
Barry, um, maybe you
should stay behind.

601
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,249
- Yeah?
- No... hey, no.

602
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,184
I'm not letting you
go up there by yourself.

603
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,720
It is okay if you
don't want to go...

604
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,889
if you don't want to do this.

605
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,158
You are my wife.

606
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,194
I'm not leaving your side.

607
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,629
- Okay.
- Can we go?

608
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,798
- Yeah.
- I'm ready.

609
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,333
Let's go before
I change my mind.

610
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,111
You really think handcuffs
can stop me?

611
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,345
I know they can...

612
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,548
just like this boot
on your neck.

613
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,982
It dampens your power.

614
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,784
Same goes for
the six-by-six cell

615
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,487
you'll be calling home
at Iron Heights.

616
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:44,888
All right, let's go.

617
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,825
Caitlin.

618
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,560
So sorry I didn't come sooner.

619
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,762
That's okay, um...

620
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,197
can I show you something?

621
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,770
My cells...

622
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:00,972
they've stopped degenerating?

623
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,973
How is this even possible?

624
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,842
It appears that when
the Velocity-9

625
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,744
is in your system,
it kick-starts

626
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,246
your latent regenerative
capabilities,

627
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,749
and your cells
repair themselves.

628
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,651
And do you think you can
get this to work permanently?

629
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:18,555
I don't know, but I think
we're on the right track.

630
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,425
Caitlin, I don't know
what to say.

631
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,828
This is... you are...

632
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,567
What was that?

633
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,001
The speed cannon.

634
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,703
Geomancer's tremors
must have damaged it.

635
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,871
Okay, come on.

636
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,173
Come on!

637
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,818
The breach isn't stabilized.

638
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,453
We need to fix this fast.

639
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,256
Otherwise they're never
gonna be able to come back.

640
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,669
So that was the sound
that we heard.

641
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,372
Please tell me it's not
as bad as it looks.

642
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:12,142
- Uh...
- Come on, seriously?

643
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,011
They still have an hour left.

644
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,913
What if they're trying to get
through the breach right now

645
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,181
and they can't?

646
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,082
Okay, the jolt disrupted
the quark matter.

647
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,151
The electromagnetic
insulators are failing.

648
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,086
How do we fix this in time?

649
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,422
I don't know if we can.

650
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,917
Barry?

651
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,109
Barry?

652
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:50,981
Cisco?

653
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,983
Dude, we made it.

654
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,652
How did you find this place?

655
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,755
Had some help.

656
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,792
Don't even get me
started on this guy.

657
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,993
Out of my way.

658
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,197
Dr. Wells...

659
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,902
Stand back.

660
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,886
I'm here.

661
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,321
I'm here.

662
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,790
Come on, let's get you out
of here.

663
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,893
Okay.

664
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,165
- Frost?
- A little help?

665
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,167
Not part of the deal.

666
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,801
- Frost!
- Hey, hey, hey.

667
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,303
Bringing us up here wasn't
part of the deal, either,

668
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,038
but here you are.

669
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,041
Something tells me you're not
as cold as I thought you were.

670
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,677
Maybe, maybe not.

671
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,163
What's going on?
Why... why isn't it working?

672
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,364
I don't know.

673
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,700
I've never had this
problem before.

674
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,773
Dr. Wells...

675
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,341
Carbyne.

676
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,376
It's some form of carbyne.

677
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,844
This cell's made out of
some form of carbyne.

678
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,980
You'll never be able to
freeze him out of there.

679
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,615
You can't phase out of there?

680
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,953
Just go, all right?

681
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,487
Before Zoom comes back.

682
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,423
We're not leaving you here.

683
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,558
I can't get out of this cell.

684
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,893
I've tried

685
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,328
a lot.

686
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,263
I'm not fast enough
to phase through this.

687
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,764
You got...

688
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,166
just leave, all right?

689
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,274
Just leave.

690
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,414
Do you know what we did

691
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,184
to get here, Barry?

692
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:10,520
We convinced her...

693
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,922
Killer Frost...

694
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,357
to show us the way.

695
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,526
Then we climbed some
insanely steep cliffs

696
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,628
outside on footholds
made of ice...

697
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,563
ice.

698
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,331
And all of us risked our lives,

699
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,468
knowing Zoom was after us,
to rescue Jesse...

700
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,803
and you.

701
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,339
Now, I don't know you,

702
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,141
and you don't know me,

703
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,810
but I can tell you that today,

704
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,581
I... I did things that
I never thought possible,

705
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,549
because I needed to prove
to my wife

706
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,252
and to myself that I could.

707
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,556
Now, if I can do
the impossible today,

708
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,026
so can you.

709
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,197
I'm just Barry Allen,

710
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,866
but you're The Flash.

711
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,541
If you tell yourself

712
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,810
you can phase out of there,

713
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,712
you'll do it.

714
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,056
Okay, let's go.

715
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,458
- Go, come on.
- Wait, wait!

716
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,926
Hey, hey, hey!
We're not leaving him.

717
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,260
Barry, there's no time.

718
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,063
He's not going anywhere,

719
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:04,034
and neither are any of you.

720
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,268
Thank you

721
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,004
for bringing them to me.

722
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,040
You double-crossed us?

723
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,675
He killed Ronnie!

724
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:15,312
Guess my heart is as cold
as you thought after all.

725
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,447
I can't believe you.

726
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,783
Just so you know,
you would be very disappointed

727
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,985
in you right now.

728
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,687
Zoom.

729
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,156
Let them go.

730
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,391
All you need is me and Barry.

731
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,193
You're right.

732
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:34,131
I may not be able
to kill you yet,

733
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,600
but I can kill them.

734
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,972
No, no!
No...

735
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:45,442
I told you I'd kill you
in front of your father.

736
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,177
No! No!

737
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,349
No...

738
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,852
Get out of here.

739
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,124
Caitlin.

740
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,859
You were right.

741
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,861
He killed Ronnie.

742
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,229
Thank you.

743
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,101
I'm not leaving without him.

744
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,836
Barry, there's no time.

745
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,538
There's no time!

746
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,306
I can't hold him forever.

747
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,409
Hey, I'm coming back for you
when this is over, all right?

748
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,544
Go!

749
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,745
I'm coming back!

750
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,321
Jay, we need to do something.

751
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,723
Our only chance is to reboot
the electromagnetic insulators

752
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,159
and hope the quark matter
redistributes equally.

753
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,161
How do we do that?

754
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,562
We have to do it manually.

755
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,863
But you can't be near
the stabilizer rings

756
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,064
when they power on,
or you'll get

757
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,265
sucked into the breach.

758
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,634
Not if I create a vortex
to counteract the pull.

759
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,203
You can't do both
at the same time.

760
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,205
Cait...

761
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,006
I have to try.

762
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,244
I'll help you.

763
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,378
What?
Dad, no.

764
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,580
Look, if it brings Barry

765
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,781
back to this Earth,
I'm doing it.

766
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,049
You sure?

767
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,850
The more we talk about it,
the less sure I'll be,

768
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,118
so let's just do it.

769
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Okay.

770
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,722
There's an override switch
on every stabilizer ring.

771
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,190
- I'll create the vortex.
- Yeah.

772
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,892
And you flip all of them.
They should all reboot.

773
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,093
Got it.

774
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,928
Once that's done,
you power up the cannon.

775
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,697
- The breach should stabilize.
- And what if it doesn't?

776
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,633
We're all out of luck.

777
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,249
The Velocity-9 is running out!

778
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,411
Jay!

779
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,946
I guess now we know how long

780
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,415
the Velocity-9 lasts.

781
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,350
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

782
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,685
Yeah.

783
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:10,420
I just hope they are.

784
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,794
I'm fine. I'm just a mess.

785
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,829
You need to get out
of Central City, all right?

786
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,098
Any place you think
you'll be safe from Zoom.

787
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,667
Yeah, we, um...
we have some family

788
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,001
in Atlantis that can help us.

789
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,102
Yeah, okay, good.

790
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,470
You may not have been
struck by lightning

791
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,672
over here like I was,

792
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:30,073
but today, you risked your life

793
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,309
to save somebody
you didn't even know.

794
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,944
That's a hero, Barry.

795
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,314
Thank you both.

796
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,882
Barry...

797
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:42,585
is my father still alive
on your Earth?

798
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,822
Yeah, he is.

799
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,825
Give him a hug for me, will you?

800
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,959
I will.

801
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,201
Hey.

802
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,003
You guys need to get
someplace safe too.

803
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,371
Where are you going?

804
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,406
The only place we can.

805
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,212
- Dad, we can't just leave.
- We have to, honey.

806
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,648
What, you want me to leave
everything I have here?

807
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,216
My friends, my family...

808
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,617
I mean, my life.

809
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,052
You don't have a life
here anymore.

810
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,253
Either do I.

811
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,688
Zoom is too powerful.

812
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,889
I can't stop him.

813
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,158
And as long as he is here,

814
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,393
he's gonna hunt us down

815
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,594
until we're dead.

816
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,999
Wells, if you're coming
with us, we have to go.

817
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,274
It's almost time.

818
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,676
I don't care what time it is.

819
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,978
After all we did to
stabilize this breach,

820
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,981
we're not closing
until they show up.

821
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,383
Y'all hear me?

822
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,087
Cisco!

823
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,123
Get ready to close
the breach for good...

824
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,324
Zoom's coming!

825
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,664
Forgetting someone, Flash?

826
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,832
Let him go.

827
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,668
Close the breach.

828
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,238
Tell Jesse I love her.

829
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,606
Tell her yourself.

830
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,941
Argh!

831
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,114
It shouldn't be
taking this long.

832
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,754
Close it!
Close it now!

833
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,660
You did it...
you made it!

834
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,464
Barry.

835
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,609
No!
