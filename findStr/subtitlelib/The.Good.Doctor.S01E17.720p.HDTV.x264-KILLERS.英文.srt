44
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,300
The timing was good.

45
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,880
I just got a job transfer,

46
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
Gretchen will start at a new school --

47
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,200
We're gonna start a whole new life.

48
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,000
It's very exciting.

49
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,670
In college, - my dad majored in cheerleading.

50
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,450
That was a joke.

51
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,500
Gretchen's got a great sense of humor.

52
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,230
I'm laughing on the inside.

53
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,910
Soon you'll be laughing on the outside, too.

54
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,940
Dr. Park.

55
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,840
Moebius Syndrome is a paralysis

56
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,080
of the 6th and 7th pair of cranial nerves.

57
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,770
The 7th pair controls facial expression.

58
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,900
Luckily, in Gretchen's case,

59
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,140
we haven't found any limitation to the 6th pair.

60
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,810
I'm a lucky girl.

61
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,570
We'll be taking two slivers of muscle from your thighs,

62
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,220
along with their nerves and blood supply,

63
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,700
and transplanting them into your cheeks.

64
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,110
There'll be considerable recovery time

65
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,950
before you'll be able to smile at will --

66
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,620
maybe three months.

67
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,200
So, what do you say? Are you up for this?

68
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,770
Can I sleep on it?

69
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,970
See what I have to live with?

70
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,380
Nobody knows when I'm joking.

71
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,980
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.

72
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,210
Yes, I am very up for this.

73
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,760
Okay, great.

74
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,610
So unless there are any other questions --

75
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,840
Do you want to be a comedian?

76
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,270
People getting your jokes must be very important to you

77
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,760
if you think it's worth the risk

78
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,060
of dying during elective surgery.

79
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,980
I apologize for Dr. Murphy.

80
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,720
He's still learning that silence is the right choice

81
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
when you have nothing useful to offer.

82
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,950
We are required to have an honest

83
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,740
risk/benefit discussion with our patients.

84
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,100
We are giving - a lovely young girl a smile.

85
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,290
That's a simple equation.

86
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,630
Well, it's more than the smile or the jokes.

87
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,790
She can't express any emotions at all.

88
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,140
No one can tell if she's happy

89
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,710
or sad or scared -- anything.

90
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,400
She's never had much of a social life.

91
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,220
Ever since her mother died,

92
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,570
she's been completely withdrawn.

93
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,370
All I want to do is bring my baby girl back into the world.

94
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,580
Don't worry, Mr. Milman,

95
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,410
we're gonna take great care of her, all right?

96
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,500
Lucy has a post-op infection of unknown origin.

97
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,250
Infusing 900 milligrams of clindamycin.

98
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,800
It's terrible, isn't it?

99
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes, it is.

100
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,590
- Have you been changing your dressing? - Every day.

101
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,790
- Soaking it in clean, warm water? - Yes.

102
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,340
Taking your antibiotics, one pill, three times a day?

103
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,490
That's a no.

104
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,990
Lucy, I know I gave you a scrip for antibiotics,

105
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,870
along with one for pain meds.

106
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,750
Why haven't you been taking your antibiotics?

107
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,900
Did you have a bad reaction to them, or...?

108
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,860
I never filled my prescription.

109
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,910
I didn't think it was necessary until it got really bad,

110
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,440
and then I was too weak to go myself,

111
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,260
and I didn't have anyone to pick it up for me.

112
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay. Mystery solved.

113
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,620
I'm sorry.

114
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,090
I know it was stupid.

115
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,400
Very stupid.

116
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,870
Okay.

117
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,820
Hey, Shaun.

118
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,640
Oh. Hello.

119
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,570
I haven't seen you in ages.

120
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,840
What's -- What's new?

121
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,220
I'm buying an apple.

122
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,300
I can see that.

123
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,770
- Here, I-I-I'll get it for you. - No, thank you.

124
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,110
Thank you, Shaun.

125
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,450
What else is new?

126
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,950
You didn't want to be friends.

127
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,950
Yeah, no, I --

128
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,300
We -- We -- We -- We're colleagues.

129
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,160
You know, we're -- Whatever we are,

130
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
we can still talk -- We should talk.

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,050
I have a new friend. Kenny.

132
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,980
Here you go.

133
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,790
Thank you, Debbie.

134
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,500
Kenny, huh? That's, uh, that's great.

135
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,020
Do you have a new friend?

136
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,870
No.

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,900
- Okay. - Thank you.

138
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,640
Thank you.

139
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,710
We can talk.

140
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,220
You know, we can talk about sports,

141
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,530
we can talk about weather, we can talk about --

142
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,310
Debbie?

143
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,010
Why would you want to talk about Debbie?

144
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,040
Debbie was flirting with you.

145
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,020
She was?

146
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,610
Yes. I noticed her exhibiting two typical signs.

147
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,140
Not the trifecta, huh?

148
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,070
No, no the trifecta, and one atypical sign.

149
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,350
I think she's just trying to be friendly.

150
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,990
She gave you an extra dollar in change.

151
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,400
And the fact that you didn't notice

152
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,030
means you like her, too.

153
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,090
Maybe she's just bad at math.

154
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,690
My dad said - that you're on the spectrum --

155
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,760
That's why you said that about people getting my jokes.

156
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,320
People always get my jokes.

157
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,910
Then you're very lucky.

158
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,470
That was a joke.

159
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,720
I see what you did there.

160
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,020
Yes.

161
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,800
They call me "Resting Gretch Face."

162
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,880
"Shaun the Moron."

163
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,090
Not very witty. I'm obviously quite smart.

164
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,180
I drew this to their attention.

165
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm on a spectrum, too.

166
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,090
Somewhere between inscrutable,

167
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,690
unapproachable, and...

168
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,390
actively scorned.

169
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,190
I don't want to be more approachable,

170
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,020
and I prefer people not reading my emotions --

171
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,420
they're mine.

172
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,530
That's what you do with friends.

173
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,210
You really think - this surgery's too risky?

174
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,070
Possible complications include embolism,

175
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,430
hemorrhage, collateral paralysis,

176
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,420
asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke.

177
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,090
It's also expensive and medically unnecessary.

178
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,910
Okay, look straight ahead.

179
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,220
There's a two-hour wait in the E.R., and what are we doing?

180
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,190
Treating a woman because she willfully ignored doctors' orders.

181
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,890
I know what a "Parasite" Looks like, and it's not Lucy.

182
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,950
So this is a Mom thing with you.

183
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,590
Growing up with a whack mother means

184
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,370
that you can identify any and all problem personalities.

185
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,620
And that is the sole upside to my miserable childhood,

186
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,470
- Thank you. - Well, at least you had a mom.

187
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,740
Mine died when I was 6,

188
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,350
and Dad instantly married a child-hating bitch

189
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,950
with a butt-load of debt.

190
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,180
Morgan, I'm sorry.

191
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,690
I didn't tell you to get sympathy --

192
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,580
just that I know "Parasites," Too.

193
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,110
Got you booked first thing tomorrow morning.

194
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,100
Dad.

195
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,400
What? Too soon?

196
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,710
It's --

197
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,750
You're nervous. I get it.

198
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,100
If you have any more questions,

199
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,350
feel free.

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,500
I've changed my mind.

201
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm not having the surgery.

202
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,580
Murphy.

203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,140
Hello.

204
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,090
Gretchen's father is very upset.

205
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,750
It seems you talked her out of the surgery.

206
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,810
No, I didn't talk her out of it

207
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,950
or talk her anywhere.

208
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,710
I just gave her - the list of potential risks.

209
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,050
Embolism, hemorrhage, collateral paralysis,

210
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,720
- asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke. - Stroke?

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,230
Yes, there was a case in Brazil in 2004,

212
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,690
and the patient suffer--

213
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,250
It seems that you don't believe

214
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,140
that restoring this girl's smile is that important.

215
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,770
Smiles are overvalued.

216
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,550
There are studies that support that.

217
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,060
And there are studies that don't.

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,190
When we smile, we produce endorphins.

219
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,110
They make us happy.

220
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,280
They make other people happy.

221
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,920
When we see smiles,

222
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,650
our basotemporal lobes are activated,

223
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,500
and we duplicate what we see.

224
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,650
Murphy, smiles are contagious.

225
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,540
You see?

226
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,420
I feel good, you feel good --

227
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,240
Everybody likes smiles.

228
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,910
I don't.

229
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,840
In any case, your smile wasn't sincere

230
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,590
since it didn't demonstrate the Duchenne Marker --

231
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,200
There was no involvement of the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes,

232
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,620
which means you didn't release endorphins.

233
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,400
You know, if you can talk her

234
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,210
out of a surgery she's wanted for years,

235
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,110
I'm pretty sure a conversation with someone objective

236
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,640
can talk her back into it.

237
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,510
Get Park, come with, and keep quiet.

238
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,770
Okay.

239
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,720
Dr. Kalu.

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,820
Remember me?

241
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,110
"Fish girl"?

242
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,920
Uh, hi. Celez.

243
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,050
Yes, uh, of course I do.

244
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,080
I hope it's okay that I requested you.

245
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,310
I'm glad you did.

246
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,200
How are you doing?

247
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,120
That's what you're going to tell me.

248
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
I've been wearing the, uh, tilapia skins for five months.

249
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,210
I'm getting really tired of being followed home by stray cats.

250
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,960
How's the pain?

251
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,600
Compared to what it was?

252
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,210
Nothing.

253
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,250
Uh, any -- any fever, itchiness, or swelling?

254
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,320
Nope.

255
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,770
Well, it looks very good.

256
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,670
But?

257
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,520
How much longer?

258
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,630
how do you feel about tomorrow?

259
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,480
Seriously?

260
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I never joke about tilapia.

261
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,270
What's the matter?

262
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,570
I-I just wasn't expecting that.

263
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,780
I...

264
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,830
I'm afraid - of how I'm going to look.

265
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,280
You're going to look beautiful.

266
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,600
Tomorrow.

267
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,140
I know Dr. Murphy informed you

268
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,970
about the risks of this surgery,

269
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,040
and some risks are significant

270
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,410
and some just aren't.

271
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,880
This is as close to risk-free surgery as we can get.

272
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,560
It'll give you a smile, it'll let you laugh --

273
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,460
No.

274
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,020
Dr. Murphy didn't talk me out of it.

275
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,510
He inspired me.

276
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,490
He helped me realize

277
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,630
that this could actually make me stronger.

278
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,420
I don't want to run from it anymore.

279
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,270
Yeah, she's lying.

280
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,720
She's a smart, sarcastic young woman,

281
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,830
not exactly someone who's prone to inspirational stories.

282
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,280
Why would she lie about changing her mind?

283
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,170
Well, when I was a cop,

284
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,470
I had a lot of people change their minds about testifying in court,

285
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,440
and it always came down to one of three reasons --

286
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,870
fear, confusion, or they were paid off.

287
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,610
She doesn't seem confused.

288
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,800
And I don't think she's afraid.

289
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,990
So Gretchen was paid off?

290
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,440
I admit the analogy isn't perfect.

291
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,780
It's close enough.

292
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,320
Guess who's back in the E.R.

293
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,820
You're happy,

294
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,240
so I'm guessing it's a non-compliant patient.

295
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,090
You misjudged Lucy.

296
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,980
She made an honest mistake forgetting her prescriptions.

297
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,870
You called her, didn't you?

298
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,930
She didn't spontaneously remember,

299
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,440
you had to remind her.

300
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,480
Is that a Mom thing, too?

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,830
Gretchen, are you worried that your dad can't afford this surgery?

302
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
The insurance company is paying for it.

303
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,260
Dad...

304
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,640
I know it isn't.

305
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,420
It's elective.

306
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,870
It's medically unnecessary.

307
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,640
No one can put a value on your smile --

308
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,200
not bullies, not an insurance company,

309
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,580
not even Dr. Murphy.

310
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,220
In my opinion,

311
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,750
this surgery's medically necessary.

312
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,100
Gretchen, sweetie...

313
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,050
my first memory of your mother

314
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,840
was of her smiling at me from across the room.

315
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,450
And because of that smile,

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,680
we ended up with you.

317
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,540
And -- And my last memory of her

318
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,370
is that radiance

319
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,300
lighting up the world one last time.

320
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,870
I mean, we never had much money,

321
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,350
but as long as I had that smile,

322
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
it didn't matter.

323
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,200
I love you, Dad.

324
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,960
And that's why I can't let you give up everything for this.

325
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,190
Lucy Callard?

326
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm here.

327
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,910
Lucille Elizabeth Callard?

328
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,480
Yes, that's me.

329
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,040
Dr. Browne called me to pick up my prescriptions?

330
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,980
You're the victim of identity theft, Lucy.

331
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,260
There's an imposter using your name and medical ID to get benefits.

332
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,240
Did you have your purse stolen recently?

333
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,400
Six weeks ago.

334
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,410
And you had your driver's license and credit cards replaced,

335
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,970
but not your health-insurance card?

336
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,120
Is this why the pharmacy refuses to fill my prescriptions?

337
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm on pain meds for post-herpetic neuralgia.

338
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,340
It's getting really bad.

339
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,470
Once the imposter filled her prescription for pain meds,

340
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,390
the pharmacy must have thought

341
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,230
you were overfilling opiates.

342
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,190
It always flares up when I get upset.

343
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,440
Don't worry, Lucy, we'll get you your meds.

344
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,070
We -- We can't.

345
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,940
We're already treating "Lucy Callard."

346
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,670
Nice game, Tony.

347
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,880
Hi, Jim.

348
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,020
- Marcus, hey. You coming or going? - Neither.

349
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,710
15-year-old girl with Moebius Syndrome --

350
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,510
your company denied coverage.

351
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,910
No respiratory issues, deformities,

352
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,910
pain, she doesn't even drool.

353
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,220
She's fully functional.

354
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,060
She can't smile. That's a function.

355
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,220
Marcus, I think it's wonderful

356
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,180
you want to give this little girl her smile,

357
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,740
but if we pay for everything wonderful, we'll go bankrupt, huh?

358
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,300
And then who are we helping?

359
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,400
We all know doctors cheat diagnoses to get coverage.

360
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,350
"Deviated septum" gets you a free nose job,

361
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,530
"Migraine" gets you Botox.

362
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,190
Do you really want me to play that game?

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,320
This isn't a game for me.

364
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,130
We're a reputable company with very high standards.

365
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,170
Very high bonuses that get even higher with your denial rate.

366
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,070
I was gonna suggest we end this

367
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,640
before we say something we'll regret,

368
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,260
but I believe that just happened.

369
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,450
Gretchen's socially isolated, depressed,

370
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,030
and that's only gonna get worse.

371
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,010
What if she slashes her wrists?

372
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,000
You'd prefer to cover that?

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,130
Are you threatening me with a teenage girl's suicide?

374
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,450
And God forbid something does happen to her,

375
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,920
'cause I'll make sure that this conversation's 

376
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,390
part of the permanent record.

377
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,790
Dr. Andrews said smiles are contagious,

378
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,070
and I'm testing that hypothesis.

379
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,480
Well, I'm not sure your study will prove anything.

380
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,410
It might have something to do with the lack of the Duchenne Marker.

381
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,590
Oh, yes.

382
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,460
But here you go.

383
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,720
That wasn't a smile.

384
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,860
Sure it was.

385
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,320
I want to show you something.

386
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,670
You need to follow me.

387
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,400
Okay.

388
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,710
The impostor has poisoned

389
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
the real Lucy's medical record.

390
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
We have to go through every medication,

391
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,270
every notation, every test to determine whose is whose.

392
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,830
Doing that with zero tolerance for errors

393
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,040
could take six months.

394
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,420
Well, the paperwork is our problem, not hers.

395
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,650
Not if the confusion results in a harmful treatment

396
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,910
or incorrect diagnosis.

397
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,300
Well, we have to do something.

398
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,340
This woman is in serious pain.

399
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,600
So we treat her, just be clever about it.

400
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,660
Shaun.

401
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,330
Shaun, I've already had two iced coffees --

402
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,360
Debbie. Hello, Debbie.

403
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,660
- Shaun. - You flirted with Dr. Glassman.

404
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,700
Oh, my God.

405
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,760
'Cause I have a new friend, and he needs one, too.

406
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,950
- I'm so sorry. - Okay. Look, Dr. Glassman,

407
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,340
Debbie's facial proportions are close to optimal, okay --

408
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,800
.38 vertical and .48 horizontal...

409
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,430
- I'm so sorry. - ...so you should find her attractive.

410
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,260
Thank you?

411
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,070
S-S-Shaun. I-I'm so sorry.

412
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
And I think you're both Jewish.

413
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,180
Tribal commonality is highly conducive to social bonding.

414
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,860
Shalom?

415
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,300
Bullies can't put a value on your smile,

416
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,660
nor can Dr. Murphy,

417
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,820
but it seems the insurance company can.

418
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,010
They've agreed to pay $43,750,

419
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,230
about 85% of the entire cost.

420
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,860
I can cover the rest of that.

421
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,810
I swear.

422
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh, sweetie, please, let me do this for you.

423
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,940
Okay.

424
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay.

425
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,360
"Jane Doe"?

426
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,240
That's the only way that we can treat you right now.

427
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,560
Go home and get some rest.

428
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,390
The records department will call you to sort all this out.

429
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,880
A year ago, I was playing tennis.

430
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,760
And then the shingles hit,

431
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,460
and I was laid up for six weeks,

432
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,030
and I've been on pain meds ever since.

433
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,160
I lost my job, my husband treats me like I'm an old lady,

434
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,850
and my daughter thinks I'm too medicated

435
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,220
to be around the new baby.

436
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,910
Maybe I'll be better off as "Jane Doe."

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,070
The imposter returns.

439
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,340
Lucy?

440
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,070
Lucy, can you squeeze my fingers?

441
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,890
"Lucy"?

442
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,020
She's in septic shock.

443
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,740
Order a lactate level, blood cultures,

444
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,150
and a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

445
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,920
I'll tell Melendez

446
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,480
we've initiated Sepsis Protocol.

447
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,710
We should report her.

448
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,290
She's a criminal and a flight risk.

449
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,560
And very, very sick.

450
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,950
We should put someone outside her door

451
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,410
and arrest her when she's stable.

452
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,810
We don't report patients we find with drugs

453
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,590
or non-violent people with guns.

454
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,630
We do report people who steal from us.

455
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,620
What would happen if people who needed our help

456
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,800
thought they would be arrested?

457
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,860
If they thought they would be arrested for stealing an ID,

458
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,350
maybe they wouldn't steal an ID.

459
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,150
I don't remember anything in the Hippocratic Oath

460
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,320
about checking payor sources before treatment.

461
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,590
Strongly suggesting

462
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,630
there was no health insurance in 4th century B.C., Greece.

463
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,860
We have a duty to treat,

464
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,410
and we have the right to get paid.

465
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,900
But first things first.

466
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,660
Oh, God, I really do not want to be sued

467
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,280
by either one of these women.

468
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,390
Maintain the pretense.

469
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,630
And as soon as she's stabilized,

470
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,070
we're gonna press charges.

471
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,460
Dr. Park, pull the muscle, please.

472
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,760
We don't want any excess gathering in the suture line.

473
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,810
Thank you.

474
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,930
Okay, remove retractors.

475
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,450
Ready?

476
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,760
Are you sure you don't want something for the pain?

477
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,150
No. No, I'm good --

478
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,340
as long as you keep talking to me.

479
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,820
Especially if you share something, uh, very painful.

480
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,790
Painful?

481
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,390
Okay...

482
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,930
like the time I mistook my biology teacher

483
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,230
for my girlfriend and picked her up in the hallway?

484
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,130
Yeah, twirled her around three times

485
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,660
before I realized my mistake.

486
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,400
That kind of painful?

487
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,960
You may have to dig even deeper than that.

488
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,670
How about...

489
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,700
the time I finally found myself in the perfect situation?

490
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,670
You know, work, friends, future...

491
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,730
something I never really had before.

492
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,060
Maybe that's why I screwed it up.

493
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,500
You're not responding to the antibiotics like we'd hoped...

494
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,710
Lucy.

495
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,460
You know, don't you?

496
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,230
When the real Lucy Callard showed up,

497
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,760
it kind of gave you away.

498
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,500
Is there anyone we can contact?

499
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,420
Do you have any children?

500
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,240
A son.

501
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,830
But he'd be so ashamed of me.

502
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,540
Where is he?

503
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,510
College.

504
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,540
first one in our family.

505
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,790
I had to choose between premiums and tuition.

506
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,620
Your son is very lucky to have such a loving mother.

507
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,560
I just wish you got your antibiotics

508
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,260
when you got your pain meds.

509
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,720
I didn't get either medication.

510
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,440
Are you sure?

511
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,400
Because the real Lucy was having problems with the pharmacy.

512
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,310
I didn't want to risk using the card again.

513
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,140
Is she okay?

514
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,900
Maybe it's time to move on --

515
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,100
take the lesson with you, find new friends.

516
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,440
I went to Denver - for an interview last week.

517
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,510
And?

518
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,270
And...we're done.

519
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,810
Really?

520
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,500
Take a look.

521
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,290
Hey, trust me.

522
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,980
See? Beautiful.

523
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,390
The kid, college --

524
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,300
it's just a convenient sob story.

525
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,130
Why would she lie if she may be dying?

526
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,600
Here's what we don't know about fake Lucy --

527
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,140
whether her story is true.

528
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,250
Here's what we do know --

529
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,580
She's a liar who just found out she's busted.

530
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,950
Speaking of lies,

531
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,110
that shingles virus that the real Lucy had last year?

532
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,550
According to Dr. Spindler at Santa Clara General,

533
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,850
she had it the year before, too,

534
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,560
and according to Dr. Millhouse at SF Muni,

535
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,690
the year before that.

536
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,190
She wasn't denied the pain meds because of our imposter.

537
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,530
She was denied

538
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,730
because she is a garden-variety addict.

539
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,680
Well-played, sir.

540
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,620
Dr. Park says the surgery went well.

541
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,930
It's been too long.

542
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,290
What has?

543
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,230
She should be breathing on her own by now.

544
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,180
Even after prolonged anesthesia,

545
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,810
it should only take 60 to 90 minutes.

546
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,320
Is she okay?

547
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,220
She should have - protective airway reflexes,

548
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,370
motor activity, - and a return of consciousness.

549
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,550
I need to page Dr. Andrews, STAT.

550
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,630
What's going on?

551
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,360
Something bad.

552
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,450
Gretchen's glucose is within normal limits

553
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,640
and her electrolytes are also normal.

554
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,660
And we've ruled out hyper- and hypothermia.

555
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,620
It doesn't leave much. What about hypoxia?

556
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,180
Uh, she maintained normal oxygen,

557
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,490
as well as end tidal CO2 throughout the entire case,

558
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,290
and we've given reversal agents...

559
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,620
which we will repeat.

560
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,250
Do you feel bad?

561
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,280
It's okay.

562
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,770
You told them it was close to risk-free.

563
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,980
They knew there were risks, and I told them, too.

564
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,000
Get a CT. Rule out clots, 

565
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,420
hematoma, bleeding, and stroke.

566
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,450
WBCs and lactate are rising,

567
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,070
O2 sat and MAP are falling.

568
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,610
The Sepsis Protocol isn't working.

569
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,480
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.

570
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,310
Medications?

571
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,390
Another antibiotic, ah, continue crystalloids,

572
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,450
- increase her vasopressors? - Low-dose steroids?

573
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,220
Give 'em all at try, and intubate her and insert a swan.

574
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,950
And, yes, I understand this is out of our own pocket.

575
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,590
Do anything exciting for Purim?

576
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,630
Purim. Uh, no.

577
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,490
Yeah -- you know, the usual.

578
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,990
Ate a little matzah,

579
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,480
and celebrated our "Exodus from slavery"...

580
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,350
which I think is Passover and not Purim.

581
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,040
The truth of the matter is, I'm only half Jewish,

582
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,910
so only half the knowledge.

583
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,350
The truth is I-I'm not Jewish at all.

584
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah.

585
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,140
Yeah, my first husband was.

586
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,790
So I guess we have our lack of Jewishness in common.

587
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,850
You know what, Debbie? I think I-I should get going.

588
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,010
Okay. Well, it was -- it was nice, 

589
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,770
finally meeting you, officially.

590
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,850
Same.

591
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,920
Oh, no, look at that!

592
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,710
A 1975 300d,

593
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,130
one of the most perfect Mercedes ever

594
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,640
just got a little less perfect.

595
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,510
I beg to differ.

596
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,140
If you're looking for perfection,

597
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,630
you look no further than the 1967 280SE.

598
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,790
Cabriolet or coupe?

599
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,510
The coupe -- an all-time classic.

600
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,770
Well, an owner of a 300SL Gullwing

601
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,600
might argue otherwise.

602
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,810
- A Gullwing? - Yeah.

603
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,370
Can I get you another coffee?

604
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,230
Yeah.

605
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,130
Iced, large, black.

606
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,680
- That's it. - I know.

607
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,480
That's a little bit unsettling, Murphy.

608
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,570
Okay.

609
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,400
Why are you studying the current of ions during electrolysis?

610
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,380
It's not the chemical kind of transference.

611
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,850
It's the doctor-patient kind.

612
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,150
I'm dealing with a personal situation.

613
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,290
I don't think the Internet is very helpful

614
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,230
for solving personal situations.

615
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,260
True.

616
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,170
But I can't exactly ask Claire for her advice,

617
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,050
and I barely know Park, and Morgan --

618
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,690
Morgan would be bad.

619
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,520
Very bad.

620
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,290
I'm a person.

621
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,830
Yeah.

622
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,060
No, no -- Yeah, of course, Shaun.

623
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,000
I'd, uh, I'd love your advice.

624
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,060
Okay.

625
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,720
So I think Celez, my burn patient,

626
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,530
has feelings for me, and I...

627
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,620
may have feelings for her, too.

628
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,380
But there's a good chance her feelings aren't real,

629
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,460
and if they are real,

630
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,390
then they may not be permanent.

631
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,790
You know, it's kind of textbook transference --

632
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,790
she's grateful and she's vulnerable.

633
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,030
And all I've ever known in my life

634
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,150
is unrequited love...

635
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,180
from Claire and from my parents.

636
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,200
And that makes me vulnerable, too.

637
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,230
You should call in sick.

638
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,760
Lea says calling in sick is all you need

639
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,360
to gain superior wisdom and knowledge.

640
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,870
She was right.

641
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,990
The CT showed no abnormalities,

642
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,890
and the reversal agents have been repeated without effect.

643
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,040
So what else could it be?

644
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,240
Anoxic brain injury,

645
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,580
a complication of anesthesia.

646
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,790
Unfortunately, we believe...

647
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,800
your daughter is brain dead.

648
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,010
What?

650
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,360
All for a smile...

651
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,410
I made her think she wasn't good enough the way she was.

652
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,230
I should've listened to you.

653
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes.

654
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,270
There's just no predicting

655
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,730
how individuals will react to anesthesia.

656
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,960
Yeah.

657
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,110
Park!

658
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,560
You just walked out on that man.

659
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,310
The last thing - a grieving family member needs

660
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,120
is to see their doctor tap out.

661
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,080
Maybe she's still under anesthesia.

662
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,230
Succinylcholine --

663
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,510
It was one of the anesthetics Gretchen was administered.

664
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,010
- Yeah. - Now, what if 

665
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,420
she has a Plasma Cholinesterase Deficiency?

666
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,870
It'd mean her body couldn't break down that specific drug.

667
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,370
Complete deficiency is extremely rare.

668
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,550
I've never personally seen it,

669
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,010
and I don't know anyone who has.

670
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,590
But if she does have it,

671
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,500
she's just gonna wake up.

672
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,870
Should I tell the father?

673
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,660
No, not yet.

674
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,590
No way - we're letting him grieve twice.

675
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,530
Your labs are not improving.

676
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,720
Your organs are shutting down.

677
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,380
You're running out of time.

678
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,480
I'd like - to stop calling you "Lucy."

679
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,800
You're welcome...

680
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,930
Beatrice.

681
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,060
What are you doing?

682
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,350
Corneal reflex.

683
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,910
It's mediated by the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic branch.

684
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,330
What does it mean?

685
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,330
It means we were wrong.

686
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,920
She's gonna be just fine.

687
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,540
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

688
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,510
Thank y--

689
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,660
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

690
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,390
Honey, you're gonna be okay.

691
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,110
You're gonna be just fine.

692
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,430
I was drawing a bath, and I leaned over to turn it off,

693
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,910
and I dropped the pill bottle,

694
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,550
and before I could fish it out --

695
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,350
All the pills were ruined. So you need a refill.

696
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,390
My pain has made me so clumsy.

697
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,180
Lucy, you're a liar

698
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,400
and a cheat and an addict.

699
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,740
We know about - the frequent prescriptions,

700
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,560
the multiple doctors, and the ever-recurring shingles.

701
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,080
You have - a serious medical problem.

702
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,910
Let me help you.

703
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,300
Three months?

704
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,300
Hopefully.

705
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,590
But we might be able to give you

706
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,220
a pretty good idea of what you're gonna look like.

707
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,590
Those things by your ears are neuro-stimulators.

708
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,420
When we activate them, instant smile.

709
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,190
Sound good?

710
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,550
Dr. Murphy.

711
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,840
It's your mother's smile.

712
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,980
She seemed like a good template.

713
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,000
There is no Duchenne Marker.

714
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,460
Her smile is not real.

715
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
Thank you.

716
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,820
But all the other ones are.

717
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,280
All the other ones are.

718
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,710
I spoke with Jim Ransler,

719
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,010
who made it very clear that we owe him big time for this.

720
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,610
Don't worry, Marcus, I can handle him.

721
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,590
I'm very impressed.

722
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,830
It was all - very presidential of you.

723
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,570
You really went above and beyond.

724
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,450
Yes, I did.

725
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,570
I thought - I was saving her life --

726
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,110
instead, I nearly ended it.

727
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,220
Celez, hi.

728
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,230
This is the brilliant Dr. Murphy.

729
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,540
He'll be assuming your care from here on,

730
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,360
though I don't expect you'll need much.

731
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,120
I understand.

732
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,140
I don't think you do.

733
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,410
You see, doctors aren't allowed to date their patients.

734
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,800
What are you doing tomorrow?

735
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,730
I'm calling in sick.

736
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,210
I think you may still have some friends here.

737
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,850
I guess there is one upside to all this.

738
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,730
If she hadn't bought the stolen insurance card,

739
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,020
the real Lucy wouldn't be in rehab right now.

740
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,310
Surprisingly nice.

741
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,060
I told her what she needed to hear to get help.

742
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,920
Trust me, I get it --

743
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,170
too soft, - people take advantage of you.

744
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,330
But with your badass upbringing,

745
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,830
no one messes with you.

746
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,160
Upsides everywhere.

747
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,590
You have way more street cred than, say,

748
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,300
someone whose mom's a Johns Hopkins cardiologist,

749
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,690
whose dad's a pathologist,

750
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,690
and whose parents have been happily married for 37 years.

751
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,960
Coming from privilege -- zero respect.

752
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,420
Must be really hard to overcome.

753
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,600
- I'll call a code. - No.

754
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,080
There's nothing left to save.

755
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,000
Time of death, 8:14 P.M.

756
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,530
I'll notify her son.

{\an9}♪ Knock us down, we'll get back up ♪

763
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,530
{\an9}♪ Yeah, we're gonna show you what we've got ♪

765
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,900
My homies decided to pop by

766
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,010
and, uh, play some Texas Hold'em,

767
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,370
so I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that pizza night.

768
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,870
You got - a 70-inch flat-screen, too.

769
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,100
No. I borrowed yours.

770
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,680
Makes no sense for us both to have one, right?

771
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,520
Plus homies - got to watch March Madness.

772
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,840
- Okay. - Oh, um, sorry, amigo.

773
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,150
It's four-player Texas Hold'em.

774
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,500
- I don't like poker anyway. - Hey, Shaun.

775
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,680
Look, you're a great guy,

776
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,990
but you got a few,

777
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,100
like, quirks, you know?

778
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,150
And that --

779
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,180
It doesn't really...

780
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,340
jive with this kind of face time.

781
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,510
You get what I'm saying, right?

782
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,130
I love you, man.

783
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,800
I once drove a 300SL --

784
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,490
Thank you -- a 300SL Gullwing.

785
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,780
On the road?

786
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,790
No.

787
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,020
For 200 feet - at the Concours d'Elegance.

788
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,080
Oh, in Pebble Beach -- That's just as cool.

789
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,200
The car show -- You know it.

790
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,950
Of course, yeah.

791
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,890
This year, they're featuring a Rollston Coachwork display.

792
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,910
Including the Mercedes SS?

793
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,890
I don't know.

794
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,550
But we should find out.

795
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,710
Do you want to go?

796
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,600
I couldn't.

797
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah, no, I --

798
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,530
Why?

799
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,050
No reason.

800
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,140
I just -- I just...thought

801
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,920
that I should make that my first response before I accepted.

802
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,730
Can I get you anything else?

803
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,060
No, thank you. - We'll just take the doorstop.

804
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,350
I'm sorry. Um, well --

805
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,290
Well, you can bring the doorstop.

806
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,300
Aaron?

807
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,620
Sorry. Um...

808
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,330
The thing...

809
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,440
The thing -- The thing -- The thing that -- that --

810
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,190
that t-tells you how much to pay, the -- the doorstop.

811
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,220
Could you call a --

812
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,300
Can you call an ambulance, please? Thank you.
