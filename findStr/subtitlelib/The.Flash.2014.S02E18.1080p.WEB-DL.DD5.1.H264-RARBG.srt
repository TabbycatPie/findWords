<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:05,396
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,363
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,399
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,003
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,905
<i>I hunted down the man who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:21,275
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:24,645
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:27,581
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

<i>Why are you here?</i>

12
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,419
Because I want to go faster,

13
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,954
and you're the only one who can teach me.

14
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:36,323
Everything you need is on this drive.

15
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,492
It means a lot, you looking after Barry.

16
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,496
Barry's not the only person
here I wanna keep safe.

17
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,598
We found Barry's double,
so where the hell am I?

My name was Hunter Zolomon.

21
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,841
I thought that if I could find
my doppelganger on this Earth,

22
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:57,011
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

23
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,280
I've been vibing Zoom,
and every time it's happened,

24
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:00,681
I've been near that thing.

25
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:04,151
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

<i>They're responsible for who
I've become today.</i>

35
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:26,473
<i>But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.</i>

36
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:27,975
Come on, Barry.

You're not my husband.

No. You're a monster.

No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

- How fast does he normally go?
- Not this fast.

00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,301
Not even close. Are his vitals okay?

Yeah, they're perfect.

What... how long was I gone?

99

Let's put it this way,

100
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,673
you just annihilated your old record.

101
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,676
Yeah, you went four times
faster than you have ever been.

102
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,811
Four times?

103
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,314
- That's as...
- Fast as Zoom.

104
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:31,385
Well, faster actually.

105
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,487
Hey, uh, do we think that, um,

106
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:36,290
we can get this thing smaller?
It kind of sucks.

107
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:42,162
If it sucks, then, yeah.

108
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,097
All right, so now all we have
to do is figure out

109
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,232
how to get back to Zoom.

110
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,001
Yes, uh, just a minor issue.

111
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:49,202
We closed all the breaches

112
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:50,637
and have no idea how to reopen them.

113
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,573
We don't... Um, Wells?

114
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:53,907
Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.

115
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,342
Let's keep the breaches closed forever.

116
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:58,045
Forget about the breaches.
Forget about Zoom.

117
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,346
Wait, I'm sorry,

118
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:00,681
I thought that you were on board with this.

119
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:04,318
No. No. I said I would help you get faster.

120
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,119
I did not say I would help you give the man

121
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,921

122
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,389

Oh, you're not gonna let that happen.

00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,462
Gosh, I wish I'd known that the first time.

126
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:19,633
You don't understand
Zoom is different than us.

127
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,535
Zoom is not tied to anything.

128
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,237
Zoom does not care for anyone.

129
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,739
I do.

130
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:27,307
My daughter's out here
on this Earth somewhere.

131
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,643
I have to find her. We all have people

132
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,112
that we care about.
Zoom will use that against us.

133
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:36,083
Believe me.

134
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,684
Maybe we should just leave it be.

135
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,786
No, no. Look, no. Look, we're...

136
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,788
We're not turning our backs
on another Earth.

137
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,857
We're not gonna let Zoom

138
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,525
get away with everything that he's done.

139
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:51,131
Right now, there is no way
to another Earth, Allen.

140
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,300
Let's keep it that way.

141
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:58,705
We're getting back to Earth-2.

142
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:01,141
With or without his help.

143
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,310
Let's go to work.

144
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:07,914
Hey, where are you going?

145
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,650
We could use your help.

146
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,284
Uh, yeah, I would.

147
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:15,322
It's just I have a date with Scott.

148
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,158
- That's the editor?
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,027
That's good. No, I'm glad
that you're finding a way

150
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,928
to move on without anything
holding you back.

151
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,163
You deserve that.

152
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,631
Yeah, and well, I would have been able

153
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,166
to do it without your support.

154
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,834
It means a lot to me, so...

155
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,969
- Of course.
- Thanks.

156
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,971
Yes, for sure.

157
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,507
Well hey, I mean, if you don't
get this breach problem

158
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,810
fixed by tonight, pencil me in for tomorrow?

159
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,879
I can do that.

160
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,247
Okay.

161
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,623
Man, I love it when you train

162
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,358

- Mm-hmm.

00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,328
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula 1.

165
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,298
Mm. No, I can't.

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,900
I got to get back to the lab.

167
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,468
I'm still trying to find a way
back to Earth-2.

168
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,969
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

169
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,705
No, he refused.

170
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:08,375
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

171
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,810
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

172
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:12,212
about a man I shot at...
And punched in the face,

173
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,814
but I think you should listen to him.

174
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:14,615
Why?

175
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,058
Barry, it worries the hell out of me

176
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,993
the thought that you want
to go back to Earth-2.

177
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,107
I'm faster now.

Well, the best plan

Reverb.

218
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,392
What were Reverb's powers on your Earth?

219
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,494
He could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies

220
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,096
between Earths.

221
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,031
He could see through dimensions.

222
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,100
Find breachers, like Ramon.

223
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,602
I mean, we... we saw Reverb
do more than that though, right?

224
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:11,605
I mean, we saw him shoot vibrational bursts

225
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,007

00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,409
What do you mean?

227
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,579

the ability to somehow

228
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:21,048
manipulate that multi-dimensional energy.

229
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,283
- What's your point, Allen?
- My point is...

230
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:25,686
if his powers are linked to the energy

231
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:28,122
that ties together the multi-verse...

232
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,857
if he can manipulate it...

233
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,725
Then he can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

234
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,262
Exactly. And if Reverb could do it...

235

00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,690
- So this...
- Huh?

359
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,525
- This whole Wally thing...
- Uh-huh.

360
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,193
He won't let me help him.

361
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,995
[chuckles] It's probably 'cause you're not

362
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,131
offering the right kind of help.

363
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,000
Wally doesn't want your help
paying for a place to live.

364
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,570
He wants you to offer him a place to live.

365
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,572
- Why didn't he just say that?
- I don't know.

366
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,241
So he does want to live in our house?

367
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,842
Yeah, man.

368
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,545
Look, Wally's never lived
with his father before.

369
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,514
And trust me, that is a big deal.

370
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,848
Huh. And you're good with it?

371
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,550
Mm-hmm. I mean, you know,

372
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,519
it's been you and me
for so long, and I love that,

373
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,254
but having Wally around would be cool too.

374
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:40,124
Just we won't get to have
as much pizza from Keystone.

375
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,826
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.

376
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,362
Have to get used to that. [laughing]

377
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,798
They really have a special bond, don't they?

378
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,235
Yeah, they sure do.

379
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,472
Are you okay?

380
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:58,543
I don't know what I am.

381
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,511
Last night, I was supposed to go on a date.

382
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,047
My first real date since Eddie died,

383
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,018
but at the last second,
I just... I couldn't do it.

384
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,088
Is it because of Eddie or because of Barry?

385
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
I've noticed the way you've been
looking at him recently.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,293
Is it that obvious?

387
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,562
Only to a woman who's been
through the same thing.

388
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,030
Everything seems to be telling me

389
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,432
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

390
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,568
I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

391
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,137
In the future, we're supposedly married.

392
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,306
And now that I'm finally ready to move on,

393
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,075
I just wonder if that should be with Barry.

394
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,045
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

395
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,315
Do you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

396
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,483
Maybe for you.

397
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,090
Hello?

398
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,796
<i>- Joe?
- Wally, I'm up here.</i>

399
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,001
Hey. What are you doing?

400
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,269
It's not done yet.

401
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,537
I mean, you can decorate it how you like.

402
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,539
- Make it your own.
- Whoa, wait, Joe.

403
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,207
What is this?

404
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,509
Wally, forgive me.

405
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,378
When Barry and Iris went to college,

406
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,647
they couldn't get away fast enough.

407
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,115
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

408
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,751
It didn't even occur to me

409
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,387
that you might feel differently.

410
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,856
It's embarrassing, but it took Barry

411
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,658
to help me see that.

412
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,894
So, if you still haven't
found a place to live,

413
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,162
live here.

414
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,900
I mean, it's yours if you want to.

415
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,669
You're serious?

416
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,671
I'm not gonna do your laundry.

417
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,506
And I'm not washing dishes after you.

418
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,541
And this bed is going to be made
every morning before you leave.

419
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,377
And there will be no beer in that fridge,

420
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,046
but yeah, it's yours.

421
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,583
When can I move in?

422
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,852
Whenever you want.

423
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,720
All right.

424
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,522
Thanks, Dad.

425
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,690

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,395

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,734
Hey, man.

428
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,903
[sighs]

429
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,809
Look, um...

430
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,045
I know what it's like...

431
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,615
Zoom, getting in your head,

432
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,384
how scary that can be.

433
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,624
It's not Zoom.

434
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,492
It's me.

435
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,261
What do you mean it's you?

436
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,931
It's like right now I'm Anakin Skywalker.

437
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,466
I got the midi-chlorians.

438
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,268
I've got the goods.

439
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,170
The force is strong with me.

440
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,938
That is something I can feel.

441
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,042
But if I start opening breaches
into other worlds,

442
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:50,014
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then...

443
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,516
what if this is how I become Vader?

444
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,385
Dude, you're never going to become Vader.

445
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,721
You don't know that.
That is what happened to Reverb.

446
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,156
He learned how to use his abilities,

447
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,425
and when he felt that,

448
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,928
when he felt that power,

449
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,963
he succumbed...

450
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,765
to the dark side.

451
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,600
[chuckles]

452
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,136
Look, I get it. I... I really do.

453
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,739
Every time I've learned a new ability,

454
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,208
I've been terrified
about what it might mean for me.

455
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,943
What it could do to me, you know?

456
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,480
But you were there with me

457
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,349
when I learned how to run on water,

458
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,284
[chuckles] when I ran up a building,

459
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,988
or traveled through time. [chuckles]

460
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,356
Just like I'm gonna be there

461
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,526
every step of the way with you.

462
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,495
You got something that Reverb never had,

463
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,564
and that's Caitlin and Joe

464
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,600
and Iris and Wells and me.

465
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,802
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

466
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,337
And we're more than just friends.

467
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,039
We're your family.

468
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,441
So what do you say?

469
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,710
Ready to put those things on again,

470
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,812
and go another round?

471
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,750
Let's do it.

472
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,685
All right.

473
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,761
[exhales sharply] You're all set.

474
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,530
He won't even know it's there.

475
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,366
'Cause whoever said
aesthetics aren't important.

476
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,368
Not me.

477
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,305
Let's go.

478
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,941
Hey, Cait, I know how hard

479
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,510
this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

480
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,878
I know, and I want to be supportive.

481
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,548
I just... I can't face Jay.

482
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,683
Or whatever his real name is.

483
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,351
What does that mean?

484
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,686
Well, you remember when I was looking

485
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,021
for his doppelganger, right?

486
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,023
Yeah. And you couldn't find him.

487
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,258
Because there is no
Jay Garrick on this Earth.

488
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,195
His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.

489
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,798
Hunter Zolomon?

490
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,400
Are you sure?

491
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,603
Yeah, why?

492
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,574
Well, because on my Earth,

493
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:00,578
Hunter Zolomon was
a convicted serial killer.

494
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,181
That's Jay?

495
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,818
No, that is Hunter.

496
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,787
Last public photo of Hunter Zolomon.

497
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,889
Instantly recognizable.
And people from my Earth...

498
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,858
on my Earth, serial killers are an anomaly,

499
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,193
so a lot of media attention to this.

500
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,062
There was a podcast.

501
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,232
When Hunter was 11,
his father killed his mother

502
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,766
right in front of him.

503
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,134
Father sent to prison,

504
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,936
Hunter grew up in the foster care system.

505
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,773
Years later he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder.

506
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,879
23? That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter type level.

507
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,147
After the trial, Hunter was sent

508
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,916
<i>to the Saint Perez Mental Asylum</i>

I had thought...

I also knew that the only way
to make Barry become faster

720
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:29,585
was if you all witnessed
your old pal Jay die.

When did you decide to do that?

Oh, once you closed all
the breaches, went to Earth-2.

Believe me, getting my time remnant

724
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:41,863
to agree to me murdering him
took a bit of convincing.

But once he saw the...
well, the genius in my plan,

Running around dressed like The Flash?

To give people hope, Detective.
