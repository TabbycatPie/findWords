18
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,390
Okay.

19
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,480
Okay.

20
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,760
This is terrifying!

21
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,710
And very fun!

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,870
Are you ready to try lying down?

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,080
Because I am ready, Shaun. I am very ready.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,960
Carly --

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,000
600 thread count microfiber sheets.

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,220
A shredded memory foam pillow.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,220
A 40-watt A19 incandescent bulb.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,150
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,880
You didn't return my calls this weekend.

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,050
After a ride up Skyline Boulevard,

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,000
60 minutes of Muay Thai,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,710
and a 15-year reserve Scotch,

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,970
I had a moment of clarity.

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,570
What you said about my objectivity in the Fields case wasn't about me.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,760
You were in pain.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,860
I was taking responsibility.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,490
And asking you to take your share.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,680
It was a good surgical plan.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,520
You need to accept that,

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,980
despite being a gifted surgeon,

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,010
you are fallible.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,170
I think I should run my procedures by Glassman from now on.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,420
Audrey, we need some checks and balances.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,100
I am checked and balanced.

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,680
And I'm the chief of this department.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
You will continue to run your medical decisions past me.

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,400
Browne, you're with Melendez today.

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Murphy and Park, meet me in the E.R. observation unit in 20.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,580
I thought I was on E.R. consults with Park today.

50
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,510
If I'm being bumped because I took off the other day,

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,810
Dr. Browne was every bit of --

52
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,250
First lead surgery.

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,350
Thank you.

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,760
Scheduled for tomorrow.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,820
Study the images and prep your patient.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,740
Yes! I rock, I rock!

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,830
The surgery gods know it, I know it,

58
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,120
and apparently, so does Andrews.

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,300
Boasting doesn't have the same impact

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,730
when you're picked last.

61
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,520
He was obviously waiting for the right case to come along.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,700
No.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
You're kidding me.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,980
This is much better than my first surgery.

65
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,380
Damn right. A med student could do an appy.

66
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,640
The carotid endarterectomy takes serious finesse.

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,380
Fair to say it's really a 5th-year procedure,

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,060
but I don't have time to sit around debating semantics.

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,590
I have the Holy Grail of resident surgeries to prep for.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,580
The tumor was found on my left lung at my medical fitness exam.

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
Tricky spot.

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,130
Curable,

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,020
but tough to remove without taking the entire lung.

74
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,830
That's what they said.

75
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,460
And you didn't like that answer?

76
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,400
I need my lung.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,710
I'm going to the moon.

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,200
When did the chest pain start?

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,250
Around 9:00 this morning.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,120
Okay, I'm gonna look at your heart.

83
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,630
This gel may be a little cold.

84
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,950
You see a cardiologist.

85
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,960
Did you use the nitro he prescribed?

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,930
It usually relieves the angina,

87
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,190
but not this time.

89
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,660
Are...you the same Rosalind Elion

91
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,840
who just published a study

92
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,440
on IDH2 Inhibitors in Myeloid Leukemia

95
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,650
in the Journal of Pediatric Oncology?

96
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,410
Yeah.

97
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,240
You're famous.

98
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,110
W-- I-I used an IDH2 on a kid with AML.

99
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,240
I mean, he's doing great.

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,000
Your studies revolutionized leukemia treatment.

101
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,670
It's an honor to meet you.

102
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,060
That's kind of you to say.

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,750
Noticing anteroapical wall motion abnormalities.

104
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,040
Is your chest pain worsening?

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,500
Yes. How did you --

106
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,210
She's having a heart attack.

107
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,330
Contact her family, then meet us in surgery.

108
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,850
She needs a triple bypass.

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
The moon?

110
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,620
The moon. In 2020.

111
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,920
It's a private venture partnership with NASA.

112
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,300
Floating in an expanse of uninhabitable emptiness

113
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,200
200,000 miles from the nearest Starbucks --

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,740
...not for me.

115
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,570
You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid?

116
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,150
Had enough challenges here on Earth.

117
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,150
Did you?

118
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,310
I was a Trekker.

119
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,120
All my friends had Spock ears.

120
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,030
I was all about McCoy.

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,340
There's our tumor.

122
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,250
It's embedded in the hilum.

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,610
NASA doctor was right.

124
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,390
We'd have to take the entire lung to get it out.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,750
Not necessarily.

126
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,860
The tumor's grown into the upper lobe.

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,010
If we can remove it from the main bronchus,

128
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,400
we can get a clean margin.

129
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,970
The rest of the lung can stay.

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,670
No-go.

131
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,010
You'd have 80% of your --

132
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,330
If treatment reduces my lung volume at all,

133
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll be unfit for space travel.

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,210
The mass is too deep.

135
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,000
Major blood vessels, your airway, esophagus,

136
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,600
and heart are right there.

137
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,710
The next opinion you get will be the same.

138
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,410
Or worse.

139
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,510
Thank you for your time.

140
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,140
What do you see at the apex?

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,240
I see perfusion abnormalities.

142
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,070
Her LAD and PD are completely occluded.

143
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,440
She listed her husband as her medical proxy.

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,590
You'll need to update him as soon as he gets here.

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,350
The entire left side of her heart is compromised.

146
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,610
He's not coming.

147
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,340
They've been divorced for two years.

148
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,500
He hasn't spoken to her in almost that long.

149
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Murphy, anastomose the internal mammary to the LAD.

150
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,790
Let's see if we can give her heart a blood supply.

151
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,780
I tracked down her sister in Santa Cruz.

152
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,760
She hasn't seen Rosalind in years, either.

153
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,530
That's a lot of legwork for a surgeon --

154
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,930
no social worker available?

155
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,570
It's good that you didn't find anyone.

156
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,930
Family members are the least qualified people in the room

157
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,700
to make medical decisions.

158
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,300
Judging by the state of her myocardium,

159
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,160
there's only one choice, anyway.

160
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,830
She needs a new heart.

161
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,600
I think it's possible to spare her upper lobe using a surgical robot.

162
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,000
Wren Braxton came to see me.

163
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,960
You're her second opinion?

164
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Or fourth or whatever she's up to?

165
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,650
I'm surprised you didn't offer the robotic option.

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,880
It's the type of surgery I usually send your way.

167
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,290
I didn't offer it because with the robot,

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,860
if I nicked her pulmonary artery,

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,010
she'd likely bleed out

170
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,890
before I have a chance to open her up to control it.

171
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,760
She's just gonna keep looking

172
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,740
until someone gives her the answer she wants.

173
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,720
And then what?

174
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,170
What do you think her odds of survival are

175
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,180
if some hack tries to cut the tumor out,

176
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,630
leaving the lungs intact?

177
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,150
Roughly zero.

178
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,140
I agree.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,790
And with you? With the robot?

180
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,310
Still lousy.

181
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,630
You can do this.

182
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,540
You're overestimating the risk, and I know why.

183
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,620
And you're doing exactly what you did last time.

184
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,340
Assuming that I can do anything.

185
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,660
So everyone else is biased except for you?

186
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,940
The one who just had a patient die on him?

187
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,610
If it's had any effect,

188
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,570
it's to make my judgment more acute.

189
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,370
I won't risk having Wren leave here

190
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,170
the same way that Patty Fields did.

191
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,370
People risk things to make their dreams come true.

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,630
If you don't want to help her, I'll do it myself.

193
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,800
The intra-aortic balloon pump

194
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,430
will support your heart until we find a donor.

195
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,730
And when might that be?

196
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,280
A heart is the most difficult organ to procure.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,800
But since yours is so badly damaged,

198
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,950
you are very high on the list.

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,990
I suppose that's a good thing.

200
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,800
Not really. The --

201
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,450
We're doing everything we can.

202
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,890
Thank you.

203
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,960
Is there anyone you want us to call?

204
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:36,930
Yes.

205
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
My lab assistant.

206
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,830
The next few days are crucial

207
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,600
to my monoclonal antibody study.

208
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,850
Hannah needs to stay with the cultures around the clock.

209
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,840
I don't want five years of work to go to waste.

210
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,890
Can I ask why you listed your ex-husband

211
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,360
as your medical proxy?

212
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,270
I had to name someone.

213
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,050
Leo is the only person

214
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,410
I ever discussed my medical issues with.

215
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,360
Now, if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do,

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,850
which, as you've indicated,

217
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,570
I may not have a lot of time to do it.

218
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,240
How are you, Shaun?

219
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,050
These are STAT cardiac labs.

220
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,130
I have to go.

221
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,390
I hope you're not embarrassed about last night.

222
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,350
I want to have sex with you.

223
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,930
That's nice.

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,360
I think about it very often.

225
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,440
Even when I'm supposed to focus on more pressing matters.

226
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,520
Like 15 minutes ago

227
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,560
when I was filling out that lab requisition,

228
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,990
I almost forgot to add a BNP.

229
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,060
That's good.

230
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,390
No, it's not.

231
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,750
We need a BNP

232
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,000
to monitor her cardiac function on the balloon pump.

233
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,890
I've been thinking about you, too.

234
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,180
Sometimes when I shouldn't.

235
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,460
- That's bad. - Not really.

236
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,220
I've been doing some research.

237
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,750
I came across this therapy psychologists use

238
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,440
to treat phobias.

239
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,380
Apparently, it works in people with autism, too.

240
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
If you're game,

241
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,290
we could try tonight.

242
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,710
I'm game.

243
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,670
I need a different first surgery.

244
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,700
There a problem with your patient?

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,780
The plaque dissection

246
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,940
is too advanced for a third-year resident.

247
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,390
I was nervous as hell for my first surgery.

248
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,390
And it was only a tonsillectomy.

249
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,670
I could take out a pair of tonsils blindfolded.

250
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,690
It's not nerves.

251
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,590
This is more like a fifth-year procedure.

252
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,050
You're setting me up to fail.

253
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,470
This is why I picked you.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,090
You come to me scared, and you couch it in arrogance.

255
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,340
It's rare that a resident has what you have --

256
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,820
the aggressiveness, the work ethic,

257
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,270
and talent to be a leader.

258
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,890
I'm not setting you up to fail.

259
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm setting you up to shine.

260
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,640
Or am I wrong about you?

261
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,970
No, sir.

262
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,390
I want you to do my surgery.

263
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,670
The one Dr. Lim suggested.

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,570
It was Dr. Lim's idea.

265
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,090
She's an excellent surgeon and my superior.

266
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,540
And you think I'm an idiot.

267
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,930
I am afraid of this surgery.

268
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,210
And I'm afraid of going to the moon.

269
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,730
It's not about the moon.

270
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,930
It's about the fear.

271
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,430
It's about getting beyond that.

272
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,760
That's how great things happen --

273
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,240
how they've always happened --

274
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,090
because someone took a chance.

275
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,730
From what I've read about you,

276
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,800
you're exactly the kind of person I need in my corner.

277
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,550
Exactly the kind of person

278
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,280
I would've thought would understand.

279
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,090
Fear is also what keeps us alive.

280
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,190
What do you think the odds are

281
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,870
of you not coming back from the moon?

282
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,210
The reason it's heroic, the reason it's exciting

283
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,000
is because you don't know what to expect.

284
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,860
You can't anticipate everything.

285
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,170
1%, 2%, maybe 5%.

286
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,390
60%.

287
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,440
This surgery, if I were doing it,

288
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,260
there is a 60% chance

289
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,790
that you die on the table.

290
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,590
It's called exposure therapy.

291
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,780
We'll lie down on the bed side-by-side,

292
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,260
fully clothed and not touching for 15 seconds.

293
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,690
When this timer goes off,

294
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,220
you'll go into the other room for a three-minute break,

295
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,980
and then we'll go again for 20 seconds.

296
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,590
Over time, we will progress to longer intervals

297
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,110
and start to lie closer together.

298
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,630
This seems like a good approach.

299
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,600
Whenever you're ready.

300
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,630
Are you okay?

301
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,960
What -- what are you feeling?

302
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,130
I -- I -- I don't know.

303
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,080
I don't -- I don't know.

304
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,530
I don't know why it didn't work!

305
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,890
It's okay, Shaun. We'll try again.

306
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,480
No! No.

307
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,280
No -- no, I can't.

308
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,990
W-we'll try for less time.

309
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,820
I can't do this!

310
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,610
Go.

311
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,600
What?

312
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,720
Go.

313
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,240
Get outta here.

314
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,340
We can watch the end --

315
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,720
I got the sheets,

316
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,740
the pillow, the damn lightbulb.

317
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,190
I read 18 psych journals.

318
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,320
And you give up after eight seconds?

319
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,120
You're right. This isn't going to work.

320
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,880
Go home.

321
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,030
How are things with Carly?

322
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,510
I lasted eight seconds.

323
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,500
She kicked me out of her house.

324
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,920
First time is difficult. I'm sure she didn't --

325
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,380
We tried timed exposure therapy to get physically closer,

326
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,060
but I... couldn't do it.

327
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,320
So try something else.

328
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,820
When I lie close to her, I feel diaphoretic,

329
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,560
my heart rate is elevated,

330
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,740
and mouth gets dry.

331
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't know how to not feel that way.

332
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,910
You want this, Shaun?

333
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,550
Yes.

334
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,140
Very much.

335
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,900
Then rely on your strengths.

336
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,640
Treat it like a surgical problem.

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,870
Do your research.

338
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,710
Carly came up with a solution, it didn't work,

339
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,650
but that doesn't mean the next one won't.

340
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,140
Give me some good news.

341
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,950
I had a potential donor in San Diego,

342
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,460
but the heart was just too damaged.

343
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm at the GE junction now.

344
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,200
Now she has complete right-sided failure, too.

345
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,430
It's time to discuss a DNR.

346
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,370
She's got one day left in this world.

347
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,970
Let's keep her comfortable.

348
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,260
60%?

349
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,390
That number is grossly exaggerated.

350
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,990
I spent an hour convincing my patient

351
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,130
I'm not trying to kill her.

352
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,940
She came to me. I gave her my surgical opinion.

353
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,690
I -- I could fire you for this.

354
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,220
Because I contradicted your opinion

355
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,810
after you contradicted my opinion?

356
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,600
I gave her an option you were too afraid to present.

357
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,860
No, you proposed a potentially deadly surgery

358
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,770
to a woman who was desperate for any option,

359
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,600
no matter how crazy.

360
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,630
- You don't have the authority -- - Authority?

361
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,790
I thought we were talking about the patient --

362
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,850
It was unprofessional, disrespectful --

363
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,820
- If anyone showed a lack of respect -- - I don't -- 

364
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,830
Doctors.

365
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
My office.

366
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,840
I wouldn't want to be kept alive on life support.

367
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,720
Not if there was no hope for a recovery.

368
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,580
There wouldn't be.

369
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,980
As your heart failure worsens,

370
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,260
you may get short of breath from fluid build-up.

371
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,440
We can use diuretics and vasodilators

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,890
to help control that.

373
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,220
I recommend both of those.

374
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,780
Of course. Yes.

375
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,340
If that doesn't help,

376
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,090
we could insert a catheter in your chest

377
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,960
to drain the fluid.

378
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
The procedure does risk a lung puncture,

379
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
which would worsen your symptoms.

380
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,540
You should give us every option

381
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,030
to keep you breathing easy.

382
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,890
And we'll be on call all night

383
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,940
to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.

384
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,460
Thank you.

385
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,050
I went through this with my mom

386
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,790
when she was dying of leukemia.

387
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm so sorry.

388
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,180
Was that recent?

389
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,340
I was 10.

390
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,060
I remember feeling so helpless...

391
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,580
You should reach out to Leo.

392
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,900
It's too late.

393
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't believe that.

394
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,460
There were, uh,

395
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,990
things between my wife and I

396
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,160
that I thought we could never get past.

397
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,500
But last Christmas...

398
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,350
...we almost lost our son.

399
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,470
And when I reached out, Mia was there.

400
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,340
Leo...

401
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,180
always made me feel pressured to choose

402
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,230
between my research and him.

403
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,900
Eventually, I realized he was right.

404
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,180
So I chose to go where I was needed the most.

405
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,490
To call him now would be hypocritical and...

406
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,240
unfair.

407
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,610
It took a lot of time

408
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,080
and dedication to push our understanding of leukemia

409
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,870
as far as you did.

410
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,610
I'm glad I have treatment options for my patients.

411
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,700
You made a good choice.

412
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

413
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,800
I assume that some of this is professional,

414
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,630
the other 90% is personal.

415
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,880
Am I right?

416
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
Well, it's a very difficult case.

417
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,100
We're both just overly invested.

418
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,880
Actually, I'd love for you to weigh in on this one.

419
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,670
Dr. Lim, are you confident in the surgical plan?

420
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,490
- Good luck. - Thank you.

421
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,270
You didn't even look at the case.

422
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,060
- The pulmonary -- - Dr. Lim is my Chief of Surgery.

423
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,600
I trust her judgment.

424
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,390
I'm sorry things got out of hand.

425
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,340
It won't happen again.

426
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,920
It better not happen again.

427
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,350
If you two can't control your interpersonal squabblings,

428
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm gonna have to lose one of you --

429
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,410
at least.

430
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,810
We need an endoscopy suite to fetch the spoon

431
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,270
out of this guy's stomach.

432
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,900
Cool.

433
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,710
How's the intimacy research going?

434
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,110
Dr. Elion has had a very successful life

435
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,530
without a relationship.

436
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,820
So can I.

437
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,560
Success and happiness aren't the same thing.

438
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,550
You need to decide what will make you happy in...the end.

439
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,170
I don't know if it's being a great surgeon

440
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,790
or being close to Carly.

441
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,570
But I'm better at surgery than I am with her.

442
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,330
Dr. Elion is wrong. You don't have to choose.

443
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,820
I fly to Phoenix every other weekend

444
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,450
to spend time with Mia and Kellan.

445
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,950
Then you won't be great at either.

446
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,980
I think Dr. Elion is afraid.

447
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,030
I think it was never about the journals

448
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,040
and the lives she could save.

449
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
I think she's always been afraid --

450
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,200
afraid she might lose Leo

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,030
just like she lost her mother.

452
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,730
And you,

453
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,540
you lost the person you loved the most

454
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,160
when your brother died.

455
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,940
Your elevated heart rate, sweaty palms --

456
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,210
they're not about your sensory issues, Shaun.

457
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,480
It's what we all feel --

458
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,590
fear.

459
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,710
W-why would anyone want to feel afraid?

460
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,100
Because the thought of ending up alone is scarier.

461
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,980
I don't think Dr. Elion refuses to call Leo

462
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,680
because it's hypocritical.

463
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,950
I think she's afraid he won't come.

464
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,490
Can you handle the spoon?

465
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,560
Yes.

466
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,850
Okay.

467
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,390
- Good morning, Dr. Glassman. - Morning.

468
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,040
Which shoulder would you like to hurt

469
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,770
for the next 24 hours?

470
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,770
I'm not here for a vaccine.

471
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,610
Okay.

472
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,640
Wrist and thumb joint pain. I need cortisone shots.

473
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,510
Surgery's in two hours.

474
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,820
Can I ask you something?

475
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,870
If a patient -- say, a violinist

476
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,070
who concertized three or four times a week --

477
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,010
were to come to you with achy joints,

478
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,600
would you give them a cortisone shot

479
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,730
or tell them to lay off for a while?

480
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,680
Better question --

481
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,230
if he or she came to you with achy joints

482
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,370
and pretended they needed a vaccination,

483
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,930
what would you do then?

484
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,270
It's...

485
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,530
It's because I wanted you to know

486
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,060
and no one else.

487
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,190
I saw a rheumatologist last month.

488
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,880
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

489
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm sorry to hear that.

490
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,800
My -- my mom had it, too.

491
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,770
It -- it destroyed her wrist and finger joints.

492
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,760
Maybe I should leave St. Bonaventure.

493
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,240
Berkeley's chief is retiring this year.

494
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,730
I could apply to replace him.

495
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,960
We're entitled to have differing opinions.

496
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,070
We can argue --

497
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,880
Apparently we can't.

498
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,890
I love you.

499
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,110
I want our relationship to work.

500
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,030
And I want to be chief.

501
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,480
If we can't find a way to work together with me as your boss,

502
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,560
then something has to change.

503
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,530
Looks like you caught it early,

504
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,780
without any noticeable erosion of the joints.

505
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,600
That's good. What's your D-MARD dose?

506
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,660
20 milligrams, but Dr. Baxter

507
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,890
just started it.

508
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,030
Okay.

509
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,990
You're gonna have to postpone

510
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,230
your first lead surgery for a while,

511
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,710
see how you respond.

512
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,270
I-I'd have to explain why to Andrews and Lim.

513
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,490
As you should.

514
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,340
A cortisone shot is just a temporary fix.

515
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,230
Do you know what the chances are the D-MARD

516
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,520
can maintain the dexterity you need

517
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,540
to perform an operation in the long run?

518
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,910
45%
45%.

519
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,880
I-it'll change the way they see me.

520
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,960
Yeah, you have a condition --

521
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,110
a medical condition.

522
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,630
They'll expect less from me.

523
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,910
They'll be looking for me to fail.

524
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,350
That's why I'm confiding in you instead of them.

525
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,890
You advocated for Shaun

526
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,840
when everybody else thought he couldn't be a surgeon.

527
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,530
I'm sorry, you're comparing arthritis to autism?

528
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm comparing people's assumptions,

529
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,060
people's prejudices.

530
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm asking for a chance to prove myself.

531
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,550
In this surgery today,

532
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,400
you're gonna have to create a plane as thin as paper

533
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,250
between two delicate layers of tissue

534
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,870
without disrupting the major blood flow to the brain.

535
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,570
If you miss by 1/10th -- 1/10th of a millimeter,

536
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,930
the patient will suffer permanent brain damage or worse.

537
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,380
Right now, it's a matter of pain,

538
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,770
not function.

539
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,680
You think I would put a patient's life at risk?

540
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,170
That's insulting.

541
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,020
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,240
Without the pain, I can do this.

543
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,220
You believed in Shaun.

544
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,990
I need someone to believe in me, too.

545
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,320
Okay.

546
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,690
Leo Adan?

547
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,900
That's me.

548
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,270
I'm Alex Park.

549
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,950
I'm Rosalind's doctor.

550
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,040
She's dying.

551
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,920
She wants to see you.

552
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,890
Then why didn't she call me? Why'd she send you?

553
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
She doesn't know I'm here.

554
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,960
Even when we were married, I never topped her to-do list.

555
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,500
She wasn't cheating on you.

556
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,590
She wasn't doing anything except saving lives.

557
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,800
She deserves to be cut a little slack.

558
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,330
Yeah.

559
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,440
She was saving the whole damn world.

560
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,620
She's a saint.

561
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,150
I made partner, she wasn't there, everybody understood.

562
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,920
My mother died, she wasn't there, everybody understood.

563
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,010
Well, I didn't.

564
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,650
Look, maybe I was a selfish jerk for wanting my wife to be around,

565
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,740
but I did.

566
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,240
She didn't send you.

567
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,960
Good for her.

568
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,130
She's not a hypocrite. At least that hasn't changed.

569
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,740
Assistant port is secured.

570
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,660
Load the forceps and electrocautery.

571
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,440
My chief's doing a difficult surgery.

572
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,710
I'm here to help in any way I can.

573
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,650
Instruments are ready.

574
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,500
Time of initial incision, 11:32.

575
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,650
- How is she? - She's really short of breath.

576
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,850
I gave her vasodilators and diuretics, but she's not settling.

577
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
She has bilateral pulmonary edema.

578
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,010
She needs 40 milligrams of furosemide.

579
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,670
I'll push two lorazepam, too.

580
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,660
I can't...

581
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,610
c-catch...my breath...

582
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,540
You've got fluid in your chest.

583
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,930
This medication should help ease your breathing.

584
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,840
She should be improving,

585
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,960
but she's not.

586
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,660
Maybe we should insert a drain.

587
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Shaun, this isn't about the fluid.

588
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,690
She's scared.

589
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,880
Rosalind,

590
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,160
I know this is frightening,

591
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,570
but you are not alone.

592
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,990
I'm here, and I am not going anywhere.

593
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,170
As long as you need me.

594
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,250
Leo.

595
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,870
I see the base of the tumor.

596
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,050
There's a lot of bleeding teasing off the pulmonary vein.

597
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,770
Put a bipolar electrocautery instrument on the right arm.

598
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,660
It's way more friable than it looks.

599
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,740
The tumor's invaded the vessel wall.

600
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,700
I need to load more hemostatic matrix.

601
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,590
If I keep going, I'll end up with a bleed I can't control.

602
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,570
I need to take the lung.

603
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,120
Prep her for an open thoracotomy.

604
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,620
I need a prostatectomy kit.

605
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,590
Now.

606
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,720
Prostate cancers tend to grow along the surrounding nerves.

607
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,700
The equipment's designed to dissect the tumor

608
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,200
without injuring the nerves.

609
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
Substitute arteries for nerves,

610
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,310
and you've got our situation.

611
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,020
Load the hot shears.

612
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,540
Unclamp the proximal and distal end.

613
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,660
You have good shunt flow.

614
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,930
Loupes.

615
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Forceps and dissector.

616
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,850
Is there a problem, Dr. Reznick?

617
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,720
Nice work, Dr. Reznick.

618
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,830
Did you...?

619
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,010
We got it all.

620
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,620
And you'll still need that flight suit.

621
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,910
Thanks, Doc.

622
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,330
He might've helped out a little, too.

623
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,190
The tumor was more entangled in your arteries than it appeared,

624
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,440
but Dr. Melendez pulled off a remarkable win for us.

625
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,830
This is the reason you still have two complete lungs.

626
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,120
Sign it.

627
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,260
Both of you.

628
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,900
I'm gonna leave it on the moon.

629
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,350
She's very close.

630
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,680
I'll pronounce her.

631
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,510
I'd like to do it.

632
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,110
Thank you.

633
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,480
I hope it's not too late.

634
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,510
It's fine.

635
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,620
Come in.

636
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,240
You were right.

637
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,110
That was a crazy surgery.

638
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,960
But not as crazy as I thought.

639
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,590
It wouldn't have even happened if it wasn't for you.

640
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,390
You were right, too.

641
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,930
I'm not objective when it comes to you.

642
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,560
I blew off your concerns about the risks

643
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,710
'cause I thought you'd lost your mojo.

644
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,590
Great.

645
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,680
We're both right.

646
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,530
And we found a way to work together.

647
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,030
And our patient's better off for it.

648
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,830
Today.

649
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,530
What about the next time?

650
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,740
We won't make the same mistakes.

651
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm not sure they were mistakes.

652
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,680
I think they might have just been our nature.

653
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,740
I don't think I can give you

654
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,060
the unconditional support you deserve from a partner

655
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,730
and the objectivity you need from a chief.

656
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,240
And...

657
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,550
I don't want to give up on my dream.

658
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,940
I love you.

659
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,230
But it's not enough.

660
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,870
Goodnight, Neil.

661
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,290
Dr. Reznick.

662
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,180
Dr. Glassman.

663
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,510
Thank you for your support.

664
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,180
My pain is 90% better than it was.

665
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,900
The shots helped.

666
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,740
Well, you did a remarkable job.

667
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,650
I'm fine.

668
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,660
Congratulations.

669
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,910
I did extensive further research

670
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,470
on intimacy treatment for autism.

671
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,750
And?

672
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,680
And...

673
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,390
I found nothing.

674
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,700
You were right.

675
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,050
Exposure therapy is the most effective option.

676
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,980
You're very smart and thorough.

677
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,510
Thank you.

678
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,680
I'd like to try again.

679
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,710
It's time to take a break.

680
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,410
I know.

681
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,880
This is terrifying.

682
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,090
And...

683
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,010
very nice.
