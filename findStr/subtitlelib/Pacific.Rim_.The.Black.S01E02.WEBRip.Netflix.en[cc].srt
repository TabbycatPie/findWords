You could call. They have phones, right?

182
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,299
You are absolutely right.

183
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,469
And I've earned some phone privileges
'cause of how awesome I am.

184
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,805
So, every night,
I expect you to be ready to chat.

185
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,764
[giggles]

186
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,391
I'll be ready.

187
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,726
[laughs]

188
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,813
[both laughing]

189
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,484
[laughter echoes]

190
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,363
[Hayley] Ah! Taylor? Taylor?

191
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,158
[grunts] Taylor. Taylor!

192
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,120
-[grunts]
-[coughs]

193
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,164
[gasps, panting]

194
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,296
[chuckles]

195
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,800
-What's so funny?
-I told you I'd get us here.

196
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,053
[Hayley]
Let's not take the same way back.

197
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,351
[birds cawing]

198
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,610
How far down?

199
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,737
Four levels.

200
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,989
Let's hope what we need is there,

201
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,158
or we'll be hunting
for a power cell store.

202
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,577
-[grunts] A what?
-Never mind.

203
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,919
-[birds cawing]
-[snarling]

204
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:15,920
[crunches]

205
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,968
Power cells
were serviced in the testing lab.

206
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,303
Wherever that is.

207
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,139
-You don't know?
-Well, cadets weren't allowed in there.

208
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,559
-I'll check this way.
-Meet me back here in ten.

209
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,729
[light bulb humming]

210
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,110
[liquid bubbling]

211
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,084
Finally.

212
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,588
[bubbling]

213
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,674
[liquid swishes]

214
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,726
[yelps]

215
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,024
[splutters]

216
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,411
Oh. There you are.

217
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,954
Taylor, look.

218
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,875
A power cell.

219
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,084
Yes, perfect.

220
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,129
Yeah, but, no. Not that.

221
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,297
This.

222
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,884
Keep looking.

223
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,805
[gasps] What is that?

224
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,433
-A kid?
-Yeah.

225
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,061
And I think that power cell
is what's been keeping him alive.

226
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,064
What the heck
was the PPDC doing down here?

227
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,691
Whatever.

228
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,151
They left him behind.

229
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,986
We need to get him out.

230
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,697
We don't know
if he can live outside this tank.

231
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,240
We have to risk it.

232
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,660
-Hayley, we can't--
-I'm not leaving him here to die!

233
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,246
Do not make this about Shadow Basin.

234
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,958
We can't just leave him.

235
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,423
How would we even get into this thing?

236
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
[metal clangs]

237
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,845
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

238
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,431
That's gonna bring
those creatures down here.

239
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,308
Taylor, please.

240
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,106
-Okay, but we need to do it fast.
-Right. Got it.

241
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,316
[metal clangs]

242
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,694
Move back. That's good.

243
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,073
[both grunt]

244
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,455
[banging echoes]

245
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,624
-[Kaiju snarling]
-Here they come.

246
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,418
[both grunting]

247
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,629
[Taylor] Again.

248
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,841
[snarling intensifies]

249
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,760
Keep trying.

250
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,429
[grunts]

251
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,349
[growls]

252
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,604
[banging continues]

253
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,483
Ah!

254
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,277
Ugh!

255
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,824
[glass shattering]

256
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,742
[liquid pouring]

257
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,764
You're okay.

258
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,267
I won't hurt you.

259
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,561
Come on.

260
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,439
We need to go.

261
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,107
[door banging]

262
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,025
I've got him!

263
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,818
[Kaiju snarling]

264
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,737
Get to the other door!

265
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,328
[Hayley grunts]

266
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,289
Taylor!

267
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,460
[roars]

268
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,421
[latch clicks]

269
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,506
[Hayley] Are you okay?

270
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,716
[grunting]

271
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,509
He's too weak to run.

272
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,636
Hey, little guy.

273
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,431
Don't worry about those things.
We're gonna get you outta here.

274
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,894
[grunts]

275
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,228
[door creaks]

276
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,814
[loud bang]

277
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,734
Wait. Wait. Here.

278
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,777
Right here.

279
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,164
Go! Go! Go!

280
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,834
[snarling]

281
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,629
We can't outrun them.

282
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,968
Help! Help!

283
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,386
What are you doing?

284
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,390
-That big Kaiju eats those things.
-Yeah, then it'll eat us too.

285
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,733
[whines]

286
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,321
[screeching]

287
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,705
[small Kaiju squeals]

288
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,877

[Taylor and Hayley panting]

291
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,150
That big Kaiju, it looked like a Jaeger.

292
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,779
I don't know how,
but I think it might be both.

293
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,616
It's like the world's gone crazy.

294
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,120
Small Kaiju, Jaeger-Kaiju, him.

295
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,749
At least we've got each other.

296
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,835
And this.

297
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,380
Ugh! Cracked?

298
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,007
-Really?
-[glass shatters]

299
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,720
-We'll just find another one.
-We barely survived finding this one.

300
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,805
I know. But we did.

301
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,979
I wouldn't have made it through today
without you.

302
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,330
I wouldn't have made it
through the last five years without you.

[instrumental theme music playing]
