21
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,700
So, who was that?

22
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,010
A housekeeper.

23
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,230
Leaving your place at 7:00 in the morning?

24
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,610
I was interviewing her.

25
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,850
You're hiring a housekeeper for a studio apartment?

26
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,050
I'm not hiring her.

27
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,540
Her clothes don't match.

28
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,330
Right.

29
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,710
You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy.

30
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,210
Today we realize a dream --

31
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,200
seeing our international humanitarian program come to fruition.

32
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,430
Our cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Neil Melendez,

33
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,060
in consultation with our head cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,

34
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,330
evaluated children from Tanzania to Malawi to Guinea.

35
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,450
They screened over 100 candidates,

36
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,500
each of them needing life-saving surgeries.

37
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,830
Ultimately, we decided on a particularly inspiring young boy

38
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,770
named Gabriel,

39
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,330
who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

40
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,830
with severe congenital heart anomalies.

41
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,050
We identified three perfect candidates --

42
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,280
- children I can actually help. - Hi. Thank you.

43
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,450
- Gabriel wasn't one of them. - Yes and no.

44
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,870
I signed off on your choices.

45
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,740
But I wouldn't have necessarily eliminated Gabriel

46
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,040
based on the echo I saw.

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,620
A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon

48
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,530
on his selection of surgical candidates.

49
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,480
It's healthy when colleagues challenge each others' decisions.

50
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,610
It doesn't make any sense.

51
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,970
We gave you good candidates.

52
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,780
You're not a doctor.

53
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,440
Why wouldn't you stick with the list?

54
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,810
There were several intangibles.

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?

56
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,440
One of those intangibles, I'm guessing, is cuteness.

57
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,730
Family displaced during the war.

58
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,240
Mother took care of her husband

59
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,570
until he died of yellow fever.

60
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,770
He bled out at home.

61
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,250
A month later, Gabriel was born.

62
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,480
People tend to give more when the cause is not only noble,

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,780
but photogenic,

64
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,780
Adorable kids and sympathetic moms may work on donors,

65
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,790
but they won't work on me,

66
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,710
and they certainly won't work on echo results.

67
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,980
Kinda working on me.

68
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,150
Before you say no, at least do your own work-up.

69
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,290
Mommy, why can't I come?

70
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,890
The hospital's worried that children bring in germs.

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,540
I won't, Mommy. I promise.

72
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,490
I know, boo. It's just -- It's the rules.

73
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,210
Okay, baby. I have to go now.

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,490
Do what Aunt Maggie says. I'll call you later, okay?

75
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,860
I love you to the moon...

76
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,460
And back.

77
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,040
I can't imagine voice rest could be very easy with a 3-year-old.

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,990
Yeah. Not very effective for my podcast audience either.

79
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,020
Of which, by the way, I'm a huge fan.

80
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,950
Grim irony, though, right?

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
A podcaster who loses her voice.

82
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,080
Elizabeth, I'm sure the nodule will be benign

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,890
and this'll be nothing more than an inspiration for another great episode.

84
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,690
If it's not benign, Isabel?

85
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,620
Today we're just focused on removing the nodule

87
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,600
and doing the biopsy.

88
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
And you've done everything you could do.

89
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,070
And when the hoarseness started,

90
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,870
you sought early care from the best.

91
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,170
And I sent you to the best.

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,220
You work perfectly together,

93
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,120
kind of ping and pong-ish.

94
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,450
It's nice.

95
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,840
A lot of doctors who are married

96
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,650
are more like miss and match.

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
Mrs. Bangura, this is Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu.

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,370
They're gonna help me run some tests on Gabriel.

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,480
I heard that you and Gabriel

100
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,850
have never been away from home before.

101
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,720
I was hoping that these would make him feel welcome.

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
Yes. You are kind.

103
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,260
I brought one for myself, too.

104
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,430
How 'bout we all do some medicine?

105
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,250
He really needs our help.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,470
"He needs our help"?

107
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,700
He sounds like he's got a blow dryer in his chest.

108
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,640
Exactly. Which is why he needs our help.

109
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,100
This is the problem with cardiologists --

110
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,190
You're really good at telling people when something's broken,

111
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,800
not so good at knowing when they can't be fixed.

112
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
If that kid is dying, I'm not gonna tell his mother that

113
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,100
unless I'm damn sure.

114
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,950
You heard that heart.

115
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,080
I heard that heart.

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
And it sounded like crap.

117
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,560
But until we do a transesophageal echo,

118
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know anything.

119
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,230
Do a transesophageal echo.

120
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,820
She has a master's degree in Sociology,

121
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,190
impeccable credentials, excellent references,

122
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,480
and you turned her away because "Her clothes didn't match"?

123
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,470
It's relevant.

124
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,030
If a life-skills coach can't select a complementing wardrobe,

125
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,150
they lack life skills.

126
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,070
But she's not gonna pick out your clothes for you.

127
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,410
She's not a nanny.

128
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,130
She's there to help you with problem-solving,

129
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,610
financial, social interactions.

130
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,910
You're doing this because I did not react well

131
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,050
to a man with a gun robbing a store I was in.

132
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,750
Statistically, that is very unlikely to ever happen to me again.

133
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,300
Social interactions will happen again and again and again.

134
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,250
It's statistically irrefutable.

135
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,090
And if you learn how to get along with people

136
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,050
a little bit better, you'll have a fuller life. A happier life.

137
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,310
If you don't like this woman, we'll find somebody else.

138
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,770
I am happy.

139
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,740
You could be happier.

140
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,870
I don't think so.

141
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,600
My neighbor, Lea.

142
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,470
If she were ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first.

143
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,520
Why's that?

144
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,050
Dr. Melendez says attractive people have advantages.

145
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,660
Dr. Melendez says that, does he?

146
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,920
Why is that funny?

147
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,570
I don't know. It's just, um,

148
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,920
some people consider Dr. Melendez attractive.

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
So, how's it going with Lea?

150
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,990
She doesn't like me.

151
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,190
Why do you say that?

152
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,400
- She said I was an asshat. - Yeah?

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,320
What was she doing when she said that?

154
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,070
- Touching me. - She was flirting with you.

155
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,040
Sometimes people say the opposite of what they mean.

156
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,250
They use teasing as a way

157
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,770
of saying something they don't mean

158
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,820
instead of saying something that they do.

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,820
I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms

160
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,180
as a flirting technique.

161
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,220
Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for.

162
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,670
- You ready? - Yes.

163
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay. The pretentious giggle.

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,290
The, uh -- the squirm.

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
And the hair sweep.

166
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,980
I call it the flirting trifecta.

167
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,510
Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire.

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur.

169
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,840
Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment

170
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,000
to let a potential mate know they're interested.

171
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,410
Or it could be ringworm.

172
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,250
Yeah.

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,540
I suppose you have to factor for that possibility.

174
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Nice touch.

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
Beauty increases happiness.

176
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Happiness improves outlook.

177
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,380
Still on Mission Carpe Diem.

178
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,600
You might want to try it.

179
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,810
I'm doing fine.

180
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,240
We're having dinner at the sink.

181
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,440
No, we're enjoying dinner at the sink.

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,960
Although if you keep talking like that...

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,260
Andrews.

184
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,370
Well, look again. It has to be there.

185
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,650
Yeah. Okay.

186
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,490
Who was that?

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,570
The lab.

188
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,140
They misplaced Elizabeth's specimen.

189
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,990
- Oh, my God. - Don't worry. They'll find it.

190
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,120
Satisfied?

191
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,310
- It's somewhere. - Somewhere else.

192
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,320
I love how everyone in surgery is so fast to blame the lab.

193
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,080
Well, double-checking can't hurt.

194
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,170
Actually it can.

195
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,960
Because you are here

196
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,610
when you should be double-checking surgery.

197
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,000
I saw the specimen go in the container.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,380
It means it has to be here.

199
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,200
No, all that means is that it was put in a container.

200
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,130
It doesn't mean that that container

201
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,100
was actually put in the surgery refrigerator

202
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,440
or that it was actually picked up by the courier.

203
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,390
He's even worse than we thought.

204
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,340
Yeah.

205
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,420
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,

206
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,880
atrial septal defect,

207
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,590
abnormal insertion of the mitral valve leaflet.

208
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,770
I've never seen so many anomalies in one heart.

209
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,630
I'm sorry I pushed for additional testing.

210
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,820
That only got his mother's hopes up.

211
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,620
Any medication that'll help?

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,440
Beta blockers.

213
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,800
Maybe metoprolol.

214
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,570
It's not like they'll get him playing soccer,

215
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,830
but they might help him get to the field to watch.

216
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,730
For a couple of years, anyway.

217
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,220
Better than dying on a table tomorrow.

218
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,190
You tell Aoki.

219
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll break it to the mom.

220
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,800
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

221
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,200
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

222
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,450
It's called sakara, given by our shaman.

223
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,230
His heartbeat...

224
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,500
it follows the sound.

225
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,290
It reminds it to beat until you fix it.

226
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,090
Mrs. Bangura, I've completed all the tests.

227
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,760
And I'm sorry that you've come all this way --

228
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,310
When Gabriel was in my belly,

229
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,450
evil spirits came to him.

230
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,990
Invade his heart.

231
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,120
Our village shaman tried to rid them.

232
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,300
He could not.

233
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,970
Then a vision came to him.

234
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,310
A stronger healer would come.

235
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,890
You.

236
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,090
You will save Gabriel.

237
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,020
I don't know about evil spirits.

238
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,980
All I know is that your son was born

239
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,550
with a heart that I can't fix.

240
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,870
I'm sorry.

241
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,810
I would not have come so far if I did not believe.

242
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,970
We'll give him medicine to make him feel better.

243
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,730
And then you can take him home.

244
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,690
We tell her we're sorry,

245
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,500
we have no news yet, and then --

246
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,420
Nope. You can't say that.

247
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,490
It's an expensive word.

248
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,830
- "Sorry"? - You can act sorry.

249
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,820
You can feel sorry.

250
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,140
In fact, you should feel sorry.

251
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,270
You just can't say it.

252
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,260
Okay, uh, "I feel bad for you

253
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,140
- because we made a mistake and --" - Nope.

254
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,700
A mistake isn't a mistake?

255
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,690
Well, it's "An unanticipated outcome of an expected action."

256
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,160
You can't use language that implies blameworthy conduct.

257
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,350
But if we did lose the specimen, isn't it actually a mistake,

258
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,000
and aren't we sorry, and aren't we blameworthy?

259
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,390
Yes.

260
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,960
Doesn't mean we can make it any easier for her attorney.

261
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,150
Hello, Elizabeth.

262
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm Jessica Preston from Risk Management.

263
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,660
How are you?

264
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,930
I don't like the sound of that.

265
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,310
I know. I really need a new -- a new job title.

266
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,160
Seems that we've encountered an unexpected occurrence.

267
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,900
The laboratory has been unable to locate your tissue specimen.

268
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,610
We don't want you to be unnecessarily alarmed,

269
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,970
but we want you to be fully aware of what's going on.

270
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,980
But ho-- How will I know if I have cancer

271
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,270
if you don't find it?

272
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,790
We are looking everywhere.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,930
We will find it.

274
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,110
As long as it's in formalin or a refrigerator,

275
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,140
everything will be fine.

276
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,160
For how long?

277
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,620
At least 24 hours. Maybe even 36.

278
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,150
Well, then you better find it.

279
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,370
Because I will be damned

280
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,010
if I'm gonna have my voice box removed

281
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,580
just because somebody screwed up.

282
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,640
I've implemented a proactive educational plan.

283
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,310
Well, that's terrific, Shaun.

284
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,880
Why are we talking about that here?

285
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm not stupid.

286
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,470
I didn't say you were stupid, Shaun.

287
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,540
Nobody said you were stupid.

288
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,980
But sometimes you lack common sense.

289
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

290
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,350
This patient is deaf.

291
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,880
I started flirting lessons yesterday.

292
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,600
Flirting lessons.

293
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,700
Wish they'd had that when I was young.

294
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,830
Yes, I learned about the flirting trifecta.

295
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,730
There's the pretentious giggle.

296
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,130
Shaun, what are you getting at?

297
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,490
Flirting,

298
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,810
it requires primarily nonverbal interactions.

299
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,110
Being perceptive in one social dimension

300
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,310
translates well to other social skills.

301
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,830
You're studying flirting.

302
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,560
Are you lonely, Shaun?

303
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,490
'Cause you know there are... There are websites now where you can --

304
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,110
I like being alone.

305
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah, well, being alone and being lonely are two different things.

306
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,030
Sometimes we're lonely, and we don't even know it.

307
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,270
How would I know it?

308
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,600
Well, uh, loneliness, it's kind of a dull...

309
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,860
It's like a dark...

310
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,110
Are you lonely?

311
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,010
Yeah, sometimes.

312
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,870
You know, sometimes very much.

313
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,520
You should learn the trifecta.

314
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,580
We're looking for a lost specimen

315
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,360
that I am positive left the O.R.

316
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,940
And I'm positive it didn't make it to the lab.

317
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,580
And since you're the link between the two,

318
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,220
we wanted to ask you about your 3:00 run yesterday.

319
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,520
So, you took everything

320
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,450
that was in the refrigerator in the O.R.?

321
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,240
In the refrigerator, out of the refrigerator.

322
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,480
Everything that's meant to go, I took.

323
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,370
- Did you stop on the way? -No.

324
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,050
Straight from the surgery to the lab, just like the rules say.

325
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,620
Well, did you stop at the restroom

326
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,650
or the -- the coffee machine, the cafeteria?

327
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,390
You know, believe it or not,

328
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,370
I can go a whole 30 minutes

329
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,040
without stopping for a cream puff.

330
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,350
We're just desperate.

331
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,700
All we care about is the specimen

332
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,530
and avoiding a full-on investigation.

333
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,430
Investigation?

334
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

335
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,640
I-I-I-If we don't find it,

336
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,620
then the legal department gets involved.

337
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,050
Everyone who was in contact with it,

338
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,810
who might have been in contact with it

339
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,570
goes under a magnifying glass.

340
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,530
I'm not looking forward to it.

341
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,560
You looking forward to it? She's not looking forward to it.

342
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,690
They're gonna check your social media, your computer.

343
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,020
- Blood tests. - Blood tests.

344
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,550
But if you find it before then...?

345
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,690
Then life goes on.

346
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,290
The same as it always has.

347
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
I did stop.

348
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,220
At the cafeteria.

349
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,430
The cashier is smokin'.

350
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,100
I might have been distracted for a little while.

351
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,390
Okay.

352
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,100
Thanks.

353
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,840
Water.

354
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,070
Always more water.

355
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,880
Even more.

356
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
I know. It's scary.

357
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,240
You are good with children.

358
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,880
You are father?

359
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,590
No.

360
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,450
One day, I hope.

361
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,030
Page rapid response team, STAT.

362
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,530
Has he developed endocarditis?

363
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,130
His echo didn't reveal vegetations on his valves or...

364
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,890
endocardium.

365
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,760
He has not developed a fever.

366
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,290
Let's be sure. Get blood cultures.

367
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,710
Order them times two, 15 minutes.

368
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,040
It's in the wrong place.

369
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,250
It was in the wrong place.

370
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,820
Okay.

371
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,710
Times two. 15 minutes apart.

372
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,490
Leonard says that he stops by here to see you.

373
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,800
Yeah.

374
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
He pretends the cafeteria is on his route.

375
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600
Like I don't know where the lab is.

376
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,220
Yesterday around 3:00, Gwen.

377
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,640
Notice anything on the food trays that wasn't food?

378
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,440
Around 3:00?

379
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,050
Just the usual --

380
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,640
Tupperware, sunglasses, cellphones, a condom.

381
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,380
Around 4:00, I found a glass eye.

382
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,330
You see a biohazard bag?

383
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,460
The ziplock bag with the red circles?

384
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,170
Yeah.

385
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,410
C'mon.

386
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,920
You can move the mitral valve.

387
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,080
Thanks for the visual aid.

388
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,860
You can't move the mitral valve.

389
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,740
Now, if Mr. Potato Head had an atrial septal nose

390
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,760
- and hypertrophic obstructive -- - I believe --

391
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,850
- I believe the abnormal insertion of the mitral valve can be -- - Stop.

392
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,730
Follow me.

393
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,810
Pretty sure I saw a biohazard bag in here yesterday.

394
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,330
You're lucky you came when you did.

395
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,010
It's due to get dumped in two hours.

396
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,270
Dentures. They're the worst.

397
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,850
You know, every patient gets a denture cup with their name on it.

398
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,230
So, tell me, why are the dentures never in the cup?

399
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,070
And if they are, it's the wrong cup?

400
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,060
One of life's mysteries.

401
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,280
Biohazard bag sighting.

402
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,190
A biohazard bag for a coin purse?

403
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,130
Really?

404
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,510
Finally, a septal myectomy

405
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,950
will open the outflow tract,

406
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,650
and the mitral valve can be re-implanted

407
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,570
into a more normal position.

408
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,770
Thank you. That's my idea.

409
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,870
Can you do this procedure on Gabriel?

410
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,620
No.

411
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,750
It's a terrible idea, and it won't work.

412
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,320
So, what was the point of this dog and pony show?

413
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,820
'Cause you seemed keen on making medical decisions for me.

414
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,290
So just insubordination?

415
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,800
And we were probably gonna wind up coming to you anyway.

416
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,410
Once Dr. Murphy gets an idea, he stays with it,

417
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,150
regardless of what anyone says.

418
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,790
This can work.

419
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,910
Yes, this can work.

420
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,100
And it would be a great idea if the boy had two hours to live.

421
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,730
Is fear of failure a good reason not to do this?

422
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,780
No.

423
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,990
But you know what is?

424
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,880
The thought that he might have a few more birthdays...

425
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,160
or make a best friend.

426
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,760
I don't know. I'm not sending him home in a box.

427
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,240
We got to go.

428
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,180
Gabriel's arrhythmia, it's gotten worse.

429
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,730
You still haven't found it?

430
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,910
I can get Ms. Preston to address any questions --

431
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,900
She wasn't in the surgery. You were.

432
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,280
She is the point person for all therapeutic misadventures.

433
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,550
Are you kidding me?

434
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,980
I may lose my voice for absolutely no reason,

435
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,650
and you are using canned jargon.

436
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,180
That sample cup doesn't have toothpaste

437
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,180
or socks or sunblock in it, okay?

438
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,270
It has my life!

439
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,430
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,120
Thank you.

441
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
- Good for you. - Yeah, right.

442
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,040
- I just broke about eight rules. - Maybe.

443
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,050
"Ms. Preston" won't hear about it from me.

444
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,010
You should go find that sample, though.

445
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,340
Thanks.

446
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,700
The meds aren't working. The question is why.

447
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,730
M-Maybe the arrhythmia is just another manifestation

448
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,190
of Gabriel's L.V. Dysfunction.

449
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,520
We should still be seeing at least a modest decline in his ectopy.

450
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,010
Maybe his gradient is worse.

451
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,710
We could try calcium channel blockers.

452
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,430
There's a much simpler explanation.

453
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
Good news about his endocarditis --

454
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,210
heart inflammation.

455
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,490
His tests are normal.

456
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,740
But we still are concerned.

457
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
For some reason, his medication isn't helping.

458
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,380
Our best explanation is...

459
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,300
he hasn't been taking his medication.

460
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,710
I am trying to save his life.

461
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,900
But withholding his medicine?

462
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,540
By keeping him here.

463
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,210
If he takes the medicine and becomes better,

464
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,230
you send him to die.

465
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,580
But there is nothing else that we can do for him here.

466
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,430
You do not understand where I live, what it is like.

467
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,350
I don't know your village.

468
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,940
But I do know what it's like to be poor.

469
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,900
I grew up with nothing.

470
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,490
My sister was disabled.

471
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,010
My parents couldn't afford her meds or treatments.

472
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,130
And it killed them,

473
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,420
and me, to watch her suffer.

474
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,250
But when nothing can be done, nothing can be done.

475
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,520
You became a doctor?

476
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,390
You did not accept being poor.

477
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,020
No.

478
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,060
Then you do not understand at all.

479
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,420
We want for everything -- food.

480
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,500
Peace. Medicine.

481
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,850
But our greatest want is hope.

482
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,060
If we leave here, we leave hope behind.

483
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,830
Okay.

484
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,590
I'll do what I can.

485
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,010
I dropped by to see Elizabeth.

486
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,900
Not surprisingly, she's very upset.

487
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,970
There wasn't much I could offer in the way of comfort.

488
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,610
If only people did their jobs.

489
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,860
Which people?

490
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,730
Scrub nurses, couriers, lab techs...

491
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,840
That's a curiously limited list.

492
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,030
I did the surgery correctly.

493
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,160
I don't think it's too much to expect others

494
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,110
to do their jobs correctly, as well.

495
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,020
So, not your fault, not your problem.

496
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,840
What are you trying to do, make me feel guilty?

497
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,360
Yes. I want you to feel horrible.

498
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,820
That's the only thing that's gonna make you change.

499
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,770
- Into what? - The guy I married.

500
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,920
The guy who cared more about patients than politics.

501
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,320
Okay, I get it.

502
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,120
This is about me vying for president of the hospital.

503
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,730
Which we discussed at length,

504
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,570
which you said you were 100% behind me on.

505
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,320
I didn't realize how far behind.

506
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,120
You think I've left you behind?

507
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,470
Tuesday --

508
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,350
"Capital expenditures meeting delayed. Will be late."

509
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,230
- Thursday -- - Iz, there are things about my job --

510
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,140
Right.

511
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,770
"Not your fault."

513
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,980
Hello.

514
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,250
Did you know that specimens in formalin go to one place,

515
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,210
exempt specimens somewhere else,

516
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,080
aerobic and anaerobic cultures two different places?

517
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,290
radioactive, medical device,

518
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,260
forensic specimens -- all different?

519
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,700
And all handled by different staff?

520
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,820
Did you know that?

521
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,660
Yes.

522
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,770
I made a chart, too.

523
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,040
A qualitative observation log of what you taught me.

524
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,160
What did I teach you?

525
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,110
Flirting.

526
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,950
Every time I saw someone flirt, I noted it

527
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,960
and cross-referenced the subject, object, and nonverbal gestures.

528
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,620
I knew it.

529
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,130
Gwen, the cashier.

530
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,010
She made out that it was all the courier, but --

531
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,560
That's my name.

532
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,100
Yes. You made flirting gestures.

533
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

534
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,460
You brushed your hair back.

535
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,800
Right hand, side sweeping.

536
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,860
At Dr. Melendez?

537
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,700
No, I don't think so. Shaun.

538
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,420
- No. - Yes.

539
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,980
You were at the nurses station,

540
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,880
and he said, "Good for you,"

541
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,510
and you said, "Yeright. I just broke about eight rules,"

542
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,090
and smiled and giggled and brushed your hair back.

543
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,610
"Ms. Preston" Won't hear about it from me.

544
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,640
It's possible you have ringworm.

545
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,660
Shaun, sometimes people toss their hair

546
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,510
just 'cause it's in their face.

547
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,470
Murphy.

548
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,920
I'd like you to elaborate on your idea.

549
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,810
My terrible idea?

550
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,910
That's the one.

551
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,140
You can move the anterior leaflet of the valve and reattach it.

552
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,300
No, we can't.

553
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,160
This is an exact replica of the kid's heart,

554
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,800
and there's no anchor point to reattach it.

555
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,330
So that part of your idea is still terrible.

556
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,300
Okay.

557
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,460
But the rest of it?

558
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,180
We're dealing with a huge septum --

559
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,470
25 millimeters.

560
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,130
What would that number be in a healthy kid?

561
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,210
About 8.

562
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,020
If we go anywhere near that number,

563
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,470
we won't have enough support for the valve.

564
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,520
But let's say we took that down to 20...

565
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,860
That won't be enough to relieve the outflow obstruction.

566
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,950
Okay.

567
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,810
18.

568
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
Okay.

570
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,340
Let's take him off bypass.

572
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,880
He's dead.

573
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
Again. 16.

574
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,190
I'm really tired.

575
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,770
I used to think that

576
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,090
I wanted to be the best surgeon in history.

577
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,450
But my new goal?

578
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,370
Is just not to get washed out of my residency.

579
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,700
You have a surgery now?

580
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,640
No.

581
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,290
I'm here to see how I can help.

582
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,830
The Chief of Surgery joining the search party?

583
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,850
Should I take a selfie,

584
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,970
show my friends that this really happened?

585
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,210
This is a team problem.

586
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,540
It should be a team solution.

587
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
How do you get a boss like this?

588
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,740
What do we know so far?

589
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,460
Let's take him off bypass.

590
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,980
His outflow is perfect at 13 millimeters.

591
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,830
Which is irrelevant when the mitral valve...

592
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,900
...doesn't have enough support to close.

593
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,900
He's dead.

594
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,020
Again.

595
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,670
Dr. Browne.

596
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,520
Any reason you assumed responsibility on behalf of the hospital...

597
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,740
told Elizabeth you were "Sorry"?

598
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,230
Because I was.

599
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,070
Well, I hope we don't see the price tag on that.

600
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,420
And I think you're out of time.

601
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,330
Let's take him off bypass.

603
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,490
Yes.

604
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,030
14 millimeters.

605
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,000
Exactly.

606
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,560
Yeah.

607
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,940
Exactly.

608
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,450
Our margin of error is exceedingly low.

609
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Good luck.

610
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,640
You believe in luck?

611
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,630
It's something people say in difficult situations.

612
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,310
Neither do I.

613
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,870
Again.

614
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,800
The reality is, even if we found your specimen now,

615
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,650
it's unlikely that it'd still be viable.

616
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,540
You don't know if I have cancer,

617
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,620
and there's no way to find out.

618
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,770
So my choices are surgery I may not need...

619
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,650
...that will leave me without speech,

620
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,500
or I do nothing and maybe die.

621
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,540
Unfortunately, yes.

3 hours, 30 minutes.

636
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,650
You didn't want him on bypass any longer than five hours.

638
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,390
"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,

639
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,660
and Nod is a little head,

640
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,730
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies

641
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,730
is a wee one's trundle-bed.

642
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,560
So shut your eyes while Mother sings --

643
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,630
How's it look, Dr. Murphy?

644
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,570
14 millimeters.

645
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,880
Exactly.

646
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,500
Perfect.

647
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,470
His septal tissue...

648
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,360
It's stiffer than I anticipated.

649
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't think this is gonna be enough for adequate outflow.

650
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm taking the septum down to 13.

651
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,190
Okay, the valve wasn't supported at 13.

652
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,370
The patient died.

653
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,450
That was a model, not a patient.

654
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,030
We're at five hours and three minutes.

655
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,650
We're taking him down to 13.

656
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,370
Field.

657
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,980
All quiet for the time-out.

658
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,770
Patient is Elizabeth McLaren.

659
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,890
No known allergies.

660
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,080
We'll be doing a total laryngectomy

661
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,770
with a Gluck Sorenson U-shaped incision.

662
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,130
Is everyone in agreement?

663
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,910
Antibiotics in?

664
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,680
One gram of cefotaxime has been infused.

665
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,060
We anticipate a specimen.

666
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,810
I've requested labels be printed.

667
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,980
Pen.

668
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,170
Prepare to intubate.

669
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,970
Dentures.

670
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,930
You've gotta hold the surgery.

671
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,530
Just give me a little time.

672
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,250
That's 13.

673
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,870
Dammit.

674
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,240
Too thin?

675
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,130
The valve doesn't have adequate support.

676
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,260
It won't be able to close.

677
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,110
I was wrong.

678
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,860
There's a reattachment point.

679
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,570
We must not have seen it at 14

680
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,330
'cause it was obscured by the subvalvular tissue.

681
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,470
We can use that as an anchor point and move the valve.

682
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,520
Your terrible idea just got a hell of a lot better.

683
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,430
Stitch.

684
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,380
5 hours, 23 minutes.

685
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,280
Dentures.

686
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,550
They always end up in the wrong cup,

687
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,850
which is why they're so hard to get back to the owner.

688
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,920
- Okay. - Right.

689
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,100
What if the label on the specimen was wrong?

690
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,130
What -- what if the nodule is here,

691
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,800
but the container has the wrong name on it?

692
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,780
Okay, I'm reconciling the operative records

693
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,710
to the surgery schedule to the specimen.

694
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,490
I'll read the cases, check the containers,

695
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,020
and feel like a jerk for judging you.

696
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,240
Well, you're only a jerk if I'm right.

697
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,050
Pump time?

698
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,760
6 hours, 48 minutes.

699
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,290
Get Mehta in here.

700
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,610
Let's take him off bypass.

701
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,520
12 seconds.

702
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,610
Should I get the paddles?

703
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,720
Not yet.

704
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,420
Come on, Gabriel.

705
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,290
How long has he been on bypass?

706
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,990
Nearly two hours too long. We need to jump-start --

707
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,070
Not yet!

708
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,370
Yeah.

709
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,860
Yes!

710
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,610
Dr. Murphy, close him up.

There was a specimen cup in the O.R. prior to your surgery.

It was supposed to be used for a bullet removal,

728
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,170
but they left the bullet in the body,

729
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,160

Yes, you did.

00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,930
That was a hell of an operation.

749
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,840
Yes.

750
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,740
And I caught Claire flirting.

751
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,760
With you?

752
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,840
Shaun, I think you might be mis--

753
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,330
With Dr. Melendez.

754
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,850
Dr. Melendez.

755
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,370
I conducted observations,

756
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,750
successfully interpreted them, and logged them.

757
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,180
Romance in a spreadsheet.

758
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,260
I love it.

759
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,370
I was aware of the cues even when Claire wasn't.

760
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,890
I think she needs a life-skills coach.

761
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,380
Extrapolating.

762
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,400
I like that, too.

763
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,380
That's great, Shaun.

764
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,540
You're paying attention. You're learning.

765
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,850
And when we find you a life coach, one with a fashion sense,

766
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,370
then you're gonna be learning better,

767
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,090
you're gonna be learning faster.

768
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,300
Are you giving up on me?

769
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,650
What?

770
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,330
No. I haven't given up on you.

771
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,830
I don't want a stranger helping me.

772
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,890
I know, Shaun. But...

773
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,430
And I can't...

774
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,860
I can't always be there. I-I..

775
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,170
I can't always help you the way you need to be helped,

776
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,220
the way you deserve to be helped.

777
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,620
I don't want a stranger helping me.

778
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,130
Congratulations.

779
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,660
You too.

780
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,860
On your mad sleuthing skills.

781
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,840
Something to fall back on if this surgery thing gets old.

782
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,600
You did a nice job, Claire.

783
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,090
- Thanks. - And here is our price tag.

784
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,450
We've been served.

785
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,150
But we found it. Elizabeth's fine.

786
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,080
I know.

787
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,900
But we put her through two days of hell,

788
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,190
and she wants to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.

789
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,250
I mean, good for her.

790
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,130
What is this?

791
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,780
Gabriel's pacemaker.

792
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,740
I heard you were brilliant again today.

793
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,140
I got lucky.

794
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,160
Do you think Armen would kill me if I got a pet hedgehog?

795
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,390
I mean, I read that they're actually pretty --

796
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,160
- Lea. - Yes, Shaun?

797
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,400
You look absurd in that sweater.

798
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,470
I have apples.

799
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,800
Do you want an apple?

800
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,990
Yeah.
