1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,270
《纽约客》  你又来了
Oh, New Yorker, you've done it again.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,500
杰  快来看这个漫画
Jay, check out this cartoon.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,700
有会说话的狗吗
Does it have a talking dog?

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,510
-没  是在评价...  -我不看了
- No, it's a commentary on... - I'm out.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,820
给你
Here you go,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,730
我最用心做的一个
one of my best efforts.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,500
吃吧
Have at it.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,630
我不能吃
Mm, I can't eat that.

9
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,960
-为什么不能吃  -碰到酸黄瓜了
- Why not? - The pickle's touching it.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,850
好了
There.

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,960
面包还是沾到汁了  好恶  那是什么
The juice got on the bread and, ew, what's that stuff?

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
香料
Spices.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,410
跟海猴子似的
They look like sea monkeys.

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,110
你真的认真观察过酸黄瓜吗  杰
Have you ever really examine a jar of pickles, Jay?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,210
黏糊糊的一团  我不吃了
It's like a swamp there. I'll pass.

16
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,790
出什么事了
What happened?

17
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,970
我给他做了个美味的三明治  他却不吃
I made him a beautiful sandwich and he won't eat it.

18
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,140
对啊  因为上面有腌黄瓜
Yeah, 'cause it had pickles on it.

19
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,990
乔在睡午觉
Joe is taking a nap.

20
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,190
我要去干洗店
I'm gonna go to the dry cleaners.

21
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,460
如果你路过寿司店
Well, if you're passing a sushi restaurant --

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,200
她不会路过的
She's not.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,280
我从没听过谁不爱酸黄瓜的
I've never heard of anyone not liking pickles.

24
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,650
那今天就是历史性的一天啦
Aw, big day for you, then.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,830
我自己做个烤奶酪三明治好了
I'm just gonna make myself a grilled cheese.

26
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,290
我应该是看到有格鲁耶尔奶酪了
I think I saw some Gruye in there.

27
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,230
我们有无花果吗
Do we have any fig?

28
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,180
坐下
Sit down.

29
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,290
你这种挑剔的毛病出去可不行
This whole persnickety thing is not gonna fly in the world.

30
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,380
别再给别人取笑你的理由了
Never hand people another reason to make fun of you.

31
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,590
你是指那些穿着皮夹克
You mean like all the cool kids

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,060
爱吃酸黄瓜的酷小孩吗
with their leather jackets and their pickles?

33
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,550
你至少尝一口酸黄瓜
Well, you're gonna sit there

34
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,840
否则坐在这儿不许走
until you at least try a pickle.

35
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,960
你被权力冲昏头脑了
You're drunk with power.

36
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,740
你说对了
You got that right.

第五季 第二十二集

48
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,470
-不是吧  -怎么了
- Oh, no. - What?

49
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,850
托尼要来了
The Tonys are coming.

50
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,020
小卡  所以我才不希望你看那些
Cam, this is exactly why I don't want you watching them --

51
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,190
你已经这么生气了
You're already so angry.

52
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,380
不是托尼奖
Not that Tonys --

53
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,630
是安东尼・拉马克  肉毒杆菌托尼
Anthony Lamarque, botox Tony.

54
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,390
他们要来参加婚礼
They're coming to the wedding.

55
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,530
但说真的  又要上演《万事成空》吗
But, seriously, another revival of "Anything Goes"?

56
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,290
我们真的又要这样吗
Are we really doing this again?

57
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,740
他们要来我很惊讶
I'm surprised that they're coming,

58
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,070
因为我跟托尼提到婚礼时
because when I mentioned the wedding to Tony,

59
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,730
他表现出毫不在意的样子
he seemed completely disinterested --

60
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,820
是因为打了肉毒杆菌啊
Oh, the botox.

61
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,850
不
Oh, no.

62
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,040
还有你的表兄皮特  他的孩子们都要来
Your cousin Pete, all of his kids.

63
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,890
大家都接受了邀请  米奇尔
Everyone's accepting, Mitchell!

64
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,830
我爸的嘉宾名单还没给我呢
We haven't even gotten the list from my dad yet.

65
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,340
你爸的朋友们喝起酒来像当兵的
And your dad's friends drink like soldiers.

66
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,850
因为他们确实当过兵
Because they were soldiers.

67
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,280
我很感激他们为国奉献
I mean, I am grateful for their service,

68
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,370
但这样一来婚礼费用我们可承担不起了
but we are not gonna be able to afford this wedding.

69
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,090
看来我们得取消一些东西
Okay, maybe we need to pull back on a few things.

70
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,760
比如什么
Like what?

71
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,340
餐桌中心摆设
Uh, the centerpieces?

72
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,470
那你何必办婚礼呢
Why even have a wedding?

73
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,240
我不知道  小卡
I don't know, Cam.

74
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,620
因为我们彼此相爱  彼此尊重
Because we love and respect each other

75
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,960
还共同抚养一个孩子吗
and we're raising a child together?

76
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,500
你还要不要帮我了
Do you want to help or not?

77
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,520
也许我们可以发一些"不邀请信"
Maybe we could send un-vitations.

78
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
有这东西吗
Is that a thing?

79
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,570
因为我们现在可以结婚
We've already made a lot of people angry

80
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,000
已经惹怒很多人了
by just being able to get married.

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,340
就别把支持我们的人也疏远了
Let's not alienate the ones on our side.

82
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,350
好吧  也许我们可以卖掉些东西
All right. Maybe we could sell something.

83
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,260
已经超预算几千美元了
We're thousands over budget.

84
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,430
得卖个大件的才行
It would have to be something great.

85
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,480
给你  你可以把我的钻戒卖了
Here, you can sell my diamond ring.

86
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,300
亲爱的  那是糖果啦
Oh, honey, that's candy.

87
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,910
我要杀了那个杰克逊
I'm gonna kill that Jackson!

88
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,560
我确实有些贵玩意儿
I do have something of value --

89
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,030
一本《蜘蛛侠大战章鱼博士》漫画书
A "Spider-man versus doctor octopus" comic book.

90
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,740
1963年第3期  几乎全新
Issue number 3, 1963, near-mint condition.

91
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,220
值五千美元
It's worth 5 grand.

92
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,110
我9岁那年用一个橄榄球换的
I traded a football for it when I was 9 years old,

93
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,070
我爸气疯了
and my dad was mad

94
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,830
因为那上面有丹・马里诺的签名
because the football was signed by Dan Marino.

95
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,610
我说  找丽塔・莫雷诺签名我就留着
I said, "Get it signed by Rita Moreno, and I'll keep it."

96
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,860
不是吧
Oh, no.

97
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,910
我侄子们要从塔尔萨飞过来
My nephews are flying in from Tulsa

98
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,700
胖胖的那几个
-- the big ones.

99
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,150
特别能吃派的那些吗
The pie eaters?

100
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,430
没错  我得卖掉我的怀亚特・厄普了
That's it. I got to sell my Wyatt Earp.

101
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
这是怀亚特・厄普[西部警长]
This here is a belt buckle once worn

102
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
曾用过的皮带扣
by the great Wyatt Earp.

103
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,710
我爷爷在我7岁那年给我的
My grandpa gave it to me when I was 7 years old,

104
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,280
他说  孩子  这会保护你远离坏人
and he said,"Son, this will keep the bad guys away."

105
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,750
我20出头时  曾戴着它去参加
In my early 20s, I wore it to

106
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,970
牛仔和印第安人主题迪斯科派对
a Cowboys-and-Indians disco party.

107
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,230
但是没有起作用哦
And let's just say it didn't.

108
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,200
不行  我不会让你这样做的
No. I can't let you do that.

109
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,330
它对你意味着一切
That means the world to you.

110
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,310
小卡  我会卖了我的《蜘蛛侠》
Cam, I will sell my "Spider-man."

111
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,920
米奇尔  我的皮带扣曾是
Mitchell, my belt buckle was owned

112
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,860
老西部传奇人物的东西
by a legend of the old west.

113
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,800
我觉得你的漫画书卖的钱
I don't think your comic book

114
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,450
可能连买气球的钱都不够
would even cover our balloon budget.

115
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,930
这话就太刺...
Well, that's very offens--

116
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,140
等等  买气球要花多少钱
Wait. What's the balloon budget?

117
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,210
妈  能把这东西放到别的地方去吗
Hey, mom, can we put this stuff somewhere else?

118
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,460
它让我的房间显得好乱
It's cluttering up my room.

119
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,370
这是什么
What is it?

120
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,370
我的一些纪念品
Oh, just some mementos of mine.

121
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,940
还有你爸爸的
A few of your dad's.

122
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,270
-齐马  -是啊
- Oh, Zima! - Yeah.

123
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,150
齐马是什么
What's Zima?

124
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,900
酒瓶子里的派对
Just a party in a bottle.

125
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,510
那让我想起了狂野的时刻
Man, that reminds me of some wild times.

126
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,580
在我的土星车里放着比约克的歌
Cranking the Bjork in my Saturn

127
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,070
然后一起在影院看《西雅图夜未眠》时
before me and my buddies snuck some "Z"

128
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,570
呼呼大睡
into "Sleepless in Seattle."

129
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,480
真希望你也捂住了我的耳朵
I wish you'd covered my ears for that.

130
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,150
妈妈  抱着你的这个帅哥是谁啊
Ooh, mom. Who's this hottie with his arm around you?

131
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,800
帅爆了
Cute!

132
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,820
那是鲍比・纳什  我的前男友
Oh, that's Bobby Nash, my old boyfriend.

133
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,850
你为什么和他分手  为了爸爸吗
Why'd you break up with him? For dad?

134
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,130
这样说吧  他没盯住球
Let's just say he took his eye

135
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,970
结果被三振出局了
off the ball and struck out.

136
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,190
于是我站到了垒板上
So I stepped up to the plate

137
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,540
在票价低廉的座位上搞定了她
and nailed her in the cheap seats.

138
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,680
别那样说
Yeah, let's not say that.

139
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,100
我要走了
Well, I'm off.

140
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,790
亲爱的  我得去药店
Oh, honey, I've got to stop by the drug store.

141
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,870
你需要什么吗
Do you need anything?

142
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,930
不用  亲爱的
No, thank you, my dear.

143
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,850
邓菲腺体能分泌我需要的所有药物
The Dunphy glands produce all the drugs I need.

144
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,180
除了足部喷雾
Except for, uh, foot spray.

145
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,320
你能买一些来吗
Could you grab me some of that?

146
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
当然可以
Sure.

147
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,950
妈妈
Oh, wow, mom!

148
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
真是呆  对吧
What a dork, right?

149
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,810
你当时想些什么呢
What were you thinking?

150
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,590
但是很舒适  我爸爸不同意
It was comfortable. My dad didn't approve.

151
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,730
无须多言
Enough said.

152
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
我知道这难以置信
I know it's hard to believe,

153
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,270
但我过去其实有点呆
but I was actually a bit of a nerd back in the day.

154
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,990
我追克莱尔时  别人说我是癞蛤蟆
And it was suggested that I was out of my league

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,190
想吃天鹅肉
when I landed Claire.

156
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,690
大部分是杰说的
By Jay, mostly.

157
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,780
还有我的朋友们  还有我父母
And my friends. A-and my parents.

158
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,810
还有克莱尔
And Claire.

159
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,000
这是什么
What's this?

160
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,510
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

161
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,740
那是你爸爸大学里的答录机
That is your father's answering machine from college.

162
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,690
天啊  我有时忘了你们有多老
God, I sometimes forget how old you guys are.

163
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,940
你来到了菲尔的世界
You've reached Phil's world!

164
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,440
该狂欢了  太棒了
Party time! Excellent!

165
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,760
他真可爱
He's so cute.

166
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
菲尔  我是米奇尔
Hi, Phil. This is Mitchell,

167
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,580
普里契特  克莱尔的弟弟
uh, Pritchett, Claire's brother.

168
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,890
我就是想感谢你安排我和你表妹见面
I just wanted to thank you for setting me up with your cousin.

169
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,480
她人真好
She was very nice.

170
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,700
唯一的问题是  她住得有点远  所以
The only problem is she lives kinda far, so...

171
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,430
那是唯一的问题吗
That's the only problem?

172
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,980
邓菲狗  我是林
Hey, Dunph-dog, it's Ling.

173
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,710
带上你的旱冰鞋
Grab your rollerblades

174
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,250
在自行车道和我们见面吧  嗨起来
and meet us at the bike path, playa!

175
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,310
但我三点就得走了
But I got to be done by 3:00,

176
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,760
因为今天我要试飞新直升飞机
'cause today's the day I fly my new helicopter.

177
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,790
菲尔  我是克莱尔
Phil, hey, it's Claire. Um...

178
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,020
我得告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something,

179
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,970
我不想在电话里说
and I don't want to do it on your machine.

180
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,440
这事很重要
It's really important --

181
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
-不不不  -生死攸关
- Oh, no, no, no. - You know, life-and-death important.

182
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,050
给我  给我
Come on. Come on.

183
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,600
跟死无关  只是生[生命]
Not death, um, just life.

184
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,900
我是说... 我只是...  该死  我怀孕了
I mean... I just -- oh, hell, I'm pregnant!

185
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,590
甜蜜的新婚夫妇啊
Oh, sweet newlyweds!

186
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,470
别担心  你没必要娶我什么的
Don't worry. You don't have to marry me or anything.

187
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,010
我们尽快聊聊吧
Let's talk as soon as you can.

188
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,650
我们为什么不多加小心呢
Why weren't we more careful?

189
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,440
愚蠢的杜兰杜兰音乐会
Stupid Duran Duran concert.

190
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,380
好了
All right!

191
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,420
够了
That's enough.

192
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,280
我是在杜兰杜兰音乐会上被怀上的吗
I was conceived at a Duran Duran concert?

193
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,240
优雅人生的优雅开始啊
Classy start to a classy life.

194
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,420
你不是我在音乐会上怀上的
You were not conceived at the concert.

195
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,960
而是在音乐会后
It was after the concert.

196
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,700
什么  在车里吗
Oh, wha-- in the car?!

197
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,150
那是一辆好车
It was a very nice car.

198
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,250
我受够了  别再问了  我要走了
Listen, I am done. Stop snooping. I'm going.

199
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,440
车座靠背可以完全放平
The seats folded all the way back.

200
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,910
恶心的画面
Oh, images.

201
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,960
他们居然把"它"留下了
I can't believe they kept it.

202
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,010
我是有名字的
I have a name.

203
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,430
我是指答录机
The answering machine.

204
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,740
我们可以拿它找点乐子
You know, we could have some fun with this.

205
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,470
我回来了
I'm home!

206
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,850
妈妈
Hi, mom.

207
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,520
曼尼  你为什么坐在一根酸黄瓜面前
Manny, what are you doing sitting in front of a pickle?

208
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,850
杰说我得尝尝它的味道  否则就不许走
Jay says I can't leave until I taste it.

209
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,050
你为什么这样折磨他
Why do you torture him like this?

210
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,020
因为他太固执己见了  歌洛莉亚
'Cause he's too stuck in his ways, Gloria.

211
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,550
这对他有好处
This is good for him.

212
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,770
他会尝尝泡菜  发现自己喜欢吃
He'll taste the pickle, he'll find that he likes it,

213
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,070
然后尝试更多的东西
he'll try more things.

214
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,740
这是教子有方
This is good parenting.

215
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,000
在我的自传里  不会把这写成什么好事
This is not going to play well in my memoir.

216
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,640
你真会耍嘴皮子
You know, you're one to talk.

217
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,160
你跟你说过多少遍
How many times have I asked you

218
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,890
让你尝尝我妈做的猪血肠
to try my mother's blood sausages?

219
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,670
不是一回事  那香肠恶心死了
Totally different. That's disgusting.

220
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,010
你从来没吃过  怎么知道很恶心
How do you know it's disgusting if you've never tried it?

221
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,700
你从没尝过外婆做的美味的猪血肠吗
You've never tried grandma's delicious blood sausage

222
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,710
冰箱里就有啊
that's right there in the freezer?

223
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,790
你说得对
Oh, you're right.

224
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,110
我们确实还有些剩下的
We do have some left over.

225
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,620
是吗  还没有被哄抢着吃光吗
Really? It hasn't been all gobbled up yet?

226
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,170
好了  "年度最佳父亲"
Okay, Mr. Father of the year,

227
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,680
该向曼尼展示你不是个光说不做的人了
time for you to show Manny that you're not a hypocrite.

228
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,980
看来你陷入两难了
Looks like you're in quite a conundrum.

229
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,960
其实你可以说...
You know, you could've said --

230
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
"酸黄瓜"  该死  就摆在眼前
"A pickle"! Dang it! It was right there.

231
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
[in the pickle同指陷入两难]

232
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,790
你好
Hello.

233
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,760
你好  需要帮忙吗
Hi. Can I help you?

234
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,260
是的
Uh, yes.

235
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,820
我有一个很特殊的东西
Um, I have something pretty special

236
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,390
对我来说意义重大
that means the world to me,

237
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,550
但我愿意卖掉它
yet I gladly part with it

238
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,100
为了证明我对我未婚夫的爱
to prove my love for my fiance

239
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,930
-小卡  你不用  -我要这样做
- Cam, you don't have to... - I do.

240
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,460
这个皮带扣以前的主人是
This is a belt buckle that was once owned

241
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,070
传奇的怀亚特・厄普
by the legendary Wyatt Earp.

242
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,990
当我祖父把这个给我时  愿他安息
And when my grandfather gave it to me, and rest his soul,

243
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,470
他说  孩子  今年...
he said”son, this year is a

244
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,050
你还好吗
Are you ok?

245
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,060
我做不到  你来吧
I can't be here for this. You do it.

246
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,010
顺便再问问那盏灯卖多少钱
And get a price on that divine lamp.

247
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,840
不管怎么样
Um, anyway...

248
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,020
我不想当面打击
Look, I didn't want to say anything

249
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,870
你的未婚夫
in front of your fiance

250
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,270
但这只是个60年代时
but this is a cheap replica

251
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,850
加油站连锁店卖的廉价复制品
given away by a gas-station chain in the '60s.

252
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,350
市面上有一大堆
There's tons of them out there.

253
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,040
也就值20块
It's worth about 20 bucks.

254
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,100
你确定吗
Are you sure?

255
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,690
非常确定
Pretty sure.

256
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,780
他家的确喜欢夸张[打扮]故事
That family loves to dress up a story.

257
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,300
还有打扮小猪
And a pig.

258
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,210
那基本全新的初版第三期
Well, how about a first-edition number 3

259
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,720
《蜘蛛侠大战章鱼博士》能卖多少钱
"Spider-man versus doctor octopus" in near-mint condition?

260
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,630
继续说
Keep talking.

261
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,700
其实
That...

262
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,160
其实这就是全部了
Uh, uh, that's pretty much it.

263
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,540
她怎么还没打来
Why isn't she calling?

264
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,430
你总是对事情抱着怀疑态度
Aren't you the doubter?

265
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,660
她会打来  倒数三
She'll call in three...

266
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,090
二
two-o-o-o...

267
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,750
一  该数一了
One! One's next!

268
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
我知道
Yeah.

269
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,970
开始录音
Press record.

270
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,840
喂  妈妈
Hi, mom.

271
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,000
海莉  宝贝
Haley, honey,

272
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
你是想发这条短信给你爸爸吧
did you mean to send this text to your dad?

273
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,430
短信  什么短信
Text? What does it say?

274
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,220
"抱歉打扰你打高尔夫  但是..."
"I hate to spoil your golf game, but..."

275
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,590
不是  我没发那条短信
Uh, no, no. I-I didn't send that.

276
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,120
肯定是你和爸爸说话时
Must have accidentally dictated

277
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,620
手机不小心听写了
when you and dad were talking.

278
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,110
好吧  奇怪了
Okay. That's weird.

279
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,440
正好我打给你了
Well, while I have you on the phone,

280
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,290
你能把刷碗机里的餐具拿出来
would you mind emptying the dishwasher and doing --

281
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,590
你那边的信号弱了
Oh, you're breaking up.

282
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,760
海莉  能听见我说话吗
Haley, can you hear me now?

283
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,840
听不见了  再见
Nope. Bye.

284
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,880
-大功告成  -跟你说了没问题吧
- Got it. - Told you we'd get it.

285
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,930
只需创造性地剪辑一下
Now just for a little creative editing...

286
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,420
你那么聪明
Your mind is so brilliant.

287
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,990
如果你把这份聪明用到学习上的话
If you put this much effort into your schoolwork,

288
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,430
你一定能成就...
there is no telling the things you could --

289
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,120
你为什么总是那么扫兴
Why do you have to ruin everything?

290
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,690
是啊  她总是在说我的"潜力"
I know, she's always talking about my potential.

291
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,170
当心
Fore!

292
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,170
你觉得我打到她了吗
Do you think I hit her?

293
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,450
没有  她没事
Nah, she's fine.

294
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,780
对不起  我今天太分心了
Sorry I'm so distracted today.

295
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,810
怎么了  哥们
What's wrong, buddy?

296
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,550
我问你件事
Let me ask you something.

297
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,060
你会不会有时候觉得
Do -- do you ever get the sense

298
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,790
你配不上你妻子
that your wife feels like she could have done better?

299
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,360
天呐  不会  她找到我算是三生有幸
God, no. Nah, she's the luckiest woman on earth.

300
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,990
非要说的话  是她配不上我
I mean, if anything, I could've done better.

301
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,090
那女人夜里发出的噪音
The noises that come out of that woman at night?

302
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,630
就好像她是《警察学校》里的那个黑人
It's like she's that black guy from "Police Academy."

303
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,840
说曹操  曹操就到
Oh, speak of the devil.

304
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
我老婆发来的信息
Message from my wife,

305
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,310
不是《警察学校》里的那个黑人
not the black guy from "Police Academy."

306
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,640
要真是他发的才给力呢
Oh, that'd be so awesome.

307
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
超给力的
That would be neat.

308
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,650
菲尔  我是克莱尔
Phil? Hey, it's Claire.

309
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,330
抱歉打扰你打高尔夫球  但是...
Um, I hate to spoil your golf game, but...

310
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,290
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant!

311
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,860
什么
What?

312
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,290
我们尽快谈谈吧
Let's talk as soon as you can.

313
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,720
我得走了
I have to leave.

314
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,410
什么  我们正在打比赛呢
What? We're in the middle of a game.

315
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,590
我得去找克莱尔
I have to be with Claire!

316
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,090
我的球杆
Oh -- my clubs!

317
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,760
我的帽子
My hat!

318
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,040
我的三明治
My sandwich!

319
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,520
对不起我在里面崩溃了
I'm sorry I freaked out in there.

320
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,730
我们卖了多少钱
How -- how much did we get for it?

321
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,100
给你  我做不到
You know, here. I couldn't do it.

322
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,080
什么  不是吧
What? No.

323
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,800
这个皮带扣对你来说意义重大
This belt buckle means so much to you.

324
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,560
我决定...还是把我的漫画卖了
I'm just gonna -- I am going to sell my comic book instead.

325
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,530
米奇尔  你真是太贴心了
Oh, Mitchell, that is so sweet. You know --

326
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,380
一想到我要跟我爷爷与怀亚特・厄普
The idea of me parting ways with a belt buckle

327
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,400
掰手腕赢来的皮带扣说再见
that my grandfather arm-wrestled Wyatt Earp for --

328
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,070
他掰手腕赢了他吗
He arm-wrestled him?

329
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,850
是啊  但不是为了争个胜负那种
Oh, yeah, but not in a contentious way.

330
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,970
要知道他们是朋友
You know, they were friends.

331
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,280
我爷爷在一次火车劫案里救了他
My grandfather saved his life during a train robbery.

332
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
火车劫案  太惊人了
A -- a train robbery? That's -- wow.

333
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,140
小卡  这太惊人了
Cam, wow!

334
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,540
他们关系很铁
They had a real bond.

335
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,210
伟大的怀亚特・厄普和诚实的亚伯・塔克
The great Wyatt Earp and honest Abe Tucker.

336
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,560
我心里知道  不拆穿
I have it, I'll store it,

337
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,740
必要时再拿出来说
and if I need to, I will use it.

338
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,140
这样吧  我放弃
You know what? I quit.

339
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,220
原谅我试图让他开眼界
Pardon me for trying to broaden his horizons.

340
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,710
不  不  你绝对不能放弃
No, no, no. You're not quitting anything.

341
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,870
你得把香肠吃了
You're going to eat your sausage,

342
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,310
而你得把你的酸黄瓜吃了
and you're going to eat your pickle.

343
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,590
我已经受够每天做两种饭了
I am tired of every day cooking two different meals.

344
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,640
不要番茄  只要白肉  多加培根
No tomatoes. White meat only. Extra bacon.

345
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,570
他能多吃培根  凭什么
He gets extra bacon? What the hell?

346
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,940
你们今天必须把这毛病改了
Today is the day you two are stopping this silliness!

347
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,510
我们今天都必须克服一些东西
Fine, we'll all conquer something today.

348
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,050
我有什么好克服的  我什么都吃
What do I have to conquer? I eat everything.

349
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,710
-抚摸斯黛拉的肚子  -什么
- Pet Stella's belly. - What?

350
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,530
你从来不摸斯黛拉的肚子
You won't touch Stella's belly.

351
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,770
因为感觉太奇怪了
Yeah, because it's the creepiest thing ever.

352
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,210
她有三十多个乳头
Has like 30 nipples.

353
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,590
我会把猪血肠吃掉
I'll eat the blood sausage,

354
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,260
曼尼会把酸黄瓜吃掉
Manny eats the pickles,

355
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,160
而你要抚摸她的肚子
you pet her belly.

356
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,320
我宁愿把狗吃了
I'd rather eat the dog.

357
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,010
别做个光说不练的人
Don't be a hypocrite.

358
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,550
要长长的爱抚  发自内心的
Nice and long, like you mean it.

359
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,970
我要看到她舒服得抖腿
I want to see that leg shake.

360
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,580
-我来拿吧  -发生什么事了
- Let me get these! - What's happening?

361
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,220
-我就是太高兴了  -真的吗
- I'm just so happy! - Really?

362
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,830
怎么  你一杆进洞了吗
Oh, did you finally get a hole in one?

363
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,690
一杆进洞
A hole in one.

364
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,810
我希望我们的宝宝也这么幽默
I hope our baby has your sense of humor.

365
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,620
-我们的什么  -我怎么没看出来呢
- Our what? - Why didn't I see it?

366
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,190
去药店  关节肿胀
The drug store, the bloated ankles,

367
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,360
你最近脾气也大了
you've been so moody lately...

368
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,440
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

369
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
你看这暴脾气
There it is.

370
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,840
菲尔  我没怀孕
Phil, I am not pregnant.

371
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,160
-你没有吗  -没有
- You're not? - No.

372
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,390
那你怎么跟我留言说怀孕了
Well, why'd you leave me that message?

373
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,240
我没有给你留过言
Didn't leave you a message.

374
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,980
你确定吗  你怀孕时忘性特别大
Are you sure? You're very forgetful when you're pregnant.

375
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,490
我觉得我能记得住
I think I would remember!

376
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,530
那你为什么最近脾气这么大
Then why have you been so moody?

377
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,110
大概是因为你刚刚说我关节肿大
Maybe because you just told me I have giant ankles!

378
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,780
我不希望宝宝听到我们吵架
Shh, I don't want him to hear us fight like this.

379
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,830
把东西给我
Give me this.

380
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,270
这会对大家都有好处
Okay. This is gonna be good for everybody,

381
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,400
所以赶快行动吧
So let's get it over with.

382
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,620
-好吧  -好吧
- Fine. - Okay.

383
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,930
我们数三下
We'll go on the count of three.

384
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,770
一
One...

385
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,320
二
Two...

386
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,200
三
Three.

387
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,270
不
Uh! Oh, no!

388
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,370
我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up!

389
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,060
怎么这么湿  杰  为什么
Why so moist, Jay?! Why?!

390
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,230
我们来的时机不对吗
Is this a bad time?

391
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,410
很抱歉我们来得这么突然
Sorry to barge in here like this.

392
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,760
感觉挺奇怪我还把东西放在这里
I guess it's weird that, uh, I'm still storing stuff here.

393
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,410
我希望你来得再早一点
I just wish you would have come in sooner

394
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,180
在我跟斯黛拉上二垒之前
before I went to second base with Stella.

395
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,980
只需要两分钟
All right, I'll be two minutes.

396
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,320
如果你需要资金来筹备婚礼
If you need money for the wedding,

397
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,960
为什么要把心爱之物卖掉呢
why sell something that you love?

398
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,350
为什么不跟杰开口
Why don't you just ask Jay?

399
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,060
不  不  不  不
No. No. No. No.

400
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,270
为什么不  他是你爸
Why not? He's your father.

401
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,440
跟我爸爸开口要钱让我很不舒服
I don't feel right asking my dad for money, okay?

402
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,360
我成年了  而且我还有我的漫画书
I'm an adult, and I have my comic book.

403
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,720
抱歉打扰你打高尔夫  但是...
I hate to spoil your golf game, but...

404
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,570
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant!

405
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,760
我们尽快谈谈吧
Let's talk as soon as you can.

406
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,670
他们真厉害
Oh, they are good.

407
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,360
简直不敢相信他们能做得这么天衣无缝
I can't believe they pulled such an elaborate stunt.

408
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,310
我不知道是该生气还是该赞赏
I don't know whether to be angry or impressed.

409
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,510
简直太邪恶了
It's so diabolical.

410
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,280
不知道他们从哪里弄到的
I don't know where they get that...

411
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,150
等等  慢着
Wait. Wait. Wait.

412
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,420
我们可以好好捉弄一下他们
We could really have some fun with this.

413
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,960
说来好笑
You know, it's funny,

414
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,830
我从来不知道你喜欢漫画书
I never saw you as a comic-book guy.

415
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,590
我不喜欢  我也不知道
Oh, no, I wasn't, but I don't know.

416
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,630
《蜘蛛侠》
Spider-man --

417
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,370
让我产生了共鸣
He -- he spoke to me.

418
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,580
我觉得大概是因为这种
I -- I think it's because it's about this nerdy kid

419
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,930
一个小书呆子有着
who has this special secret side of himself

420
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,680
不可告人的另外一面的感觉
that he can't share with anybody, and --

421
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,430
我一直也都是这么觉得的
And that's how I always felt.

422
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,660
蜘蛛侠让我觉得与众不同没什么不好
Spider-man made me feel like it was okay to be different.

423
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,750
而且他让我在遇到困难时
And...it made me feel tough enough to --

424
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,150
变得足够坚强
to get through the rough times.

425
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,140
米奇尔  这真让人感动
Oh, Mitchell, that's so sweet.

426
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,930
我都不知道是这样的
I didn't know that.

427
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,110
你确定要把它卖了吗
Are you sure you want to sell it?

428
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,070
是的  确定
Yes, yes.

429
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,490
因为  就像蜘蛛侠一样  我勇敢坚强
Because, like Spider-man, I am brave and strong.

430
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,960
-蜘蛛网  蜘蛛网  -米奇尔
- Oh! Spider web! Spider web! - Mitchell.

431
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,070
弄到我嘴里了
It's in my mouth.

432
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,920
-米奇尔  -怎么了  天哪
- Oh, Mitchell! - What?! Oh!

433
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,190
不  不  不
No! No! Oh, no!

434
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,790
得了吧  菲尔
Give me a break, Phil!

435
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,690
你到底想我怎么样
What do you want from me?!

436
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,220
-小声点  -我什么都没说啊
- Shh! - I didn't say anything.

437
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,890
你听说我怀孕的时候
A little compassion when you thought I was pregnant

438
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,970
能不能多点热情
would have been nice!

439
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,630
对不起  那是我的下意识反应
I'm sorry. It was a knee-jerk reaction.

440
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,340
说你是个混蛋[jerk]倒是真的
You got that half right!

441
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,920
反正你也没怀孕  谁在乎呢
Well, you're not pregnant, anyway, so who cares?!

442
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
我说了什么你这么大火气
And what did I say that was so terrible?!

443
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,930
用你的原话说就是
Well, I believe your exact words were,

444
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,360
太好了  我们又有一个孩子可以糟蹋了
"Great, another kid that we could screw up.”

445
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,050
那对不起了  但我们都知道我说得没错
Oh, I'm sorry. But we both know that's true.

446
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,500
等等  你是说我们根本不应该要孩子吗
Wait. Are you saying we never should have them in the first place.

447
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,990
就好像你没这么说过一样
Like you never said that!

448
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
这太糟了
This is awful.

449
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,430
你一开始就知道会这样吗
This is what you thought gonna happen?

450
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,800
我想不到那么远的
I didn't think that far ahead.

451
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,740
从没想过  你知道的
I never do. You know that.

452
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,960
你应该阻止我的
You should've stopped me!

453
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,430
你说这会很有趣的
You said this was going to be fun!

454
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,940
现在没有人觉得有趣
Nobody is having fun!

455
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,490
说话注意点  菲尔
Careful?! Please, Phil!

456
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,840
如果你没有把我的肚子搞大
If you hadn't gotten me pregnant,

457
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,210
我根本不可能嫁给你
I never would have married you!

458
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,700
我肯定嫁给鲍比・纳什了
I would have married Bobby Nash!

459
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,010
-真的吗  -是啊
- You would?! - Oh, yeah!

460
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,530
现在我就该在阿斯本一百亩的大庄园里了
And right now, I would be on my 100-acre ranch in Aspen

461
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,200
和我两米多高做对冲基金的老公一起
with my strapping 6'4" hedge-fund husband!

462
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,430
你真的希望你嫁的是鲍比吗
You really wish you'd married Bobby?

463
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,290
每天都这么希望
Oh, every single day!

464
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,900
等等  菲尔
No, Phil.

465
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,660
爸爸  你还好吗
Dad, are you okay?

466
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,570
还行
Yep.

467
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
这家里每个人都这么看我
That's what I am to everyone around here.

468
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,350
-妈妈  -只是"还行"而已
- Mom... - Just "Okay."

469
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,380
-菲尔  -妈妈
- Phil! - Hey, mom?

470
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,980
-等会儿  -菲尔
- Not now. - Phil!

471
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,590
你们听见了吗  我们完全骗到他们了
You guys hear that? We totally got them!

472
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,710
快点  我们需要个吹风机
Quick! We need a blow dryer!

473
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,500
是有什么基佬紧急情况吗
Is this some sort of gay emergency?

474
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,690
不  爸爸  不是什么基佬紧急情况
No, dad, it's not a gay emergency!

475
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,530
是我的漫画书
It's my comic book.

476
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,330
我们要...  天呐
We need to -- ohh, god!

477
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,370
全毁了
It's ruined.

478
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,250
米奇尔  没事的
Mitchell, it's okay.

479
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,030
反正也许并不值那么多钱
It probably wasn't worth that much anyway.

480
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,560
这书值五千块  你的皮带扣分文不值
It was worth $5,000! Your belt buckle is garbage.

481
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,700
那是从加油站买的
It came from a gas station!

482
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,600
你祖父从来没见过怀亚特・厄普
Your grandfather never met Wyatt Earp!

483
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,870
这个秘密看来没有保守太久
I didn't hold on to that for quite as long as I thought.

484
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,340
对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

485
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,870
这事我没想说的
I -- I didn't mean to blurt it out like that.

486
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,190
不  没关系
No, it's -- it's okay.

487
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,650
我也怀疑过时间点不太对
I -- I kinda suspected the dates didn't line up.

488
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,000
现在我开始怀疑那到底是不是
Now I'm starting to think that wasn't

489
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,790
阿梅莉亚・埃尔哈特的指南针了
Amelia Earhart's compass.

490
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,790
[阿梅莉亚: 著名美国女飞行员]

491
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,250
太可惜了  但我觉得杰肯定能帮到你们
I'm so sorry, but I am sure that Jay can help you two out.

492
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,380
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

493
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,590
我们想自己解决这个问题
We want to do this on our own.

494
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,120
我能问个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

495
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,270
你们为什么要弄一个那么大的婚礼
Why are you having such a big thing anyway?

496
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,330
因为我们只结一次婚啊
Well, because we're only getting married once.

497
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,410
我只是想说为什么你们要如此大张旗鼓
I'm just saying, why do you need to make into a spectacle?

498
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,340
大张旗鼓
A s-- a spectacle?

499
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,500
这也许正是老天想要暗示你们
This could be the universe's way of telling you

500
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,960
把婚礼搞得低调一点
to bring it down a notch.

501
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,360
邀请家人  还有你们的朋友胡娇
Invite your family, your friend Pepper,

502
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,450
还有那个叫什么的  爱穿荷叶边的那个
and, what's his name, the -- the -- the flouncy one?

503
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,400
L・大卫
Uh, L'david.

504
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,990
我没有爱穿荷叶边的叫L・大卫的朋友
I don't have a flouncy friend named L'david, dad.

505
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,850
你是说L・迈克或是J・马库斯吗
Do -- do you mean L'michael or J'marcus?

506
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,250
我不太确定你说的是谁
I'm not sure who you're referring to.

507
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,770
管他呢
Whatever.

508
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,470
我就是说低调一点
I'm just saying keep it small.

509
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,560
为何要为了几乎不认识的人花那么多钱呢
Why pay all that money for people you barely know?

510
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,780
你是说你的那些朋友吗
Oh, oh, you mean like any of your friends?

511
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,200
拜托  你不会想邀请我的朋友们的
Oh, please, you don't want any of my friends there.

512
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,940
真的吗  因为我
Really? Because I've --

513
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,680
我管你要名单都要了几个月了
I've been asking for a list for months now.

514
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,330
到底是谁不想让他们来呢
So, so who doesn't want them there --

515
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,730
我还是你
me or you?

516
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,810
你为什么生气
Why are you getting upset?

517
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,730
因为如果这是克莱尔的婚礼
Because, dad, if -- if this was Claire's wedding,

518
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,780
你就会投入得多了
you would be all over it.

519
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,630
你甚至会要求在你的俱乐部办
You'd be wanting to have it at your club.

520
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,810
你会邀请你所有的朋友
You'd be inviting all your friends.

521
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,550
拜托
Oh, please!

522
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,930
克莱尔结婚时我也一样不那么兴奋
I wasn't that thrilled when Claire got married, either.

523
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,360
"也一样"  老天爷啊  别说了
"Either"? For god's sake, just stop talking.

524
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,790
所有人都退一步
Everybody back off.

525
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,250
我不觉得我说得过分
I don't think I'm out of line

526
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,120
我的朋友不会想在盛大的
suggesting my friends don't want to see

527
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
同志婚礼上  看父子共舞
a father-son dance at a big gay wedding.

528
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,340
根本没什么父子舞  老爸
There is no father-son dance, dad.

529
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,520
我不知道在同志婚礼上是什么情况
I don't know what things go on there.

530
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,910
我需要牵着你走红毯吗
Do I walk you down the aisle?

531
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,550
会有人扔花束吗
Does someone throw a bouquet?

532
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,390
我是说  我不知道
I mean, I'm just saying, I don't know

533
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,940
如果我俱乐部那些朋友来了
how this stuff plays out

534
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,110
会是怎样的情况
with my guys from the club.

535
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,770
你是说那些围坐在屋子里
Oh, you mean the guys who sit around the locker room

536
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,140
裸身看橄榄球赛的人吗
watching football naked?

537
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,120
不  别劝我  问题不在于他们
No! No! See, this -- this isn't about them.

538
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,040
而在于你
This is about you.

539
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,750
是你觉得有点不太能接受
You are the one that's uncomfortable here.

540
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,460
好吧  我承认
Fine. I admit it.

541
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,350
你们的整个婚礼在我看来都很古怪
This whole wedding thing is weird to me.

542
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,950
为什么你可以做真实的自己
Now, see, why do you get to be you,

543
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,400
而我却不可以呢
but I don't get to be me?

544
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,230
我也不想对此感到不太能接受
See, I didn't choose to be uncomfortable.

545
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,170
《Born this way》是Lady Gaga的著名撑同性恋歌曲
深受广大同性恋的喜爱

546
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,170
但我生来就是这样的人
I was born this way.

547
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,610
你现在真的要用同志圣歌来堵我们的嘴吗
Are you really throwing a gay anthem in our face right now?

548
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,850
该死的  你也理解一下我吧
Oh, damn it. Give me some credit.

549
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,380
你知道我做到今天这样有多不容易
You know how far I've come.

550
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
你还希望我怎么样呢
I mean, what more do you want from me?

551
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,100
算了  老爸  你可以的
You know what, dad? Y-you do.

552
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,120
你也可以做真实的自己
You do get to be you.

553
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,430
如果你真的不太能完全接受的话  那么
If -- if it really makes you that uncomfortable, then...

554
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,750
就别来参加我们的婚礼了
don't come to the wedding.

555
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,670
米奇尔
Mitchell...

556
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,770
别  瞧  我们已经在削减参与人员了
No! No, see? We're scaling back already.

557
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,800
菲尔  亲爱的
Phil, honey...

558
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,650
刚刚在下面是怎么回事
What happened down there?

559
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,590
你攻击了我
You attacked me.

560
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,810
那是在玩啊  我们都在互相攻击啊
In a fun way. We were both doing it.

561
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
我听到你今早说的话了
I heard you this morning,

562
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,860
谈论你超帅的男友鲍比
Talking about your super-cute boyfriend Bobby,

563
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,290
说我只是个"舒适的"选择
saying that I was the "Comfortable" choice,

564
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,170
你跟我结婚只是为了跟你爸作对
that you only married me because your dad hated it.

565
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,030
不  亲爱的
No, sweetheart.

566
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,960
我当时不是在说你
I was not talking about you.

567
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,040
我是在跟女儿们解释
I was explaining to the girls

568
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,250
我有张照片上穿的那身衣服
about an outfit that I was wearing in a picture

569
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,260
是个"舒适的"选择
that was the comfortable choice

570
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,650
而我爸很讨厌这件衣服
that my dad hated.

571
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,320
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

572
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,490
你怎会以为我是因为那样才跟你结婚的呢
You can't possibly think that's why I married you.

573
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,760
好吧  我懂你爸这人
Okay, I -- I get it a-about your dad.

574
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,360
但有时候我真的会假想
I -- I -- sometimes I do wonder, you know,

575
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,740
如果你当时没怀孕
if you hadn't gotten pregnant...

576
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,420
-我们会像现在这样在一起吗  -是啊
- would we even be here right now? - Yeah.

577
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,580
我也老是想同样的问题
Well, I wonder the same thing, too.

578
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,850
是吗
You do?

579
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,610
是啊  经常想
Yes. All the time.

580
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,650
就上周
Just last week,

581
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,710
你和孩子们在外面洗车
you and the kids were outside washing the car,

582
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,660
你们开始了肥皂泡大战
and you got in that soap battle

583
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,410
大家都在跑  不停地笑
and everybody was running around laughing.

584
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,310
我站在厨房的窗前
And I stood there at the kitchen window,

585
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,910
心想着我是多么幸运
and I was thinking how lucky I am.

586
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,040
因为如果我没跟你结婚的话
'cause I would have missed all of this

587
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
就会错过这一切
if I hadn't married you.

588
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,450
我知道你在看
I knew you were watching.

589
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,920
所以我故意把海绵掉在了地上
That's why I dropped the sponge.

590
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,250
正是这个动作最开始吸引了我的注意力
That's what got my attention in the first place.

591
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,570
你真的不后悔没嫁给鲍比・纳什吗
You really don't regret not marrying Bobby Nash?

592
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,370
不后悔
No.

593
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,130
他是很帅  但也很无趣
He was cute, but he was boring.

594
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,940
他都没成功逗笑过我一次
He never once made me laugh.

595
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,360
我经常能逗得你笑
You laugh at me all the time.

596
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,820
是啊
I do.

597
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,390
我很喜欢你听说我怀孕时
I liked how happy you were

598
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,090
表现出的那种喜悦
when you thought I was pregnant.

599
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,840
那是当然了
Of course I was.

600
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,380
你可以帮我捡起来吗
Do you think you could pick that up for me?

601
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,900
不知道呢
I don't know.

602
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,170
真的好低哦
It's so far down here.

603
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,730
瞧吧  我就说他们肯定会和好的
See? I told you they were gonna be fine.

604
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,060
-锁门了  -快跑
- Door lock! - Run!

605
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,660
快走  快走
Go! Go! Go! Go!

606
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,580
嗨菲尔  我是米奇尔  克莱尔的弟弟
Hey, Phil, it's Mitchell, Claire's brother.

607
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,990
我听说你把克莱尔搞怀孕了
I heard about your and Claire's whole pregnancy situation,

608
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,130
我很抱歉我爸的反应那么恶劣
And I'm -- I'm sorry my dad didn't have a better reaction.

609
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,970
你别往心里去
Don't take it personally.

610
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,970
他就是那样的人
He's just like that.

611
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,230
他会想通的
He'll -- he'll come around.

612
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,240
如果他想不通的话
And if not...

613
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,660
那也是他的损失
His loss.

614
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,300
对了  总之
Yeah, okay, anyway,

615
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,190
既然我们已经是一家人了
uh, now that we're gonna be family,

616
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,410
我如果和你表妹谈恋爱的话可能有点怪
it's -- it's probably a little weird for me to date your cousin,

617
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,320
或许你可以让她别再呼我了
so maybe you could ask her to stop paging me?

618
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,060
真是太疯狂了
It's so crazy.

619
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,750
我也觉得  戴着呼机的米奇尔舅舅
I know. Uncle Mitchell with a pager.

620
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
不行  斯黛拉  别妄想了
No, Stella. Okay? No!

621
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,880
斯黛拉  我说了不行
Stella, I said no.

622
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,490
你...
You...

623
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,780
好吧  就这一次
Okay, but just this time, okay?

624
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,220
你最好死守这个秘密
And you keep your mouth shut about this.

625
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,590
是谁鬼鬼祟祟的
Who's there?
