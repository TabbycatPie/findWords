亲爱的  你不会一直到婚礼现场
Honey, you're not gonna talk like that

42

我接了一个辣酱的急单
I got a rush order for my sauce,

76
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,250
我平常的那个厨房被订走了
and the kitchen that I usually use was booked,

77
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,690
所以我只能全部自己做
so I have to do everything myself.

78
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,370
我昨晚好像没睡好
You know, I think I slept funny last night.

79
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,400
别这样  我知道请你帮忙也是白搭
No, don't. I know better than to ask for your help.

80
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,650
那就好  我还要去打高尔夫呢
Ah, good, 'cause I have a tee time.

On the way, could you take me to pick up my prom tux?

82
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,780
听着像你爱做的事情啊
That sounds like something you'd love to do.

83
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,490
我的确非常不想去
I so don't want to do that.

84

我明年就70岁了
I'm turning 70 next year.

85
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
我知道  我状态很好
I know -- I look great.

86
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,720
这把年纪的特权之一就是
One of the few perks of getting up there

87
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,270
可以毫无愧疚地直接拒绝别人
is the ability to say no without guilt.

88
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,240
"能送我去机场吗"  不行
"Can I have a ride to the airport?" No.

你就别白费唇舌了
I'm gonna stop you right there.

93
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,990
昨晚有人进我房间吗
Was anyone in my room last night?

94
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,790
我昨晚把你安顿睡下后就没了
Not after I tucked you in.

95
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,740
很好  我房间有怪物
Great. I have a monster.

96
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,110
我想你肯定搞错了
I'm sure you're mistaken.

Nope. And we have to catch him before I go to bed tonight.

98
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,350
乔  世界上没有怪物
Joe, there's no such thing as monsters.

99

冷静  我没打算叫你帮忙
Calm down. I'm not gonna ask you to help.

100
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,220
看样子今年我可以享清福了
Shaping up like a pretty good year.

101
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,750
早餐吃蛋糕吗  这才像话嘛
Cake for breakfast? Now we're talking.

102
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,860
别  别碰
No, don't touch that!

103
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,240
那是为胡娇叔叔今晚的
I'm making that for Uncle Pepper's

104

108
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,010
对了

109
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,950

Where is Pam?

110
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,570
她说她两小时前就能到
She said she was gonna be here two hours ago.

111
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,780
她完全不尊重别人的时间
She has no respect for anyone else's time.

112
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,730
她说她要过来住一两天
You know, she says she's gonna pop in for a "Short stay."

113
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,910
我们就好像得重新安排我们的生活了一样
It's like we're just supposed to rearrange our lives?

114
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,960
我花了很长时间才终于明白这个道理
It's taken me a long time, but I've finally learned

115
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,290
一提到小卡姐姐的事情
that when it comes to Cam's sister,

116
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,950
我说的任何话都可以并且会被用来打我的脸
anything I say can and will be used against me.

117
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,800
你说我们是不是应该让酒保
Do you think maybe we should, you know,

118
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,730
别再卖酒给小帕了
have the bartender cut Pam off?

119
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,040
天啊  她有点要发酒疯了
Oh, God, you know what? She is getting a little bit messy.

120
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,850
小帕  米奇尔觉得你可能...
Uh, Pam, Mitchell thinks you're kind of

121
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,340
在让自己出丑
making a fool out of yourself.

122
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,560
去死吧  米奇尔
Go to hell, Mitchell!

123
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,410
你麻利儿地快去死吧
You go straight to hell!

124
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,760
女王陛下终于大驾光临了
Well, her majesty has finally arrived.

125
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,860
我能感觉到你有多生气
I can sense how angry you are.

126
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,190
我知道  我知道  我迟到了
I know. I know. I'm late.

127
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,680
没有  家人永远不算迟到
No, there's no late when you're family.

128
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,220
虽然米奇尔刚刚还在说
Although Mitchell was just saying --

129
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,610
什么风把你吹来了
What brings you into town?

130
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,590
当模特
Modeling.

131
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,040
你说什么  当模特吗
I'm sorry. Modeling?

132
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,560
素人模特
Real-person modeling.

133
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,380
在老家  他们把我放到饲料商店的广告牌上
Back home, they put me on a billboard for the feed store,

134
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,550
结果大受欢迎
and I caught the bug.

135
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,380
下一站  好莱坞
Next stop -- Hollywood.

136
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,730
好吧  那你要在城里待多久
Okay. So how long are you gonna be in town?

137
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,890
谁知道呢
Well, who's to say?

138
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,370
我还希望是知道呢
Well, I was hoping it'd be you.

139
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,440
梦想是没有期限的
You can't put a date on a dream.

140
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,290
说到这个
‭Speaking of,

141
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,880
我得去参加一个试镜
we need to take me to an audition,

142
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,710
我有点紧张  所以我希望你俩
and I'm a little jittery, so I was hoping you guys

143
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,780
能陪我去  给我点精神支持
would want to ride along for moral support.

144
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,250
其实  米奇尔和我有个...
Oh, actually, Mitchell and I have a r--

145
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,330
我们今天很忙  是不是啊  米奇尔
We have a really busy day. Isn't that right, Mitchell?

146
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,330
对啊
Uh, yeah.

147
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,460
不会花很长时间的  快走吧
Oh, this won't take long. Let's go.

148
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,890
在路上  我还可以练习一下我的关节痛表情
On the ride over, I can practice my joint pain grimaces.

149
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,000
你还好吗
Are you okay?

150
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,730
很好啊  很好
I am! I am!

151
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,440
我知道  很好  很厉害
Oh, yeah, I know. You're good. You're good.

152
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
又来
Again?!

153
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,400
乔好久都没用过这个勾衣服的破摇篮
Joe hasn't slept in that chewed-up sweater snagger

154
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,080
但歌洛莉亚不让我扔那孩子碰过的
in years, but Gloria won't let me get rid of anything

155
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,590
任何东西  我需要个计划
the kid has ever touched, so I needed a plan.

156
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,510
幸运的是  当你拒绝一切的时候
Fortunately, when you say no to everything,

157
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,540
就腾出了时间来构思绝妙计划
it frees up time to concoct ingenious schemes.

158
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,280
看  乔  哪都没有怪物
Look, Joe, there's no monsters anywhere.

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,470
床底下没有
There's nothing underneath the bed,

160
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,930
帐篷里也没有
nothing inside the teepee.

161
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,010
你们确定吗
Are you sure?

162
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,540
当然  怪物需要藏身之处
Yes, monsters need places to hide.

163
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,950
他们不像邪灵
They're not like the evil spirits,

164
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,650
就围绕在我们身边
which are all around us.

165
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,620
-什么  -没有  啥也没有  宝贝
- What? - ‭No, no, nothing, baby.

166
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,710
-啥也没有  -看  我的窗户开着
- Nothing. - Look, my window's open.

167
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,470
可能他就是从窗户进来的
Maybe that's how he got in.

168
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,450
不可能
Impossible.

169
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,810
如果他经过房顶
If he came across the roof,

170
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,040
就会有破损的瓦片或怪物的脚印或...
there'd be broken tiles or monster prints or...

171
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,390
我的压花钱夹
My monogrammed money clip.

172
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,370
我昨晚从乔的
I snuck in through Joe's

173
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,570
窗户爬进来  因为过了门禁时间
window last night because it was past curfew,

174
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,470
我肯定是把钱夹落在屋顶了
and I must have dropped my clip on the roof.

175
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,360
我得在妈妈看见之前把它捡回来
I needed to get it before mom saw.

176
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,850
我可不能被禁足
I can't afford to get grounded.

177
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,790
大卫·赛德瑞斯在工作日的晚上

{\an8}知名作家与单口相声演员

179
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,920
要来巴诺书店演出
on a school night.

180
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,080
我可以到房顶上看看有没有怪物的口水
I guess I can go out on the roof and check for monster slobber.

181
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,500
-好的  -不
- Okay. ‭- No!

182
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,570
如果他从房顶上掉下来摔死了
If he falls from the roof and dies,

183
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,690
他的幽魂就会缠着你一辈子
his ghost will haunt you forever.

184
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,410
天啊  我可不想要有幽魂
Oh, boy. I do not need a ghost.

185
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,820
曼尼  来车库里帮我个忙
Manny, help me out in the garage.

186
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,750
我能对我不愿做的事说不吗
Do I get to say no to things I don't want to do?

187
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,270
不能  在你这年纪  拒绝人会讨人厌
No, at your age, it's unlikable.

188
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,900
而在我这年纪  拒绝人会讨人喜
At my age, it's delightful.

189
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,810
你能帮我把那些复活节装饰物拿下来吗
Can you get those Easter decorations down for me?

190
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,440
不知道你还记得不
I don't know if you remember,

191
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,500
最近我的背一直疼
but my back's been bothering me lately.

192
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,100
我需要先换个衣服吗
Uh, do I need to change my shirt?

193
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,640
那儿看起来蛛网密布
It looks cobwebby up there.

194
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,270
不用  就拉一下
No, just give it a tug.

195
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,750
我都没意识到那个水泥砖这么差一点
You know, I never realized how close to the edge

196
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,420
就会砸到了这个漂亮的摇篮上
that cinder block is to falling right on this beautiful crib.

197
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,860
见了鬼了  开什么玩笑
Son of a...! You got to be kidding me!

198
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,690
我靠
Come on!

199
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,580
好热闹的场面
Quite the shindig, huh?

200
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,680
小傻子们去歇歇腿吧
You mooks cool your heels.

201
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,590
小爷我去给美人儿拿点烈酒
I'll grab some hooch for this parakeet.

202
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,760
菲尔  为什么我们是唯一穿成这样的
Phil, why are we the only ones in costume?

203
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,590
小宝贝说的没错  哪里不太对头
Oh, you're right, doll. Something's screwy.

204
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,430
请柬上明明写着  "可选着帮派戏服"
The invitation clearly said "Gangster attire optional."

205
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,300
可选着
Optional?!

206
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,660
你这个傻子真这么穿了
You dumbasses actually did it!

207
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,130
杰里  快拍
Jerry, get this!

208
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,780
不  杰里  别拍
No, Jerry, don't get this.

209
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,060
各位  这是洛林的儿子  雷
Uh, everyone, this is Lorraine's son, Ray.

210
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,340
母女  我最喜欢的搜索类别
Mother-daughter -- My favorite search category.

211
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,090
按道理你不是应该在
Shouldn't you be partially upright

212
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,990
"男人成长度表"上较偏后的位置了吗
on a "Stages of man" chart somewhere?

213
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,980
-什么  -是的
- What? ‭- Yeah.

214
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,950
亲爱的  你现在听着
Honey, you need to hear this right now.

215
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,620
你的家人很难堪
Your family's embarrassed.

216
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,960
我们是唯一这么穿的
We're the only ones in costumes.

217
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
你总是陷我们于这种境地
You do this all the time.

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,450
我还穿着羊毛内裤呢
I'm wearing wool underwear.

219
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,310
这是你为了符合历史自己选穿的
That's an extra step you chose to take.

220
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,580
对不起  我以为这很好玩
I'm sorry. I thought this would be fun.

221
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,690
但你觉得好玩的对我们来说很恐怖
Yes, but your idea of fun is often our idea of a horror show.

222
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,140
当你开热狗车到学校接我时
When you picked me up from school in that hot dog car.

223
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,310
在我的毕业典礼上
Repeatedly screaming,

224
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,220
不断大喊 "这才对嘛"时
"That's what I'm talking about!" at my graduation.

225
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,150
踩着高跷去我的科学展览会
Walking into my science fair on stilts.

226
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,080
你的作品是长脚[爸爸]蛛  我没得选啊
Your exhibit was on daddy longlegs. I had no choice!

227
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,550
亲爱的  你一直都有选择
Oh, honey, you always have a choice.

228
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,060
只是你总选错误的那个而已
You just keep making the wrong ones.

229
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
兄弟们
Guys.

230
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,570
别走啊
Come on, now.

231
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,320
看  是漂亮男孩邓菲

233
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,060
爸爸  你看起来也很棒
Looking good yourself, Pops.

234
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,570
你怎么样
How, uh -- How you doing?

235
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,590
我准备好了我的戒指  我的誓词
Well, I got my rings, got my vows.

236
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,440
万事俱备只欠逃婚路子
Now all I need is a way to escape.

237
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,250
快来人啊  帮帮我
Please, someone help.

238
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,930
我开玩笑呢
I'm kidding, of course.

239
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,780
实际上  我一直很期待再婚
Actually, I'm really looking forward to being married.

240
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,350
那你拿着这行李袋子干嘛
Then -- Then what's with the getaway bag?

241
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,810
我想请你帮我
Oh, I got to ask you to help me out

242
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,280
来实施我这个惊喜
with what I think is a doozy of a surprise.

243
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,060
过来
Come here.

244
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,500
听我说  仪式举行中  当你问
Get this -- Mid-ceremony, you know, when you ask

245
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,320
有人反对吗的时候
if anyone has any objections?

246
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,010
我会拿出
‭I'm gonna pull out

247
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,260
一个冲锋枪  让你跳过那部分
a Tommy gun and tell you to skip that part.

248
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,980
哎哟我滴妈  我喜欢
Sweet maple syrup. I like it.

249
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,080
还不止如此呢
I'm just getting warmed up.

250
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,910
我准备了脚本  道具枪  漆弹
I got a script, prop guns, exploding paint capsules.

251
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,860
我还雇了本地剧院的几个演员来帮忙
I even hired a few of the local theater people to help out.

252
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,750
洛林同意这件事吗
And, uh -- And Lorraine's cool with all this?

253
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,090
这就是最棒的地方  她根本不知道
That's the beauty part. She doesn't know a thing about it.

254
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,110
80%的喜剧都是惊喜
80% of comedy is surprise.

255
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,500
剩下的20%是文字哏
The other 20% is wordplay.

256
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,170
怎么了  儿子
Something wrong, son?

257
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,090
我觉得这可能不是个好主意
I think this might be a terrible idea.

258
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,960
你什么意思
What do you mean?

259
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,180
洛林有可能是比较传统的新娘子
Lorraine might be one of those old-fashioned brides

260
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,670
不想自己的婚礼上还得进行尸体清点
that doesn't want a body count on her special day.

261
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,530
爸  咱俩喜欢玩儿
Dad, you and I like to have fun,

262
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,560
但不是每个人像咱俩一样
but not everybody's like us.

263
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,440
有些人  有些人觉得
Some people -- Some people think

264
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,350
咱们的招牌幽默让人难堪
our brand of humor is embarrassing.

265
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,680
你说得对  有时候我的确有点过火
Oh, you're right. Maybe I do overdo it.

266
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,520
我记得在你受洗仪式上
I remember your mother was really ticked off at me

267
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,310
我一直假装圣水很烫
at your baptism when I kept pretending the holy water

268
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,470
你妈妈就很恼火
was boiling. ‭

269
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,150
好吧  我们今天就不做什么疯狂事了
Okay, we don't have to do anything crazy today.

270
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,980
-放心吧  -谢谢  爸爸
- Don't worry about it. - Thanks, Pops.

271
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,430
不过  你还是会按我们说好的那样
But, wait, you're still gonna do my funeral

272
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,100
帮我筹备丧礼的吧
the way we talked about, right?

273
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,920
播放那段你猛敲棺材盖  
That recording of you banging on that piece of wood

274
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,050
大喊"放我出来"的录音  
screaming, "Let me out of here!"

275
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,720
我没办法亲眼看到那一幕  真是可惜
It's a real shame I'm gonna miss that.

276
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,750
-你在干吗  -曼尼刚才制造的那场意外
- What are you doing? - That accident that Manny caused earlier

277
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,470
快把我吓死了  于是我决定
gave me quite a start, so I figured

278
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,400
把所有东西搬出来  用更安全的方式摆放回去
I'd pull everything out and put it back in a safer fashion.

279
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,390
歌洛莉亚  你能帮我插好这个插头吗
Gloria, could you plug this in for me?

280
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,030
我想给部分杂物吸一下尘
I want to dust off some of this stuff.

281
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
你叫人家出来外面  就为了这事吗
Did you call me outside just for that?

282
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,370
我的背不舒服啊
I got a back situation.

283
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,780
曼尼应该提起过吧
Maybe Manny mentioned it.

284
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,030
不  插错了
Oh, no! Wrong cord!

285
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,220
你都干了什么
What have you done?

286
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,050
天啊  乔的婴儿床貌似彻底报废了
Geez, it seems like Joe's crib's damaged beyond repair!

287
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,130
不不  没事啊
No, no, it's fine.

288
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,690
它不过是像玩"青蛙过河"  跳到了对面
It just Froggered across the street.

289
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,060
先放在那儿吧  明天收垃圾的人会来
Leave it there. The garbage man is coming tomorrow.

290
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,180
那你没意见吗
And you're fine with that?

291
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,490
你明明对跟那孩子有关的东西都很留恋
You're attached to everything related to that kid.

292
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,350
是啊  但我一点都不留念那张破床
Yeah, but not to that stupid crib.

293
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,230
你知道我被这张床弄坏了多少件衣服吗
Do you know how many clothes I've ruined walking by it --

294
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,810
有美美的裙子  毛衣  还有一双高跟鞋
nice dresses, sweaters, a pair of high heels?

295
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,130
你怎么有办法勾坏高跟鞋呢
How do you snag a pair of high heels?

296
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,640
我用脚踢那破玩意儿啊  不然呢
I kicked that stupid thing. How else?

297
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,110
我的陷阱起作用了  我抓到了那只怪物
My trap worked! I caught the monster!

298
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,530
你落入我手中了  大怪物
I got you now, monster!

299
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,750
等等  别动手  是我  曼尼
Wait, wait, wait, stop! It's me -- Manny.

300
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,030
拿出证据  我喜欢吃蔬菜吗
Prove it. Do I like vegetables?

301
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,430
蘸了番茄酱才肯吃
Only with ketchup.

302
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,380
曼尼  你怎么会在这里
Manny, what are you doing here?

303
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,610
我只是要找个地方  
Uh, I just needed a place to practice

304
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,490
为毕业舞会练习新舞步
some new dance moves for the prom.

305
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,350
跳吧
Do it.

306
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,010
什么
What?

307
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,370
跳新舞步给我看
Do the dance moves.

308
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,250
不得不说  你跳得挺好
I have to admit that that is very good.

309
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,140
但我知道你在说谎
But I know that you're lying.

310
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,020
好吧
Fine.

311
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,580
昨晚在房间里的人是我
I was the one in here last night.

312
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,020
我从窗户爬进来的  因为我违反了宵禁
I came in through the window because I broke curfew.

313
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,980
我的钱夹掉了
I dropped my money clip,

314
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,580
我只是想把它找回来
and I was just trying to get it back.

315
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,650
你今晚别想去看大卫·赛德瑞斯了
Forget about going to David Sedaris.

316
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,510
我错了  乔
I was wrong, Joe.

317
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,430
这个房间里的确有一只怪物
There is a monster in this room.

318
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,050
当素人模特最关键的一点
The key to real-person modeling

319
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,220
是不能太吸引目光而模糊了焦点
is not to attract a lot of attention to yourself.

320
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,160
这张是我在考虑要不要买车
This is me thinking about buying a car.

321
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,650
这张是我有牙疼  很明显了
This is me with a toothache, obviously.

322
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,780
这张就是我很机智的样子
Oh, this is me smart.

323
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,340
-你刚说什么  米奇尔  -我什么都没说
- What was that, Mitchell? - I didn't say anything.

324
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,300
我好像听到你说  我们今天很忙
I thought you said something about that we had a busy day.

325
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,250
不  不  我很开心能在这里
No. No, I'm just happy to be here

326
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,830
见证她事业开始腾飞的时刻
watching a career get launched.

327
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,580
是啊
Oh. ‭Yeah.

328
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,320
他们叫到我名字时  喊我一声
Hey, tell me if they call my name.

329
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,660
我去压制一下我的美貌
I'm gonna go pretty down.

330
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,520
好的
Mm. ‭Okay.

331
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,190
你说她过分不
Can you believe her?

332
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,130
她就这么闯进我们的生活  觉得我们理应
She just barges into our life and expects us

333
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,720
放下自己的事情  支持她这个不切实际的梦想
to drop everything and invest in this crazy dream.

334
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
她演这个刚弄坏了拖把的人  的确惟妙惟肖
Well, she really does look like someone who just broke her mop.

335
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
够了  你到底怎么回事
Okay, what is going on with you?

336
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
我不会再这么做了  小卡
I'm not doing it anymore, Cam, okay?

337
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,100
你太害怕了  不敢反抗你大只又可怕的姐姐
Okay, you're too afraid to confront your big, scary sister,

338
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,430
所以你利用我来当坏人
so you use me to do it.

339
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,810
我不干了
Well, I'm out, okay?

340
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,650
除非你学会如何反抗她
Until you learn how to confront her yourself,

341
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,080
否则你从她那儿永远得不到
you're never gonna get the respect from her

342
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,580
你明显超想要的尊重
that you clearly crave.

343
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,370
你知道吗  我一点都不怕她好吗
Okay, you know what? I am not in the least bit intimidated by her.

344
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,180
"她"是谁
"Her" who?

345
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,470
变装戏服店的女店员啦
Oh, the lady at the costume store that,

346
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,820
米奇尔正催我马上去
uh, M-Mitchell's pressuring me to go

347
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,120
那家店里取戏服
pick up the costumes right now.

348
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,460
好吧  我这就去  米奇尔
I go-- Okay, I'm going, Mitchell.

349
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,690
天啊  急什么
My gosh. My gosh.

350
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,780
给我一块钱硬币
Hey, give me a dollar

351
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,420
我要在自动贩卖机买口香糖
so I can get me some gum.

352
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,880
-给你  -谢谢
- Here. - ‭Thank you.

353
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,030
天啊  你太完美了
My God, you're perfect.

354
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,800
我要火了
It's happening!

355
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,370
你真是太平凡太路人了
You're absolutely unremarkable!

356
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,820
泰瑞  快出来
Terry, get out here!

357
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,640
这次别又是假...
This better not be another false...

358
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,760
我无法不把视线从他脸上移开
I can't not take my eyes off him.

359
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,460
我不是来试镜的
Oh, I'm -- I'm not here to audition.

360
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,620
再说一遍
Say that again.

361
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,540
对  我已经忘了你刚刚说什么了
Yes, I've already forgotten what you said.

362
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,350
他就是上帝用龙套脸模板做出的成品吧
When they made him, they kept the mold.

363
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,190
你在看我吗  你在看我吗
Are you looking at me? Are you looking at me?

364
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,730
拜托告诉我你是在练习电影台词
Please tell me you're doing a scene from a movie

365
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,430
而不是真的不知道镜子是什么
and not confused about what a mirror is.

366
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,270
亲爱的  那是什么
Hi, honey. What's that?

367
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,350
一袋塑料枪
A bag of plastic guns.

368
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,250
我爸本来在婚礼上安排了一场疯狂的大戏
My dad was planning this crazy stunt at the wedding

369
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,030
洛林完全不知情
that Lorraine didn't even know about.

370
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,880
连剧本什么的都准备好了
There's a whole script for it and everything.

371
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,130
别担心  我已经劝阻他了
Don't worry. I talked him out of it.

372
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,690
今天不会再让邓菲家的人难堪了
No more embarrassing the Dunphys today.

373
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,510
我听到你们说的话  我真的很抱歉
I heard what you guys said, and I'm -- I'm truly sorry.

374
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,680
快问快答
Oh, quick.

375
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,080
珍妮弗·洛佩兹偷了乔恩·洛维兹什么绰号
What nickname did Jennifer Lopez steal from Jon Lovitz?

376
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,320
{\an8}都是好莱坞知名艺人
名字缩写都可以是J-洛

377
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
J...  算了
J-- Never mind.

378
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,440
你好  对  是戒指
Hello? Yes, the rings.

379
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,540
他居然没说"J-啰"这个烂哏
Wow. He didn't say "J-Lo."

380
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,500
他刚听到了警笛声  也没有说
He also heard that siren and didn't say,

381
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
"接我的车来了"
"There's my ride."

382
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,040
老爸是不是被我们搞坏了
Did we break dad?

383
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,580
你们什么时候见过他
And when was the last time you saw him

384
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,780
拿起一罐发泡奶油
pick up a can of whipped cream

385
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,180
却不演"我有狂犬病"口吐白沫那一出
and not do his "I've got rabies" gag?

386
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,140
我的天  是不是矫枉过正了
Oh, my God. Did we go too far?

387
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,450
我们他把搞笑的一面给弄没了
Have we knocked the fun out of him?

388
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,360
才没有  不能这么想
No, no, no. Stop this thinking.

389
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,790
我们只差一步就能拥有一个正常的老爸了
We are this close to having a normal dad,

390
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,670
你们不能半途而废
and you are not ruining it.

391
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,900
各位  我能占用克莱尔一会儿吗
Hey, guys, can I have Claire for a second?

392
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,650
当然
Sure.

393
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,370
受不了  他们要在我们隔壁过新婚之夜吗
Ew, they're spending their wedding night right next door?

394
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,330
别慌  你能听到的最大动静
Calm down. The loudest noise you're gonna hear

395
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,980
不过是爷爷从椅子上起身而已
is Grandpa getting out of a chair.

396
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,840
你看起来美极了
You look great.

397
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,890
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

398
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,870
这都是我第四次结婚了
Well, you'd think on my fourth marriage,

399
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,260
还以为不会那么紧张呢
I wouldn't be this nervous.

400
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,010
我猜嫁人永远不是件轻松的事
Ah, I guess it never gets easier.

401
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,920
我还记得我的婚礼
I remember my wedding.

402
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
我紧张得肚子里像装了乱飞的蝴蝶
My stomach was filled with butterflies.

403
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,120
与海莉
And Haley.

404
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,420
我总是嫁给很严肃的男人
I've always married such serious men.

405
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,600
但弗兰克可一点都不严肃
Frank is not that at all.

406
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,350
我知道  但如果你能忽略那一点
Oh, I know, but if you can see past that.

407
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,230
什么忽略
Past that?

408
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,110
是啊  他也有很多优点的
Yeah, he's got a lot of wonderful qualities, too.

409
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,960
亲爱的  不是的
Oh, sweetie, you're missing it.

410
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,450
我的所有前夫都是很严肃的成功人士
All my ex-husbands were accomplished, serious men,

411
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,520
但无聊得要死
but bone-dry.

412
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,990
而弗兰克每天都能逗得我乐开怀
A day hasn't gone by that Frank hasn't made me laugh.

413
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,030
希望我能不负他的幽默
I hope I keep up.

414
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,020
不过我说的你肯定都懂
Oh. ‭But who am I telling?

415
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,540
你也幸运嫁了邓菲男儿
You got lucky, too.

416
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,340
胜利的滋味
Sweet victory!

417
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,370
等一下
Okay, wait, wait.

418
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,400
-冲啊  -不要
- Charge! - No, no, no!

419
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,840
不许弄到我头发上
Not my hair!

420
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,630
不许弄到我头发上
Not my hair!

421
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,070
你们这是在玩什么
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

422
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,420
没什么  我们在用防怪物的漆
Oh, nothing. We're painting Joe's wall

423
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,330
重刷乔的墙来保护他
with monster repellent to protect him.

424
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,520
看起来你们玩得挺开心的
Looks like you're having fun, huh?

425
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,810
别担心  我们不会叫你做任何事的
Don't worry. We're not gonna ask you to do anything.

426
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,300
刷好墙角的秘诀是
The trick to the corners is if you --

427
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,410
我们知道
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

428
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,560
去给你自己倒杯酒喝吧
Go fix yourself a drink!

429
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,890
"去给你自己倒杯酒喝吧"
"Fix yourself a drink."

430
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,290
-就是那  -就是那  乔
- Right there. - Right there, Joe.

431
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,130
拒绝别人有这么个缺点
The thing about saying no --

432
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,440
如果你总是拒绝别人
You say it too much...

433
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,920
就再也没人找你一起做任何事了
people just stop asking.

434
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,540
你偷走了我的梦想
You stole my dream.

435
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,700
你别再这么说了行吗
Okay, would you please stop saying that?

436
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,310
如果不是你用你出众的平庸
If you hadn't distracted those ninnies

437
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,150
影响了那些笨蛋的判断  他们就会让我
with your striking regularness, they would have put me

438
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,170
出演全国电视广告  结果我们谁都没份
in a national TV ad campaign instead of neither of us!

439
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,570
你为什么冲我发火
Why are you flipping out?

440
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,360
我根本没和你争啊
I-I am not in competition with you.

441
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,580
所以你觉得我是疯婆子撒泼是吗
Oh, so now you think I'm crazy?

442
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,460
不是的
N-No.

443
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,920
没准我就是疯婆子  但我有很充分的理由
Well, maybe I am crazy, but I have a damn good reason.

444
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,670
把线索联系起来啊  你个笨蛋
Connect the dots, you dummy.

445
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,910
我穿着这么松垮的衣服  我急需用钱
I'm wearing real loose clothes. I need money real bad.

446
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,100
我的头发像狮鬃一样有光泽
My hair is lustrous like a lion's mane.

447
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,540
你恋爱了吗
Uh, you're in love?

448
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,310
不  正相反  我怀孕了
No, the opposite! I'm pregnant!

449
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,710
好吧  我的天啊
Okay. Oh, God.

450
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,640
家里人不想让我和博复合
The family didn't want me to get back together with Beau

451
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,260
因为他是六分之一外地人还已婚
on account of he's six-parts Chicopee and married,

452
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,210
但我还是和他复合了  现在他进了监狱
but I did it anyway, and now he's in County

453
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,350
因为他照骑警马的脸上打了一拳
for punching a police horse in the face.

454
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,260
如果家里发现了  他们就会知道
And if they find out, then they'll just know

455
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,210
所有人说我是废物真是一点都没错
that everyone was right about me being such a screw-up.

456
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,220
小帕  我一点都不知情
Oh, Pam, I-I had no idea.

457
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,590
你怀孕几个月了
I mean, how many months along are you?

458
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,640
马上就生了
Oh, all of them.

459
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,300
想说就说吧  谴责我吧
Yeah, go ahead. Condemn me.

460
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,700
你那张平凡的脸上全是评判的表情
I can see the judgment all over that generic face of yours.

461
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,890
这根肩带像钢琴线一样割肉
This strap is cutting into me like a piano wire.

462
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,640
你介不介意去翻翻我的行李
Would you mind going through my luggage

463
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,660
帮我把晚餐后穿的胸罩找出来
and pulling out my after-dinner bra?

464
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
如果别无选择的话
If I must.

465
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,310
我回来了
I'm home!

466
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,230
我没选上  多谢关心
I didn't get picked. Thanks for asking.

467
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,880
我倒是有好消息
Well, I have good news.

468
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,000
米奇尔和我是赢得人或动物类最佳装扮
Mitchell and I are early contenders to win the best costume

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
的早期热门选手
in the human/animal category.

470
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,710
你在做什么
What are you doing?

471
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,950
用食物自我安慰
Self-comforting with food.

472
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,400
那蛋糕我做了一早上
I've been working on that all morning,

473
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,930
是为了晚上的派对准备的
and it is for a party tonight.

474
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,730
你们一群基佬又不会真的吃蛋糕
What are a bunch of gays gonna do with a cake

475
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,320
只会围起来叽叽喳喳夸蛋糕漂亮
but stand around screeching about how pretty it is?

476
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,420
好吧  我受够了
Okay, that's it.

477
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,720
小帕  你太无礼了
Pam, you are rude.

478
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,850
你太不尊重人了
You are disrespectful.

479
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,170
你居然还敢吃第二口
And you are going in for another bite?!

480
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,400
把叉子放下  放下
Put the fork down! Put it down!

481
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,550
是时候
It is high time

482
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,790
你开始也为其他人着想一下了
that you start thinking about somebody other than yourself!

483
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,030
你就是这么看我的是吧
Oh. So that's how you feel?

484
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
是的
Yes, it is.

485
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,910
那咱俩今天没完了
Then I guess it is on!

486
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,010
别  不要
Don't. No!

487
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,660
-你跑就对了  -别闹
- You better run! ‭- No!

488
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,880
从我身上下来  我还没准备好
Get off of me! I wasn't ready!

489
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,470
准备好接我这招
Then get ready for this!

490
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,870
快住手
Hey! Cut it out!

491
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,320
疼死了
Hey! That hurts!

492
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,820
很好  表示老娘打对了
Good, then it's working!

493
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,610
别演了  你个戏精  我都没碰到你
Oh, cut it out, you faker. I'm not even touching you.

494
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,610
我猜是这件吧  你这是干嘛
I assume it's this one. Oh, what are you doing?

495
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,490
她怀孕呢
She's pregnant!

496
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,330
什么
What?! ‭

497
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,770
别打了
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

498
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,320
惨了  我羊水好像破了
Oh, no, I think my water just broke.

499
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,270
流在我身上了吗
Is it on me?!

500
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,040
我现在准备要下崽了
I'm fixing to reproduce right now!

501
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,400
打给811
Call 811.

502
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,650
米奇尔  别  那是牲畜急救电话

505
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,800
姐  你为什么没告诉我
Pamela, why didn't you tell me?

506
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,040
你觉得呢
Well, why do you think?

507
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,090
当然是不想让你失望啊
I didn't want to disappoint you.

508
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,470
你是我最崇拜的.....
You know you're the person I look up to mo-o-o-o-o-st...

不然我为什么来这里
Why do you think I came here?

511
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,460
我希望生孩子时能在你身...

512
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,390
我想到如果我先找到份工作
But I thought maybe if I got a job first,

513
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,770
我看起来就不会那么失...败
I wouldn't look like such a pathetic me-e-e-e-ss!

514
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,060

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,920
他们大概十分钟后到达
Okay, so they are gonna be here in, uh, 10 minutes.

519
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,140
我撑不到那时候了
I'll never make it!

520
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,080
孩子要出生啦
Okay. ‭It's a-coming!

521

好  米奇尔  米奇尔  来

帮忙我把她裤子脱下来
Help me get her pants off.

524

-好的  行  -然后我们得
- Okay. Yes. - ‭All right, we need to get

525
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,860
弄点枕头放到她屁股下
some pillows up underneath her hips

526
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,140
让她的产道维持正确的生产角度
to get her birthing canal properly angled.

527
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,220
好啦  我们准备
Yeah! ‭All right, here we go.

528
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,040
放轻松
Relax. ‭

529
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,860
米奇尔
Mitchell!

530
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,750
我想确保救护人员不会开过我们家
I want to make sure that they don't miss the house,

531
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,650
-所以我去...  -呼吸  呼吸
- so I'm just gonna... - Breathe, breathe.

532
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,620
弗兰克与洛林  今天是你们公开与合法地
Frank and Lorraine, today marks the public and legal

533
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,640
灵魂与灵魂结合  把婚姻置于一切之上的
joining of your souls, marriage being above all else,

534
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,670
签约仪式
a contract.

535
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,860
我最爱的其中一个作家曾写道
Uh, one of my favorite authors once wrote,

536
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,570
{\an8}来自印度/英国文学家萨尔曼·鲁西迪爵士

537
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,010
"爱若不是一切  那便一文不值
"If love is not all, then it is nothing.

538
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,570
这个原则与它反面的不贞
This principle, and its opposite,

539
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,110
碰撞出了我一生多年来扣人心弦的故事"
collide down all the years of -- of my breathless tale."

540
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,990
看到菲尔在台上这么闷  我有一种母鸟
Seeing Phil bomb up there, I felt like a mama bird

541
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,890
在小鸟已长大  把它踢出巢时
who had just nudged her chick out of the nest

542
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,270
没先说个笑话让它忘了疼的自责感
without a single pun to break his fall.

543
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,930
"人没有了爱情就活不下去
"For man can no more survive without love

544
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,990
就像木桶工不能离开柴刀
than a cooper without his billhook,

545
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,170
补鲸人不能没有剥鲸油刀"
nor a whaler less his flensing knife."

546
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,430
这些真知灼言直到今日
Words as true today as they were

547
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,420
也与一万八千年前刚被写下时一样正确
when they were written 18,000 years ago.

548
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,500
这不太对啊
That can't be right.

549
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,350
现在到了我问在座各位
Now is the moment when I ask if anyone here

550
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,950
有没有人有任何理由反对他俩成婚的时候了
has reason to object to the union of these two people.

551
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,620
谢谢大家
Thank you.

552
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,660
我反对
I object!

553
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,090
我反对你没有把他们的钻戒交给我  牧师
I object to you not handing over those diamond rings, preacher!

554
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,970
听到她说的了没
You heard her.

555
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,800
把钻石交过来  否则让你们吃墙子儿
Hand over the ice, or I fill you full of...leed.

556
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,640
-是吃枪子儿  -亲爱的  你在干嘛
-Lead. -Honey, what are you doing?

557
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,390
抱歉牧师  吉时已过
Sorry, padre, you had your chance.

558
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,460
我宣布你正式死亡
I now pronounce you dead!

559
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,160
你什么时候...
When in the world did --

560
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,650
一个死人咋这么多问题呢
A lot of questions for a cadaver!

561
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,060
你们没看出来吗  这两个人是一伙的
Don't you see? These twos is in on it together!

562
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,000
少管闲事  贱人
Mind your own potatoes, Daisy.

563
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,840
不好意思
Excuse me.

564
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,230
这是老娘的婚礼
This is my wedding 

565
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,980
与你们的丧礼
and your funeral!

566
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,500
小白脸也吃子弹吧
And one for the choir boy!

567
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,160
没中
Missed me.

568
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,500
你们还有兴趣再刷一个东西吗
Hey, uh, you guys feel like doing one more paint job?

569
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,630
不过这次是我们一起刷
Only all of us this time?

570
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,730
没问题
Sure.

571
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,720
有时人生比我们想得简单
Sometimes life can be simpler than we think.

572
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,820
我们出生...
We're born...

573
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,810
或许我们应该收留小帕与孩子
You know, um, maybe we should let Pam and the baby

574
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,620
在楼上住一阵子
stay upstairs for a little while.

575
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,110
米奇尔刚才说...  不对  他不喜欢我这样
Mitchell was just saying -- No, he hates when I do that.

576
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,950
我刚才在想  或许你跟孩子
I was just saying that maybe you and the baby

577
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,100
应该在我们楼上先住段时间
should stay upstairs for a while?

578
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,180
小卡
Oh, Cam!

579
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,720
我们去世
...we die...

580
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,850
你们是恶魔佳酿上脑  都疯了吧
You're all mad with the devil's brew!

581
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,850
{\an8}来自1916年无声电影《再来一杯恶魔佳酿》
恶魔佳酿指的是鸦片

582
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,030
而在这之间
...and in between...

583
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,530
如果运气好  我们会有欢笑
Ah! ...if we're lucky, we laugh...

584
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,310
而这趟人生旅途也就值了
...which makes the journey worth taking.

585
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,060
听完这番话之后
With that in mind...

586
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,000
弗兰克·邓菲  我认识最傻气的一个人
Do you, Frank Dunphy, the silliest man I know...

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,820
愿意娶洛林来折磨她一辈子吗
...take Lorraine to be your long-suffering wife?

588
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,180
我愿意
I do.

589
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,080
你可以亲你的娘子了
You may kiss the tomato.

590
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,780
先生  你一个小时前就该上床啦
Your bedtime was an hour ago senor.

591
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,460
我想先读完这本书
I wanna finish this.

592
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,250
你都不认字
You don't even know how to read.

593
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,840
别担心了  楼上没有怪物
Stop worrying. There is no monster up stairs.

594
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,000
那漆很管用的
That paint works.

595
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,060
妈咪  你能去检查一下吗
Mommy, can you check it?

596
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,950
好啦
Okay.

597
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,350
你妈连这块又旧又粘的防水布都不让我丢
Your mother won't even let me get rid of this sticky old tarp.

598
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,570
她对什么东西都抱着不放
She's attached to everything.

599
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,810
很快你就会享受到这件事的好处了
Someday soon that will work in your favor.

600
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,160
小心那个水泥砖
Careful that cinder block.

601
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,600
拜托  你就是推也推不动它
Man, you couldn't budge that thing with it.

602
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,960
棒  这下还有个沼泽怪物了
Great, now I have a swamp monster.
