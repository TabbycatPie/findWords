14
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,810
Last season on "Arrow"...

15
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,680
This city still needs saving.

16
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,130
Not by the hood.

17
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,110
It needs a hero.

18
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,600
If you survive a crucible, you grow the stronger for it.

19
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,940
This is to remind you of that.

20
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,030
Welcome aboard.

21
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,790
Sara swore her allegiance to the League of Assassins.

22
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,870
- You agreed to go back.? - She'll be ok.

23
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,940
Yeah, I know she'll be ok,

24
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,980
but ok what is what bothers me.

25
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,430
Dad? Dad!

26
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,620
Slade's whole plan was to take everything from me. He did.

27
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,800
Slade took Laurel

28
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,090
because he wants to kill the woman I love.

29
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,110
- So? - So he took the wrong woman.

30
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,000
I love you. Do you understand?

31
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,780
The five years that I was gone,

32
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,150
I wasn't always on the island.

33
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,220
My name is Amanda Waller., Mr. Queen.

34
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,880
Welcome to Hong Kong.

35
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,340
Got him. Coming up 52nd Streeet, heading east.

36
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,250
Copy that. Or is it roger?

37
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,740
I never know the difference.

38
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,860
John, there's an illegal shipment of rpgs

39
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,640
headed your way.

40
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,430
Roger. I'm on it.

41
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,120
Oh, so it is roger.

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,630
Rpgs are secure. I've got eyes on.

43
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,860
Roy!

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
We're coming to you.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,370
Vincent Steelgrave...

46
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,990
You have failed this city.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,570
The Arrow just took down another one

49
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,110
of the city's most wanted,

50
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,160
and there's no denying that the city's crime rate

51
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,110
has plummeted in the past five months.

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,890
- You're welcome. - But so has its unemployment rate

53
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,380
and its population.

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,690
We have experienced two terrorist attacks in as many years.

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,350
Starling City is dying, and a prison full of criminals--

56
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,650
Take another off the board.

57
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,040
We keep this up, there will only be

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,150
two types of criminals left in Starling City--

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,530
the ones we put away

60
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,750
and the ones that are running scared.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,260
What's that?

62
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,340
A fern. It thrives on the light.

63
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,680
I thought since you were living here now,

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,620
the place could do with a little sprucing.

65
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,940
You should buy me a bed.

66
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,440
You were sleeping on the floor.

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,140
Another text from Thea.

68
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,350
Where is she now?

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,820
Amalfi Coast.

70
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,260
I keep telling her to send photos.

71
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm going to go do a patrol, clear my head.

72
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,930
You did really good tonight.

73
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm going to head out, too.

74
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,040
I have to pull an early shift at work today,

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,730
which may or may not be the most depressing thing I've ever said.

76
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,430
But we're still on for tomorrow night?

77
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,290
Absolutely. I am going to turn you

78
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,530
into corporate master of the universe.

79
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,050
Those board members are going to be begging

80
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,590
to sell Queen Consolidated back to you and your backers.

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,790
I'm going to roll out, too.

82
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,710
Lyla has me trying to build the bassinet from hell.

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,080
That reminds me...

84
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,680
I figured since you and Lyla are having a girl...

85
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,860
Man, you cannot afford this.

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,410
I can't afford anything, which is why I made it.

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,110
Arrowheads, one of the few things that I can make.

88
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,200
Well, it's beautiful. Thank you.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,520
Congratulations, John.

90
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,420
And not just on the baby.

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,090
You and Lyla are happy.

92
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,750
Well, you know, you should try it some time.

93
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,340
Last girlfriend, she's in the League of Assassins.

94
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,710
My girlfriend before that, she shot my girlfriend before that.

95
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,790
I'm not...not exactly a catch at the moment.

96
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,190
Maybe Felicity will change all that.

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,580
It's...it's not the right time.

98
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,980
Things are as good now as ever will be, Oliver.

99
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,800
And you love her.

100
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,290
You even told her so.

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,220
I was trying to fool Slade.

102
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,510
Yes.

103
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,670
Except now the only person you're fooling is yourself.

104
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,800
Thanks again.

108
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,630
I told you, I don't speak Chinese!

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,670
And I told you, you try to escape again,

110
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,850
I beat you senseless.

112
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,280
Steelgrave took a plea for 15 to 20.

114
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,950
His lawyer folded like a deck chair

115
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,370
after I hit him with the evidence that the Arrow gathered.

116
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,520
Good work.

117
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,160
You catch 'em, I cook 'em.

118
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,350
Did I say that too loud?

119
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,930
No, you're fine.

120
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,230
Did you ever think that we'd end up as business partners?

121
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,580
Is that why you invited me down here, Laurel?

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,600
To see Mr. Steelgrave sent off into his new life?

123
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,200
No.

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,500
I have a surprise for you.

125
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,500
What's your dad doing here?

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,680
You'll see.

127
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,320
I'll be right back.

128
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,180
Dad.

129
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,950
How are you?

130
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,580
Well, if they had told me press conferences came with a promotion,

131
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,640
I would tell them I prefer getting shot at.

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,020
Good thing your doctors didn't give you a choice, then.

133
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,750
You know, you could try to hide the fact

134
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,130
that you're glad I can't get out in the field anymore.

135
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,900
I can't hide that I'm glad that you're safe.

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,780
- What's all this? - Your surprise.

137
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,490
Thank you all, thank you for coming.

138
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,790
Five months ago, this city was under siege.

139
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,400
And the SCPD rallied behind a man in a hood.

140
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,600
Well, I ended up with a captain's rank,

141
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,670
and he didn't even get a thank you.

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,300
But today, he does.

143
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,190
'Cause today, the Starling City Police Department

144
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,710
is formally recognizing the individual known as the Arrow.

145
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,770
And I'm using my new position

146
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,830
to disband

147
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,580
the Anti-vigilante Task Force charged with capturing him.

148
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,550
Thank you.

149
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,920
Now make no mistake-- vigilantism will never be tolerated.

150
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
But I refuse to hunt, in the name of this city,

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,360
- the hero who saved it. - Shut that crap off.

153
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,820
Less heat on the Arrow means more heat on us.

154
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,830
And the ATF now has our shipment of grenade launchers.

155
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,860
They got our shipment already?

156
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,980
What are we paying bribes to the cops for?

157
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,600
We have a more pressing concern.

158
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,790
Lack of leadership.

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,430
I nominate myself. Any objections?

160
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,900
Yeah, a few.

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,870
Illuminate me.

162
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,360
Where do I start? It's not just that you talk funny.

163
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,030
You don't know the first thing about business.

164
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,590
You're just a low level street dealer, a pill pusher.

165
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,720
Those pills I push?

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,650
Are known as Vertigo.

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,800
In the wake of the Count,

168
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,380
I tinkered some with his formula,

169
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,330
introduced an additive produced by certain mushrooms.

170
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,320
My Vertigo reveals the face of your greatest fear.

171
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,620
As I was saying...

172
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,010
lack of leadership. I nominate myself.

173
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,870
Any objections?

174
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,440
Our course of action is straight as an arrow.

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,040
Gentlemen...

176
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,020
we're going to kill him.

178
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,790
How was work?

179
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,640
"It" is not work. It is a soul crushing exercise in misery

180
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,250
that offers health and dental. Suffice it to say,

181
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,040
I am highly motivated

182
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,540
to help convince the board to sell you back the company.

183
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,900
Unfortunately, you don't really have

184
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,460
the qualifications to run Queen Consolidated,

185
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,160
But what you do have is passion.

186
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,830
You care about the company and the people that work there.

187
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,180
That's what you have to get across to them.

188
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,480
You got to speak from the heart.

189
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,870
Felicity...

190
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,230
would you like to go out to dinner with me?

191
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,880
- I'm being serious here, Oliver. - So am I.

192
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,250
I don't want to read... too much into this,

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,310
but are you asking me out on a date?

194
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,490
Like an actual date? Like a... date-date?

195
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,120
Su--I mean, the implication being with dinner that you...

196
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,900
Usually I'm the one talking in sentence fragments.

197
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,100
Would you like to go to dinner with me?

198
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,430
Yes.

199
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,390
Kelvin Nico just knocked over a liquor store.

200
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,080
Nico's in Steelgrave's crew.

201
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,310
Send his photo to Roy.

202
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,600
Get me Felicity.

203
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,050
You got it.

204
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,620
I can't talk right now.

205
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,510
I'm at work.

206
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,590
Could I ask you guys just to wait one moment?

207
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,920
Someone's calling for tech support.

208
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,830
Oh, you are going to get me so incredibly fired.

209
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,040
Okay, I am hacked into the city's database.

210
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,090
I am running facial recognition...now.

211
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,360
Do you like Italian?

212
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,760
- What? - For tonight.

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,550
You like Italian, right?

214
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,940
Everyone likes Italian.

215
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,300
Oliver, you're in the middle of a high speed chase.

216
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm multitasking.

217
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,560
I got him. He's in the sewer.

218
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm picking up his cell phone underneath.

219
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,930
He's at the corner of Grand and Ames.

220
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,650
And yes, I love Italian.

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,800
Detective Lance-- Captain Lance-- is also in pursuit.

222
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,290
You are welcome. I have to go.

223
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,440
Detective...thank you.

224
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,220
- You had it handled. - For what you said today.

225
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
I wish I could do more.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,960
You've already done more than enough.

227
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,100
I've got to go. Some place I have to be.

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,170
You got a hot date or something?

229
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,180
So this morning makes how many escape attempts

230
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,710
in the last five months?

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,620
Nine.

232
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,290
What we have here is a failure to reach an understanding.

233
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,770
Go to hell.

234
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,940
So this is my reward from saving you from drowning

235
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,330
in that freighter off the coast of Lian Yu?

236
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah.

237
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,370
Why'd you do that?

238
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,040
That's need to know.

239
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,080
Suffice it to say, I have need of a man of your capacity.

240
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,430
I don't care.

241
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,310
I don't care about anything except going home.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,970
And you should know that.

243
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,840
You should know

244
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,820
that I will never stop trying to escape.

245
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,590
And you should know that

246
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,230
it's extremely easy to kill someone

247
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,780
the world already thinks is dead.

248
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,150
Kill me, then.

249
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,900
I don't care.

250
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,620
We're going to have to try this another way, then.

251
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

252
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,610
Ah, no problem. I just want to buy this.

253
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,460
This is a satellite frequency communicator TX40.

254
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,510
Yeah, I'm trying to breach

255
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,430
a TORsecured firewall

257
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,620
and I need something to help me piggyback off

258
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,630
a Keyhole Hexagon satellite, so...

260
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,650
I did that once.

261
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,220
Hacked a public wi-fi signal,

262
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,630
piggybacked using crowd-sourced stealth processing.

263
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,610
You're Felicity Smoak.

264
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,710
Formerly of Queen Consolidated.

265
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,420
Do you mind if I ask you something-- why are you here?

266
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,880
How do you know who I am?

267
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,540
I know a guy who might be interested

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,650
in hiring someone with your expertise.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm not actually...

270
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,310
looking for a new job right now. God help me.

271
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,770
But I can help you buy this.

272
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,460
Unless I can't. I mean, I shouldn't.

273
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,890
You shouldn't buy this.

274
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,500
Ok. Clearly you don't understand

275
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,580
how this whole sales thing works.

276
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,810
The next-gen model, the TX50,

277
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,730
comes out in a few months.

278
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,020
I got to touch one last year.

279
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,160
Pure bliss.

280
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,390
And if you want to breach TOR-level security,

281
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,110
you should really deploy a remote administration tool.

282
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,430
I have a good one. Here's the URL.

283
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,390
Thanks.

284
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,570
Happy hacking.

285
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,850
I certainly hope so.

286
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,200
False alarm.

287
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,230
Are you sure? These contractions...

288
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,140
Just braxton-hicks.

289
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,420
You're not even four centimeters dilated.

290
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,620
I feel like an M1-A1.

291
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,230
It's a tank.

292
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,970
Think a big, big tank.

293
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,660
You did the right thing coming in.

294
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,830
You don't want your husband--

295
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,360
- Boyfriend. - Ex-husband.

296
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,580
to be delivering the baby on the side of the freeway.

297
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,240
You can get dressed now.

298
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,290
All right.

299
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,440
Are you ok?

300
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,110
Yeah, yeah, I'm not the one that's nine months pregnant.

301
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,810
You look a little scared.

302
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,760
Honey, please, I've thrown down with the Taliban,

303
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,860
Malcolm Merlyn, and a host

304
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,230
of Mirakuru-powered human weapons.

305
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,340
I'm terrified.

306
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,630
Queen, party of two.

307
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,590
Right this way.

308
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,260
- What? - Nothing.

309
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,030
- I'm just- - Nervous?

310
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,570
Yeah.

311
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,060
Line forms behind me.

312
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,250
Scotch. Neat.

313
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,900
Just the water for me, thanks.

314
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,220
Are you--are you sure?

315
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,680
The booze might sort of help with the whole--

316
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
The alcohol is not going

317
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,330
to mix well with the three benzos I took.

318
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,310
Am I being crazy?

319
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,410
I mean, what do we have to be nervous about?

320
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,450
Well, we've already exhausted every topic

321
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,480
that one would normally talk about on a first date.

322
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,890
And a second date and a third date,

323
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,460
and every date, actually,

324
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,160
And I've already seen you shirtless.

325
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,560
Multiple times.

326
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,480
Shirtless, all the time.

327
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,290
- Thank you. - Thank you.

328
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,570
There are still a few things that you don't know about me.

329
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,170
Please. Name one.

330
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,570
The five years that I was away...

331
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,150
I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

332
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,040
I thought so.

333
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,290
Where were you?

334
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,570
Hong Kong...

335
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,560
for one.

336
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,660
And I have been thinking a lot recently about...

337
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,620
my time there.

338
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,300
The choices that I had to make.

339
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,770
Those years sound like they were full of a whole lot of suck.

340
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,790
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,010
I'm just a little out of my element.

342
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,700
The entire time that I was gone,

343
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,860
I could never...

344
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,960
completely trust someone.

345
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,720
And when that goes on for so long,

346
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,990
you stop...

347
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,310
seeing people for people.

348
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,560
You see...

349
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,290
threats.

350
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,860
Or targets.

351
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,610
And when I decided to come home, I...

352
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,320
I just didn't know how to turn that part of me off.

353
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,440
Then I walked into your office.

354
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,840
You were the first person that I could see as a...

355
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,990
a person.

356
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,970
There was just something about you.

357
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,750
Oh, yeah, I was chewing on a pen.

358
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,080
It was red.

359
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,400
GPS shows him in the restaurant.

360
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,540
The Arrow's definitely in there.

361
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,660
If we're going to find him, we got to get in closer.

362
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,960
We're close enough.

363
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,340
Do you remember when I told you that

364
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,730
because of what we do,

365
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,330
I didn't think that

366
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,250
I could be with someone that I...

367
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,650
that I could really care about?

368
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,950
Yeah, I remember.

369
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,000
So maybe I was wrong.

370
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,090
Oliver, are you--

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,330
Oliver--

372
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,460
Is she ok?

373
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,480
She's just knocked out.

374
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,670
Saw it all over the news,

375
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,620
police and fire are on the scene.

376
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,800
Yeah, I didn't think it was the best idea

377
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,290
to stick around and answer questions.

378
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,410
You don't think you and an explosion

379
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,400
at the same place is a coincidence?

380
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,810
Hey, check this out.

381
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,240
It's a GPS. I found it on your jacket.

382
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,150
It's wasted now.

383
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,250
You took out one of Steelgrave's crew earlier tonight.

384
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,400
It was a set up.

385
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,800
So they could plant that thing on me.

386
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,320
Oliver, I know what you're thinking.

387
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,950
No, you don't.

388
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,450
Listen, I'm not other people.

389
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,530
I know exactly what's going on in your head, and you are wrong.

390
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,240
Diggle, somebody put a tracer on me

391
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,810
and I don't notice?

392
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,230
The only explanation...

393
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,500
I lost my focus.

394
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,270
Detective. The person we took down earlier

395
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,880
is working with whoever's respoesible for tonight's explosion.

396
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,940
Another one of Steelgrave's crew, I'm guessing.

397
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,120
Well, I need to know who's at the top of that organization now.

398
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,420
And where I can find him.

399
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,830
I'm on it.

400
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,230
You're safe.

401
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,900
You're safe. I'm here.

402
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,560
I'm on your side!

403
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,690
Got this handled, Detective.

404
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,630
These guys blew up a building.

405
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,230
You think I'm sitting this out?

406
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,200
Suspect's name is Werner Zytle.

407
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,730
He's a real nutmeg.

408
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,780
Keep your head on a swivel, then.

409
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,530
I'm Werner Zytle.

410
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,550
But you can call me Vertigo.

411
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,870
The Count's dead!

412
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,350
Some things never die.

413
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,970
You, for example.

414
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,600
It's frustrating.

415
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,780
Just means I have to try a little bit harder.

416
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,930
The Count might be dead, true...

417
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,890
But his glorious narcotic lives on--

418
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,770
with a few enhancements

419
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,180
that will reveal to you your greatest fear.

420
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,460
Like gazing upon truth itself.

421
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,510
Get away from him or get put down!

422
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,990
No...no!

423
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,140
Felicity, call an ambulance!

424
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,720
Are you ok?

425
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,570
That was a pretty strong psychotropic Werner hit you with.

426
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,460
How's Detective Lance's condition?

427
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,120
Stable. He's at Starling General.

428
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,670
I hacked the paramedic radio.

429
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,840
He had a coronary artery spasm treatable with medication.

430
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,030
He'll be fine.

431
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,300
How are you?

432
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,330
Believe it or not, I have had worse first dates.

433
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,450
Hit the streets.

434
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,960
Werner's agenda can't stop with me.

435
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,170
I need to know what he has planned.

436
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,110
On it.

437
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,040
I'll back him up.

438
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,970
Roy's got it.

439
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,910
Go home to Lyla.

440
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,760
Oliver...

441
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,410
If this is about what happened, man,

442
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,310
risk is part of the job.

443
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,760
Diggle. It's just intel gathering.

444
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,220
Roy can handle it.

445
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
I know we need to talk.

446
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,840
About our dinner

447
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,010
or our dinner getting blown up?

448
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,210
- Both. - It's ok.

449
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,400
We'll talk about it after we catch this guy.

450
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,380
But maybe we should reschedule the board meeting.

451
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,270
It's in less than an hour.

452
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,690
I've got this.

455
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,070
When are people going to realize that I don't speak Chinese?

456
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,550
Japanese.

457
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,270
You speak English?

458
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,490
Better than you speak Chinese.

459
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,480
Where am I?

460
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,840
Our home.

461
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,340
Mine and my husband's.

462
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,530
Your husband?

463
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,520
Welcome to my home.

464
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,480
Dinner?

465
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,240
I got to warn you, the doctors told me not to get yelled at.

466
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,420
Well, it's a good thing you don't care about

467
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,700
your doctor's instructions, then,

468
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,650
since you're still going out in the field.

469
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,970
Do you know what an advanced health care directive is?

471
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,870
It's what they ask for when you're going to die, dad.

472
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,810
The night Sara left,

473
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,930
the night you collapsed,

474
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,850
the E.R. doctor asked me if you had one.

475
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,090
I'm sorry, Laurel, I really am.

476
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,560
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

477
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,100
Then why do you keep pushing yourself like this?

478
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,450
I don't know how.

479
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,230
I've been a cop since before you and your sister were born.

480
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,380
It's all I know.

481
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,270
If I'm not a cop...

482
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,190
what am I?

483
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,010
You're my father.

484
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,410
And I need you.

485
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,390
And I just spoke to Ned Foster.

486
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,850
He said the board is primed.

487
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,590
You just have to go in there and wow them.

488
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,240
Which I am pretty sure is a business term.

489
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm afraid we have a situation.

490
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,170
Apparently there's another bidder for the company.

491
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:15,930
Really?

492
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,680
Who?

493
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,330
Ray Palmer.

494
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,020
Nice to meet you.

495
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,400
Love your company.

496
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,540
Nice to see you again, Miss Smoak.

497
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,870
You two know each other?

498
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,280
So sorry I am late. Heh, traffic was terrible.

499
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,720
Which is why I took my helicopter.

500
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,990
I parked on your roof. I hope that's ok.

501
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,610
You guys validate, right?

502
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,850
Oh, frack.

503
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,770
Two years ago, the people of Starling City thought I was dead.

504
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,390
I came back.

505
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,680
And so can Queen Consolidated.

506
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,110
With Starling National Bank's new investment,

507
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,110
we can take QC out of receivership and into the future.

508
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,900
I mean, this company's my family.

509
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,620
And as my mother always said...

510
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,460
there is nothing more important to me than family.

511
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,540
Thank you.

512
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,400
That was a good speech.

513
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,510
Hard to top.

514
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,700
Thank you all for coming out today.

515
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,120
I promise to be brief, if not a little entertaining.

516
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,790
Ahh. Oh, that's one of my new smart watches.

517
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,300
I'm very proud of those.

518
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,010
You like it, it works for you?

519
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,250
Yeah, good. Anyway. Science. Numbers.

520
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,340
I like numbers.

521
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,300
These numbers show QC's performance

522
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,160
under Mr. Queen's management.

523
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,270
I'm using that term extremely, BTW,

524
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,710
also BTW, these numbers

525
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,570
aren't sanitized for Wall Street.

526
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,640
This is raw information

527
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,120
from your company's own servers.

528
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
How did he get into our computers?

529
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,900
Something tells me he deployed a remote administration tool.

530
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,480
But the truth is,

531
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,960
this company's woes are a symptom of a much larger problem.

532
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,060
And that problem is Starling City.

533
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,460
Queen Consolidated can't hope to survive

534
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,420
if the city it's located in is dying.

535
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,420
Guess what? It is.

536
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,350
Nobody wants to live here anymore.

537
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,730
And after two terrorist attacks,

538
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,930
who can blame them?

539
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,880
This city still needs saving.

540
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,510
And that is my vision for this company.

541
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,880
To not only see it rise from the ashes,

542
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,320
but to take this city with it to that new horizon.

543
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,280
And that new day has a name.

545
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,380
Oliver!

546
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,800
I really thought it was going to go our way.

548
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,080
So did I. But maybe the company's better off with Dr. Palmer.

549
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,730
I couldn't make time for QC last year,

550
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,600
and trying to get the company back now, it's selfish.

551
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,060
That's something that the old me would have done.

552
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,010
And if the past 12 hours have reminded me of anything,

553
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,310
it's that two years ago,

554
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,240
I made the decision to put Oliver Queen aside

555
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,840
and be the Arrow. It's not a choice I get to unmake.

556
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,520
Last night at the restaurant, you didn't feel that way.

557
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,470
Look what happened, Felicity.

558
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,490
Oliver! The explosion wasn't your fault.

559
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,720
When Werner hit me with the Vertigo dart,

560
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,140
he told me that his formula,

561
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,140
it shows us our worst fear.

562
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,960
And I saw myself.

563
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,710
You don't really think you're afraid of yourself, do you?

564
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,300
I think I'm scared of what would happen

565
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,770
if I let myself be Oliver Queen.

566
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,920
What did we find out?

567
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,190
You know how we've got the number of crime bosses

568
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,480
in Starling City down to three?

569
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,920
Well, this new guy, Werner, he wants to make it zero.

570
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,800
Take out the competition.

571
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,390
Mikhail Petrov, Luciano Costa,

572
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,650
Shintawa Shimosawa.

573
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,090
What are their locations?

574
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,790
I'm not getting anything off of last known addresses.

575
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,270
Werner could be moving these guys right now.

576
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,850
I'm going as fast as I can! It's not like these guys

577
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,180
walk around with little GPSs attached to them.

578
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,320
Unless they do.

579
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,350
Petrov, Costa, Shimosawa,

580
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
They're all on parole or out on bail.

582
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,360
Ankle monitors.

583
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,500
Can't be right. They're all in the same location.

584
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,430
Rockets Arena. The heavyweight title fight's tonight.

585
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,630
That's like christmas for crime bosses.

586
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,980
There'll be like 20,000 people there.

587
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,840
He was willing to blow up a restaurant to take down one man.

588
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,420
He'll blow up a stadium to take down three.

589
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,370
Yeah, but an RPG won't do it. I need you looking

590
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,660
for a large explosive device.

591
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,750
Roy... suit up.

592
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,680
Where do you want me?

593
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,160
Here.

594
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,790
I can't have you in the field anymore.

595
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,920
Really? What changed?

596
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,220
You're going to be a father.

597
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,500
Oliver, you've known for

598
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,290
the past five months I was going to be a father.

599
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,550
So I ask you again--

600
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,140
- What changed? - I have.

601
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,750
My risks can't be your risks.

602
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,540
That... Diggle, you have a life.

603
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,340
You have a new life, it's...

604
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,950
life I can't have.

605
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,960
I get it.

606
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,890
You and Felicity were in an explosion.

607
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,120
People died, either one of you could have.

608
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,350
But you didn't.

609
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,100
You can't let that shake you, man.

610
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,060
Detective Lance is laying in hospital bed right now

611
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,370
- because I let him-- - Wait, wait, wait!

612
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,590
Lance is his own man who makes his own decisions,

613
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,000
and so am I.

614
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
Not this one.

615
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,230
Oliver, I've given the last two years of my life to your crusade.

616
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,560
I don't know what that's supposed to earn me,

617
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,880
but it earns me at least the right to make my own choices.

618
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,900
- No, it doesn't-- - Damn it, Oliver,

619
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,360
you would be dead ten times over if it wasn't for me!

620
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,080
You're right.

621
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,850
But this is my crusade,

622
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,740
which makes this my decision.

623
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,690
It's a five minute timer.

624
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,350
Come on! What are you waiting for?

625
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,390
My partner. Go.

626
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,830
I've isolated a frequency spike consistent with an incendiary device.

627
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,630
It's in the maintenance tunnel underneath the stands.

628
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,540
I'll get the bomb.

629
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,190
Get the son of a bitch.

630
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,710
Back for more?

631
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,890
It's as if you've developed an addiction

632
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,770
to Vertigo.

633
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,110
I've made my choice.

634
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,180
Felicity, we're running out of time here.

635
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,160
Ok. From your description,

636
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,440
it sounds like a collapsible circuit design.

637
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,550
Felicity...

638
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,740
Cut the yellow wire.

639
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,380
There is no yellow wire.

640
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,010
Ok, new plan.

641
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,980
Look above you, there should be insulated piping

642
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,530
pumping the arena's ac system. They're pumping freon.

643
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,350
You want to break one off, aim it at the bomb.

644
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,000
You're going to freeze the thing.

645
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,230
It's not working!

646
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,460
Don't look so surprised.

647
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,060
I haven't been gone that long.

648
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,400
Lock me down, it doesn't matter.

649
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,530
There will always be a Vertigo,

650
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,940
always someone to pick up the mantle.

651
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,170
You have given it the power.

652
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,860
Don't you see? Don't you see?

653
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,200
- You look well. How's Nanda Parbat? - Hot.

654
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,230
It's good to see you.

655
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,240
You've been missed.

656
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,720
I was on my way to see Laurel, picked up your radio chattha.

657
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,300
You should tell Felicity mix up her frequencies a bit.

658
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,210
That's a good tip. And is this permanent, you being back?

659
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,940
- I hope so. - We'll see.

660
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,900
How are you doing?

661
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,580
I'm... working through a few things.

662
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,090
Word of advice?

663
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,350
We're not our masks.

664
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,990
And we need people in our lives who don't wear one.

665
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,240
- Hey. - What are you doing here?

666
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,180
And the answer better not be stalking me.

667
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,700
Well, that depends on whether you consider

668
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,570
pinging your phone's GPS stalking. Ok, guilty.

669
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,290
But you know how I know a guy who would be interested

670
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,680
in hiring someone with your expertise?

671
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah, turns out I could really use it.

672
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,170
Seems somebody hacked my cell phone and my laptop

673
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,170
- and my desktop. - Gee, that's too bad.

674
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,560
All my data's been replaced

675
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,280
by audio files of porcupine flatulence.

676
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,170
And so I was hoping that whoever did it

677
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,670
might be willing to undo it

678
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,760
if I apologized for misleading them in any way.

679
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
That would probably work.

680
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,860
Oh, unless, of course, you did all that

681
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,520
to steal that person's friend's company,

682
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,850
in which case I would suggest getting used to the sound

683
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,520
of spiky rodents farting.

684
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,620
I didn't steal anything!

685
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,490
Ok, maybe a little, but as it turns out,

686
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,530
I didn't even need the data. I mean, you saw the speech.

687
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,630
It was a pretty good speech.

688
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,970
My friends just had a baby,

689
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,050
so if you don't mind,

690
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,580
there's another

691
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,370
slimy little human that needs my attention.

692
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,380
Oh, and BTW,

693
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,270
might want to check your tablet while you're at it.

694
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,740
Oh, she is scrumptious!

695
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,260
Mazel tov, guys, seriously.

696
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,610
Thank you.

697
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,300
I can come back.

698
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,750
No, Oliver, come in.

699
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,400
Oh, she's perfect.

700
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,310
Congratulations.

701
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,090
Thank you, Oliver.

702
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,990
For what?

703
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,310
For being right.

704
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,940
The second I looked at her...

705
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,590
everything changed.

706
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,620
The whole universe... changed.

707
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,670
You were right.

708
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,710
How do I get out of here?

709
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,280
You can't leave.

710
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,040
Well, why don't you try to stop me?

711
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,050
You've already learned I can.

712
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,320
Repeatedly.

713
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Amanda Waller wants you working for her,

714
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,780
and she will have her way.

715
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,090
Yeah, well, too bad for her. I'd rather die.

716
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,410
Which is why it's not your life she's threatening.

717
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,380
I am to be responsible for you.

718
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,720
She's found the proper way to motivate me.

719
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Akio.

720
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,480
She's threatened my family.

721
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,400
She'll kill them if I let you go.

722
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,870
My father had a proverb he was once fond of.

723
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,020
A man cannot live by two names.

724
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,680
And what does that mean?

725
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,430
In your case...

726
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,100
I believe it means not having any choice.

727
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,770
They look really happy.

728
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,990
- She's beautiful. - She is.

729
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,300
We need to talk.

730
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,370
I don't want to talk.

731
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,210
Which for me, I know, is a little unprecedented.

732
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,620
But...

733
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,660
as soon as we talk, it's over.

734
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,240
I'm so sorry.

735
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,960
I thought that I could be me

736
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,380
and the Arrow...

737
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,200
But I can't.

738
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,410
Not now.

739
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,870
- Maybe not ever. - Then say never.

740
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,050
Stop... dangling maybes.

741
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,100
Say it's never going to work out between us.

742
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,480
- Say you never loved me, say you-- - Felicity...

743
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,610
Don't ask me to say that I don't love you.

744
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,000
I told you as soon as we talked...

745
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,670
it would be over.

746
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,070
Hello?

747
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
It's Barry.

748
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,840
Barry Allen.

749
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,980
I woke up.

750
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,740
I could use some advice.

751
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,500
I'll be right there.

752
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,660
And here I thought that you used up

753
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,500
all of your league of assassin vacation days.

754
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,380
You look great. How's dad doing?

755
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
The same.

756
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,660
Seeing you will help.

757
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,840
I don't want him to know I'm in town,

758
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,010
not just yet.

759
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,340
You don't want him to know you're in town,

760
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,140
or you don't want him to know why?

761
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,750
Both.

762
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,120
This life, it...

763
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,750
it's complicated.

764
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,600
We didn't want you to choose it.

765
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,820
Not for us.

766
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,040
I know. I chose it for me.

767
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,130
The Arrow--

768
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,190
Oliver--

769
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,240
busted someone who tried to blow up Rockets Arena.

770
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,540
And my boss wants me to head to the station

771
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,490
to backstop the interrogation.

772
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,700
Laurel Lance.

773
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,210
Always trying to save the world.

774
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,520
Runs in the family.

775
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,800
Love you.

776
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,550
Hello, Sara.

777
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,270
What are you doing here?

778
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,960
Oh! No! No! Sara!

779
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,170
Sara! No, no!
