17
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,170
Damn, you're good.

18
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,390
Real good.

19
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,590
Maybe too good.

21
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,710
We did it.

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,700
We did it!

23
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,080
Oh, my.

24
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,910
Cisco Ramon, tonight you've got yourself

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,770
a hot date and a meta-human cure.

26
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,680
We're unstoppable.

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,990
Ooh, shrap...

30
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,970
We have to wait how long

31
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,640
before we can use the meta-human cure?

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,990
Not even that long.

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,080
- Cisco. - It's gonna go by like that.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,220
Cisco.

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,750
- 29 days. - A month?

36
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,250
I know, right? Just one, teeny, tiny, month

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,220
until we stop Cicada's purge. You know,

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,640
historically speaking, this is way faster

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,230
than we've ever stopped a big bad so...

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,360
We can't wait that long.

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,610
If he finds another meta

42
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,580
or comes after us--we have to speed this up somehow.

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,500
We have to wait for the compound to fully synthesize

44
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,130
or it won't be able to effectively neutralize

45
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,080
the dark matter in a meta-human's pituitary gland.

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,140
Without any way to expedite the exotic evolution--

47
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,150
Barry, we're gonna have to wait.

48
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,220
I think we have to wait.

49
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,390
Unless...

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,370
you took it into the Speed Force.

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,180
What, you want him to go into

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,500
the Speed Force for a month and then, what,

53
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,980
come out the same day that he left?

54
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,680
Oh, no, no, I'm not saying you manipulate time.

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,180
I'm saying you manipulate dark matter.

56
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,870
So very simple. It's simple chemistry, right?

57
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,740
When you are synthesizing a compound, you use a--

58
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,240
commodity, uh, substrate, uh--

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,010
- A catalyst? - Catalyst, right.

60
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,060
And the most efficient catalyst you can use when synthesizing

61
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,470
a compound that negates dark matter

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,260
is superluminal particles.

63
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,170
- Tachyons? - Tr¨¨s bien.

64
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,990
Tachyons, and the place where tachyons are the most dense?

65
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,910
- Speed Force. - And voil¨¤.

66
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,350
That might actually work.

67
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,610
Yeah, it will. It'll be like nuking it

68
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,570
in a pan-dimensional microwave.

69
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,710
-Nice work. - I know.

70
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,540
So how much time would this save?

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,270
From 29 days down to 60 minutes.

72
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,490
Yeah, it's gonna be faster.

73
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,230
And also since Cicada has been quiet

74
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,950
since your last encounter,

75
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,450
maybe there's no time like the present.

76
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,830
- Do it. - All right.

77
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,640
I'll see you in an hour.

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Nora, you need to stay here.

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
You don't want my help?

80
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,050
I just-- I got this one this time.

81
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,070
Are you sure that now is a good time to go?

82
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,830
I mean, I just mean, the city will be Flash-less,

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,230
and an hour is a long time to be without the Flash.

84
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,610
The city is not gonna be Flash-less. It'll have XS.

85
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,520
Yeah, but what about the time

86
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,570
you had to spend 24 hours in the Pipeline cell

87
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,420
and Weather Witch and Silver Ghost stole that A.R.G.U.S. car--

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,960
And you stopped them without me.

89
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,780
Eh, with what happened to Mom because of Cicada--

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,370
Iris is fine, and this is the key to stopping Cicada.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,710
I gotta go.

92
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,280
If anything happens, just do what I've trained you to do:

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,550
slow down and think clearly.

94
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,660
- Yeah. - I trust you, you just gotta trust yourself.

95
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,770
You'll be fine.

96
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,660
60 minutes.

97
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,990
Nora, Cisco hasn't left for his date yet, has he?

98
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,470
Uh, I don't think so.

99
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,760
Great, we get another chance at this.

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,200
Well, it is-- that's why you don't do it.

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,970
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

102
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,600
Oh, God. Not the "Book of Ralph" again!

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,230
Yeah, buddy. You successfully completed

105
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,850
my 27 steps to getting over the love of your life.

106
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,920
Gypsy is in the past.

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,300
You have a new siren,

108
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,990
so now it's time for...

109
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,080
"The Art of Love."

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Um, Caitlin?

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
I've gotta finish working on the device to inject the cure.

112
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,350
Also I have to inject the device for the cure.

113
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,000
I-- I-- I-- Iris?

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,970
Oh, no, this is all you, man.

115
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,290
I got an article I gotta write.

116
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,970
Let me know when Barry gets back.

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
Help me.

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,650
"Chapter one: Initial Planning."

119
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,700
Initial planning?

120
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,860
It's a first date, Sun Tzu, not an incursion.

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,900
Trust me, Grasshopper,

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,160
love is war, but, fine,

123
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,900
if you wanna skip to chapter six, "Know Your Terrain."

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,650
- We're meeting at Jitters. - Ah, familiar territory.

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,510
You are learning.

126
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,110
Uh, you know, he really should be going.

127
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,770
- I really should. - Hang on, hang on one second.

128
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,020
This one's really important.

129
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,050
Chapter thirteen, "Intelligence and Reconnaissance."

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,410
Wh-- you cyber-stalked Kamilla?

131
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,190
No, no, no, no, of course not.

132
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,920
That's her public profile.

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,290
But it did happen to have some info

134
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,040
on the types of guys that she might be into.

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,250
The types of guys that she's into?

136
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,640
Yes, and, unfortunately, you are nothing like them,

137
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,310
but, hey, if you don't wanna get a second date, be my guest.

138
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,740
Just don't come crying to me when everything inevitably

139
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,490
goes horribly, horribly wrong and you die alone.

140
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,600
No big deal.

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,860
See, now he's in my head.

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,900
Okay, no thank you.

143
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,370
I didn't take these.

144
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,180
- You saw nothing. - Nothing.

145
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,560
One Cicada on the bar for Ian?

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,430
- It's I-an. - Sorry, I-an.

147
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,620
Hey, Kamilla.

148
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,380
Cisco. Wow.

149
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,920
Sorry I'm late. I got held up at a meeting.

150
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,800
That's okay. I just got here.

151
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,690
If I'd had known, I would have dressed up more.

152
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,390
Oh, this old thing?

153
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,280
No, please, this is work clothes.

154
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,930
You have to wear a suit to your lab?

155
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,860
My lab?

156
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,200
When we met at the bar,

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,980
you were talking about DNA and genomes,

158
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,480
so I assumed you were some kind of scientist.

159
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,010
Right, I said that, scientist.

160
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,530
Yes. No. Well, I'm what you would call

161
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,370
a science businessman.

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,450
So, what, you make money off of other people's discoveries?

163
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,490
Well, somebody has to.

164
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,380
It's just a little joke, something I always say.

165
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,210
So, uh, what is the name of the company you work for?

166
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,410
It's called Ramon Industries.

167
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,990
It's named after yourself?

168
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,760
That's humble.

169
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,550
Maybe I should grab us a couple coffees.

170
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,620
Sure.

171
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,200
- Decaf Flash. - Decaf Flash, right, okay.

172
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,250
You're not the only one who does their research.

173
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,810
I know who you are, Iris West-Allen.

174
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,580
I know you work with the Flash and the other heroes.

175
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,720
You said you were gonna beat me,

176
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,400
but tonight, I'm gonna beat you,

177
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,740
all of you.

178
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,740
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,200
That's the decaf. Men in this city...

180
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,540
Tell me about it.

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,040
Uh, I'm sorry, it's work. I have to go.

183
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,800
Uh, could we just have, like, a do-over, please?

185
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,320
It's Mom.

186
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,990
Get away from her.

187
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,610
She's not who you want.

188
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,950
No, she's not, but you are.

189
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,000
Then come and get us.

190
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,670
Caitlin!

191
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,140
Told ya.

192
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,750
Nora, Cisco hasn't left for his date yet, has he?

193
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,320
Uh, I don't think so.

194
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,860
Great, I get another chance at this.

195
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
We do.

196
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,450
- What's wrong? - Uh, nothing.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,330
I just have to fix this. Okay.

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,370
Oh, God, not the...

199
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,750
"Book of Ralph."

200
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,070
- Again! - Yeah, buddy,

201
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,190
You have successfully completed my 27 steps

202
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,720
to getting over the love of your life.

203
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,070
Gypsy is in the past, you have a new siren,

204
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,140
so now it's time for the Art of Love.

205
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,370
Um, Caitlin?

206
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,630
I gotta go finish the device to inject the cure.

207
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,560
Also have to inject the device for the cure.

208
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
- I--I--I--Iris? - Oh, no, this is all you, man.

209
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,150
I got an article I gotta write.

210
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,880
Let me know when Barry gets back.

211
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,530
So not shway.

212
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,540
"Chapter one: Initial Planning."

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,320
- Uh, you can't leave. - What?

214
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,320
I mean, you just shouldn't go to your office,

215
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,460
- not right now. - Why?

216
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,360
Because Dad is gonna be back, like, any minute

217
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,610
and by the time that you get there,

218
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,860
you're just gonna have to turn around anyway.

219
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah, I know, but I need to get this article out tonight.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,170
Yeah, but, I mean, you have your laptop with you, right?

221
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,770
So why don't you just write it here

222
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,980
in the lounge where it's safe?

223
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,820
Safe?

224
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,810
I mean cozy. It's cozy.

225
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,530
Um, yeah, I mean, yeah. I guess I could.

226
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,190
Great, I'll make you coffee.

227
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,890
- Ok. -OK

228
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,890
You end up dying alone.

229
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,440
Okay, see, now he's in my head.

230
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,990
No thank you, Ralph.

231
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,880
Dang it.

232
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,770
Last bottle.

234
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
One Cicada at the bar for Ian.

235
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,670
- It's I-an. - Sorry, I-an.

236
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,780
- Kamilla, hey. - Cisco, wow.

237
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,810
Sorry I'm late. I just came from the gym.

238
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,690
Ya gotta get your steps in, you know?

239
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,100
That's okay, I just got here.

240
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,610
You work out a lot?

241
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,200
You kidding me? I'm, like, a gym rat, you know.

242
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,670
I live there.

243
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,510
So what kind of workouts do you do?

244
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,750
What kind of workouts don't I do? I mean, like,

245
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,150
Pilates for the core,

246
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,030
plyometrics for the quads,

247
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,830
circuit training, I mean, pretty much anything

248
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,540
I can get my hands on, even my hands, you know.

249
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,710
I've been known to do some

250
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,010
you know, finger pushups every once in a while.

251
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,260
- What? - When we met at the bar,

252
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,760
you were talking about DNA and genomes, so--

253
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,480
So you thought maybe I wasn't your type?

254
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,540
I thought I had finally met a guy who was more concerned

255
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,860
with flexing his brain than his muscles.

256
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,500
Okay, um, maybe I should grab us a couple of coffees.

257
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,670
Sure, decaf Flash.

258
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,450
Decaf Flash, I was gonna ask you.

259
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,650
I know who you are, Elongated Man.

260
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,290
I know you work with the Flash and the other heroes.

261
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,070
Iris West-Allen told me you were gonna beat me.

262
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,050
But tonight,

263
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,330
I'm gonna beat you,

264
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,630
all of you.

265
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,430
- One Zoom and one decaf Flash. - Thanks.

266
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,180
- The men in this city. - Tell me about it.

267
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,800
That's the decaf. The men in this city...

268
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,480
Tell me about it.

269
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,790
Uh, I'm sorry, it's a gym emergency.

270
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:34,710
I have to go. Um, can we just have a do-over, please?

272
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,580
- Ralph. - Get Caitlin.

273
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,790
Okay.

274
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,070
Move!

275
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,430
Ralph?

276
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,750
Told ya.

277
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,600
Nora, Cisco hasn't left for his date yet, has he?

278
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,420
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure he hasn't.

279
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,700
Great, I'm gonna get another chance at this.

280
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,290
Yeah, we do.

281
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,230
What's wrong?

282
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,200
Nora?

283
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,900
Nothing. Come on, you can figure this out.

284
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,470
Not the "Book of Ralph" Again!

285
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,250
Yeah, buddy, you successfully completed my 27 steps

286
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,630
to getting over the love of your life.

287
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,180
Gypsy is in the past. You have a new siren,

288
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,200
so now it's time for "The Art of Love."

289
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,290
Um, Caitlin?

290
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,720
I gotta go work on the device to inject the cure.

291
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,260
Also I have to devise the cure.

292
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,590
I--I--I--Iris?

293
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,810
Ooh, nah, that's all you, man.

294
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,930
I gotta go write an article.

295
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,110
Let me know when Barry gets back.

296
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,710
Uh, no, you know what? Don't go.

297
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,160
Uh, why don't you write the article here?

298
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,750
Uh, I can make you coffee.

299
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,260
I mean, I know that there's coffee over there, but I--

300
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,730
I just think it's really important for the team leader

301
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,550
to stay here until Dad gets back

302
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,510
just in case something happens, okay?

303
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, lounge it is.

304
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,980
All right, "Chapter one: Initial Planning."

305
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,780
It's a first date, Sun Tzu, not an incursion.

306
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,040
Trust me, Grasshopper, love is war.

307
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,690
Yeah, and I couldn't agree more, so read these.

308
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,420
They'll help you, and you'll know what to do.

309
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,940
- Wait, wait, how-- - And if anything goes wrong,

310
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,950
just give us a call.

311
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,630
You and I are gonna stay here and have our own coffees

312
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,900
- in the lounge. - No, no, no.

313
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
There's brownies.

314
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,330
- Brownies? - Yes.

315
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,610
Ralph, did you cyber-stalk her?

316
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,770
You were talking about DNA and genomes.

317
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,850
I thought I'd finally met a guy who was more concerned

318
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,920
with flexing his brain than his muscles.

319
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,860
Ca va?

320
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,690
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I just--

321
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,640
I'm having the most wicked d¨¦j¨¤ vu right now.

322
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,410
Is that right?

323
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,520
Why don't you want your mother to come here, hmm?

324
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,240
Because you time-travel.

325
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,960
- It's I-an. - Sorry, I-an.

326
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,540
Kamilla tha thrilla.

327
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,950
Cisco?

328
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,350
- Wow. - Sorry I'm late.

329
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,150
I just came from a photoshoot.

330
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,590
The things you do for the 'gram, am I right?

331
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,440
Hey, maybe next time you should be my photographer.

332
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,600
What do you think?

333
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,250
So you're a...

334
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,920
I'm an aspiring social media influencer.

335
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,870
This is my card. You can keep that.

336
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,780
When we met at the bar,

337
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,640
you were talking about DNA and genomes,

338
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,000
so I assumed you were some kind of scientist.

339
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,990
Really? When we met at the bar,

340
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,470
you were talking about DNA and genomes, so I--

341
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,760
You assumed I was some kind of scientist?

342
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Yeah, exactly.

343
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,730
Is everything okay?

344
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,720
Yeah, I'm just having some d¨¦j¨¤ vu again.

345
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,810
Maybe I should grab us a couple of coffees?

346
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,290
Oh, yes. Yes, that'd be great.

347
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,360
Will you get me a Zoom, please?

348
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,560
Okay.

349
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,190
What?

350
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,180
Okay, here we go.

351
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,020
Thanks.

352
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,840
- One Zoom and one decaf Flash. - Thank you.

353
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,030
Something's wrong,

354
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,810
- and I think I have to go. - Right now?

355
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,770
No, right now.

357
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,900
Yep, gotta go. Um, I'd ask if we could have

358
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,300
a do-over, but, um,

359
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,470
something tells me I already have.

360
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,350
- The men in this city. - Tell me about it.

362
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,350
- Come on! - It's Sherloque.

363
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,480
What? I thought he was here with Caitlin.

364
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,830
- We gotta get Frost. - No, no, I got this.

365
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,370
You guys just stay here.

366
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,240
Gar?on, look out!

367
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,510
Told ya.

368
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,350
Cisco!

369
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,560
Why can't I fix this?

370
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,280
Why can't I go back any further?

371
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,300
- Nora? - Cisco hasn't left yet.

372
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,610
Great.

373
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,250
So we get another chance at this.

374
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,660
We do.

375
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,290
I'm fine, Sherloque.

376
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,120
I have to fix this.

378
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,110
Okay, you guys have to stay here.

379
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,090
Why?

380
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,510
Because dad put his trust in me that I would protect all of you

381
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,730
and I'm the only speedster here for the first time

382
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,840
and if something were to go wrong,

383
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,060
I don't know if I could fix it, in fact,

384
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,170
I'm pretty sure that I couldn't fix it, so just, for one hour, stay here.

385
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,280
I have to go finish--

386
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,440
No, no!

387
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,790
I got a date with--

388
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,370
Were you cyber-stalking Kamilla?

389
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,620
No, no, no, of course not.

390
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,260
This is her public profile.

391
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,940
You were talking about DNA and genomes,

392
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,550
so I thought I'd finally met a guy

393
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,280
who is more concerned with his brain than his muscles.

394
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,660
Kamilla.

395
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, I got some details on the kinds of guys she's into.

396
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,360
Wait, were you cyber-stalking her?

397
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,670
No, I'm not stalking her. It's her public profile.

398
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,470
Guys! I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to stay here.

399
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,050
- I-an. - Sorry, I-an.

401
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,790
You have got to be kidding me.

402
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,850
You got the first one.

403
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,090
- I got the next one. - I think we all got one.

404
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,130
What did you get?

406
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,920
- It's Cecile. - Guys, um, just stay here.

407
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,260
Told ya.

408
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,740
Nora?

409
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,690
I was supposed to protect you,

410
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,940
but I can't. I don't know how to.

411
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,660
But my dad does.

412
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,290
I can't get into the Speed Force either?

413
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,490
You're reversing time, aren't you?

414
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,610
And I can't fix it.

415
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,830
So all of us die?

416
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,230
Sometimes, or just one of you.

417
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,190
Sometimes Cecile, but every time, there's at least one.

418
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,720
I thought I was having d¨¦j¨¤ vu.

419
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,610
I keep seeing my date with Kamilla again and again,

420
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,150
me failing miserably every time by using these.

421
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm not having d¨¦j¨¤ vu.

422
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,740
I'm vibing the past hour over and over.

423
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,910
Yeah.

424
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,390
How many times has this happened?

425
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,250
- 52. - 52?

426
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,330
This is one of those fixed points the Legends theorized, isn't it?

427
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,810
There's no way to keep one of us from dying.

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,250
- We have to get Barry. - No, I tried that,

429
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,160
but there's something wrong with me.

430
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,790
I can't get into the Speed Force.

431
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,780
Well, then we'll just wait here until he gets back.

432
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,130
No, if we do that, Cicada will kill Cecile.

433
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,900
So just reverse time and go back to before he left.

434
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,000
No, I've tried that too, but I can't control it.

435
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,290
It doesn't matter what I try to do. Nothing works!

436
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:33,270
Believe it or not, this ain't the first time

437
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,420
I've died in a past timeline.

438
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,310
I once got a vibrating hand through the chest

439
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,140
courtesy of Eobard Thawne.

440
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,130
Well, more than once.

441
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,730
I actually kept vibing that moment until I realized

442
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,350
that it actually happened.

443
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,690
I guess I should have known the same thing was happening now, huh?

444
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,040
I keep trying my absolute hardest to change the outcome,

445
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,780
but I end up failing every time.

446
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,040
What if we can't fix this, Cisco?

447
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,100
Nora, sometimes we fail because

448
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,530
all we worry about is not failing.

449
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm so worried about my first date since Cynthia

450
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,020
that I don't feel free to be myself around Kamilla,

451
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,840
and then I'll just end up screwing it up even more.

452
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,250
This--this intelligence and reconnaissance mess,

453
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,240
I don't need this. All I need is to be myself.

454
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,430
And I sure as hell don't need to dress up like Ozone

455
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,390
just to impress Kamilla.

456
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,530
Sorry, that is an outdated reference.

457
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,330
No, from the movie "Breakin'."

458
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,790
Yeah, I've seen "Electric Boogaloo" Too.

459
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,200
I've seen them both, like, a hundred times.

460
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,850
I know every move.

461
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,250
Wow, fangirl.

462
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,980
Wait.

463
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,600
Wait, that's it.

464
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,610
Every time I fail, I take notes in my journal

465
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,720
so I can do something different the next time.

466
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,580
We know every move.

467
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,170
So all you need to do is just tell us

468
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,600
everything you've done and how it went wrong.

469
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,100
So we can figure out how to make it right.

470
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,340
52 kidnappings, 52 combinations

471
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,180
leading to 52 deaths.

472
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,400
- None of them were Cicada's? - Exactly.

473
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,930
Yes, exactly.

474
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,340
Wait, does that mean you want to use Cicada's dagger against him

475
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,270
by having Nora reverse time?

476
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,270
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

477
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,290
Yeah, but how are we gonna do that?

478
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,520
I mean, Nora can't control it when she reverses time.

479
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,510
She could control her abilities if we help her slow down.

481
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,610
Slowing it down.

482
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,700
If she can do that, we bring the fight to him.

483
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,240
And we all live through the night.

484
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,660
I like the sound of that.

485
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,900
Well, we have everything we need.

486
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,640
Looking for me? I know you did your research.

487
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,940
You know who I am, that I work for the Flash

488
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,620
and the other heroes.

489
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,670
I told you we were gonna beat you,

490
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,100
and tonight we will...

491
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,460
All of us.

492
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,690
Allez, now!

493
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,050
Told you.

495
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,860
No dark matter anywhere. Dwyer's gone, again.

496
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,470
Maybe after the ass kicking he just got,

497
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,640
he'll think twice before coming after us again.

498
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,250
And if he doesn't think twice, now you can make him.

499
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,890
Thanks for helping me slow it down.

500
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,690
Now that I've experienced a sense of control,

501
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,030
maybe next time, I can do it on my own.

502
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,900
Thank you for saving us, all of us.

503
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,880
I didn't save everything.

504
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,220
Maybe you can now?

505
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,160
No, no, that date is over.

506
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,450
There's no way Kamilla's still at Jitters.

507
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,860
Well, if she is still there,

508
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,240
there might be some stuff

509
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,810
in here that can help you smooth things over.

511
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,350
But, you can handle it. You're Cisco Ramon.

512
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,980
Come on, you gotta get a move on.

513
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,090
Okay.

514
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,740
- Giddyap, Romeo. - I'm moving.

515
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,750
Okay.

516
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,380
Sherloque was right. One hour, it's cooked.

517
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,940
Something happen while I was gone?

518
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,480
Kid Flash on the bar for Steven?

519
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,600
- It's Stephan. - Sorry, Stephan.

520
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,720
- Kamilla, hey. - Cisco

521
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:22,290
I am so sorry I'm late. I had an emergency at work.

522
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,640
It's okay, I just got here.

523
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,200
So you're a scientist, right?

524
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,880
When we were at the bar,

525
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,590
you were talking about DNA and genomes, so...

526
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,220
I'm more of a tech nerd, actually,

527
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,480
but the project that we're working on now,

528
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,500
it gets very scientific.

529
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,220
You sound like you're really excited about it.

530
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,610
Oh, my God, I am. I'm so excited about it.

531
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,100
You have no idea, um.

532
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,820
I think we might have made a breakthrough recently,

533
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,250
a breakthrough that could change a lot of lives.

534
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,580
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

535
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,810
I hope you don't mind, I called it in ahead of time.

536
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,230
It's the least I could do.

537
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,730
- That's the decaf. - How did you know what I like?

538
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,140
I had a feeling.

539
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,780
Not like most of the men in this city.

540
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,110
Tell me about it.

541
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,650
Listen, I know I screwed up royally

542
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,580
showing up late like this,

543
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,340
but it would make me very happy if--

544
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,450
Can we just have a do-over, please?

545
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,450
That sounds nice.

546
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,400
52 times?

547
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,130
53, if you include now.

548
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,950
That's a lot.

549
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,510
What was I supposed to do, let one of them die?

550
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,370
The thing is, Nora, there are consequences to time travel.

551
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,330
- Oh, I know. - No, you don't,

552
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,170
not like I do.

553
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,340
Let me show you something.

554
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,000
Imagine this coffee cup is the space/time continuum.

555
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,860
Whenever you go back in time, it breaks.

556
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,150
Now, you can try and reset the timeline,

557
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,490
try and fix it, but no matter how hard you try,

558
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,770
it's never gonna be exactly how it was.

559
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,710
It seems like things worked out this time,

560
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,420
but that's not always gonna be true,

561
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,280
and it's impossible to know how these changes are gonna unfold,

562
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,560
the ripples you'll cause, whose life you're gonna affect.

563
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,610
No one can do that.

564
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,640
No one?

565
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,600
No one.

566
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,180
We're not gods, Nora.

567
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,900
We've just been given extraordinary abilities.

569
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,340
Thawne, I need to know we're not making this worse.

570
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,180
Tell me you know what you're doing.

571
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,040
I am the only speedster who knows what he's doing!

572
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,590
Stick with the plan.

573
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,080
Follow my instructions and we'll defeat Cicada,

574
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,940
we'll destroy his dagger,

575
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,910
and then we will save your father.
