8
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,620
我真不敢相信我居然来看心理医生
I can't believe I'm talking to a therapist.

9
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,080
我平常也不是一个很感性的人
Well,usually,I'm not the touchy-feely,talk-about-your-emotions type

10
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,690
但这次 我必须鼓起勇气承认 我的确需要帮助
but with this,I just had to be a big enough person to admit that I need help.

11
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,090
哦
Huh.

12
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,510
我想这就是成长的感觉吧
I guess this is what growing up feels like.

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,530
这是法院强令的心理咨询
This is court-mandated therapy.

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,230
你袭击了一位女性
You assaulted a woman.

15
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,000
哦...
Oh...

16
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,850
那件糗事
That silly thing.

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,350
我想我们可以谈谈那个
I guess we can talk about that.

18
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,380
是从几个月前开始的
It all began a few months ago.

19
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,750
这个人是Barney
There's this guy,Barney.

20
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,000
也是我的前男友
We used to date.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,390
我向他介绍了我的同事 Nora
I set him up with this girl I work with,Nora.

22
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,980
Barney煞费苦心的向Nora证明 他会是一个好男朋友
Barney was working hard to prove he was real boyfriend material.

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,640
所以整周我都坐在那里
So,all week,I had to sit there watching him...

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,850
看他送花
send flowers...

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,960
送巧克力
chocolates...

26
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,110
送气球
balloons.

27
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,450
然后有一天...
Then one day...

28
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,130
嘿
Hey...

29
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,610
我听说Barney今天啥也没送
I heard Barney didn't send anything today.

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,710
Patrice说他可能劈腿了
Patrice said maybe he met somebody else.

31
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,790
她可真八卦 你说是不?
She's such a bitch,right?

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,970
* 当一个男人爱上一个女人 *
* When a man loves a woman *

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,950
* 他绝对不会一心两用 *
* Can't keep his mind on nothin' else *

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,660
他可真迷人
He's so dreamy.

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,120
没人问你 Patrice!
Nobody asked you,Patrice!

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,240
真不好意思 你肯定已经认为 我不是一个好人了
I'm sorry. You must already think that I'm a horrible person.

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,880
Robin 很多来我这儿看病的人 都是犯下重罪的
Robin,many of my patients are disturbed felons.

38
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,890
上周 有个人还给我寄了一包排泄物
Last week,one of them mailed me a bag of his feces.

39
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,970
但好的一面是 他记得我的生日
On the plus side,he remembered my birthday.

40
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,730
跟他们比 你做的还不算什么
You're doing fine.

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
最后 我忍无可忍
Well,finally,I-I just couldn't take it anymore.

42
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,090
彻底崩溃了
I snapped.

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,310
* 当一个男人 当这个男人 *
* When a man,when a man,when this man *

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,370
* 爱上一个女人 *
* Loves a woman! *

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,080
所以就在那时 你袭击她了?
And that's when the assault occurred?

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,570
不是
Not exactly.

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,730
这么说来你喝的酩酊大醉 躲在桌子底下 大吃偷来的巧克力
So,you're drunk under a desk,binge-eating stolen chocolates.

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,360
我讲的不是很明白 是吧?
Boy,I am not coming across great here,am I?

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,510
重点不是你讲明白没
This is not about how you're coming across.

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,900
不过也确实没讲明白
But no.

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,550
好吧 为了让你更明白  我必须讲下我的朋友Marshall和Lily
Okay,well,for this story to make sense,I have to tell you about my friends Marshall and Lily.

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,730
这酒看起来不错
The wine looks good.

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,720
嘿 嘿 孕妇不能喝酒
Hey,hey,hey,hey,pregnant women can't drink alcohol.

54
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,450
不是的 医生说偶尔尝一口也没差的
No,my doctor says it's okay to have a sip of wine every now and then.

55
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,170
真的吗?
Really?

56
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,770
Sonya医生太好了
Dr.Sonya's great.

57
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,650
每次问她可不可以吃东西 她就像这样...
Whenever you ask her if you can have something,she's,like...

58
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,010
可以吃点儿
Just a little bit.

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,900
等下  Sonya医生没允许你吃寿司 是吧?
Wait,Dr. Sonya doesn't let you have sushi,does she?

60
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,040
可以吃点儿
Just a little bit.

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,470
连奇多都还能吃?
You're allowed to have Cheetos?

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
奇多...
Cheetos...

63
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,560
啊 也可以吃点儿
Ah,just a little bit.

64
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,530
你不介意的话 为了以防万一 我可以再检查一下这个吗?
You mind if I double-check some of this stuff just in case?

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,830
作为我们宝宝计划的团队成员之一 我应该这么做
I mean,it's the least I could do as part of Team Baby.

66
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,480
" 宝宝计划 " ? 哇
"Team Baby"? Whoa.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,600
下一步是什么  还有专门定制的团队T恤?
What's next,like,cheesy matching T-shirts?

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,140
没有啦
No.

69
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,040
Robin 那些连环杀手们 讲犯罪过程都比你快
Robin,I've had serial killers lead me to shallow graves faster than you're telling this story.

70
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,390
好啦!
Okay!

71
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,430
我是不能再跟Nora一起工作了
Look,it was getting impossible for me to be around Nora

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,150
所以 除掉Nora的机会来了...
so when an opportunity to get rid of her presented itself...

73
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,190
桑迪时间到!
It's Sandy time!

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
快围过来
Huddle up,gang.

75
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,920
两件事 第一  有人从我办公室偷了一瓶名贵的酒...
Two things: 1) Somebody stole a very expensive bottle of wine from my office...

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,490
第二 我需要有人去法国报导 八国集团峰会
2) I need a producer to cover the G8 Summit in France.

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,820
Nora可以的!
Nora will do it!

78
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,970
我知道虽然我是前辈 但是...
I mean,I know I have seniority,but...

79
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,240
我还是想问问Nora自己的意思
I was gonna ask Nora anyway.

80
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,890
Robin 谢谢你的支持
Thanks for the support,Robin.

81
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,770
这对我来说太重要了
This is huge for me.

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,260
Sandy 你确定?
Are,are you sure about this,Sandy?

83
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,050
我的确是个前辈
I do have seniority.

84
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,120
这我可以肯定
Oh,I'm sure.

85
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,060
Nora很迷人
Nora's amazing.

86
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,430
我想跟她上床
I want to have sex with her.

87
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,910
要先解决内心对Barney的醋意 而你老板都对她...
To deal with that rejection from Barney,not to mention your boss...

88
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,720
一定非常难受吧
must've really hurt.

89
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,820
我们为什么不研究一下这段情绪呢?
Why don't we dig into those emotions?

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,530
然后Marshall跟Lily去了 Sonya医生那儿...
So Marshall and Lily were at Dr. Sonya's office...

91
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,430
我对阴道的了解真是少的可怜
It's fascinating how profoundly little I know about vaginas.

92
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,040
请进
Come in.

93
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,760
Ted 你来这儿干什么?
Ted,what are you doing here?

94
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,320
我核对了这纸上的事情 这位" 医生" 说都没问题 但她却错了
I checked up on all the stuff this "doctor" says is okay,and she's wrong.

95
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,150
所以 为了孩子的健康 我来了
So,for the health of this baby,I'm stepping in.

96
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,920
- 听上去这个Ted该来看看心理医生了 - 哦 他的确得来
- Sounds like this Ted guy could benefit from some therapy. - Oh,he definitely could.

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,430
这简直不能接受
This is unacceptable.

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,370
对不起 我们得换个医生了
I'm sorry,we're gonna have to find a new doctor.

99
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,780
- 同志们 为了我们孩子的身体健康 - " 我们的" ?
Guys,for the health of our baby,Our?

100
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,340
我们得认真对待Lily吃进肚子里的东西
we have to get serious about what Lily is putting in her body.

101
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,650
说到这儿 当咱们生的时候 绝不能用麻药
Speaking of which,when we deliver,we won't be using any drugs.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,540
闪一边儿去!
Get out!

103
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,600
干嘛这样对我?
Why are you kicking me out?

104
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,950
因为你总是破坏我们的甜蜜时刻
Because you're always intruding on our intimate moments!

105
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,790
这就又像是回到大学一样!
This is like college all over again!

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,060
我去 你们也太能整了!
Man,you guys sure are messy!

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,150
到处都是衣服
There's clothes everywhere.

108
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,500
门把手上居然还有袜子!
There's even a sock on the door!

109
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,410
门把手挂袜子是公认的 " 我们需要独处空间" 的暗号好吗?
A sock on the door is a universal code for "We need some space."

110
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,650
我们不仅那时候需要 现在也需要!
We needed it back then,and we need it now.

111
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,670
得了吧!
Come on!

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,610
我们是三剑客啊!
We're a trio!

113
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,150
我们一直都是三剑客啊!
We've always been a trio!

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,570
我们就好像蝙蝠侠  罗宾还有那个老管家
We're right up there with Batman and Robin and Alfred.

115
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,850
滚!
Out!

116
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,280
罗密欧 朱丽叶还有那个药剂师
Romeo and Juliet and the Apothecary.

117
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,220
滚!
Now!

118
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,910
我们就像盐 胡椒还有孜然
Salt and Pepper and Cumin!

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,410
那边的小东西是来干嘛的?
What's that little guy up there do?

120
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,650
哦 可怜的孩子
Oh,you poor girl.

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,450
Robin!
Robin!

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,190
这些事都是一环扣一环的 我发誓
It all ties together,I swear.

123
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,330
然后 Nora就要去法国了
So,Nora was about to leave for France.

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,720
你知道吗 就在不久前 我还担心
You know,not too long ago,I would have been worried that

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,360
如果我把你留下的话 你的魂会被那些金发大波妹给勾走
if I left you alone,you'd be up to no good with some blond bimbo.

126
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,470
哦 我已经改过自新了
Oh,I've changed.

127
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,190
我知道 所以当我回来的时候
I know,which is why when I get back,it's gonna be the start of a new chapter for us.

128
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,690
咱俩的感情可以开启一个新篇章 只有我跟你 希望没有那条领带
A chapter of me and you and hopefully not that tie.

129
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,870
你说的对!
You got me!

130
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,560
一路顺风!
Have a nice trip!

131
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,840
Stinson医生吗?
Dr. Stinson?

132
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,480
我看了你的广告 我是来找你做免费缩胸咨询的
I saw your ad,and I'm here for my free breast-reduction consultation.

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,540
你觉着呢?
What do you think?

134
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,460
是不是太大了?
Are they too big?

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,890
我简直不敢相信 你还在勾搭那些胸大无脑的美女们!
I can't believe you're still running plays on dumb blondes!

136
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,670
我还以为你对Nora是认真的呢!
I thought you were serious about Nora!

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,350
我发誓我是认真的!
No,I've been good,I swear!

138
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,000
我只是忘了我的BDS
I just forgot about my BDSes.

139
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,790
BDS?
BDSes?

140
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,170
放荡女交付系统
Bimbo Delivery Systems.

141
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,880
你看 这么多年来 我一直致力于 开发一个精密的系统

I can't believe you go to so much trouble to get laid.

169
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,170
是啊 有时候我连澡都懒得洗、

170
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,950
妈妈就喜欢那股麝香味道

171
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,640
在Nora回来之前 我得把这些系统都抛掉

我帮你

174
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,660
我觉得你可以在那个小表格上写 "病人无私帮助需要帮助的朋友"
Maybe you should write on your little chart there: "Patient selflessly tried to help a friend in need."

175
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,380
首先 这是一个填字游戏

176
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,960
其次 你其实是打算在那三天 把Barney抢回来吧
Secondly,you were clearly planning on using those three days to steal Barney back.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,510
他是我朋友啊!
I am his friend!

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,450
你怎么能这么说呢!
How dare you!

179
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,260
去了哈佛你就觉得自己很聪明了是吧
God,you think you're so smart just because you went to Harvard

180
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
然后还去了普林斯顿大学 然后…
and then Princeton and then...

181
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,670
哇 又是哈佛
wow,Harvard again.

182
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,210
额 好吧 
Okay,yes,fine.

183
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,380
我…我确实是想把他抢回来
I was... I was trying to steal him back.

184
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,470
这是好现象
This is good.

185
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,050
你终于开始说你自己的事情了 而不是Marshall和Lily在干嘛干嘛
You're finally opening up and talking about yourself,not just what Marshall and Lily were up to.

186
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,450
噢没错 那个时候  Marshall和Lily在叠衣服
Oh,yeah,so Marshall and Lily were folding laundry...

187
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,960
我错了…
That one's my fault.

188
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,340
那个什么…
You know...

189
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,670
没事
Never mind.

190
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,120
那个…
It's just...

191
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,370
算了
Forget it.

192
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,800
Marshall 你是个爽快人
Marshall,you're a grown-ass man.

193
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,540
你要说什么你就直说好啦
If you want to say something,just say it.

194
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,090
我真心疼Ted
I feel bad for Ted!

195
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,510
要是我妈妈在这她一定会问我怎么了
And if my mom were here,she would ask me what was wrong.

196
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,850
你心疼Ted?
You feel bad for Ted?

197
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,050
他感觉自己就是个多余的人
It's tough feeling like the third wheel.

198
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,190
好吧 首先 我确信Ted没事的
Okay,first of all,I'm sure Ted's fine.

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,620
哪个加盐和胡椒的时候 不带上孜然啊
Who eats salt and pepper without cumin?

200
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,050
其次 Ted老是跟Sonya医生做对
Second,Ted is way off base coming after Dr.Sonya.

201
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,710
我们都喜欢她!对吧?
We love her! Right?

202
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,790
别跟我说你也开始怀疑Sonya医生了
Don't tell me you're doubting Dr. Sonya!

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
有那么一点点
Just a little bit.

204
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,890
那是啥?
What's that thing?

205
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,780
对有些女人来说 这只是我父母的骨灰
Well,for some women,it was the ashes of my parents.

206
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,120
还有些人觉得这是 从温布尔顿得来的战利品
For others,it was the trophy from Wimbledon.

207
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,210
但是对一个胸大无脑的人来说 这两项都是
And believe it or not,for one busty dullard,it was both.

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,030
玩乐 巨大的器官 对位
Game,enormous set,match.

209
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,410

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,230
港务局亲爱的Mitch
Port Authority Mitch.

213
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,670
每当有一个大眼睛的农村女孩 怀着对百老汇的梦想走下公共汽车
You'd always call me whenever a wide-eyed farm girl would get off the bus with big dreams of Broadway

214
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,480
对星探可能会让她做的是握还是舔 感到茫然无措的时候 你就会打给我
and no idea what a "casting director" could legally ask her to do,hold or lick during an audition.

215
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,360
不好意思啊 老朋友 你的服务已经没有人需要了
I'm sorry,old friend,your services are no longer needed.

I know,I know.

221
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,590
但是 你也知道我们要实行清单上写的

没事了
Okay?

224
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,540
对了 我想起来了 我当时干嘛 要打电话给发廊说"Jack Fantastic辞职了?"
Which reminds me,why am I calling a hair salon and saying,"Jack Fantastic is quitting"?

225
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,150
亲爱的 借用Maya Angelou一直 跟Oprah说的那句话
Sweetheart,it's like Maya Angelou keeps telling Oprah,and I keep telling you:

我把那张好莱坞的照片裁了
I cropped that Halloween photo.

233
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,260
现在只剩盐和胡椒了 看上去是不是很蠢
It's just salt and pepper,now,so it looks ridiculous.

234

Well,that's insane.

241
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,930
Marshall你觉不觉得这有点太早啦
It's way too early for that,right,Marshall?

但你要是不来上这个课
but if you don't come to this class...

248
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,160
我就不过性生活
I'm withholding sex.

249
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,600
我不觉得她会来诶
I don't think she's coming.

250

是啊
Yeah.

251

当她说坐另一辆出租车的时候 我就开始怀疑了
I was a little suspicious when she had us take separate cabs.

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,570

Lily,don't do it!

253
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,530
一点点没关系
Just a little bit.

254

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,420
你是个伙计 纯爷们!
You're a dude. You're a man.

287
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,410
嘿 你还可以再单身一晚
Hey,you are flying solo one more night.

288
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,170
我去打扮的性感热辣  你去穿件马甲把那根丑的要死的领带遮住
How about I put on a smokin' hot dress,you slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie

289
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,820
我们去狂欢作乐一番怎么样?
and we paint the town?

290
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,120
我们都多久没穿上凸现我们的性别的一身 出去狂闹烂醉了
I mean,when was the last time we got rip-roaring drunk in clothing that highlights our genders?

291
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,940
所以你的计划是穿的特别挑逗  去和别的女人的男人出去喝酒作乐?
So,your plan was to be out on the town,dressed provocatively,drinking with another woman's man.

292
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,100
Robin 这是我们第一次会诊  我知道这只是门诊建议 但...
Robin,this is our first session,and I know this is just one clinical opinion,but...

293
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,290
你真荡!
you a dawg!

294
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,760
是阿...
Yeah...

295
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,330
只有一个问题...
There was just one problem...

296
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,750
惊喜!
NORA: Surprise!

297
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,650
我提前回来了!
I got back early!

298
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,960
嘿!
Hey!

299
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,620
我来猜猜 你又趴在桌子底下喝多了
Let me guess,you got drunk under your desk again?

300
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,210
没有 哈佛先生
No,Mr. Harvard.

301
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,130
我这次处理的不太一样...
I handled things a little differently...

302
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,100
那么我想现在你要让我谈谈我当时的感受
So,I suppose now you want me to talk about how it felt

303
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,130
看着Barney和Nora一起离开 对不?
watching Barney and Nora walk off together,right?

304
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,290
我更想跳过直接谈骚扰事件
I'd rather just skip ahead to the assault.

305
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,140
我下一个病人觉得自己是上帝
My next patient thinks he's God.

306
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,950
万一他真的是对的呢 我可不想让他等太久
On the off chance that he's right,I really don't want to keep him waiting.

307
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,580
就在他们离开之后 发生了件疯狂的事
Well,right after they left,something crazy happened.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,270
打扰一下 你知道Barney Stinson在哪么?
Excuse me,do you know where I can find Barney Stinson?

309
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,490
他在地铁上见到过我 留下消息让我来这找他
He saw me on the subway and left me a message to meet him here.

310
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,760
为什么不重录一下?
Why not re-record it?

311
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,360
我录了一百来遍
I did like a hundred takes.

312
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,470
删不完了
It kept happening.

313
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,310
嗨 我知道这很疯狂 但我在地铁上见过你...
Hi,I know this is crazy,but I saw you on the subway...

314
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,720
他问我是否相信命运
He asked me if I believed in destiny.

315
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,610
我相信
And I do.

316
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,970
我们天生一对
We are so meant to be.

317
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,940
我怎么能找到他?
Where can I find him?

318
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,900
我陷入了道德上的两难境地
So I was faced with a moral dilemma.

319
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,970
把这个傻泡推给他们 或者做个好人 帮助我朋友
Unleash this nut bag on them or be a bigger person,and help my friend.

320
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,390
Barney在爱之咖啡店 75街和阿姆斯特丹大街路口 
Barney's at Café L'Amour,75th and Amsterdam.

321
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,610
太好了!
Awesome!

322
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,040
不 等等等!
No,wait,wait,wait!

323
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,570
好吧 这样不对
Okay,this isn't right.

324
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,270
衣扣再解开点 秀出事业线
Let's pop that top button,show off your gals.

325
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,350
祝你好运 去搞定他们!
Ooh! Good luck,go get 'em!

326
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,210
让你的爱传递到指尖
Let your love me through your fingers.

327
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,630
哥们 说好不哼哼 始终保持眼睛睁开
Dude,the rule is no moaning and keep your eyes open at all times.

328
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,410
别怪里怪气的
Stop being weird.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,910
嘿 什么时候轮到我做女的啊?
And hey,when do I get to be the woman?

330
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,360
记住 怀孕期间最重要的是让妈妈淡定愉快
Now remember,the most important thing in pregnancy is to keep Mom calm and happy.

331
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,460
她最知道自己需要什么了
She knows best what she needs.

332
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,100
相信她
Trust her.

333
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,580
现在 爸爸们 我需要你们握住妈妈们的手
Now,Papas,I want you to take Mom's hands in yours

334
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,390
深深地望着她的眼睛 跟我重复
look deep into her eyes,and repeat after me.

335
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,970
我相信你
I believe in you.

336
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,930
我相信你
I believe in you.

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,910
我敬仰你身体的智慧
I honor your body's wisdom.

338
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,840
我敬仰你身体的智慧
I honor your body's wisdom.

339
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,240
你的子宫是个神殿
Your womb is a temple.

340
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,990
- 你的子宫是 - 好了 我知道了!
- Your womb is a - Okay,I get it!

341
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,140
我们真不应该不听Lily的需要
I feel terrible we didn't listen to what Lily wanted!

342
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,130
我知道 我也是
I know,so do I.

343
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,210
事实是 我本以为我这会已经结婚了  和你们一起经历这些事情
The truth is,I thought I'd be married by now and going through all this stuff alongside you guys.

344
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,120
但就算我下一秒钟就遇到我的梦中情人 我还是要等一晚上加九个月才能有自己的家庭
But even if I meet the girl of my dreams right this second,I'm still one night and nine months away from having a family of my own.

345
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,060
还要假设我孩子的母亲是个荡妇的前提下
And that's assuming the mother of my children is just a huge slut.

346
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,030
不要放弃希望 Ted
Don't lose hope,Ted.

347
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,050
荡妇就在那
That slut is out there.

348
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,320
谢谢你兄弟
Thanks,buddy.

349
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,130
- 我们要向Lily道歉 - 对
- We owe Lily an apology. - Yeah.

350
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,030
爸爸们 现在我将要回答你们对阴道的所有问题
Dads,this is the time that I'll answer every question you've ever had about vaginas.

351
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,490
妈的!
Damn it!

352
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,680
嘿
Hey.

353
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,730
真对不起 Lily
I'm so sorry,Lily.

354
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,510
你可以就吃一点
You have just a little bit.

355
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,940
我意识到我的责任是 要让你在接下来的七个月保持开心 
I realize now that it's my job for the next seven months to keep you happy

356
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,880
所以...
and that's why...

357
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,240
所以性生活恢复了
I'm no longer withholding sex.

358
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,280
我的英雄
My hero.

359
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,880
但我需要你不要对Sonya医生感到别扭
But I want to make sure that you feel comfortable with Dr. Sonya,too.

360
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,580
不会 你知道么 其实她很淡定
I do. And you know what,the fact that she's so calm

361
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,970
很放松 或许不是坏事
and laid back,maybe that's not a bad thing.

362
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,530
也许这正是生产时我们需要的
Maybe that's exactly what we're gonna want in that delivery room.

363
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,820
Lily 你再不用力 我就把孩子推到你嗓子眼
Lily,if you don't push,I will shove this baby up your throat

364
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,090
从你嘴里拽出来!
and pull it out of your mouth!

365
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,240
Marshall尼玛的在哪?!
Where the hell is Marshall?!

366
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,040
那段故事可不得了 孩子们
That's a crazy story,kids.

367
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,350
我以后再说
I'll get to that.

368
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,550
嘿 Ted在门口呢
Hey,Ted's out in the hall.

369
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,300
他也想道歉
He wants to apologize,too.

370
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,680
嘿
Hey.

371
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,840
你的袜子呢?
What happened to your sock?

372
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,280
说来话长
Long story.

373
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,580
说到底 我认识到有时爱意味着要让步
Bottom line,I realized that sometimes love means taking a step back.

374
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,780
也不尽然
Well,not always.

375
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,620
我是说 有时候最好干涉一下搞点蓄意破坏对吧?
I mean,sometimes it's better to interfere and sabotage stuff,right?

376
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,210
我觉得如果你真在乎某人 应该让他们开心
Well,I think if you care about somebody,you should want them to be happy

377
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,380
即使要让自己置身事外
even if you wind up being left out.

378
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,160
哇
Wow.

379
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,400
你在Lily和Marshall那边的教训还真适合我的情况
The lesson you learned with Lily and Marshall is directly applicable to my situation

380
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,160
因此这也正是我最终处理这件事情的关键部分
and is therefore a valid part of how I'll eventually tell this story.

381
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,270
真的? 真是这样的?
Really? That's how that went down?

382
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,750
重点是 最终都联系到一起了对吧?
Point is,it all tied together,right?

383
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,600
根本没有
Not really at all.

384
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,330
我们能不能说骚扰部分了?
Can we just get to the assault?

385
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,340
敬我们!
To us!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Barney 是我!
Barney,it's me!

387
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,100
我爱你 Barney!
I love you,Barney!

388
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,050
扇贝看着不错
Mmm,scallops look good.

389
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,830
可不是么
Oh,they are.

390
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,680
不过上次我点的时候卖完了 所以...
But the last time I was here they ran out,so,uh...

391
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,830
祝...
knock...

392
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,590
好...
on...

393
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,830
运
wood.

394
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,900
我想要这个紫色的蛋糕做甜点
Well,I have my eye on the red velvet cake for dessert.

395
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,260
不错 AA制?
Lovely. Splitsies?

396
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,750
不 我来买单
Nah,I want it all to myself.

397
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,050
真的?
Really?

398
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,360
掰手腕决胜负?
Arm wrestle for it?

399
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,470
不!
No!

400
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,240
好吧
All right.

401
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,020
我喜欢这里
I love this place.

402
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,120
- 谢谢你 亲爱的 - 不客气 亲爱的
- Thank you,babe. - You're welcome. Babe.

403
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,030
Barney对这事一点都不知道
Barney doesn't know a thing about any of this.

404
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,810
但这也是为什么我要接受法院强制性治疗
But that's why I got court-mandated therapy.

405
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,530
你肯定觉得我很傻
You must think I'm nuts.

406
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,080
我觉得你真是个不错的朋友
I think you're a really good friend.

407
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,550
- 真的? - 真的
- Really? - Really.

408
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,650
在我看来这起骚扰事件中没有任何犯罪倾向
As far as I'm concerned,there was no criminal inte to this assault.

409
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,900
谢谢 医生
Well,thanks,Doc!

410
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,880
看我们啊!
Well,look at us!

411
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,870
我们一期治疗就解决了
We got this wrapped up in one session.

412
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,350
干得好 对吧?
Go us,right?

413
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,590
现在我们谈谈你撬法官车锁的事情
Now let's discuss how you keyed the judge's car.

414
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,060
好吧 嗯...
Okay. Um...

415
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,090
事情是这样的
Here's how it happened

416
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,090
Marshall和Lily本来要去动物园
Marshall and Lily were supposed to go to the zoo

417
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,490
都会联系到一起的 我保证
okay,it all ties together,I swear.

418
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,750
现在...
Now...
