1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,300
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,900
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,900
By something impossible.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,200
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,800
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,500
And find others like me.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,900
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,200
Mom!

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,900
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500
The night we trapped
the Reverse-Flash

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,100
In the force field,
there's no reason

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,900
That the containment system
should have failed.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,600
- I've been having these dreams.
- What happens in the dream?

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,700
And he kills me.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,800
If this is Dr. Wells,

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Then who have we been working
for this whole time?

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
A completely different person.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Oh, my god.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,100
What the frack?

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
"Flash missing.
Vanishes in crisis."

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
"after an epic street battle
with the Reverse-Flash,

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
"our city's
very own scarlet speedster

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,300
Disappeared in an explosion
of light."

30
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Barry, look at the date.

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,900
April 25th, 2024.

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,300
Guys, when I fought
the Reverse-Flash at christmas,

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,700
He said that we'd be fighting
for centuries.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Wait, you can't really think
that this is from...

35
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,900
The future.

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,100
That would means Dr. Wells,
or whoever he is, is also...

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,900
From the future.

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,200
I have to say,
I'm really digging

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,900
The brighter red suit.

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,400
And the white
on the symbol?

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,700
That's dope.

42
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
Wait a second.

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,300
Suppose we now change
the color on your suit.

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,200
Will it be because we got
the idea from this picture?

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,400
That would mean
we're living in a causal nexus.

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
This... wow.

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,900
This is so trippy.

48
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,100
Like, Marty and the Polaroid
trippy.

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,800
Not as trippy as the name
on the byline.

50
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,500
Iris West-Allen?

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
Mazel Tov?

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Hebrew.

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Ancient language
of the Jewish people.

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Uh-uh.
What the hell was that?

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Is someone here?

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello?

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Good evening,
Barry Allen.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
Uh...

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
H-Hi.

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,700
- You know who I am?
- Of course.

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,200
Barry Allen,
Director of Central City Police,

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
CSI division.

63
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Director?

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
I guess
you get a promotion.

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Also known as The Flash.

66
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Founding member of...

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
What are you?

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,800
I am Gideon,

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,500
An interactive
artificial consciousness.

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Ai.

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,100
Sick.

72
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,600
You know Dr. Wells?

73
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,500
Yes.

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,600
Do you know who he really is?

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
I don't understand the question.

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,900
I...I mean,
what is he doing here?

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,900
W-why did he come here?

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
To kill you.

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
Wells is in the building.

80
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
What?
How do you know that?

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,100
I put a tracker
on his wheelchair.

82
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,700
Which, if we're wrong about him
and he is paralyzed,

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to hell
for that one.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
He's in the cortex.

85
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,300
Ask questions fast.

86
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,700
Why did he kill Nora Allen?

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,800
Because he was angry.

88
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
About what?

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,300
That you escaped.

90
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,500
He's on B level.
He's coming this way.

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,200
What does he want from me?

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,700
For you to be the Flash.

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,800
Maybe that's why wells let

94
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,200
The Particle Accelerator
Explode,

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,800
So that you could become
the Flash.

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,700
Why?
I mean, for what reason?

97
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,400
Guys, we got to go.
He's almost here.

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,700
- Hurry.
- All right.

99
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,900
Wait a second.
Wait.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
What if Hal over there tells
Wells that we were in here?

101
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
That would be bad.

102
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
If I can get into
its operating system,

103
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe I can disable
its memory core.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,100
Gideon, can you show us where
your operating system is?

105
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,700
Certainly.

106
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,100
Yeah.
Nope.

107
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
That's not gonna happen.

108
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,900
Guys, he's in
the corridor.

109
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
Gideon, could you just,
like,

110
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,000
Not tell him that we were here?

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Of course.

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
I will accept any command
given to me by you.

113
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
- Barry.
- Come on.

114
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
- We got to get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,500
Why would you accept
my commands?

116
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,400
Because you created me.

117
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Good evening, Gideon.

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Is everything all right?

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Everything is fine.

121
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Eddie.

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
- Thank you.
- What's the emergency?

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,100
Oh, no emergency.

124
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,800
I just wanted to,
you know, talk to you...

125
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Thanks.

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,900
Without Iris around

127
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Or Barry around

128
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,000
Or Cisco around
or Caitlin around.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,500
So, in other words,
you want to talk to me alone.

130
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,200
What is it?

131
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,700
Right.

132
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,000
Um, so listen.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,100
With everything going on...

134
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,200
Investigating Wells
and finding out about Barry...

135
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,100
Eddie, you cannot tell Iris
about Barry.

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,200
This isn't about Barry.

137
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,000
I know the timing
might seem off, you know,

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,100
With everything
that's going on,

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,100
But I want to propose to iris,

140
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,100
And I'd like your blessing.

141
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,700
No.

142
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,000
Come again?

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,300
No.

144
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,700
You do not have my blessing.

145
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
That's Barry.
We got to go.

146
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,300
Joe, I only asked
as a courtesy,

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Out of respect.

148
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,600
I don't need your permission.

149
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
Really?

150
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,100
For three very smart people,

151
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
That was really stupid.

152
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,100
What if wells had caught you
in that...

153
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,600
- Time vault.
- Thank you.

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,500
Okay, I know we've seen
a lot this past year,

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,600
But time travel?

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,900
I did it.

157
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
- Or I will do it, I mean.
- Excuse me?

158
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,100
One of the two speedsters
in Barry's house

159
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,400
The night his mother died
was Barry.

160
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,600
I mean, The Flash.
He was there.

161
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,500
Which means that one day
in the future,

162
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,300
Barry will travel back in time
to that night.

163
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,600
Okay.

164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,500
Actually, I wasn't talking
about that.

165
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,000
I kind of already
time traveled.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
- By accident.
- What?

167
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,300
I was running to
try and stop a Tsunami

168
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
From hitting the city...

169
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
When was that?

170
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
A few weeks ago.

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,700
Right before you started
getting those dreams.

172
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,200
Oh, you mean the ones
where Wells uses

173
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,700
His super-speeding hand
to shred apart my heart?

174
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,500
- Those?
- Yes, right.

175
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,300
So, what if they're not dreams?

176
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,500
What else could they be?

177
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,600
Memories.

178
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm not following.

179
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
All right, what if, that day,
Cisco found out

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,300
That Wells is the Reverse-Flash,
and then Wells killed him?

181
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,800
But when I ran back a day,

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
I changed the timeline
so that event never happened.

183
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,400
If it never happened,
how can Cisco remember it?

184
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
I don't know.
I don't know.

185
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I think the important thing is,
he does.

186
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,900
Guys, I think
I've got a really bad idea.

187
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,000
Dad, it's been three weeks.
You barely eat or sleep.

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
You should probably go home
at some point.

189
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

190
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
I'll go home when Barry does.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Help!
My son's coding.

193
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
They said he was stable.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Barry.

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
- Oh, my god.
- I need the room.

196
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,800
Just go.
I need the room.

197
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
How can he be seizing?

198
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,100
He has no heart rhythm.

199
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,700
- Starting compressions.
- Epi push. Epi.

200
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,100
They can't save him.

201
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,500
But I can.

202
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,200
I know who you are.

203
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
You're that scientist
that Barry's obsessed with,

204
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,800
The one who blew a hole
in the city.

205
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Harrison Wells,
and interestingly enough,

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,000
My facility is the very place
I would like to take him.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,700
You're out of your mind.

208
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
I'm not gonna try and
convince you with promises.

209
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,000
But, detective,
give me a chance.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
I think we already know
what you're capable of, doctor.

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
You hurt a lot of people
that night.

212
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,500
So those doctors in there,
they're good enough?

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
The best in the city,
best in the country.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Look at them.

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,100
They have no clue
what's going on.

216
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,800
They're baffled,
and the reason for that is

217
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
What's happening
inside Barry is a mystery,

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
And they don't have
the tools to solve it.

219
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,900
- But you do?
- That's right.

220
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,500
Millions of people

221
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,200
Used to look at my lab,
and what did they see?

222
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,200
They saw the future.

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Well, let me take
that technology,

224
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Let me take that know-how
into ensuring

225
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,100
That your son
actually does have a future.

226
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,800
Detective.

227
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
Let me save him.

228
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,300
- Hand me the paddles.
- Starting compressions.

229
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,400
Then save him.

230
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Charge.
200. Pads.

231
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,700
Joe?

232
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,000
Joe, are you listening?

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah.

234
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,400
We... we have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

235
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,500
Somewhere in his subconscious
is the key.

236
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,700
The key to what now?

237
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
Getting my dad out of prison.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,200
And how are we going to do that?

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,500
We're gonna get Wells to confess
to killing my mom.

240
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,400
So, this will allow Cisco
to see into his dream?

241
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
I got the idea
from a journal article

242
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,300
On Lucid dream therapy.

243
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
They think it can be used
to help people

244
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,800
Suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

245
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,300
Traumatized, stressed?

246
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,700
Check and check.

247
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,400
The theory is that
it will allow people

248
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,900
To objectively enter
their dreams

249
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,700
And face their fears.

250
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Still working on
the talking part.

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,300
And you're sure this thing
isn't gonna, you know,

252
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Mess with my brain?

253
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh, the amount of electricity
required

254
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
To trigger Lucid dreaming
is harmless.

255
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Probably.

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Who's going to be
Lucid dreaming?

257
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Um...

258
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,500
With all of the meta-humans
in Central City,

259
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,700
People have been seeing
some strange things...

260
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Things that
they don't understand.

261
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
And it's really just
a matter of time

262
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Before psychological issues
develop.

263
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
And Lucid dreaming will help
the doctors

264
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,700
Better understand their fears.

265
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,200
Intriguing.

266
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,700
Of course, you still need to
guide the patient

267
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
From the outside, right?

268
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,900
Direct them to
specific aspects of the dream.

269
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
We're still working
on a communications interface.

270
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,300
When we dream,

271
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,700
The middle brain lights up
with electrical activity,

272
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,200
Whereas the higher brain
remains dormant.

273
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Once we find a way to make
both parts of the brain active,

274
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,400
Then it's just a matter of
finding the frequency

275
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
That will stimulate
the language center.

276
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Then the dreamer could speak.

277
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
He could describe his dream.

278
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,100
- Exactly.
- Or her dream.

279
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,500
It could be used for anyone.

280
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Right, it's not gender specific.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,300
I would try a frequency of
45 hertz to start.

282
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,600
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,100
Well, you never cease to
impress me, Caitlin.

284
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
- Allen.
- Hey.

285
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,800
The owens case.

286
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm still waiting
on the fiber evidence

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,100
And the ballistics report.

288
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,900
Are you on vacation
or something?

289
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,500
- No, I'm so sorry, I've just...

290
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
I've been distracted
by another case.

291
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Which is no excuse,
I just...

292
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Okay, just get me the reports
when you can.

293
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
There's... there's no rush.

294
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,700
All right.
Uh, Captain?

295
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,000
Is everything okay?

296
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Yeah, since Rob and I
have been planning the,

297
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
You know, wedding,
between the florist

298
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,900
And the hundreds of kinds
of cake filling

299
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,000
And who can sit next to who...

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Never get married, Allen.

301
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Right.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
- Oh.
- Iris.

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
- Barry.
- Hey.

304
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,400
Are you okay?

305
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Yeah. No. Yes.

306
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
That was...
That was just really weird.

307
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Captain Singh was
nice to me.

308
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, well, he's in a good mood.

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,100
He's about to get married.

310
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Lucky him.
Yeah, I know, it's...

311
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh, hey,
can I talk to you in private?

312
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
It's... it's kind of work-related.

313
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,900
Okay, yeah,
now's not a great time.

314
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,500
- I'm sorry, I've got...
- Hi, beautiful.

315
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Hi.

316
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,700
Barry, can I grab you
for a second?

317
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Absolutely.
Yeah.

318
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay, well, can you call me
when you're done?

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
It's... it's really important.

320
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

321
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,200
What's up?

322
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Oh.
O-okay.

323
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,700
W-what did she say?

324
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,400
Or, wait, you still have it, so,
duh, you haven't asked her yet.

325
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Or you did ask her,
and she said...

326
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
- I was gonna propose tonight.
- All right.

327
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,400
But I went to joe
to ask for his blessing.

328
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
- He said no.
- He did? He...

329
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,300
- Repeatedly.
- Uh, weird.

330
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,200
I need you to talk to him,
find out why.

331
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,400
Uh, Eddie...

332
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,100
Look, I know me
asking you like this,

333
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
It's a little awkward.

334
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah.

335
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
But you know how heartbroken
she's gonna be

336
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,300
If she finds out
that Joe's not on board.

337
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.

338
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
Yeah, I'll talk to him, man.

339
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate it so much.

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
- Yeah.
- And so will

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The future
Mrs. Thawne.

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Iris Thawne.

343
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Sounds pretty good, huh?

344
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I have a feeling
she's gonna want to hyphenate.

345
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Okay, can we go over this
one more time?

346
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Yeah, you put the glasses on,
fall asleep, and start dreaming.

347
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,300
Not that hard.

348
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Yeah, except I'm pretty sure
I die in this dream.

349
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,900
If I go back into it,
am I gonna die in real life?

350
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
I mean, what are
we talking about here?

351
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,800
<i>Is this inception
or dreamscape?</i>

352
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Here.
Drink this.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
- What, am I five?
- Just drink it.

354
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Okay, I'll drink it.

355
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,900
You're gonna be fine, Cisco.

356
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,200
Mm.

357
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,100
Okay.

358
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,400
The glasses are emitting
a Low-Level Delta Wave

359
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Which should help you
fall asleep.

360
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,700
Okay.

361
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,100
I got to warn you, though,

362
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
Usually it takes me
a long time.

363
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
I mean...

364
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,100
I'm not saying I'm, like...

365
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,500
An insomniac or any...

366
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,800
Ah, so that's how you get him
to shut up.

367
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,600
He's entering rem.

368
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
It's working.

369
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,300
Cisco.

370
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,500
Can you hear me?

371
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,600
You're dreaming, bud.

372
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,300
Okay, I will take Dr. West
to jitters

373
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
So you do whatever it is
you want to do.

374
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Whoa.

375
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Guys, this is mad freaky.

376
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay, um, where are you?

377
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Um, in the cortex.

378
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,100
I mean, I know I'm just dreaming
that I'm in the cortex,

379
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
But it feels so real.

380
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,000
What is dream you doing?

381
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Caitlin just left.

382
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,700
I asked her to
take Wells to jitters.

383
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,800
Why... why do you want Wells
out of the lab?

384
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,100
I think he might have
tampered with my work.

385
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
I need to check.

386
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

387
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,900
Okay, I'm walking to the bunker.

388
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh, man, I love this shirt.

389
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,600
I thought the dryer ate it.

390
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Focus, Cisco.

391
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,300
Okay, okay.

392
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
All right.

393
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,000
Now I'm running tests
on the containment system.

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,300
This data...
It doesn't make any sense.

395
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,900
All the supercapacitors...

396
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
They were all still
fully charged.

397
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,000
There's absolutely no reason
that the man in yellow

398
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,300
Should have escaped.

399
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,900
Oh, my god.

400
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,900
It was just a hologram.

401
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,000
He tricked us.

402
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
Hello, Cisco.

403
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, god, Wells is here.

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,900
Cisco, it's just a dream.
He can't hurt you.

405
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,400
You better be right
about that.

406
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,900
My name is Eobard Thawne.

407
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,400
Eobard Thawne.

408
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,500
Thawne?
Like Eddie Thawne?

409
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,300
You killed Nora Allen.

410
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,900
It was never my intention.

411
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
Nora?
What about my mom?

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
- He's confessing.
- Cisco?

413
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,500
He... he didn't want to kill her.

414
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,600
It was you, Barry.

415
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
He was trying to
kill you.

416
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Guys, he's losing
higher brain function.

417
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Cisco, you're gonna be okay.

418
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,700
It's just a dream.
You're gonna be okay.

419
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,200
I have grown quite fond of you,
Cisco.

420
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,300
His hand...
It's vibrating.

421
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,700
- He's gonna have a stroke.
- Get him out of there!

422
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,500
In many ways,

423
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
You've shown me
what it's like...

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,600
- Help me.
- Caitlin.

425
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,700
Help me, please!

426
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
To have a son.

427
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Help me!

428
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,100
Aah!

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
You're okay.

430
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
It was just a dream.
You're okay.

431
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Oh, god.

432
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
It felt so real.

433
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,300
- Barry?
- My mom.

434
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,200
That's why it's my fault.

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hello?

436
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,300
Where are you?

437
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
Barry.

438
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
Barry, are you there?

439
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Dr. Wells.

440
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah.
It's... sorry, yeah.

441
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,600
It's... it's a bad connection
right now.

442
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,100
Where have you been?

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
Uh, we're...
Why? What's going on?

444
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
A fire.

445
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,400
A huge fire just erupted.

446
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
A fire?
Where?

447
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
New Brighton.

448
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
Bradford tower high-rise.

449
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
I know that building.

450
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,500
That's where Captain Singh's
fiance works.

451
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,900
On my way.

452
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,700
Now move it!
Go!

453
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Get those hoses up.
Move!

454
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,900
And tell dispatch we need

455
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,200
As many tankers
as this city has.

456
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
- What floor?
- 21st.

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,900
My god.
That's where Rob works.

458
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Please hurry.

459
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,400
Over here!

460
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Dr. Wells, the sprinklers...

461
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
They're not working.

462
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
I see that.

463
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,800
Just get everyone
out of there, Barry.

464
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,500
No, I can't.
I can't save them all.

465
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Dr. Wells, please, what do I do?

466
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,300
You create a vacuum.

467
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,200
Rotate your arms
at super-speed.

468
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
That'll create a wind funnel

469
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,700
That will suck the air
right out of the room.

470
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,900
It's making it worse!

471
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,100
Barry, listen to me.

472
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,900
You need to move
your arms faster.

473
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,200
I believe in you, Barry.

474
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Rob.

475
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm okay.
It's okay.

476
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,000
I thought I lost you.

477
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Medic!

478
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,600
Mr. Allen.

479
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,000
Tonight, at the fire,

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,300
I saw hesitation.

481
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,000
I saw you doubting yourself.

482
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,900
Why is that?

483
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I don't know.

484
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,400
Uh, I guess I was afraid

485
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
I couldn't save everyone.

486
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,900
Right.

487
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,300
But if there is anything
that I have learned

488
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,900
In our time together, Barry,

489
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,300
It is that the only thing
standing in the way of you

490
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,900
Achieving every goal
that you set for yourself

491
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,400
Is you.

492
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,800
There is no limit
to how strong you will get

493
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,700
Or how fast you will go.

494
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,000
Everything that you need,

495
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
You already have.

496
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,500
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

497
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,700
You know,

498
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,200
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

499
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
I feel the same way about you.

500
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,100
It's so strange.

501
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,900
I mean, I look at him now,

502
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,100
And I know that he killed my mom
and he sent my dad to jail,

503
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,800
But, I mean,
sometimes he's just so kind

504
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,400
In the moment,
I actually like him.

505
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
But you never did.

506
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,300
- No.
- No.

507
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Well, at least now
we know how to trap him.

508
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,400
In Cisco's dream,
he confessed to everything.

509
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
If we can just recreate
those conditions,

510
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
He'll do it again.

511
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,800
Man, Barr.

512
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
Taking down bad guys,
pulling confessions.

513
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,700
I'm the cop.

514
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm the one that's supposed
to be doing this.

515
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,600
Look, if we're gonna get him
to confess,

516
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,100
It has to be with someone
that he truly trusts,

517
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,000
Someone that he'll genuinely
let his guard down with.

518
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,500
He thinks of Cisco as a son.

519
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,900
Well, then we need to do
a better job protecting him

520
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,600
Than I did protecting you.

521
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm not sure
what that means.

522
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,900
Barry,
this is all because of me.

523
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,500
No.

524
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,400
I never should've let Wells
take you from that hospital.

525
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
None of this would've
ever happened.

526
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,300
If you hadn't let him take me,
I would be dead, for sure.

527
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,000
But even then,
I knew something wasn't right.

528
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
Everything in my gut
was telling me not to trust him,

529
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,600
But I did,

530
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,800
Because I was so desperate
to see you okay.

531
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,300
Joe, this isn't your fault.

532
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,100
It's not your fault.

533
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,000
Look, every bad thing
that has happened to us...

534
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,300
All of it...
It was him.

535
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,800
And now he's gonna pay for it.

536
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
So, Wells set up a fake showdown

537
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,700
With a fake opponent
who was never really there?

538
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,900
He figured if we saw
both of them together

539
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,100
It would prove that he wasn't
the man in yellow.

540
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,900
This all just keeps getting
crazier and crazier.

541
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,100
I just talked to Dr. Wells.

542
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,700
He's attending
a lecture downtown,

543
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,000
Won't be back until 5:00.

544
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
All right, Cisco,
you know when he gets here

545
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,900
You need to be working
on the trap

546
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,500
So he sees you set off
the hologram.

547
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,700
Hold on,
isn't that, in your dream,

548
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
When everything went all...

549
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Kali Ma.
Temple of doom.

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,300
Yeah, that definitely happened.

551
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,600
But this time,
I'm ready for him.

552
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
I originally designed
the force field

553
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,100
To keep a speedster
from getting out.

554
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,500
But I've reversed it.

555
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,800
Now it won't let one in.

556
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,500
Back up.

557
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Barry, are you okay?

558
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,600
Ah.

559
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,900
It works.

560
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Okay,
as long as I'm inside,

561
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,500
Wells won't be able
to get near me.

562
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
And I will be in the cortex

563
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,300
Watching and recording
everything that happens.

564
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,100
And as soon as we get
the confession we need

565
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,400
To free my dad,
I'm moving in.

566
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
So what do I do?

567
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,900
Wells also threatened iris,

568
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,100
So if something
goes wrong here,

569
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,400
We need you to keep an eye
on her

570
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Until wells is neutralized.

571
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,300
I'll always keep iris safe,
Joe.

572
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,600
- What?
- Come here.

573
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,000
So, um, Eddie told me
what happened,

574
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
That you kiboshed
his proposal.

575
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,200
That was supposed to be
between him and me.

576
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
I so agree with that.

577
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
And I... and I know that we have
a lot going on right now,

578
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
And I should definitely be
the last person

579
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Pleading Eddie's case,
but I don't get it, Joe.

580
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Why did you say no?

581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
Because if Eddie
proposes to Iris,

582
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,700
She's gonna get caught up
in the moment and the romance,

583
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,200
And she's gonna say yes.

584
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
What's wrong with that?

585
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,700
Again, I don't know
why I'm saying this.

586
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
Because one day
she's gonna wake up and realize

587
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,500
She married the wrong guy.

588
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,600
But she'll stay anyway
because she made a promise.

589
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,100
I don't want
that kind of life for her.

590
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,800
Or him.

591
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,600
She's got feelings for you,
Barry.

592
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,300
She may not know how to deal
with those feelings right now,

593
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,600
But I know her.

594
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,700
They're there.
Always have been.

595
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,200
You know that, too.

596
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,900
Speaking of,
Iris just sent me a 911 text.

597
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,700
I'll be right back.

598
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,300
Like I said.

599
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

600
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
What's going on?

601
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
Look, Barry, I know
it's not a good time.

602
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,700
I mean, lately, it never seems
to be a good time,

603
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,500
But I need you to listen to me
right now.

604
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,300
Like... like, really
listen to me.

605
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Of course.
Yeah.

606
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,400
Whatever you need to tell me,
I'm listening.

607
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
Okay, I mean,
I know this is gonna sound

608
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,300
Really crazy at first,
but...

609
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,400
Everything strange that's been
going on in Central City,

610
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
It all goes back to
that night.

611
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,100
The night that the particle
accelerator exploded.

612
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,300
I have gone through
every bit of information

613
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,100
That I've collected
since I started my blog...

614
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,000
Every tip, every rumor,
every strange sighting.

615
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,100
Nothing predates the explosion.

616
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Whatever was released
into the atmosphere that night,

617
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
I think
it changed people...

618
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,000
Caused them to have powers.

619
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,600
And I think that
S.T.A.R. Labs knew about it.

620
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,500
I think the burning man
worked there,

621
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,900
And I think that that's how
the Flash got his powers too.

622
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,900
- Uh...
- So what do you think?

623
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,700
I...

624
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,900
I don't know.
I mean, it's... it's interesting.

625
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,300
Yeah, it's interesting.

626
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,700
It's... there's... there's just...

627
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,400
A big hole
in your theory.

628
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,500
Um, you know...

629
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,900
I was affected by whatever was
released by the explosion,

630
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,900
And I don't have any powers.

631
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,000
- Obviously.
- Right, yeah.

632
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,300
Look, I mean, I know that it's...
It's really mind-blowing.

633
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,500
I mean, I haven't even talked to
Eddie about it yet, but...

634
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Yeah, you and Eddie...
How are...

635
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,400
Everything's okay
with you and Eddie?

636
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Uh, sure.
Sure.

637
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah, we're great.
Why?

638
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,700
Uh, I...
Yeah, okay, look.

639
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,800
I'm gonna... let me read over
all of this stuff,

640
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,500
And we'll definitely
talk about it later.

641
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I promise.

642
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,400
Just... I mean, this is crazy.

643
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah, okay, just let me
just go through it,

644
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,800
And we'll talk later,
all right?

645
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,300
Okay.

646
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,700
Hey, Barry.

647
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,600
It's Iris.

648
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,500
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I hope you can,

649
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,600
Because I really, really
need you to wake up.

650
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,200
Like, the other day,

651
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
Detective pretty boy
came into jitters,

652
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,300
And he asked me out,
and I actually said yes.

653
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,400
See, I do dumb things like that
when you're not around.

654
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,500
And the house is really
quiet without you.

655
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,100
I know that the reason
that you came to live with us

656
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,200
Was awful.

657
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,500
But Barry,

658
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,100
You made it a home again.

659
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,000
You made us a family again.

660
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We need you.

661
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,200
I need you.

662
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,900
Hello, Dr. Wells.

663
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
How was your lecture?

664
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,400
Oh, boring, tedious.

665
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Platitudinous?

666
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,900
Couldn't have said it better
myself.

667
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,500
Um, where...
Where's Cisco?

668
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Uh, he is in the bunker.

669
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,200
He thinks he finally figured out
what went wrong at christmas.

670
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,800
You know, when we were trying
to catch the Reverse-Flash?

671
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,300
Yes, I remember that night.

672
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,700
Well, did he say
what he's found?

673
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,500
Nope,
just that it was important.

674
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,800
Hmm.

675
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,400
Good for Cisco.

676
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Um... Okay.

677
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
Well, maybe
I'll wheel on down there,

678
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
See what he's got.

679
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,100
Okay.

680
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,100
Here he comes.

681
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,600
Hello, Cisco.

682
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
You've been busy.

683
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,400
You really are
incredibly clever, Cisco.

684
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I've always said it.

685
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
You're him.

686
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,700
The Reverse-Flash.

687
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,000
Joe was right this whole time,
wasn't he?

688
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Good ol' Joe.

689
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Joe West had his doubts
all along.

690
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,800
Even from that first night
in the hospital,

691
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,700
Joe knew
something wasn't right.

692
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,200
Cops... as inconvenient now

693
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,700
As they will be
in a hundred years.

694
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,600
Come on, Cisco.
We need a confession.

695
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,900
You killed Barry's mother.

696
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,400
I want to know why.

697
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
It was never my intention
to kill Nora.

698
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,200
But from my perspective,

699
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
She was already dead.

700
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,700
It just happened sooner
than it was supposed to.

701
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,700
No.
That's not an admission.

702
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,900
Oops.

703
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,500
You're not gonna get away
with this.

704
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm not gonna get away
with it?

705
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, you're smart.

706
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,300
You're smart, Cisco.

707
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,600
But you're not that smart.

708
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,900
Cisco!

709
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,100
No!

710
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,700
He didn't confess.

711
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,500
Cisco, are you okay?

712
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,800
Yeah.

713
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm never ever gonna sleep
ever again,

714
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,300
But, yeah, I'm okay.

715
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,500
He's dead.

716
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,600
He didn't confess.

717
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Joe, this was it.

718
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,900
My dad's gonna be in prison
forever.

719
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
Barry, I'm sorry.

720
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Hey, uh...

721
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,700
Whoa.

722
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
What the hell?

723
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I told you this before.

724
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,600
I am always
one step ahead... Flash.

725
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,100
Allow me
to reintroduce to you

726
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Mr. Hannibal Bates

727
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,800
And his incredible ability
to transform

728
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,500
Into any person he touches.

729
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
I knew that ability
would come in handy.

730
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,300
I did not expect it
to come in handy this soon.

731
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,100
You used him!

732
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,300
Like you used all of us!

733
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,100
Well, he served a purpose.

734
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,500
Didn't take much convincing.

735
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,100
Just the simple promise
of his freedom.

736
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,900
You ruined my life!
All our lives!

737
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,400
We stood by you
after everything that happened.

738
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,300
I can see how this must be
difficult for you to understand,

739
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,100
But trust me,

740
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,600
Your lives now
are so much better

741
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Because of what
I have done for you.

742
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,500
You don't have to
hide anymore.

743
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,800
We know you're not
Harrison Wells.

744
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,100
Just tell us who you are.

745
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,400
A confession
will get you nowhere.

746
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,200
You've seen who I am.

747
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
You know what I can do.

748
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,600
You want to kill me, go ahead.

749
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm not gonna fight you.

750
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
But just tell the police
what you did.

751
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
Get my dad out of prison.

752
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
I don't want to kill you, Barry.

753
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I need you.

754
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
And...

755
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
I also did not anticipate,

756
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,300
As difficult as the past
15 years have been for me,

757
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,800
How much I would come
to love working with you.

758
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,400
With all of you.

759
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,000
And yet, that does not change
what needs to happen.

760
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Then face me now!

761
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, we will face each other
again.

762
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I promise you.
Soon.

763
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,300
Very, very soon.

764
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,500
He's in the time vault!

765
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Barry!

766
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,800
It was all a set-up.

767
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,300
We thought we set
a trap for him,

768
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
But he set a trap for us.

769
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,500
Oh, my god.

770
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,900
Iris.

771
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
We have to find Iris.

772
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,500
- Why?
- Wells.

773
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,000
He's been watching
all of us.

774
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,900
He has surveillance footage
set up everywhere.

775
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Our homes, my lab
at the police station,

776
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,600
Central City picture news.

777
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
Cisco, call me
when you have a location.

778
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,800
I am very much enjoying
this stroll.

779
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
We needed a good stroll.

780
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah.

781
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

782
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,100
Um...

783
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, it's my dad.

784
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Could you call him back later?

785
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,400
Sure.

786
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
What's going on?

787
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Iris, this week,
when I was arrested

788
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,200
And it looked bad,

789
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
You never wavered.

790
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,600
You never lost faith in me.

791
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Impossible.

792
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,400
And even though we've been
through some rough times,

793
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
I've never lost faith in us.

794
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,500
Iris West.

795
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,000
Eddie?

796
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Eddie!

797
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,600
Bad timing, Detective.

798
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,400
Stop!
Leave him alone!

799
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,800
Iris, no!

800
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,300
I know who you are.

801
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
You killed Barry's mom.

802
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
But you don't have to hurt
anyone else.

803
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,800
Hey, Iris.

804
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,900
It's okay.
It's me.

805
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,300
He took him.

806
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,600
The man in yellow,
he took Eddie.

807
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,500
I promise I will find him,
okay?

808
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,700
What is happening?

809
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,800
Listen to me.
You go home.

810
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,900
Don't say anything to anyone.

811
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,400
I swear to you, I will
bring him back, all right?

812
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,800
Wait, stop.

813
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
Barry?

814
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,800
You might as well take
that mask off.

815
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,300
I know it's you, Wells.
Or whoever you really are.

816
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:23,700
Well, allow to
to introduce myself.

817
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,700
My name is Eobard.

818
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,200
Eobard Thawne.

819
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,100
I don't understand.

820
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,200
Why do you have my name?

821
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,900
Why?

822
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,800
Well, 'cause we're family,
Eddie.

823
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

824
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,100
That is funny.

825
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,700
And the reason for that

826
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,600
Is because as far as
those guest lists are concerned,

827
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I haven't been born yet.

828
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,700
So that's why you didn't kill me
that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?

829
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,500
This whole thing...

830
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,700
It's been about me?

831
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,400
Not a chance.

832
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,100
You, my friend,

833
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,200
Are simply my insurance.

834
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,600
You look so young.

835
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,000
And I could kill you

836
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,300
Right now so easy.

837
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,000
What I wouldn't have given...

838
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,000
All those times before
to have had you like this.

839
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,900
So...

840
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,400
Helpless.

841
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,900
But fate,

842
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,100
It's tricky, isn't it?

843
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
I come here to destroy you...

844
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,700
And then to get home,
I have to be the one

845
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,400
Who creates you.

846
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,900
But I will say,

847
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,300
It's been an education...

848
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
Watching you grow up
all these years.

849
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,700
Science fairs
and soccer games.

850
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,400
No hint, no sign,

851
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,300
No trace of the man
you will be one day

852
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,800
For whom I have
nothing but hate.

853
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,100
And to be clear,

854
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Nothing is forgiven.

855
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,900
There will be a reckoning.

856
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,700
I promise you, Barry Allen,

857
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,500
That you will die.

858
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,500
Greg, move your head.
