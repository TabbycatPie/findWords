00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,800
相信爸妈看到我们送上的
I’m sure how mom and dad are surprised

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,640
结婚纪念日早餐一定会十分惊喜 
by the anniversary breakfast we’re bringing to them.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,750
我不想走进去看到他们两个光溜溜的
I hate to walk in if they are naked.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,070
是啊  即便几年过去  每当夜不能寐
Yes, that kind of image could haunt someone

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,920
那画面总是在脑海中挥之不去
if she tries to sleep even years later.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,140
放松点啦  你们安全了
Oh, relax. I think you are safe.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,460
是吗
Or are they?

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,080
今天是我们结婚20周年纪念日
It’s our 20th anniversary,

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,440
所以在今天的学校园游会上
so today at the school fair,

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,660
一个名叫节奏老爹的乐队将以
a band called the Dad Beats

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,340
一首动感的浪漫民谣给克莱尔一个惊喜
is gonna surprise Claire with a power love ballad.

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,500
而乐队主唱  你最好坐下来
And the lead singer -- you might want to sit down --

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,800
就是独一无二的
is the one and only --

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,630
还是站起来吧  就是这个人
get up on your feet! -- this guy!

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,930
她貌美如天仙*
*She's a pretty sight

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,440
智慧比佛祖*
*Wise as a buddha

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
但是哥们  小心她咬你*
*But, brother, watch that bite

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,360
因为她是克莱尔小怪兽*
*’cause she's a Claire-acuda

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,810
要不还是别唱原创歌曲了
Or maybe an existing song.

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,570
谢谢
Thank you.

第五季 第七集

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160
想不想在脸上画上
Do you want to get your face painted

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
美丽的蝴蝶
like a pretty butterfly?

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,070
不想  我没那心情
No. I'm just not in the mood.

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,830
莉莉  你呢
Lily, what about you?

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:07,750
知道吗
You know what?

31
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,760
我可以让他们画
Maybe I will have them paint

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,780
"史上最差教练"几个字在我额头上
"Worst coach ever" on my forehead.

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,620
小卡最近在教新生打橄榄球
Cam's coaching freshman football,

34
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,210
但他的球队总是输
and his team's losing,

35
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,350
这让他有点紧张焦虑
and it's making him, uh, a little tense.

36
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,370
快跑  快跑
Run, run!

37
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,110
像保护你的孩子一样护着球
Protect it like it's your baby!

38
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,710
你把你的孩子弄丢了
You dropped your baby!

39
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,480
你丢了你的孩子
You dropped your baby!

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,510
他们抱着你的孩子跑了
They're running away with your baby!

41
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,760
快去抢你的孩子
Go get your baby!

42
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,280
这裁判比选罗素・高尔
That's the worst call since

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,140
出演《悲惨世界》的人还差劲
they cast Russell Crowe in "Les Mis,"

44
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,240
就在那啊
right there!

45
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
你看到大家是怎么瞪我的吗
You see the way everyone's glaring at me?

46
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,330
-没有  -好像我是个窝囊教练
- No. - Like a big loser coach.

47
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,870
都是你自己瞎想罢了
All in your head.

48
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,530
我就是新生橄榄球队的海丝特・白兰
I'm the Hester Prynne of freshman football.

49
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,070
我不如在衬衫上绣一个
I may as well have a

50
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,660
猩红色的"L"好了[Loser: 废物]
scarlet "L" sewn on my shirt.

51
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,300
那大家会以为你是拉芙妮
Well, then, everyone would think you're Laverne.

52
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,300
[ABC台情景喜剧《拉芙妮与雪莉》中的人物]

53
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,260

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,140
昨晚输得很惨啊
That was a tough loss last night.

55
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,510
是啊  确实很惨
Yeah, yeah. Sure was.

56
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,230
我知道你很失望  肯定的
I feel your frustration. Sure do.

57
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,530
米奇尔  这是特雷弗的爸爸约翰
Uh, Mitchell, this is John. He's Trevor's dad.

58
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,000
-抱歉  -明星跑卫
- Sorry. - Star running back.

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,300
恐怕打不了多久了
Well, maybe not for long.

60
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,070
我正在考虑让他退队
I'm seriously thinking about pulling him from the team.

61
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,970
什么  为什么
What? Why?

62
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,720
因为特雷弗总是被拦截抢球
'cause trevor's getting killed out there.

63
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,080
你没安排人为他阻截对手
You got no one to block for him.

64
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,730
我明白你的意思了  你说得没错
I-I hear what you're saying, and you're not wrong,

65
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,470
但给我一点时间
but give me a little time.

66
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,810
给你一星期
You got one week.

67
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,410
在园游会上这样太不合适了
Well, that is not appropriate fair behavior at all.

68
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,100
你知道什么能让你开心点吗
You know what might make you feel better?

69
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,240
召集球队  让队员心中充满对神的敬畏
Gathering my team and putting the fear of God in them.

70
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,290
我本来要说的是西班牙油条
I was gonna say a churro.

71
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,300
我可以两个一起来
I can do both!

72
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
她真是一团糟
She's a mess.

73
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,780
丫头
Girl...

74
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,540
快车手  转弯时悠着点
Hey, hey, lead foot, easy on the turns!

75
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,040
这蛋糕我做了好几个小时呢
I worked hours on this cake.

76
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,450
你确定要去吗
You're sure you want to do this?

77
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,340
我要拿下蛋糕比赛
I'm going to win the cake contest,

78
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,620
这样再也没什么能阻止我了
and then there'll be no stopping me.

79
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,700
阻止你什么  被揍一顿吗
From what? A beating?

80
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,730
冠军绶带会赢得尊重的  杰
First-place ribbons earn respect, Jay.

81
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,680
但如果跟你竞争的是一群
Not if your competition's

82
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,390
老女人和怪胎就没这效果了
a bunch of old ladies and weirdos.

83
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,680
你就不能友善一点吗
Could you just be nice?

84
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,060
你吃他练习做的那些蛋糕时
You didn't seem to care

85
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,240
好像一点也不在乎啊
when you were eating all his practice cake.

86
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,260
总算有车位了
Finally.

87
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,490
你打算怎么办啊  伙计
What are you gonna do, pal?!

88
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,060
我也正想问你呢
About to ask you the same thing.

89
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,770
你没看到我的指示灯吗
Did you not see my blinker?

90
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,900
-没  -那你就是瞎了  灯还在闪呢
- Nope. - Then you're blind, 'cause it's on.

91
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,350
看你这样  我估计一整路都闪着呢吧
Looking at you, I'm guessing it was on the whole way here.

92
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,370
我车上有卫星广播  我能跟你耗一整天
I got all day and satellite radio.

93
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,900
我才不管把车停在这里是不是你的遗愿
I don't care if parking here is on your bucket list.

94
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,230
我有两本有声书  一条太空毯
I've got two books on tape, a space blanket,

95
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,200
手套箱里还有一整根能量棒
and a protein bar in the glove box.

96
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
有必要的话  我就睡在这里
I will sleep here if I have to.

97
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,590
我们坚决不动
We're not moving.

98
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,620
随便你  但我俩要走了
Ay, but we are.

99
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,880
走吧  曼尼
Let's go, Manny.

100
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
-你是谁  -老天啊
- Who are you? - Oh, my god!

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,590
你把我吓尿了
You scared the hell out of me!

102
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,830
注意用语哦  家里有个小宝宝呢
Okay, language. There's a baby in the house.

103
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,980
那宝宝是我舅舅
Uh, that baby happens to be my uncle.

104
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,650
那你是哪个
Which one are you?

105
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,040
你得告诉普先生你打碎了他的一瓶啤酒
You need to tell Mr. P you broke one of his beers.

106
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,820
我是艾丽克斯  你是谁

107
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,880
我是他们的男保姆[曼尼]

108
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,970
得了吧
Nice try.

109
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,250
我认识他家的曼尼  你和他一点也不像
I know their Manny, and you look nothing like him.

110
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,110
你是海莉
Oh, you're Haley.

111
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
我是他家的男保姆  安迪
I'm their male nanny, Andy.

112
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,530
你真的得挪个位了
You really need to move.

113
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,910
好吧  我去泳池边了
Okay, well, I'll be out by the pool.

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,410
什么  不行
What? Nope!

115
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,070
不行
No, no, no.

116
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,640
没允许的话就不行
Not without permission, you're not.

117
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,700
-我要给普先生和太太打电话  -等等
- I'm gonna call Mr. and Mrs. P. - Oh, wait!

118
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,200
说真的  曼迪  你...
Um...seriously, Mandy, do you, uh --

119
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,980
你真的非得那样做吗
do you really have to do that?

120
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,880
我知道你在耍什么把戏
I see what you're doing.

121
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,720
别费心了
Don't bother,

122
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,350

That's pretty young, but I guess they do things

125
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,080
也许不同吧
differently over there.

126
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,160
她和我一般年纪
She's my age,

127

我们订婚了  就要订婚了

143
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,890
她刚刚来我们学校  还没意识到
and she's so new to our school, she doesn't even realize

144
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,960
我比她低一个社会阶级
that I'm a full social class below her.

145
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,610
我需要在她发现学校有自助餐厅前
I need to cement the friendship

146
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,690
巩固我们的友谊
before she finds out we have a cafeteria.

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,620
超级重大
So huge.

你们应该两小时后才过去的啊

200
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,120
过去我一直送给菲尔

我知道  但我刚从摩天轮上下来
I know, but I just got off the Ferris wheel,

212

但你要错过节奏老爹乐队表演了
But you're gonna miss the Dad Beats.

214
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,240

菲尔  我会吐出来的
Phil, I might throw up.

217
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,300
我没开唱前谁都不会吐
No one throws up until I sing.

218
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
菲尔  我们得走了  现在就回家

女士  你被捕了

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,010
不  爸  告诉他我现在没空玩这游戏
Uh, no. Dad, tell him I can't do this right now.

225
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,500

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,170
我读不出口

-罪名成立  -别闹了

236
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,910
我的天
Oh, my god!

237
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,380

240
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,470
我们来看看你说得对不对
Hmm. Let's see if you're right.

241
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,670
不对
Mm, no.

242
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,540
好吧  你在泳池区
Okay, well, you're in a pool zone,

243
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,250
啤酒瓶是玻璃做的  这不安全
and that is glass, so that's not safe.

244
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,080
很危险
It's dangerous.

245
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,320
你和你女朋友怎么都这么热衷保护水源
What is with you and your girlfriend protecting water?

246
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,940
好吧
Okay, just --

247
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,230
你给我...不  不
If you just -- no -- no, uh, uh!

248
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,680
该...该死

249
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,630
这可是你干的
Well, now you've done it.

250
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
你得爬进去把泳池里
You're gonna have to climb in there

251
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,100
所有的玻璃渣找出来
and get all the glass out of the pool.

252
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,720
我刚把头发拉直
Um, I just got my hair straightened,

253
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
所以我是不可能下水的
so that's not gonna happen.

254
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,370
我讨厌发脾气
I hate to go all ballistic,

255
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,600
但认识你真不是件愉快的事
but it has not been a pleasure meeting you.

256
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,850
你用那张嘴亲你的假想女友吗
Do you kiss your imaginary girlfriend with that mouth?

257
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,920
对  但她真实存在  她是个真姑娘
I do, but she's real. So, she's a real girl.

258
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,280
这一切都归结于一件事  先生们
It all comes down to one thing, gentlemen --

259
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,070
专注
focus...

260
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,050
还有团队合作和用心
and teamwork and heart!

261
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
你们看到这根木锤了吗
You see this mallet?

262
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,520
你们觉得我能用一根手指转动这根木锤吗
Think I can swing this here mallet with one finger?

263
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,820
不能  我需要整个团队
No! I need my whole team!

264
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,530
因为当你们作为一个团队行动和工作时
Because when you're functioning and working as a team,

265
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,260
先生们  看好了
gentlemen, look out!

266
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,700
狂野老太婆
Sassy granny?

267
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,860
是的  狂野老太婆
Yeah, sassy granny.

268
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,320
是的  完全正确
Yes, exactly.

269
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,010
因为这就是你们昨晚在赛场上的表现
Because that is what you all played like last night --

270
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,020
一群狂野老太婆
is a bunch of sassy grannies.

271
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,700
但是这个星期我们要竭尽全力
But we're gonna bust our humps this week,

272
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,860
我们要冲上赛场
and we're gonna get out there,

273
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,880
打起比赛来要像一群...
and we're gonna play like a bunch of...

274
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,580
娘娘腔  明白了
Girly men. Got it.

275
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,400
好吧  那什么  这东西插上电源了吗
Okay, you know what? Is this thing plugged in?

276
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,850
这机器不需要电源
It's not electric.

277
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,090
好像是19世纪制造的
I think it was made in the 1800s.

278
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,830
好的  这就是我要说的
Okay, well, that's my point.

279
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,450
这机器过时了
This is outdated.

280
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,370
而且很无礼
This is offensive,

281
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,330
因为姑娘们也可以是运动员
because girls are athletes, too.

282
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,460
所以  结论就是
So, in conclusion...

283
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,340
如果你想赢得一场橄榄球赛
if you want to win football games,

284
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,990
就得走上赛场  打比赛要像...
we got to go out there and play like a...

285
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,320
大爸在干吗
What is daddy doing?

286
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,100
大爸在痛击他的恶魔
Daddy's smashing his demons.

287
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,170
就像你在家用吸尘器吸除的那些东西吗
Oh, like the ones you vacuum up at home?

288
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,570
对  对  就是那样
Yeah, yeah. Like that.

289
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,280
该死  就差一点儿
Mm! Damn. Near miss.

290
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,510
你为什么为了个校园活动盛装打扮
Why the hell are you so dressed up for a school fair, anyway?

291
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,910
这怎么叫盛装打扮
How is this dressed up?!

292
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,630
我...为什么这么说
I'm -- why?

293
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,260
因为我的衬衫有扣子吗
Because my shirt has buttons?

294
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,840
这是什么面料  是丝绸吗
What's that fabric? Is that silk?

295
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,830
别用你那沾满冰激凌的手指碰我的衬衫
Get your vanilla fingers away from my shirt!

296
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,170
-女士衬衫  -好吧
- Blouse. - Okay...

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
你想谈衣服是吗  那我们就谈谈衣服
You want to talk about clothes? Let's talk about clothes.

298
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,830
谈吧  来看看
Let's go. Let's see.

299
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,450
你穿得像个年老过气的高尔夫球手
You look like some kind of old, washed-up golf pro

300
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,050
一路比赛一路买醉
who drank his way off the tour

301
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,510
就差拿支小铅笔
and is one step away from writing a suicide note

302
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,140
写自杀遗书了
with one of them little pencils.

303
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,040
对不起  我不是那个意思
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

304
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,860
你要不是那个意思就不会那么说了
You wouldn't have said it if you didn't mean it.

305
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,970
我没有穿时髦衣服的身材
I don't have the body to wear the clothes they make today,

306
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,600
所以我挑舒服的穿
so I dress comfortable.

307
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,750
你身材很好啊  伙计
You're in shape, man.

308
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,310
你有多大  50多吗
What are you? Late 50s?

309
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,560
别开玩笑了  明显不是
Come on. You know I'm not.

310
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
我说真的  伙计
I'm serious, man.

311
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,970
你看起来像常驻健身房的
Y-you look like you live at the gym.

312
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,420
-我偶尔散步  -是吧
- I do some walking. - Yeah?

313
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,480
普里契特  威廉姆斯
Pritchett, Williams,

314
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,950
摩天轮那里有个人需要拘捕
got another arrest over by the Ferris wheel.

315
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,790
收到
On it.

316
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,340
我们走
Here we go.

317
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,130
为什么要把冰激凌扔了
Why'd we throw out the ice cream?

318
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,400
我们有的是时间
We got plenty of time.

319
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,790
看着曼尼在那
Seeing Manny up there

320
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,340
跟那些怪人和他们的怪蛋糕在一起
with the misfits and their crazy cakes,

321
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,810
我开始怀疑杰可能是对的
I started to wonder if Jay was right.

322
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,650
要是曼尼更像其他男孩那样
Maybe Manny would fit in better

323
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,610
也许他能更合群
if he was more like the other boys.

324
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,050
也许我需要帮他一把
And maybe I needed to give him a little push.

325
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,330
我全看见了
I saw you.

326
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,840
县监狱

327
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,230
好了  小姑娘
All right, young lady.

328
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,410
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

329
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,660
-什么  -你有权保持沉默
- What? - You have the right to remain silent.

330
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,510
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

331
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,520
爷爷
Grandpa!

332
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,310
抱歉  孙女  职责所在
Sorry, honey. Part of the job.

333
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,950
让开点
Out of the way!

334
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,710
我们走吧
Let's go.

335
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,430
这是谁干的
Who did this?!

336
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,700
看来只剩我们两个了
Hmm. I guess it's just you and me.

337
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,240
我的蛋糕  有人把它毁了
My cake! Somebody ruined it!

338
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
谁会这么干
Who would do that?!

339
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,290
曼尼  太可怕了  你的心血啊
Ay! Manny, how terrible. All your hard work.

340
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,550
算了  那我们去玩吧
Oh, well. Let's go ride the rides.

341
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,810
不不  妈妈  我知道是谁干的
No, no, no. Mom, I know who did it.

342
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,730
真的吗
Oh, you do?

343
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,790
是伊妮德
It was Enid.

344
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,450
看看她
Ah. Look at her.

345
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,020
你能看到她眼中的愤恨
You can see the hate in her eyes.

346
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,250
她一看到我的蛋糕  就感到了威胁
The minute she saw this, she felt threatened.

347
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,700
这个冷血贱人
She's cold as ice.

348
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,080
何不随它去呢
How about you just let it go

349
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,980
去和其他男孩们玩玩吧
and go play with the other boys?

350
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,640
那正合她意
Oh, she'd love that.

351
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
好啊  伊妮德
Okay, Enid.

352
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,800
你想玩玩吗  那我们就来玩玩
You want to dance? Let's dance.

353
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,620
把手机给我  拜托  我要打个电话
Let me have my cellphone. Come on. I got to make a call.

354
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,450
抱歉  规定不允许
Sorry. Those are the rules.

355
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,310
你笑什么
What are you smiling at?

356
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,510
我6岁
I'm six.

357
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,220
天呐
Oh, god.

358
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,190
好了  又给你们送来一个
All right. Got another one for you here.

359
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,390
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

360
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,080
进去吧
Come on.

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,160
罪状是这个大姐太凶残
One count of being an aggravating big sister.

362
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,270
关8到10分钟
That's 8 to 10 minutes.

363
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,410
是卢克干的吗  我是在帮他啊
Luke did this?! I was just trying to help him.

364
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,410
帮他干什么
Help him do what?

365
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,040
我朋友西恩娜和我正帮他
My friend Sienna and I were trying to help him

366
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,500
找到他喜欢的那个女孩
find this girl he has a crush on.

367
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,160
宝贝  西恩娜就是他喜欢的女孩
Honey, Sienna is the girl he has a crush on.

368
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,020
拜托  你没看到他看她的眼神吗
Come on, haven't you ever seen the way he looks at her?

369
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,370
像他以前看万圣节糖果的眼神一样
It's same way he used to look at Halloween candy.

370
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,950
天呐  他要做蠢事了
Oh, my god. He's gonna do something stupid

371
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,650
他会毁了我的好事
and ruin it for me.

372
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,840
我得出去
I have to get out of here.

373
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,170
好吧  我有个主意  听我的
Okay. All right. I got a plan. I got this.

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
我来调虎离山
I'm gonna create a distraction.

375
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,030
把那个小警卫引到这来
Just got to get that little guard over here.

376
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,820
你就安静地坐着
You're gonna sit down very quietly,

377
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,620
坐在门边
right by the door.

378
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,080
好主意  妈妈  记得告诉我结果如何
Great plan, mom. Let me know how that works out for you.

379
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,460
那是个假锁
It's a fake lock.

380
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,280
你要在那坐多久
How long were you gonna sit on that?

381
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,570
又找到一块
Found another one.

382
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,320
我就说吧
I told you.

383
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,700
你每次都要这样炫耀吗
Are you gonna do that every time?

384
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,320
你找到的是玻璃渣
You found glass,

385
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,940
又不是消失的亚特兰大城
not the lost city of Atlanta.

386
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,130
估计那个城就是因为有太多
Wow, I'm gonna chalk that one up

387
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,410
未成年人饮酒才沉没的
to a lot of underage drinking.

388
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,940
-你流血了  -什么
- You're bleeding. - What?

389
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,590
我晕血  我晕血
I do not like blood. I do not like blood.

390
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,870
-严重吗  -我看看
- Is it bad? - Here.

391
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,880
-天呐  -怎么了
- Oh, my god! - What?

392
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,410
你的手指又短又粗  像小胡萝卜
Your fingers are so stubby,  like baby carrots.

393
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,640
好吧
Sure. Okay.

394
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,570
嘲笑我吧
Make fun...

395
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,270
总有一天你会需要我把手伸进贩卖机里
till you need me to reach into a vending machine,

396
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,360
到时候大家都要巴结我了
then I'm everyone's best friend.

397
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,160
来  举着别动
Here. Hold still.

398
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,560
我来压住止血
Let me put some pressure on it.

399
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,650
你为什么要当男保姆呢
So, why are you a manny, anyway?

400
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,120
赚钱上大学
Saving up for college.

401
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,470
而且我喜欢孩子
Plus, I like kids.

402
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,080
因为和他们一起你的手显得正常吗
'Cause they make your hands seem normal?

403
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,230
好了  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

404
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,650
我没事了  谢谢
I'm good. Thank you.

405
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,060
卢克  我不想打击你
Luke, I hate to say it,

406
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,590
但也许那女孩已经离开了
but maybe this girl left.

407
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
这也许是最好的结果
It's probably for the best.

408
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,740
我是说  即便我找到她
I mean, even if I found her --

409
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,820
算了  当我没说  这很难为情
ah, forget it. It's embarrassing.

410
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,610
没事  说吧
No. Tell me.

411
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,650
我不知道该做些什么
I wouldn't know what to do.

412
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
我从来没有亲过女孩子
I've never kissed a girl before.

413
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,950
其实没有那么难
Oh! It's not that hard.

414
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,810
不如这样吧
You know what?

415
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,470
我亲你一下给你看看是什么感觉
I'll kiss you once to show you how it's done.

416
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,480
真的么  好  那我们去垃圾桶后面吧
Really? Okay. Want to go behind the dumpster?

417
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,240
不用  在这里就可以
No. Here is fine.

418
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,230
好吧  虽然跟我原来想象的不一样
Okay. It's not really how I imagined it, but...

419
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,890
停下
Stop!

420
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,670
什么  别理她  我们到哪一步了
What? Ignore her. Where were we?

421
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,340
你就是那个女生  他喜欢你
You're the girl! You're his crush!

422
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,580
他是个小怪胎  请别因此对我另眼相看
He's being a little weirdo! Please don't judge me!

423
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,280
卢克  这是真的么
Uh, Luke, is this true?

424
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
她是个书呆子  她的朋友都是书
She's a nerd! Her friends are books!

425
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,000
你是发生在她身上最好的事
You're the best thing that's ever happened to her!

426
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
-艾丽克斯  -我不知道他在说什么
- Alex? - Um, I don't know what he's talking about!

427
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,410
好吧  我要去找我的朋友们了
Okay, I'm just gonna go catch up with some friends.

428
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,190
西恩娜  等等
Sienna, wait!

429
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,340
别伤心  反正她也配不上你
Don't be sad. You're too good for her anyways.

430
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,420
是啊  谢谢  艾丽克斯
Yeah. Thanks, Alex.

431
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,220
没说你
Not you.

432
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,310
我在说我自己  你这个小矮人
I was talking about myself, you little gnome.

433
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,270
他在那
There he is.

434
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,950
再逮捕一个人  我们就能收工了
One more arrest and we can hang up our badges.

435
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,540
我之前就看到这个小混混到处捣乱
I've seen this punk horsing around earlier.

436
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,120
我会享受这一刻的
I'm gonna enjoy this.

437
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,970
该坐牢了  穿牛仔夹克的那个
Jail time, jean jacket.

438
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,270
-是不是很糟  -你会没事的
- Is it bad? - You're gonna be fine.

439
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,100
我应该穿个马甲的
Aah! I should have worn a vest.

440
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,120
为什么每个人都站在那里看着
Why is everyone just standing around?!

441
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,170
拿条毛巾来给他擦衬衫啊
Get this man a towel for his blouse!

442
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,720
好冷
So cold.

443
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,280
我们差点就成功了
We were almost out.

444
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,760
-我不想就这样结束  -你不许那样做
- I didn't want it to end like this. - Don't you do that!

445
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,940
事情还没结束
It's not over!

446
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,790
听我说
Listen to me.

447
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,150
我需要你告诉我太太事情的经过
I need you to tell my wife what happened.

448
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,320
告诉她这不是我的错
Tell her it wasn't my fault.

449
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,110
你可以自己跟她说
You're gonna tell her yourself.

对不起  我应该听你的话

455
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,320
但你一定要留下来再听一首歌
But you have to stay for just one song.

456
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
为什么
Why?

457
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,150

我以前从没做过类似的事情

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,820
药房的一些朋友

是个摇滚明星

475
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,150
他的歌声简直可以作为良药出售
His voice is the drug he should be dispensing,

476
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,150
因为很显然  那能治愈一切
because apparently, it's the cure for everything.

477

-该走了  我们走吧  -别别别

512
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,760
砸在伊妮德的单层蛋糕上

别别别  等等  不是伊妮德干的
No, no, no! Wait! Manny, Enid didn't do it.

514

-是我干的  -什么
- I did it. - What?

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,670
是我毁了你的蛋糕

516
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,080
我怕那些男孩子嘲笑你

我觉得我比你更在乎你是否合群

不  我在乎

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,010
我非常在乎
I care a lot.

520
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,060
只是我擅长的事情
It's just the stuff I'm good at

521
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,010
不会让我受欢迎
isn't the stuff that makes you popular.

522
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,920
请各位选手在60秒内
Contestants, all cakes

523
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,930
将蛋糕放在评委桌前
must be at the judges' table in 60 seconds.

524
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,910
这么多人  我们怎么可能挤得过去
Ay, there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.

525
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,990
不可能挤不过去  拿着
Like heck we won't. Here.

526
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,780

-好的  -准备好了吗  来

528
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,580
看看谁终于放下他的木锤了

529
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,170
你发完脾气了吗
You done having your little temper tantrum?

530
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,350
没有那么糟啦
It wasn't that bad.

531
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,560
小卡  你的行为也太幼稚了
Cam, your behavior was completely juvenile,

532
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
我不觉得这会给莉莉
and I don't think that it set a very good example --

533
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,020
别插队
Hey, hey! No cutsies --

534
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,320
树立好榜样
for Lily.

535
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,460
对不起  我太沮丧了
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,990
我感觉无法让球队反败为胜了
I-I can't seem to turn this team into a winner.

537
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,160
你为什么要给自己这么大压力呢
Oh, why do you let it get you so stressed out?

538
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,590
不就是橄榄球吗
It's just football.

539
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,220
你知道橄榄球对我来说意味着什么吗
You know what football was to me?

540
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,160
橄榄球是我的救赎
Football was my salvation.

541
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
每当我踏上赛场
Every time I stepped onto that field,

542
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,060
我就不再是那个被孤立的怪咖基佬了
I wasn't the weird gay outsider kid anymore.

543
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,290
我是球队的榜样
I inspired my entire team

544
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,290
因为我有想要证明的东西
because I had something to prove.

545
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,530
我的那个想要证明自己的小孩去哪了
Where's my kid that has something to prove?

546
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,430
妈  快点儿
Come on mom!

547
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
快跟上我  跟紧点儿
Stay on my hip! Follow my lead!

548
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,830
快
Move!

549
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,120
这正是我需要的
That's exactly what I need.

550
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,310
快点  快点  妈
Oh! Come on! Come on, mom.

551
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,610
需要蛋糕吗

552
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,630
告诉他们你的好消息

553
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,600
-我赢了蛋糕比赛  -另外一个好消息
- I won the cake contest! - The other good news.

554
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,950
他加入了球队
He made the football team.

555
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,030
他们第一次赢了比赛
They won their first game.

556
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,340
他们爱死我烤的香蕉面包了
And the guys love my banana bread.

557
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,530
闭上眼  在你睁开眼之前
Keep your eyes closed, and before you open them,

558
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,610
想想这20年来
remember that for 20 years,

559
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,370
你每年都给我完美的  贴心的礼物
you have given me perfect, creative, thoughtful gifts.

560
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,440
然而每年  我都让你失望
And every year, I have let you down.

561
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,140
你将会感到非常糟糕  我懂
You're about to feel really bad, and I know that,

562
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,070
因为这也是我每年的感受
because it's how I have felt every year.

563
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,900
但是亲爱的  这不是我的目的
But, honey, it is not my intention,

564
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,890
因为我爱你
because I love you.

565
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,800
结婚纪念日快乐
Happy anniversary.

566
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,430
天啊  中国杂技

20周年  中国[与"瓷器"同音]

568
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,930
你好聪明
You're brilliant.

569
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,400
-没错  -伙计们  你们是我的礼物
- You got it! - Hey, guys! You're my present!

570
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,220
那是什么
Oh -- oh, what's that?

571
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,280

那是直升机  我应该加入他们
That's the helicopter. I should get in there.

573
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,230
不不  让他们为你表演

他们是来为你表演的
They're here for you.

575
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,500
亲爱的

576

别担心  只是两瓶啤酒
Don't worry, it was just a couple of beers,

577
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,080
而且你打扫干净了

听说你被通缉了

你所见的可能对你不利[压在你身上]

582
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,330
那你得先抓到我

583
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,810
拿点酒来
Bring me some wine.

584
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,950
普先生  有件事我要向您坦白
Mr. P., I have a confession to make.

585

楼上有个更吸引人的"坦白"在等着我
I'm taking a much more interesting confession upstairs.

586
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,980
乔睡着后
After Joe went down,

587
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,650
我在泳池边喝了口小酒
I had a sip of beer by the pool,

588
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,270
结果瓶子碎了
and a bottle broke.

589
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,120
-是我干的  -别担心

我也经常在照顾小孩之后喝啤酒
