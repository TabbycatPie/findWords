20
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,198
Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

21
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,158
He's... He's good
with regular folk."

22
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,415
This is a real situation
where... where...

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,917
Where Jerry
could really shine.

24
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,491
He's a master convincer."

25
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,072
Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

26
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:25,947
Oh. Okay, well,
I told Morty,

27
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,345
"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

28
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,865
but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know... Pbht!

29
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:32,685
And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

30
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:33,755
It impedes my work.

31
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,837
So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

32
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,647
Wait. My son asked you
to take me

33
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,468
on some kind of
pity adventure

34
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,945
to keep me
from killing myself?

35
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:42,622
Wait, wh-what
did you think it was?

36
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,003
An execution.

37
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,182
Geez!
You really do need a win.

38
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,590
No!
I-I don't know.

39
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,173
I mean, you never made me
the pants, so...

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,742
So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

41
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,912
into the middle
of the galaxy

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,483
and shove you
into the vacuum of space

43
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,574
with your dick
hanging out?

44
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:55,796
And we're seeing
how you'd act

45
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,114
if that were
about to happen?

46
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,904
I mean I'll make you
the pants right now.

47
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,015
Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

48
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,819
I have pants at home!
Jerry, if I make pants,

49
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,374
they'll be better than
your pants at home.

50
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,720
Also, if I wanted
to kill you...

51
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,592
Yeah, I get it.
It would be amazing.

52
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:07,847
Please, take me home.

53
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,875
I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

54
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,074
Well, if it's all the same,
could we go

55
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,121
get our story straight?

56
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,283
Because
you're a terrible liar.

57
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,098
You called me
a master convincer!

58
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:16,512
You believed me?

59
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,712
Huh. This seems...
kind of fancy.

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,619
Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

61
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,710
of an alien truck stop.

62
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,979
You have
no frame of reference.

63
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:29,672
You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

64
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,516
But, yes,
it is super fancy.

65
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:33,270
I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

66
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,836
I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

67
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,099
Rick Sanchez.

68
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,245
I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

69
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,262
I would stick you
like the pig you are.

70
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:44,433
Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

71
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,670
There'd be two funerals.

72
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,311
Aaah!!

73
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:50,915
Someone?

74
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,239
Uh, someone?
Someone!

75
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,799
My friend!
It has been too long.

76
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,535
Oh, it's great
to see you again, buddy!

77
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:03,605
Yeah, you're doing it.

78
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:05,473
Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

79
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,639
The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

80
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,238
You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

81
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,450
Okay, but still...
Bad parenting.

82
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,384
Hey, rich a-holes are
rich a-holes.

83
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,833
They all pay top dollar
to come here

84
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,652
and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

85
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,757
No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

86
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,506
Can't even have a heart attack.

87
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,904
Got it.
The perfect place

88
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:26,903
to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

89
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,672
I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,873
but it's
right on the money.

91
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,120
If I come home
without you,

92
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,525
I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

93
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:34,796
Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum.

94
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:35,972
Jeff Goldblum?

95
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,951
What the are you
talking about, Jerry?

96
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:39,276
Jesus!

97
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:40,844
Holy shit!

98
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:42,311
Yo, what's up,
"Big Chill"?!

99
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:43,774
Don't go
into the telepod!

100
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:47,013
Hey, maybe we would have fun
on a fake adventure.

101
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:48,675
On a<i> fake</i> adventure.

102
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,669
Speaking of...
What are we gonna tell Morty?

103
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:52,361
I don't know.
But whatever it is,

104
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,458
we're gonna need a couple more
of these babies!

105
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,462
What's wrong?

106
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,473
Mom,
do you think I'm hot?

107
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:04,157
I... don't think that's something
that matters.

108
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:05,502
So, I'm not hot?!

109
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,957
I'm saying the part of you
that cares about that

110
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,713
is a part you shouldn't
give any energy to.

111
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,959
That's not an answer!

112
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,699
Because I'm not an issue
of<i> Cosmo,</i> okay?

113
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:14,305
I'm your mother
and a doctor, and...

114
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,448
I'm hideous!

115
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,314
Geez.
What's with her?

116
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,042
Teenage-girl stuff.

117
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,180
Is that a...
hoof collage?

118
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,850
It's perfectly legal, if that's
what you're wondering.

119

Cool... zies.

Oh, yeah, Ethan?

122
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:35,113
What do you have in common
with Tricia Lange?

123
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:37,193
A mutual love
of French cinema?

124
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,617
The belief
that a carbon tax

125
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,135
is the only viable solution
to climate change?

126
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:44,648
Or could it be
her massive stripper titties?!

127
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,645

Malakai the Squid came,

rips off his face,

131
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,003
I liked it.

Hey, he usurped

147
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,208
He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,

what your life could have been

150
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:50,623
Wondered? Sure.

151
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,950
I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

Move on.

Oh, you really moved on.

157
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,274
There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

160
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,583
You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

161
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,302
I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

162
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,566
get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

163
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,823
where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

164
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,842
Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

165
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,921
pulled from thin air.

166
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,708

so you're free to do
as you please.

But there comes a time
in every man's life

172
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,452
when he must choose
the foundation

173
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,378
on which his legacy
will be built...

174
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,711

year, there's a special person here ♪

Oh, yeah.

177
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,072
That's what I'm talking about.

178

Oops! Okay, a little more

Oh, geez!

Aah! Stop!

walk right out of there

For Christ's sakes,
Morty,

185
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,924
women going through
a divorce need a creative outlet.

00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:22,733
What was that?

187
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,121
Summer!

188
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,088
I'm coming, Summer!

189
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,204
What the hell
happened?!

190
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,482
How do we get her
back to normal?!

191
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,960
I don't know, man! This thing is
pretty complicated.

192
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,340
I-I'm gonna call Rick.

193
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,431
Well, hold on.
We can't just call your grandpa

194
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:45,795
whenever
there's a problem.

195
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,409
We can handle this
ourselves.

196
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,567
I mean, I don't see the point
in trying to.

197
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,058
This is obviously
Rick-level

198
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:52,738
I have
a medical degree.

199
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,149
Is that
what this is about?

200
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,885
L-Like, you want
to prove yourself?

201
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,987
Oh, it's not about anything, Morty.
How dare you?

202
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,542
Okay, good.
Then I'll just call... Ow!

203
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,094
Morty, I need this.

204
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,684
Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here
says he knows a place

205
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,717
where the ladies drop panties
for anyone bi-pedal.

206
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,030
Yeah, I'm
not really interested.

207
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:09,749
My heart still belongs
to Beth.

208
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,419
Oh. Huh. Okay.

209
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,317
What, you don't think
I have a shot?

210
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,489
I didn't say that.

211
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,627
Excuse me.
May I have another one of these?

212
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,861
Coming
right up.

213
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,800
Hmm, things weren't always
so bad between Beth and me.

214
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,700
We had some good times
when we were younger.

215
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:24,917
Oh, yeah, I bet.

216
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:26,846
That's how teenage pregnancy
happens, my friend.

217
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,164
Yeah, no.

218
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:30,757
Things were pretty great, even
until a couple of years ago.

219
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:32,519
- Jerry, I get it.
- That's around the time

00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:33,720
I moved in with you guys.

221
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,013
Oh, I guess
you're right.

222
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,858
Jerry, you know,
I hope you're not suggesting

223
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,756
that I had anything to do
with your marriage breaking up,

224
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,521
because there are some major
issues between you and Beth

225
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:43,386
that have been there
since you guys met.

All right,
what's going on here?

231
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,289
When did you get cool?!

232
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:57,712
When you stole my wife!

00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,054
I should have done that
a long time ago!

234
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,740
We're going on

Whirly Dirly, baby.

00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,458
Aha, look at this.

237
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,723
It says "normalize."

238
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,271
I bet if we
just press that...

239
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,417
But... if the machine was made
by spider people,

240
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,120
normal would mean
eight legs.

241
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,015
Oh, God! are you gonna
go on another spiel

242
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:15,874
like you did
with the flesh-colored crayon?

243
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,323
I'm pretty sure "normalize"
will make her normal.

244
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,811
Aah!

245
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,852
I'd call that progress.

246
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,338
- She's huge!
- And normal!

247
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,118
I'm not normal!

248
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,358
- Mom!
- Okay, this says reverse."

249
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,344
- Done and done.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

250
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,789
Oh, come on! What else
could "reverse" possibly mean?

251
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,623
Aah!

252
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,745
Mom, call Rick!

253
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,292
Thank you.

254
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,701
There's a customer-service
number on here.

Oh, man.
This is gonna be awesome!

257
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:51,083
I got to hand it to you, Jerry.
This was a solid idea.

258
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,401
Uh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

259
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,341
And you know what?
I'll cop to it.

260
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:55,905
I put a lot of strain
on your marriage.

261
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,962
It wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

262
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,642
What?! I didn't respect
your marriage.

263
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,176
I certainly
didn't do it any favors.

264
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,338
And for what it's worth,

265
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:04,476
I'll apologize to Beth for it
when we get home.

266
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:07,163
Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!

267
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,917
Stop the ride!
We got to get off.

268
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,005
What are you
talking about, buddy?

269
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,823
We got to get out of this thing.
We got to get out!

270
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,573
Jerry, come on, man!

271
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:15,112
We haven't even gotten
to the first whirly.

272
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,362
No, no, this sucks.
It's so boring.

273
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:18,920
I mean,
I'm falling asleep here.

274
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:20,359
Let's just get out and crawl
down the sides.

275
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:31,505
Uh, get down!
Duck down!

276
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:33,075
It's more fun
when you scrunch down.

277
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:34,620
Jerry, what the...

278
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,956
Oh

279
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,585
Rick, up here! There's
a spot where you can kill him!

280
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:58,856
Good call, Jerry!

281
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,821
Hey, how'd you know
about that?

282
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,327
Uh...

283
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:19,488
Lisa?

284
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:30,167
So, uh, Jerry, big fan
of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

285
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,388
Not anymore.
Obviously.

286
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,270
But when you were,
how did you know about it?

287
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,013
We had a deal,
Jerry Smith.

288
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:46,642
It's a<i> really</i>
common name.

289
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,561
Now, take it easy, Rick.

290
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,116
You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

291
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,890
It's... It's no time
to be thinking about

292
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:55,568
who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

293
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:57,070
Get it off me!

294
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,174
It's eating me!

295
00:11:58,222 --> 00:11:59,699
Look, I confess, okay?

296
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,661
They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

297
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,587
and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

298
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,205
But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

299
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,840
you're not a monster...
Not like this thing.

300
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,183
It's got me good.

301
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,464
This is a mislead,
right?

302
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,312
You're inventing a thing
to save me.

303
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,627
That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

304
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,717
It's been invented.

305
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,979
I'm making a way out of here...
One seat ought to do it.

306
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,718
I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

307
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,134
- I won't do it again!
- Nobody ever does.

308
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,319
You self-righteous
piece of

309
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,628
You took my family!

310
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,195
I took<i> your</i> family?

311
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,857
Who do you think
had more taken from them

312
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,078
when you shot 20 ccs

313
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,994
of liquid dream-killer
into my daughter?

314
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,131
She was<i> Rick's</i> daughter, Jerry.
She had options!

315
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,331
- Oof.
- That all ended

316
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,220
because she felt sorry for you.

317
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,345
You act like prey,
but you're a predator!

318
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:42,137
You use pity to lure in
your victims!

319
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:43,268
That's how you survive!

320
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:44,911
I survive
because I know everything.

321
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,047
That snakes survives
because children wander off,

322
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,675
and you survive
because people think,

323
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,067
"Oh, this poor piece of.
He never gets a break.

324
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,902
I can't stand
the deafening silent wails

325
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,175
of his wilting soul.

326
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,955
I guess I'll hire him
or marry him."

327
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,164
- Rick!
- Rick!

328
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,595
I knew you wouldn't
let me die.

329
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,979
That was never an option.

330
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,416
Because you never had
a son.

331
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,139
No, because I need
a living organism

332
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:13,936
coated in gibble snake bile
to attract a shmooglite runner.

333
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,209
Wait, what's happening? Use
that confusion, Jerry.

334
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:18,839
It'll make you wriggle more like
an abandoned newborn.

335
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,542
Jesus Christ!

336
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,591
What the Rick?!

337
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,396
Help!
Help me!

338
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,448
Aaah!

339
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,463
There's a space port
20 miles south.

340
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,838
We'll be able to board
a galaxy class cruise ship

341
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,175
and jump through a wormhole
that will put us

342
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:47,492
within spitting distance
of the Milky Way.

343
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,105
But, hey,
it's about the journey,

344
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:50,960
not the destination,
right, Jerry?

345
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,960
Just stay put, sweetie!
Mom's still on hold.

346
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,441
Morphizer customer service.
How may I help you?

347
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,817
Yes, I'm having a little trouble
with one of your machines.

348
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,152
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

349
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,988
Do you see a little compartment
on the side of the machine?

350
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,347
Let me check.
Yes, got it.

351
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:09,659
- Mom?
- Great! Now,

352
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,748
do you see
the little button next to it?

353
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,372
I do. Give that button a push.

354
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,046
Okay.
Mom, listen to me!

355
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,328
We're free!!

356
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:20,213
Okay, so I pushed the button,
and three little men ran out.

Hello?

we got disconnected.

00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,672
- Morty!
- Don't "Morty" me!

361
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,760
I tricked Rick into taking Dad
on an adventure

362

help him keep him around,

00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,199
Right.
I'll make you a deal.

521
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,845
I'll leave out the part
where you tried to murder me...

522
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:46,916
And I'll leave out
the part

523
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:49,981
where you admitted
to sabotaging our marriage.

524
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,183
You want to...?

525
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:54,170
Nah, if the family
sees me like this,

526
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,712
they'll
feel sorry for me.

527
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,266
Which is no longer
my signature move.

528
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,268
Later days, amigo.

529
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:04,851
Actually, I just realized,
I don't have my wallet,

530
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,122
and my bus pass is in there,
so maybe...

531
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,958
Stay strong, Jerry.
I believe in you!

I tell you, fellas.
This is the life.

It certainly is.

541
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,221
To freedom!

542
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,779
Ooh!
Looks like a 4-22.

543
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:58,463
Ooh, a couple cranks
on scaling knob

544
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:01,296
with a four dilabyte cross fade
would fix that in a jiff.

545
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:04,519
Four? You'd be lucky
to clear 13% de-morphized

546
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,590
with that
kind of range.

547
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,603
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what did we agree on?

548
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:09,983
No work talk!

549
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,843
Let's just relax and enjoy
our retirement, shall...

550
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,557
Oh, my God!

551
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:16,132
Aaaaah!

552
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,223
Did you get any of that?
