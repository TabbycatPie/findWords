1
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:03,232
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:06,267
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:09,801
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:12,837
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,408
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,376
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,946
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats.

8
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,115
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:28,219
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:30,856
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:32,057
No!

12
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:33,826
The man who saved Central City.

13
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:35,259
Why did you want to kill me?

14
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,429
- He promised he'd take me home.
- Who?

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,930
- Zoom.
- Wells killed my mother.

16
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:41,232
I don't know anything anymore,

17
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,901
especially who I can
and can't trust.

18
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:44,737
S.T.A.R. Labs is now
safer than ever.

19
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,671
People can't just waltz
in and out of here.

20
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,573
Exactly.

21
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:51,643
- Stay where you are.
- My name is Jay Garrick.

22
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,112
Your world is in danger,
Barry Allen.

23
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,914
Please, just let me explain.

24
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,584
I mean you no harm.

25
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,851
How do you know my name?

26
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,253
I know all your names.
Caitlin Snow,

27
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,355
Cisco Ramon,
Detective Joe West...

28
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,057
Enough.

29
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,992
That part about explaining
needs to happen right about now.

30
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:09,762
This world is in danger.

31
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,930
What other worlds are there?

32
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:14,099
When you created the
singularity above Central City,

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,468
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

34
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:19,304
I'm sorry, a breach?

35
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,673
Yes, a portal
connecting our two earths.

36
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:24,109
And what precisely
is your concern?

37
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,644
A few days ago, you found
a dead man named Al Rothstein

38
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:28,379
at the nuclear plant.

39
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:29,847
But then a different
Al Rothstein tried to kill you.

40
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,450
Atom Smasher.

41
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:32,784
That man was from my world.

42
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:34,185
If he got through the breach,

43
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,753
I suspect there'll be
more to follow.

44
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:41,960
Okay, so, Jay, how exactly
do you know all of this?

45
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:45,195
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

46
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:47,698
They called me The Flash.

47
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,872
Before I arrived on your earth,

48
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,643
I was in a fight
with a man named Zoom.

49
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:03,478
Zoom?

50
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,647
I've heard that name before.

51
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,219
Atom Smasher, he said Zoom
sent him here to kill me.

52
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,486
Who is this guy?

53
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,122
He's a speedster,
like you and me.

54
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,557
And fast.
Maybe the fastest of all.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,092
But evil.

56
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:20,430
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

57
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:26,703
We were engaged in our
fiercest battle ever,

58
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,538
racing throughout my city.

59
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,906
But I wasn't fast enough
to stop him.

60
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:33,043
Zoom has me beaten.

61
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,610
He was about to kill me

62
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:37,379
when suddenly there was
a blinding light

63
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,781
and the sky split open.

64
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,117
A breach,
between my world and yours,

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,222
caused from the singularity.

66
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,723
It pulled me in...

67
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:55,064
And I somehow ended up
in your world.

68
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:57,466
Powerless.
Unable to return home.

69
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,768
What do you mean?

70
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,502
I lost my speed.

71
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:01,471
How?

72
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,639
Not entirely sure.

73
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,044
So, you've been in
Central City for six months.

74
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:10,580
Why haven't you come
to see us before?

75
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,414
I'm in a foreign world here,
Detective.

76
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,917
I didn't know who you all were.

77
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,353
Took me that long
to piece it all together.

78
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,121
So that's how you know
our names.

79
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,257
You've been following us.

80
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,759
Look, I know how this sounds.

81
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,561
The existence of another earth,

82
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,497
you, another Flash,

83
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,466
it all came as an unexpected
shock to me, too.

84
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:34,137
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

85
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,538
There is.

86
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,341
We're gonna...
do some tests on you.

87
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,644
See if you're telling us
the truth.

88
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:46,115
'Cause if you're not, this Zoom,

89
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,819
he's not gonna be
your only enemy.

90
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:01,163
Where the hell am I?

91
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,764
You want to go home?

92
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:05,367
You only have to do one thing.

93
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,368
What's that?

94
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,771
Kill The Flash.

95
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,644
So, Mr. Garrick,

96
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,112
how long have you been
The Flash on your world?

97
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,848
Not long enough
to call me Mister.

98
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,084
Please, it's Jay.

99
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,384
Jay, of course.

100
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,987
On my world, I've been The Flash

101
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:25,154
for about two years.

102
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,557
And how did you get your speed?

103
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,625
Not really sure. I was at my lab

104
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,595
trying to purify heavy water
without any residual radiation

105
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,430
when there was a blinding light.

106
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:36,832
I fell into a coma.
When I woke up,

107
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,534
I could run almost as fast
as the speed of light.

108
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,237
Sorry. Did you say lab?

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,939
Are you a scientist?

110
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,475
Well, I certainly didn't work
at a place like this,

111
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:46,776
but, yeah.

112
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:49,278
I had a respectable
solo operation.

113
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,413
Part-time chemist,
part-time physicist.

114
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,516
Part-time superhero.

115
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:57,487
I can forget that
superhero part now, though?

116
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,954
Is any of this possible?

117
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,857
A breach to another earth?
It's not, right?

118
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,125
The contrary. Just recently,

119
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,392
the many-different-worlds theory

120
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:04,826
proposed interaction

121
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,829
with parallel universes
was plausible.

122
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,831
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's
saying is true,

123
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,100
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

124
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,268
It doesn't add up.

125
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,536
I'm gonna be honest here,

126
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,803
I don't understand what the hell

127
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:16,271
any of you are talking about.

128
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,574
So, Jay is saying he's from,

129
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,776
like, a mirror-world.

130
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,677
Or a parallel universe

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,048
that's very, very similar
to ours.

132
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,485
Multiverse would be
a more apt description.

133
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:31,221
- No, not helping.
- Bless your heart.

134
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,889
Okay, let's see if this helps.

135
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,793
This is our earth.

136
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:42,632
Let's call it Earth-1.

137
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:47,637
And this second earth,
let's call it Earth-2.

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,507
This is where Jay
claims to be from.

139
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,744
And these other earths,
three, four, five,

140
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:59,014
to infinity, all of them,
are nearly identical to ours.

141
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:01,918
And they all exist
at the same time,

142
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,221
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

143
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:09,526
For example, the Joe West
on Earth-2, your doppelganger,

144
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,927
he might not be a detective.

145
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,562
He could be
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

146
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:17,132
And you, the Barry Allen her
is The Flash,

147
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:20,636
but over there,
he could be an electrician.

148
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:25,408
So, I'm assuming that the
people on all these other earths

149
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,843
work to make money
to pay bills and such.

150
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,845
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

151
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,247
I'm heading back to the station.

152
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,981
Call me when this makes
a little bit more sense.

153
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,350
I'm still trying to wrap my head

154
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,485
around this whole idea
of time travel.

155
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,624
There is, uh,
one problem that remains.

156
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,026
If Mr. Garrick is telling
the truth,

157
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,461
there is a breach

158
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,362
somewhere in Central City
that we need to find

159
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,132
and close for good.

160
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,432
Yeah, but how do we find it?

161
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,901
We don't even know
what to look for.

162
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,769
Well, I-I suggest
we put our heads together

163
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,805
and come up with a solution.

164
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,542
Not literally, of course.

165
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,011
Those days are over.

166
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,651
- What'd you find?
- Well, Jay's heart rate

167
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,185
is extraordinarily low.

168
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:13,122
And he does have
regenerative capabilities.

169
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,790
Other than that,
I'm not seeing any evidence

170
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,492
of the Speed Force
in his system.

171
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:18,127
We don't even have proof
that he's a speedster,

172
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,661
much less from another earth?

173
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:21,197
Not necessarily.

174
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,331
What does that mean?

175
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,167
Well, Jay doesn't know this,

176
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,601
but while I was testing
his heart rate,

177
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:27,403
blood pressure,
and motor responses,

178
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:31,240
I also measured his autonomic
reactions while we were talking.

179
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,742
You gave him
a lie detector test?

180
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,146
And he passed it.

181
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,415
What if he's not a good guy,

182
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,317
and he just wants to
find our weaknesses?

183
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,487
Keep running tests.
See what else you can find out.

184
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,668
Detective West, sir.

185
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,670
Yes, Officer...?

186
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,939
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

187
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,608
Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions

188
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,476
available on your
anti-meta-human task force.

189
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,112
Yeah, everybody quit.
There is no task force anymore.

190
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:13,583
Well, I know someone
who's interested in being on it.

191
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:15,250
Me.

192
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,418
You do realize that

193
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,952
meta-humans have
super powers, right?

194
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:19,588
And even if they didn't,

195
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,423
you wouldn't be
a good fit for the team.

196
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,824
Because I'm a woman?

197
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,627
I didn't mean to imply that.

198
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,297
Good, because I know how
difficult this job would be,

199
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,231
but I think
I'm an excellent candidate.

200
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,901
I triple-majored at Hudson in
biology, chemistry, and physics.

201
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,769
I'm in prime physical condition.

202
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,804
And I rated top of my class
in marksmanship.

203
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,206
Your class?

204
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,707
You don't even have
your stripes yet.

205
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,442
Soon. Been on the job
seven months, sir.

206
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,678
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

207
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,979
Detective Thawne, yes.

208
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,415
I know that he died
and the one before him,

209
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:48,783
Fred Chyre, died, too, but the
one before that's not dead,

210
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:50,086
just transferred.

211
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,020
I'm sure it had nothing
to do with you.

212
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:55,225
- Listen, Officer...
- Spivot, Patty Spivot.

213
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,460
Yes, Spivot, the answer's no.

214
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:59,361
All I'm asking for
is a shot, sir.

215
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,130
- Please, just an interview.
- You just had the interview.

216
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,734
Didn't get the job.

217
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,976
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

218
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,278
I get it, kid.

219
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,947
You're doing
what you think you have to.

220
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,182
But you'll all realize
soon enough that this,

221
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:22,284
the tests, it's unnecessary.

222
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,086
I want to help you, Barry,
not harm you.

223
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,154
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

224
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,956
If what you told me
about Zoom is true,

225
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,692
that he sent Rothstein here
to kill you,

226
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,226
instead of locking me up
in here,

227
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,227
you better start listening.

228
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,828
Because if Zoom is involved,

229
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:36,030
you are gonna need a lot more
than just me at your side

230
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,533
to stay alive.

231
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,768
Barry, there's a fire
at the waterfront.

232
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,503
Fire department's en route.

233
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,672
I'm on my way.

234
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,606
Be careful.

235
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:06,902
That was the Flash.

236
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,746
That was a big fire.

237
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,248
It's out, Cisco.

238
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,015
Copy that, see you in a bit.

239
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:41,369
I thought it would be
harder than this.

240
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:56,485
Barry?

241
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:59,153
Hello? Are you there?

242
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,822
- What was that?
- I don't know.

243
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,825
We need to find out.

244
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,462
- Bar.
- Hey.

245
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:09,831
What are we dealing with here?

246
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:12,265
Well, definitely a meta-human.

247
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,434
Had a pretty solid look
at him between punches.

248
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:16,571
And he was, like, made of sand.

249
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,838
Sand?

250
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,441
- Okay.
- These walls are too porous

251
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,775
to pull any prints.

252
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,076
I can't even get one
off the boat,

253
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,145
but check this out.

254
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:28,716
There's gasoline burns
everywhere.

255
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,217
Water didn't go off.

256
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,888
Sprinklers weren't working.

257
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,588
This was arson.

258
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:37,057
Excuse me? Barry Allen?

259
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,659
- Yeah.
- Hi.

260
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:41,461
Two days in a row, Officer.
What a coincidence.

261
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:44,432
Or kismet, if you
believe in destiny or fate.

262
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:48,570
- I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
- Hey.

263
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:49,703
I'm really excited to meet you.

264
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:52,240
- I'm a huge fan.
- Excuse me?

265
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:55,109
Your forensic reports.
I-I read them sometimes.

266
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,546
Who am I kidding? All the time.

267
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,246
I've actually read them all.

268
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,149
Wow, I don't think that
I've read them all.

269
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,052
They're always so detailed.
You know, they really paint

270
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,153
a picture like you were
somehow actually there

271
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:08,756
when somebody was being
brutally murdered.

272
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,724
Thank you.

273
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:13,695
Uh, anyhow, I-I found,
uh, something.

274
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,964
Well, I think I found something.
It's just a theory,

275
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,499
- but I would like to show you.
- Great.

276
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,970
So, this right here is
the point of origin of the fire.

277
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,371
And look.

278
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:25,673
I don't know a sandblaster
on the market

279
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,174
that can make a cut
that precise,

280
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,577
so I think a meta-human
may have done this.

281
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,712
Here. Took a sample for you.

282
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,346
Uh, there's also some
fingerprints

283
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:34,682
on the back of the pipe.

284
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,618
You should have gone
into CSI work.

285
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,352
I love the science, but out
here's where all the action is.

286
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,855
Isn't that right,
Detective West?

287
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:44,125
The answer's still no,
Officer S...

288
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:47,161
- Spivot, yeah.
- Spivot.

289
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,763
What was that about?

290
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:50,899
I'm trying to join
the anti-meta-human task force.

291
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,701
But you heard him.

292
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,436
Hey, he's kinda like
your dad, right?

293
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,871
So, do you have any advice
on how I can crack his no-code?

294
00:12:57,874 --> 00:13:00,808
Yeah, I've been trying to
pick that lock since I was 11.

295
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:03,077
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

296
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,278
- Deal.
- All right.

297
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,346
It was nice to meet you, Barry.

298
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,548
Yeah, you too.

299
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,759
His blood pressure is low,
his heart rate is low,

300
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,328
his oxygen levels
are impressive.

301
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:23,932
Yeah, but nothing compared
to Barry's.

302
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,335
No, but he's certainly in
the physical specimen range.

303
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:30,403
In more ways than one.

304
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:33,040
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

305
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,875
That's enough for today, Jay.

306
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,510
Thank you.

307
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:40,115
Found it at the crime scene.

308
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,850
I mean, it's gotta be from the
meta-human that attacked me.

309
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:45,552
What is this stuff? Sand?

310
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,154
It's not sand.

311
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:49,289
It's human cells
whose myosin II protein

312
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,292
have migrated to
the cell's periphery.

313
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,394
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

314
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:56,563
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

315
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,633
giving them the appearance
of sand.

316
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,534
And how do you know this?

317
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,936
The belong to a meta-human

318
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,203
I've fought before
named Sand Demon.

319
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,504
I know you're new here,

320
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:05,940
so I'm just gonna
break it down for you.

321
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,508
The whole
"naming the bad guys thing,"

322
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,677
that's my jam.
But you know what?

323
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,812
I'm gonna let you have that one

324
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:11,879
'cause I actually kinda like it.

325
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm not mad at that one.

326
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:14,248
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

327
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,750
Oh, uh, sorry.
It was all we could find, so...

328
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,220
I was gonna say,
'cause it looks a lot smaller

329
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:23,991
on you, right?

330
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:26,695
I gotta do this thing.

331
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:29,230
So, who is this Sand Demon?

332
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,530
I don't know his name,

333
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,000
but I know how to stop him.

334
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,301
You know what?

335
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,070
I think we'll be fine
on our own.

336
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,504
Look, Barry,
I don't know what else I can do

337
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,440
to prove to you
I'm on your side.

338
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,841
I've been poked, prodded.

339
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:43,945
I even subjected myself
to a full body scan.

340
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,278
I was being thorough.

341
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,947
Sand Demon's from my world.

342
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,417
Let me teach you
how to stop him.

343
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:52,552
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

344
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,654
Zoom sent Rothstein here
to kill you.

345
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,758
He must have sent Sand Demon
here to do the same thing.

346
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,592
Don't you get it?
Anyone close to the Flash,

347
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,427
all of you,
are in a lot of danger.

348
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:02,129
All right.

349
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,065
If you're so good,

350
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,033
you would have
caught him already.

351
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:10,171
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

352
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:20,615
Hey, beautiful mind,

353
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:23,417
I think you need
to take a breather.

354
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,820
After some, uh,
lengthy calculations,

355
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:27,654
I believe I have
discovered the key

356
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:30,490
to proving the proposed
breach theory.

357
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,293
Exotic matter.

358
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:35,864
You mean, like,

359
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:37,097
transdimensional energy?

360
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,299
Precisely. Exotic matter,

361
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:42,403
transdimensional energy
will theoretically leak

362
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,838
from one universe into another.

363
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:47,008
Now, if this breach
Mr. Garrick's talking about

364
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,942
is real, if there is indeed

365
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:53,447
a hole in our universe
which leads to his earth...

366
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,149
We can make some adjustments

367
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,485
and upload an
electrophotography program

368
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:58,886
to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

369
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,054
and essentially photograph

370
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,523
the exotic matter leak.

371
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:05,826
Thereby giving us
the locale of said breach.

372
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,229
Last time I saw the kit,
it was in the fabrication room.

373
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,325
I shall return.

374
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,732
Getting gooseys.

375
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,668
All right.

376
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:18,273
Let's see what you're made of.

377
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:19,774
That's too much.

378
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,418
Barry?

379
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:39,460
I thought it'd be harder
than this.

380
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,466
What's happening to me?

381
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,216
- Hey.
- I found our meta.

382
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,484
His name is Eddie Slick.

383
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,086
We tracked those prints
to his address.

384
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,688
All right, where are you?
I'll meet you there.

385
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,722
Too late. He made me.

386
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:10,557
- What?
- Joe?

387
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:35,016
So, can I be on your task force?

388
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:47,345
That look familiar?

389
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,280
How about now?

390
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,682
- What's it look like?
- A fire.

391
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,317
There you go, genius.

392
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:55,286
It's the fire you started
in the third ward last night.

393
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,520
Man, I didn't start no fire
there last night.

394
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:59,057
What? Were you out of town?

395
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,423
Your cat get sick?

396
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,792
Well, let me guess.

397
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,094
You don't start fires anymore.

398
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:04,494
You been rehabilitated.

399
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,064
Yeah, I done it before. So what?

400
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:07,965
I didn't do this one.

401
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:11,836
I always start a fire with
something that's hard to trace.

402
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:14,071
You know, like acetone
or something.

403
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:17,875
Or maybe you don't need
to use accelerants anymore.

404
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,576
Iron Heights can hold
people like you now.

405
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,045
You know that, right?

406
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,147
You think I'm one of
those meta-human freaks?

407
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,682
If I had powers, you don't think
I would have used them

408
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,884
to get away from you?

409
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:28,385
December, 2013. Where were you?

410
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,421
- Why?
- Answer the damn question.

411
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,957
- Where were you?
- Blackgate Penitentiary.

412
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,759
You don't believe me.
Check your records.

413
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,694
Jimmy, I need you
to confirm something for me.

414
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,931
So, Joe told me what you did.

415
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:41,132
I'm impressed.

416
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:43,167
No, all I did was, you know,

417
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,701
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

418
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,403
then track Slick down
from there.

419
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,506
That's all.

420
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,307
Yeah.

421
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:51,541
How's it going with Joe?

422
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,877
You any closer to
cracking his no-code?

423
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,145
Are you kidding me?

424
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,147
He's like the permission Sphinx.

425
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,917
Or like a magic eight ball
with just one answer.

426
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,251
Or like, you know,

427
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:02,953
the Bridgekeeper
protecting the Holy Grail.

428
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,690
- What is your quest?
- Oh, to join your task force.

429
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,791
No.

430
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,231
Well, maybe I can put in
a good word for you.

431
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:19,470
That would mean
a lot to me, Barry.

432
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,538
- He needs me.
- Yeah.

433
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,675
Okay, so, Slick wasn't in
Central City

434
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,744
the night the
particle accelerator exploded.

435
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:28,980
He's lying.

436
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,748
He's a dirt bag,
and an arsonist,

437
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,250
but he's not lying about this.
He's not a meta, Barry.

438
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,652
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

439
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,119
Do you think it's possible

440
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:38,021
that the Slick in there has a...

441
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:42,059
A doppelganger? I don't know.

442
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,363
Yesterday's surprise broadcast
from a Star City vigilante

443
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:47,565
who is calling himself
the Green Arrow

444
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,000
has spawned a massive outcry of
both support and dissenters...

445
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,468
Catchy.

446
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,436
I hate it when they put
a color in their name.

447
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,638
- Yo.
- Yo.

448
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,807
- The sample you gave us?
- Yeah.

449
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:58,242
Not sand.

450
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,809
Definitely human cells.

451
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:02,012
Yeah, I know.
It's not him, I get it.

452
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:04,115
I hate to say it, but I think
this Earth-2 theory

453
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,884
- is starting to make sense.
- For real?

454
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:08,318
What, you think Jay is lying
about the Sand Demon?

455
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,554
I don't know. That's my point.

456
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,858
But I'm not gonna just believe
some guy that walks in here

457
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,528
and says a few things
that sort of check out.

458
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,963
Sort of?
He was... he was right about Zoom.

459
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,798
We don't even know
anything about Zoom.

460
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,634
What is Zoom? Is Zoom even real?

461
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:25,836
Right now, that's just,
you know, a story

462
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:27,137
around a campfire.

463
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,740
I mean, have you
discovered a breach yet?

464
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,875
Not yet, but we know how to now.

465
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:35,645
Have you found one thing to
suggest that Jay is a speedster?

466
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:38,848
Is the Speed Force
even in his system?

467
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,751
It doesn't appear to be, no.

468
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,820
See?

469
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,923
We are scientists.

470
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,657
You are a journalist.

471
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,894
We test, we prove, we report.
That's what we do.

472
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,932
Except right now, nobody here
wants to do any of that

473
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,935
except me.

474
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,605
Can we have the room
for a minute?

475
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,880
What has happened to you?

476
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,781
Are you... me?

477
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,517
Yes, you.

478
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,884
The you that I grew up with.

479
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,686
The you that is my best friend.

480
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,088
The you that became The Flash.

481
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,790
I haven't seen that you
in a very long time.

482
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,460
A lot's changed, Iris.

483
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,861
Yeah, it sure has.

484
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:27,597
You have learned how to
not trust people.

485
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,034
What is it about Jay
that you don't like?

486
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,736
I don't know.

487
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:38,276
It's because he reminds you
of Harrison Wells.

488
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,144
I trusted that man.

489
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,180
For months. We all did.

490
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,451
And you know what?

491
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:49,319
Eddie is dead.

492
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,154
Ronnie is dead.

493
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:55,593
And a whole lot
of other people in this city,

494
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,060
they are dead

495
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,662
because we trusted him.

496
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:02,066
I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

497
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:08,905
Barry, not everyone
is Harrison Wells.

498
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:13,743
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people.

499
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:17,647
Because you believed in them.

500
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,717
This team that you have here,

501
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,951
they will follow your lead.

502
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,653
They'll do what you say.

503
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:26,891
But if they think that
you don't believe in them,

504
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,792
it won't be long before
they don't believe in you.

505
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,367
Get to walking.

506
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,503
I don't want to see
your ugly mug around here again.

507
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,105
Sayonara.

508
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,176
We didn't have probable cause.

509
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,177
I get it.

510
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,445
One thing you should know

511
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:49,747
about dealing with
these meta-humans,

512
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:52,150
nothing is ever as it seems.

513
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,317
Speaking of which,

514
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,617
you're the only person here

515
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,453
who wants to be
on my task force.

516
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,822
You want to tell me why you're
so hell-bent on being on it?

517
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,991
You want to tell me
why you're so hell-bent I'm not?

518
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:07,198
Didn't I just tell you

519
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,099
I didn't want to see
your ugly mug around here again?

520
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:11,868
Well, you're gonna have to,
Detective West.

521
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:14,738
So I can get to the Flash.

522
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,380
Hey!

523
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:32,056
I like you.
You'll do the trick...

524
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,958
just fine.

525
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,634
Finally come to your senses?

526
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:53,003
Sand Demon kidnapped
a police officer.

527
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,239
A woman that I know.

528
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,506
And you need my help?

529
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:58,343
I need you to help us save her.

530
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:01,078
Before something happens.

531
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,181
I guess you're gonna have to
trust me now, huh, kid?

532
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,816
We're looking for any structures

533
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,218
that promote humidity.

534
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,386
Greenhouses, grow rooms,
anything of the sort.

535
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:11,355
His body will literally start
to fall apart

536
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:12,690
if he becomes dehydrated.

537
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,291
- Like dry sand.
- Exactly.

538
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:16,660
Sand Demon always attacks
on two fronts.

539
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,863
He creates a diversion, then
strikes when you're distracted.

540
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:20,097
Okay, then what do we do?

541
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,432
We use your speed to get to him

542
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,367
before the distraction
can happen.

543
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:26,503
Jay, how do I stop somebody
who can slip through my fingers?

544
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,906
The way I was never able to.

545
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,375
With lightning.

546
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:32,911
Yo, are you about to pull
a Zeus right now?

547
00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:34,244
What are you talking about?

548
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:35,645
Barry's gonna hurl lightning

549
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,115
from the energy he creates
when he runs.

550
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:40,084
Because lightning
plus sand equals...

551
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:41,352
Glass.

552
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,586
Time to learn
something new, kid.

553
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,457
All right.

554
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,963
Give me a sec.

555
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:55,967
Hey, are you good?

556
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,234
That was Singh.

557
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:58,936
CCPD still
hasn't found anything yet.

558
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,439
Irony is, I didn't want Patty
to have anything to do with

559
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:02,705
the damn task force
in the first place.

560
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,275
And she gets taken
because of me.

561
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:05,643
No, no, no, this isn't
your fault, all right?

562
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,412
It's hard not to think that.

563
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,314
Well, look, we're gonna
find Patty, all right?

564
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:12,916
Whatever it takes.

565
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,830
Flash is coming for you,
you know?

566
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,099
Yes, I'm sure he is.

567
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:31,368
You can't beat him.

568
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:33,903
I don't care
what powers you have.

569
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:37,174
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

570
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:40,478
Is that why you need
to build that concussive bomb?

571
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,113
Yeah, I know what it is.

572
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:45,583
I'm a cop. I've seen one before.

573
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,419
This isn't gonna kill the Flash.

574
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,519
I am.

575
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:53,357
This...is gonna kill you.

576
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,432
You know you got lucky, right?

577
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:04,134
You think you were chosen.

578
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:06,269
The rest of us
don't mean anything.

579
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,770
But it's not true.

580
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:12,309
You were just at the right place
at the right time.

581
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:14,644
Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

582
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:17,981
They only highlighted the worst
parts of who you already were.

583
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,651
Maybe you're right.

584
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:22,487
Maybe not.

585
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,654
Either way, you and the Flash
are about to find out

586
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,523
what those worst parts are.

587
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,904
RELATIVE HUMIDITY SCAN NO MATCH

588
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:33,096
I've searched all the vacant
buildings in Central City

589
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,732
and none of them fit
the description that we need.

590
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,169
And I've looked at any draw
upticks on the electrical grid.

591
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,171
Nothing out of the norm,
I'm afraid.

592
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:42,640
We gotta do whatever it takes.

593
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:47,077
I'll be back.

594
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:52,549
Okay, come on.

595
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:07,230
Flash is coming for you,
you know?

596
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:10,535
Yes, I'm sure he is.

597
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:12,502
You can't beat him.

598
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,005
I don't care
what powers you have.

599
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:19,042
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

600
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:22,011
Oh, no.

601
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:26,784
Mr. Ramon?

602
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:30,087
What are you doing down here?

603
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,155
I figured out where Patty is.

604
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:35,726
And how exactly did you do that?

605
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:38,895
Just a hunch.

606
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:40,431
We gotta tell Barry.

607
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,885
Again.

608
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,258
I've been doing this
for an hour.

609
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,826
It's not working.

610
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:09,060
It's because
you're trying to rush it.

611
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:13,031
This is the one time
you need to slow down.

612
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:15,034
Let the energy pass over you,

613
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,737
then simply direct it
to where you want it to go.

614
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,204
All right, Jay...

615
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,606
I don't know if
I'm gonna get this in time.

616
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,643
You'll get it. I believe in you.

617
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:25,278
The last person that
helped me like this

618
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,078
was a man that I looked up to.

619
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,548
Idolized.

620
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,883
He taught me how to get faster,
how to get stronger,

621
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:34,119
how to use my powers
to save people.

622
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:36,221
That same man
murdered my mother.

623
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:42,094
It's a tough break,

624
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,164
but I'm not him.

625
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,767
Yeah.

626
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,169
I know where they are!

627
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:53,205
The abandoned Woodrue
grow house.

628
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,540
That's where Slick's
keeping Patty.

629
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,142
Dude, great job.

630
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:58,778
And I was thinking,
if I were Sand Demon

631
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,880
and I were attacking a speedster
on two fronts,

632
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,847
I would probably want
to slow you down,

633
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:05,317
like, by using a concussive bomb

634
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,619
- or something like that.
- That's a good thought.

635
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,521
He's actually used one
on me before.

636
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,790
His body absorbs the blast
so it doesn't affect him.

637
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,527
Well, kid, gonna have to
think of something.

638
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:15,662
You know what?

639
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:17,396
What if we give Slick
a diversion?

640
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:18,463
He knows you, right?

641
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,832
You said you went up
against him.

642
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:22,602
Yeah, but, Barry,
I don't have my speed.

643
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:23,935
He doesn't know that.

644
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:25,305
You got your suit?

645
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,339
Sure. Well, except my helmet.

646
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:29,040
- Helmet?
- Silver kettle helmet?

647
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,276
Gold wings?

648
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:33,680
Don't tell me you guys found it.

649
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,288
Never thought
I'd see that again.

650
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:47,826
It was my father's,

651
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,394
from the War of the Americas.

652
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:51,830
Did you just say
War of the Americas?

653
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,467
I wish you would have just
told us you lost your helmet.

654
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:56,501
Would have saved us all
a headache.

655
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:05,577
Well, sure you want to do this, Flash?

656
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:07,212
Yeah.

657
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:10,250
Let's go see
what you're made of...Flash.

658
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm in the security feed.

659
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,635
Go, Barry!

660
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,906
Is that you, Flash?

661
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,174
Found your way here.

662
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:41,513
I came quite a distance.

663
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,714
I thought you were dead.

664
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,284
You were wrong.

665
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,684
Like usual.

666
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,055
Let the girl go.

667
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,023
Have at it. But you touch her,

668
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:54,661
she goes boom.

669
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:58,463
And I think even you
aren't fast enough to save her.

670
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:05,471
Quite a bit slower on
this Earth, aren't you, Flash?

671
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,048
You don't have
your speed, do you?

672
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,318
Slick's distracted. Go, Barry.

673
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,613
- Jay!
- Barry!

674
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:53,452
Patty's alive.

675
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,488
Must be my lucky day.

676
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,522
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

677
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,558
Now I get to kill The Flash
from two worlds

678
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,193
before I go home.

679
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:05,698
He's choking Jay.

680
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,432
Barry, you gotta
do something now.

681
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:20,645
Come on!

682
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,007
You okay?

683
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,075
Yeah. I'm okay.

684
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:51,376
Nice shot, kid.

685
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,848
Flash?

686
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,182
Coming.

687
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:13,388
You're pretty good at this.

688
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,250
I've had a lot of practice
over the last year.

689
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:22,582
It was really courageous
doing what you did today,

690
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,284
standing up to the Sand Demon
without any powers.

691
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:27,952
Ah, Barry did all the work.

692
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:30,055
I just stood there
and took a few punches.

693
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:32,458
It was more than a few.

694
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,427
This is a lot harder
than I thought.

695
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,929
Losing something that
was such a big part

696
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,699
of who I was for so long.

697
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:43,801
I lost something that
was a part of me, too.

698
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,204
It's hard,

699
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:49,642
but it gets easier every day.

700
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,349
You just have to find
a new way to live.

701
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,352
Just because it's
a different life

702
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,453
it doesn't mean
it's a worse one.

703
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,960
And, speed or no speed,

704
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,664
in my book you were
still a hero today.

705
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,431
I'm just sorry

706
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:16,168
we didn't all realize it
a little bit sooner.

707
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,304
Especially me.

708
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,838
I'll leave you two
speedsters alone.

709
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:25,744
So, I hear they call you
"The Scarlet Speedster""

710
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:27,679
Yeah.

711
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:29,414
- What about you?
- "The Crimson Comet."

712
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,550
What is it with

713
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,018
alliteration and nicknames?

714
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,657
Hey, look, Jay, um...

715
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,494
So, thank you for all your help.

716
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,496
And for being so patient
with me.

717
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:47,500
Nah, anytime, kid.
You're a quick study.

718
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,434
Took me a lot longer
to learn how to toss lightning,

719
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,670
believe me.

720
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,070
Then I suppose
I had the right teacher.

721
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:57,510
It's going to be a lot harder
to take down Zoom.

722
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,976
Who is this guy?

723
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,780
No one knows.

724
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,682
He showed up around the same
time as when I got my powers.

725
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,784
Killed a lot of people
in my world.

726
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:09,822
I spent about two years
tracking him down.

727
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,590
But he was too smart, too quick.

728
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,628
He's always one step ahead.

729
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,295
You really think he's just

730
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:19,331
bringing these guys here
to kill me?

731
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,599
Zoom is obsessed
with destroying me.

732
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,369
- Now he wants to destroy you.
- Yeah.

733
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:27,472
He needs to be the best.

734
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,775
And he will do whatever it takes

735
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:33,144
to ensure
he's the only speedster.

736
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:34,146
In any world.

737
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,952
- Officer Spivot?
- Detective.

738
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,152
You're supposed to be
home resting.

739
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:42,788
I'm okay, sir, really.

740
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:45,123
Look, I'm sorry you got
mixed up in all this mess

741
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,358
because of me.

742
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,327
It's not your fault.

743
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,061
Do you really think
you have what it takes

744
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,929
to be part of my task force?

745
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:53,632
I know it, sir.

746
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,534
Well, I always check the
jacket of anyone

747
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:56,735
I'm considering for it.

748
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,503
In my research on you,

749
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:01,440
I found out
we got a mutual acquaintance.

750
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:04,175
Mark Mardon.

751
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:06,177
I need you to be honest
with me here.

752
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:10,282
Why do you want to do this?

753
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,452
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

754
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:21,092
He had a little shoe shop
down on Chesterfield.

755
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:22,827
It was a cash business.

756
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:25,364
One night he went
to Fairfield bank

757
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:27,331
to make his weekly deposit,

758
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,635
and the Mardon brothers
showed up.

759
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:33,371
While he was waiting in line,

760
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:36,909
Mark shot my dad in the face
for a few hundred dollars.

761
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:43,516
Then a few months later,
Mark and his brother got powers.

762
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,418
Two murderers got superpowers.

763
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,186
So that's why I'm here, Sir.

764
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:52,824
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

765
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,092
'Cause there's some bad people
out there

766
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:59,097
and they can do anything.

767
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,599
And I may not have powers,

768
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:04,503
but I want to stop them.

769
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:07,505
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

770
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,949
Monday, 8:00 a.m.

771
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,652
Don't be late.

772
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:22,487
Uh, late for what?

773
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:25,056
The task force, Detective.

774
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:37,235
Joseph.

775
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:42,306
Hi.

776
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,510
Been a long time.

777
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:52,016
Yeah, it has.

778
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:53,853
Why are you here?

779
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,387
Because you didn't
return my calls.

780
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:00,358
And I wanted to see you.

781
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,128
And our daughter.

782
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:12,070
Any progress with
the electrophotography?

783
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,338
The satellite picture
of the city's still rendering.

784
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,842
While we wait,

785
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:19,443
care to tell me
what's going on with you?

786
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:20,813
What? Nothing.

787
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:24,682
Two hunches in one day.

788
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,518
Slick's locale,

789
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,820
and that he'd be using
a concussive bomb

790
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:30,856
to thwart Barry.

791
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:33,659
Do I need to inform you of
the odds of such a prediction?

792
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,496
Something's happening to me.

793
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,865
I'm starting to perceive things.

794
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,534
Horrible things.

795
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:46,405
It started after Wells killed me
in the other timeline.

796
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,175
It came back when Atom Smasher
attacked on Flash Day,

797
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:53,378
and then again
when Sand Demon showed up.

798
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,614
I get a vibe,

799
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:59,851
and then a vision of something
that's already happened,

800
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,653
and then it's gone.

801
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,257
That's how I knew
where Slick was.

802
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,059
Cisco, this is amazing.

803
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:10,663
We... we have to study this,
figure out just what to do.

804
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:12,230
No, no, no, we're not doing
any of that,

805
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:13,898
and we're certainly not
telling anybody, either.

806
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,101
Cisco, I would think
you'd be the one most intrigued

807
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,402
with knowing exactly what
this is and how it works.

808
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:21,005
I'm seeing things
I don't want to see.

809
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,407
And knowing things
I don't want to know.

810
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,108
I just want it to stop.

811
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,445
Professor, I don't want anyone
to know about this.

812
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:28,746
Not yet.

813
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,353
It's okay to be afraid,
you know?

814
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:38,690
Wells told me
this was my future.

815
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:44,063
That he gave me this power.

816
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:48,067
But everything he did was evil.

817
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,735
That's what scares me,
Professor.

818
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:53,505
You have to promise me

819
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,608
you won't tell anyone
about this.

820
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,077
I promise.

821
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:08,920
It appears that while
we were indeed successful

822
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,288
in closing the singularity,

823
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,824
there was an unfortunate
side effect.

824
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,893
- What are you talking about?
- Using electrophotography,

825
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:17,461
Cisco and I were able
to search Central City

826
00:40:17,463 --> 00:40:20,132
for any signs of energy
entering our earth

827
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,599
from another dimension.

828
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:25,202
From any "breaches",
as Mr. Garrick described them.

829
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:28,172
But, of course, there isn't
just one breach.

830
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,143
There's 52 of them
scattered throughout the city.

831
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:33,911
These breaches are pockets
of time and space

832
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,681
folded into and upon itself.

833
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,851
But the most significant
breach of all appears to be

834
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,286
this one.

835
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:45,724
And where exactly
is that located?

836
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:48,860
It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

837
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,463
And just beyond that breach

838
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:55,668
is an entirely diff... fferent...

839
00:40:57,403 --> 00:40:59,304
Professor?

840
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:00,405
Professor!

841
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:11,215
I'd like to personally
welcome you

842
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,152
to the Scientific and
Technological

843
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:15,019
Advanced Research Laboratories,

844
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:17,690
or, as it's more commonly known,

845
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,157
S.T.A.R. Labs.

846
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,827
Founded in 1991,
S.T.A.R. Labs is leading

847
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,563
the world in exciting
new technological discoveries

848
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,431
that, as our motto suggests,

849
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:29,735
are truly bringing us
tomorrow's world today.

850
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,304
Specializing in
artificial intelligence,

851
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:35,273
genetics, and meta-human stu...

852
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:39,844
Oh, are we in for
an unexpected treat.

853
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:43,380
It is my absolute honor
to introduce you to the founder

854
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:44,983
of S.T.A.R. Labs,

855
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:47,418
the savior of Central City,

856
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,387
Dr. Harrison Wells.

857
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,963
Hello, kids.
