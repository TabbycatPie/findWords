{\pos(115,222)}ZiMuZu.tv

16
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,170
You really did it this time, Barry.

17
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,730
- Seriously? - Yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, seriously!

19
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,320
- You come to Star City, you ask for my help, - OK.

20
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,220
and then, inevitably,

21
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,160
immediately, we end up up the creek!

22
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,440
Yeah, okay. That's fair. Thank you.

23
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,790
They're moving in.

24
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,560
On three, Team Leader.

25
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,300
What's that?

26
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,690
That would be heat vision.

27
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,330
- Three. - Okay.

30
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
{\an8} Part2

32
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,170
Kid gets faster every time we test him.

33
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,610
- Mach 2. - Already?

34
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,790
He just got his speed a few days ago.

35
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,960
How are his vitals?

36
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,380
His running economy, lactate threshold

37
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,730
are all way above expected levels.

38
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,180
I think we might have a little prodigy on our hands.

39
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,800
Like a Wizard of Whiz.

40
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,260
Guys, I don't want Wally thinking that he's Barry,

41
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,300
rushing off half-cocked,

42
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,770
trying to take down Alchemy or Savitar

43
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,220
the next time one of them shows up.

44
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,370
Okay, but guys, Wally's not like me.

45
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,200
He doesn't want his powers gone.

46
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,470
We're gonna have a hard time convincing him not to use them.

47
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,020
Yeah, well, we have to. Until he's ready.

48
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,640
How?

49
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,660
By convincing him that he isn't.

50
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,920
That means no encouraging him, no training him,

51
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,080
and you...

52
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,450
no talking to him about a suit, please.

53
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,850
It's for his own good.

54
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Why the hell not?

55
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
It's just another lie between friends, right?

56
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,890
Cisco.

57
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,460
What?

58
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,900
Still not good?

59
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,700
I think maybe we should try again tomorrow.

60
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,350
I can run a few more tests.

61
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,060
That was amazing.

62
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,870
Dinner's on me. Whatever you want.

63
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,360
Test. Test. Fellow S.T.A.R. Labs employees.

64
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,220
Your presence in the cortex would be greatly appreciated.

65
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,630
That's tonight? His presentation?

66
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,090
Great.

67
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,280
What do you think if, after, maybe we get a drink?

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,610
You, me, Barry?

69
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,440
Barry? We're just gonna get drinks?

70
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,050
Pretend like we're friends?

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,270
Nice try.

72
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,380
It ain't gonna happen.

74
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,240
You want to open S.T.A.R. Labs to the public?

75
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,440
In two weeks?

76
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,870
Soft open. Not a hard open.

77
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,810
But, you know, I'll use your input.

78
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,320
All right? Right now, it's very important

79
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
'cause the clock is ticking.

80
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,960
My vision is set to include, but not limited to--

81
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,640
bam-- a personal transportation tour of the facility.

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,670
Or, for the faint of heart, we have--

84
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,050
pow-- a virtual reality alternative.

85
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,250
Both set to include particle vision.

86
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,740
Particle... vision?

87
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,070
Particle vision, which is a moment-to-moment reenactment

88
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,440
of the particle accelerator explosion,

89
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,530
but seen from the point of view of...

90
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,500
- Part-- - The particle!

91
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,070
Listen, H.R., I know that you're trying to figure out

92
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,970
how you add value to the team, I get it, but this--

93
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,180
Let me stop you right there, B.A.

94
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,120
- Okay, don't call me B.A.-- - I can make S.T.A.R. Labs

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,420
the powerhouse in the scientific community that it once was,

96
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,200
and, moreover,

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,710
earn back the people's trust.

98
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,930
Look at you guys.

99
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,420
You just-- your faces are so darn gloomy.

100
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,540
Here's what we'll do. I'm gonna make you guys a--

101
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,800
Was that-- was that the satellite?

102
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,390
I hope that wasn't the satellite.

103
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,360
Is that a meteor?

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,990
Why, yes, that is a meteor,

105
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,620
and yes, it is heading for downtown.

106
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,380
I got to go.

107
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,930
Guys.

108
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,900
What is it?

109
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,950
Barry, what do you see?

110
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,210
This isn't a meteor.

111
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,370
Barry? Hey, Barry, come in.

112
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,930
- Can you hear me? - Guys?

113
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,250
Oh, come on.

114
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,390
Aliens!

115
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,710
Government officials are reporting

116
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,900
the mysterious object that crashed in downtown Central City

117
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,440
was simply a DOD aircraft on a routine training operation.

118
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,230
Thank you, but we'll brief the White House.

119
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,950
You're not listening to me about this.

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,380
The intelligence we've gathered at A.R.G.U.S.--

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,710
Is not accurate.

122
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,660
We've got this covered, Director Michaels.

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,880
Go back to Star City.

124
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,450
Let the big guns take over.

125
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,870
Lyla, what is this?

126
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,090
I saw the weird ship that crashed--

127
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,110
You saw a ship? What else did you see?

128
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,510
Enough to give Ridley Scott nightmares.

130
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,460
Meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs.

131
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll tell you everything I know.

132
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,660
Aliens?

133
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,630
Are they "Alien" Aliens or little green men?

134
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,040
Both, sort of.

135
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,100
Since we learned of them,

136
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,080
we've been calling them the Dominators.

137
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,050
That is not the name

138
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,490
of a species that comes in peace.

139
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,640
No, no, it's very aggressive.

140
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,350
So how long have you known about these Dominators?

141
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,630
Since the '50s.

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,170
That was them. Redmond, Oregon.

143
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,710
The government tried to cover it up.

144
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,290
What? I watch Syfy channel.

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,800
In 1951, they appeared under the same sort of circumstances.

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,460
A ship crash-landed. Little to no communication.

147
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,160
We learned they were abducting humans

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,850
to gather intel about us.

149
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,620
They attacked, and hundreds of soldiers lost their lives.

150
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,570
Then, for some inexplicable reason, they left.

151
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,440
All contact had been lost until three months ago

152
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,400
when the DOD received this.

153
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,040
We pose no threat, human inhabitants.

154
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,700
Understanding is our purpose.

155
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,150
Any action against us, as shown to us in the past,

156
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,710
will prompt swift retaliation.

157
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,990
So when we discovered four ships heading towards Earth,

158
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,690
we were concerned that it was happening all over again.

159
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,900
One of them, obviously, landed here.

160
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,900
Right, 'cause we ain't got enough crazy going on here

161
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,790
in Central City.

162
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,790
Do you know what they want?

163
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,630
They've ignored all attempts to communicate,

164
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,260
but we do know, just like before,

165
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,200
that the dropships contain reconnaissance teams

166
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,140
sent here to gather more intel about us.

167
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,600
Looking for our weaknesses.

168
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,070
- We need to do something. - We are.

169
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,010
Nearly every member state in the UN is in talks

170
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,350
to coordinate a response.

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,930
Action is being taken.

172
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,310
So, wait, you want us to just sit this one out?

173
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,530
These things are like "World War Z" Zombies.

174
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,240
If they decide to attack, no military can stop them.

175
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,390
Neither could you.

176
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,500
Not by yourself, anyway.

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,170
Just let us handle this. For now.

178
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,560
I will be in touch.

179
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,790
So the plan isn't to just stay still

180
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,920
and do nothing, right?

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,810
No.

182
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,780
Barry, you heard Lyla.

183
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,220
You can't do this alone.

184
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,610
I don't plan to.

186
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,180
Anything?

187
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,470
Zilch.

188
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,930
He's got to be here somewhere.

189
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,360
What are the chances the guy just decided

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,150
that he had enough of this life, you know?

191
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,170
No health insurance.

192
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,500
He was sick of the crazy hours.

193
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,540
I mean, bullets aren't actually that cheap, and he--

194
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,300
- I'm sorry, man. I-- - It's okay.

195
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,540
Man...

196
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,250
Hi,  Barry.

197
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,780
So, who was that guy?

198
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,450
That was Vigilante, and we nearly had him.

199
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,370
You nearly had him, Ollie?

200
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,370
It looked like he was about to

201
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,680
"Scarface" you guys.

202
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,210
Barry, is there something that I can do for you?

203
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,690
Another evil speedster to help you with or--

204
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,820
Maybe, actually. That's not why I'm here, though.

205
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,040
What's so urgent that you had to rush to Star City?

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,660
Aliens.

207
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,700
Aliens?

208
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,750
Aliens.

209
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,430
I swear to God, Barry.

210
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,620
My life was somewhat normal before I met you.

211
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,100
I-- I mean, I'm sorry.

212
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,680
Look, okay, they're real, and they're already here,

213
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,850
and, from what Lyla told us,

214
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,550
it does not appear to be for peace.

215
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,230
- Oh, no. - Lyla knows about this?

216
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,990
Lyla-- yeah, she came to--

217
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,980
where are you--

218
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,220
I called Thea.

219
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,620
Yeah, I came to have you sign this

220
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,350
before City Council went in to mutiny,

221
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,500
but that can totally wait.

222
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,800
Count me in.

223
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,950
For what? I thought you retired.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,860
Yeah, but it's-- it's aliens.

225
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,610
Aw, that is so cute.

226
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,190
You guys are just gonna get together

227
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,690
and go fight some aliens-- have you lost your mind?

228
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,990
They're aliens, and there's only four of you.

229
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,080
Not if we get Stein and, you know, all the others.

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,610
They're calling themselves the Legends.

231
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,360
Egotistical but catchy.

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you know where they are?

233
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,950
I know where they were.

234
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,100
What is this place?

235
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,460
It's this old hall hangar thing that S.T.A.R. Labs owns.

236
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,320
Or I guess I own it.

237
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,750
Well, you should do something with it.

238
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,670
All right, so let me get this right.

239
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,600
Our time-traveling buddies in a flying timeship

240
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,020
are supposed to just pop up right here, right?

241
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,150
Yeah. This is the time and place I gave them,

242
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
so if they got my message,

243
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,150
they should be here--

244
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,340
Right now.

245
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,870
You know why I've never done drugs?

246
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,210
It's 'cause I was always afraid I'd see weird stuff.

247
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,550
Okay, take everybody inside, all right?

248
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,610
- Tell Oliver I'll be right back. - Where are you going?

249
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,920
Well, since we're fighting aliens,

250
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,810
I figured we should get one of our own, right?

251
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,140
You found the right Earth?

252
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,910
Tachyon device tracked you on Earth-38 when you met her,

253
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,540
- so you should find her there. - All right.

254
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,620
Just so you know, I'm only doing this

255
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,100
because we're on a mission.

256
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm not gonna let my issues with you get in the way of that.

257
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,390
This might take a few tries.

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,950
This better be the right place.

260
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,810
'Cause if this isn't the right place,

261
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,450
someone's about to be real confused.

262
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,150
Barry?

263
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,960
I knew it!

264
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,660
I knew that was you.

265
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,060
I knew it was you in that weird space--

266
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,440
Sorry, it took a couple tries to get here.

267
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,710
This is my friend, Cisco.

268
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, friend is a loose term. We work together.

269
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,830
Hi. Cisco.

270
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,810
I have to say it--

271
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,420
this is a nice universe you got here.

272
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,300
Thank you.

273
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,610
Okay, do you remember last year

274
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,270
when I helped you out

275
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,460
and you promised to do the same for me?

276
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,490
What are we up against?

277
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,460
Team Arrow is here.

278
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,840
Team Legends is here.

279
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,710
- Is that everyone? - I think so?

280
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,400
Nate and Amaya are back watching the Waverider.

281
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,430
The newbies.

282
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,390
That was cool.

283
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,650
Guys

284
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,470
Thanks for coming.

285
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,140
Barry, I thought you were bringing an alien.

286
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,470
And, yeah, we did.

287
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,920
Everybody, this is my friend, Kara Danvers,

288
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,660
or, as she's known on her Earth, Supergirl.

289
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,870
What makes her so super?

290
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,060
Well?

291
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm convinced.

292
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,080
Best. Team-up. Ever!

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,510
Okay. I think I have this.

301
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,430
- Oliver. - Green Arrow.

302
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,880
- Dig. - Spartan.

303
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,530
- Thea. - Speedy.

304
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,620
Okay.

305
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,220
- And Sara. - White Canary.

306
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,200
- Jax and Professor Stein. - Firestorm.

307
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,320
- Ray. - Palmer. The Atom.

308
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,610
And Mick.

309
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,820
Heat Wave.

310
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,070
And...

311
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,160
Iris, Caitlin, and Felicity.

312
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,380
Yes!

313
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,780
And you, you have cold powers, but you can't use them?

314
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,040
- You have powers? - It's a long story.

315
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,630
Barry, so, Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow?

316
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,470
- Yeah. - Oh, my God.

317
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,210
- He just got so much hotter. - Oh my God.

318
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,270
Okay, Cisco, we should probably get started.

319
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,370
These are the Dominators.

320
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,770
We don't know much about them.

321
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,300
Except they're really strong.

322
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,370
I-I heard a lot of stories about them when I was a kid.

323
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,280
They came to my planet before I was born.

324
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,580
They did experiments on a lot of people.

325
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,000
Killed a lot more.

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,920
Well, they're not the only ones

327
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,760
with superhuman strength, I hear.

328
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,100
Barry says that you're more powerful than a locomotive.

329
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,710
We should use Kara as a stand-in for training.

330
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,050
Since when is Robin Hood calling the shots?

331
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
What I think Mick is trying to say

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
is it would be nice if we knew who was in charge around here.

333
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,090
Maybe we should take a vote.

334
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,960
Choose a leader. Someone we can all trust.

335
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,900
Well, I trust Oliver. He's got my vote.

336
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,510
Appreciate that, Cisco,

337
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,770
but Barry put us all together.

338
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,950
It should be him.

339
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,250
Fair enough.

340
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,810
Okay.

341
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,520
Cool, all right, well, I guess as Team Leader,

342
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,670
first thing to do is start out by...

343
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,030
- Doing a test run. - Let's do a test run.

344
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,510
Yeah, let's do a test run.

345
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,620
- Against Supergirl. - Against Supergirl, all right?

346
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,730
Test run against Supergirl.

347
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,570
Are we just supposed to pretend

348
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,950
like we don't hear him?

349
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,440
So just suit up. Mm-kay? Look alive.

350
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,150
We're training to fight aliens by fighting an alien, so...

351
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,110
- Do it. - Suit up.

352
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,240
- Stop. - What?

353
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,400
Oliver. Hey. Kara. Really quick.

354
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,680
I was excited about the two of you guys meeting each other.

355
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,970
Oliver was the first person to train me.

356
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,820
- Really? - Yeah.

357
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,710
Well, you did a really good job.

358
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,060
It's 'cause I didn't hold back.

359
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,150
I shot him. You can't hold back either.

360
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,740
- He did shoot me. - Ouch.

361
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,290
Okay. Are you sure about that?

362
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,010
I just met these people--

363
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,870
These people need to understand

364
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,130
this isn't gonna be easy.

365
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't hold back. Especially against me.

366
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,360
Yes, sir.

367
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,840
Does he not like me?

368
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,410
He's like that with everyone. He'll warm up to you.

369
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,410
Old West Dwarf Star plus Replicator, equals new suit.

370
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,270
You know what, Ray?

371
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,170
Maybe it's just me, but I think this thing's due for an update.

372
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,430
Yes.

373
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,720
But after we dominate the Dominators.

374
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,840
I see what you did there.

375
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,250
Listen. I got to get to work.

376
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,110
Felicity's waiting for me.

377
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,100
But we'll talk about this later.

378
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,000
Hey, Barry.

379
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,300
Where's Snart?

380
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,730
Man, I'm sorry, Barry. I forgot that we never told you.

381
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,620
What happened?

382
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,400
He sacrificed himself. Saved us all.

383
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,700
- He died a hero. - A Legend.

384
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,060
Wally, what are you doing here?

385
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,370
You can't just show up and think

386
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,970
you're gonna train with everyone else.

387
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,550
Why not?

388
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,200
Because we need to test you more.

389
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,870
HR Said that my results were great.

390
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,390
He said I'm good to go.

391
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,020
I don't care what HR Said. You are not ready.

392
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,620
- I am ready. - Wally.

393
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,850
Everyone here has been doing this

394
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,490
for a long time, and this is gonna be

395
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,510
the hardest challenge they have faced.

396
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,310
Fighting Alchemy or Savitar or aliens

397
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,370
isn't something you just show up and try.

398
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,090
If you screw up, you could die.

399
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,970
Do you-- do you get that?

400
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,790
Great.

401
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,980
Satellite's not picking up anything abnormal.

402
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,950
No.

403
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,470
I don't know if we're gonna find any Dominators this way.

404
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,350
I--just, I couldn't help but notice

405
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,250
things are a little bit tense.

406
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,880
You don't need to be able to Vibe to figure that out.

407
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,330
Okay, so apparently, it's, like, illegal

408
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,250
to be mad at Barry, but guess what.

409
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,670
He screws up, just like the rest of us.

410
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,270
Yeah, and when he does, he feels bad

411
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,490
like the rest of us too.

412
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,760
Felicity, he took it upon himself

413
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,440
to change the timeline.

414
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,970
And because of it, my brother was killed.

415
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,630
So there's no amount of feeling bad

416
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,200
that could ever make up for that.

417
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,970
Barry.

418
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,080
Before we start training,

419
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,310
there's something you need to hear.

420
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,360
A message that would be better

421
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,320
if we could share with you in private.

422
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,660
- All right, I'll step away. - No, no, it's fine.

423
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,010
You can stay.

424
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,090
All right, but no one else.

425
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,510
All right.

426
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,770
Let's make it quick.

427
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,390
A war is coming, Captain Hunter,

428
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,370
and at some point you're gonna be called back

429
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,750
to Central City to fight it.

430
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,600
So you need to know that, while you and your team

431
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,020
have been in the Temporal Zone,

432
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,340
I made a choice that affected the timeline.

433
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,590
As you know, whenever you alter the past,

434
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,200
those changes affect the present

435
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,010
and get compounded in the future.

436
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,280
When you return, you will be in the new timeline I created,

437
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,180
where everyone's past and everyone's future

438
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,360
has been affected, including yours.

439
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,440
When you come back, don't trust anything or anyone.

440
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,480
Not even me.

441
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,790
Where did you get that from?

442
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,420
We found it in a secret room inside the Waverider.

443
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,650
It was sent by you, 40 years from now.

444
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,870
40 years from now?

445
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,500
Barry, what the hell does this mean?

446
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,280
It means I screwed things up when I changed the past.

447
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,650
What did you do?

448
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,070
I went back in time,

449
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,340
and I saved my mom.

450
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,780
I created a timeline where she's alive.

451
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,130
It's called Flashpoint.

452
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,030
I lived in it for a few months,

453
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,630
until I realized that I made a big mistake,

454
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,070
and I tried to reset the timeline,

455
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,840
put things back to how they were supposed to be,

456
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,470
but--

457
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,660
But it didn't work.

458
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,170
No.

459
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,420
Barry, that's...

460
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,820
So what's changed since you did this?

461
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,950
Cisco's brother is dead. Caitlin has powers.

462
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,620
Diggle has a son now instead of a daughter.

463
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,810
What? John had a daughter?

464
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,520
I didn't just screw up my life, man.

465
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,630
I screwed up everybody's lives

466
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,640
and, apparently, everybody's lives in the future.

467
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,000
It felt like, when these aliens got here,

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,810
that finally something had happened I didn't cause,

469
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,750
and maybe I could make up

470
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,890
for everything I'd done to everybody, but I--

471
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,970
I think we should be on the up and up with everybody.

472
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,100
We got to tell 'em.

473
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,390
We're going up against a bunch of aliens,

474
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,250
and you want to tell people

475
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,800
that their lives might have been affected by time travel?

476
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,820
One sci-fi problem at a time.

477
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,420
You made a mistake, Barry.

478
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,650
It's part of the job.

479
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,810
But we can't deal with it today.

480
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,740
Professor Stein, are you okay?

481
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm not sure.

482
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,050
Ms. Snow, would you mind accompanying me to my home?

483
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,670
There's something I need to do.

484
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Sure.

485
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,190
She really is a badass.

486
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,200
Yeah, it's kind of hot.

487
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,810
Let's go again.

488
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,870
So this is, what,

489
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,170
your way of advising me to do nothing?

490
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,920
The Dominators have yet to engage

491
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,700
in an act of aggression, sir.

492
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,030
What does A.R.G.U.S. think?

493
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,460
I think us being passive is exactly what they want,

494
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,300
Mr. President.

495
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,860
Well, finally, someone here with balls.

496
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,770
Ike ignored all the signs and waited until it was too late.

498
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,690
I'm not gonna make that same mistake.

499
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,640
You saw what happened

500
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,420
the last time we engaged them.

501
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,580
That's a lot of casualties to be remembered for.

502
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,860
Four dropships landed on this planet,

503
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,810
all of them sent to gather intel.

504
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,010
If we do nothing and they attack,

505
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,400
that's what I'll be remembered for.

506
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,100
Proceed as instructed.

507
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,480
You know, Director Michaels,

508
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,000
the reason that Amanda Waller lasted as long as she did

509
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,410
is because she learned how to follow my lead.

510
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,000
I suggest that you acquire that trait.

511
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
Soon.

512
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,750
He's gone.

513
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
Traveller has been taken.

514
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,020
I repeat, Traveller has been taken.

515
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,920
The Dominators have the President.

516
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,590
- Hey, son. - I don't understand, Dad.

517
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,700
No one in this family wants me to have powers.

518
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,160
You don't. Barry doesn't.

519
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,150
Even Iris.

520
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,090
According to this, everything's fine with me.

521
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,310
In fact, everything is better than fine.

522
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,770
What, did you run back

523
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,700
to make sure I didn't see these?

524
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,150
I'm faster than you now, remember?

525
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,590
Whether you or Barry or anyone likes it or not.

526
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,900
Wally, look.

527
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,840
I know you're upset with me.

528
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,080
I was just trying to protect you.

529
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,260
Come on. I know you don't want me training.

530
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,490
I just don't get why.

531
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,880
Because I'm better than Barry was when he first got his speed.

532
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,230
You know, in Flashpoint,

533
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,030
you and I were a brother-sister crime-fighting unit.

534
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,240
So it sucks you don't have the same faith in me here

535
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,360
as you did there.

536
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,660
Brother and sister crime-fighting unit?

537
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,730
Hi, there, Wallace.

538
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,620
I came back to get some lip balm.

539
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,180
It's okay. You seem to be the only one

540
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,610
that'll tell me the truth around here.

541
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,300
Me?

542
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,990
We're kind of treated the same way, right?

543
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,340
No one shows us any respect.

544
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,350
Respect, I'm just trying to earn that, Wallace.

545
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,960
Maybe we should stop listening to them.

546
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah, what? What does that mean?

547
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,720
It means I want you to train me.

548
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,130
- Me? - Mm-hmm.

550
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,220
I would be gone faster than humor in a Liam Neeson movie.

551
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,330
Do you know what I mean?

552
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,510
- No. - Yeah.

553
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,450
- Not if they don't find out. - Wallace.

554
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,560
Come on. No one's gonna do this for me.

555
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,040
I want to make a difference, H.R.

556
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,090
I'm never gonna be able to

557
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,140
if I don't know how to use my powers.

558
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,740
Please. I want to help people, same as you do.

559
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,920
So show me how.

560
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,560
Nah.

561
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,610
Thank you for joining me, my dear.

562
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,860
Of course. I wasn't being much help back there anyway.

563
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,110
You know, having powers isn't exactly a death sentence,

564
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,970
no matter who your doppelganger is.

565
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,220
I attacked my friends-- my best friends--

566
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,510
and said horrible, horrible things to them.

567
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,210
But that wasn't you.

568
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,720
And believe me, as a person who sometimes shares a body

569
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,610
with another human being, I know the difference,

570
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,930
and so do your friends.

571
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm just so scared.

572
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,850
What if she comes back and I can't keep her out?

573
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,040
Then what?

574
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,080
We'll all be there for you.

575
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Are you okay?

576
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,040
You're back!

577
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm sorry. I was looking for my wife.

578
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,450
Very funny. She's not here.

579
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,770
Oh, it's so good to see you. I missed you so much.

580
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,500
Did you?

581
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,260
Of course. I love you, Dad.

582
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,290
I love you too.

583
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,950
But I'm sorry. We have to go.

584
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,640
Please--

585
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,980
tell your mother I'll see her soon.

586
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,040
- Professor Stein? - We have to leave now.

587
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,890
Where are you?

588
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,250
A war is coming, Captain Hunter--

589
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,470
Are you sure you want me to keep going?

590
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,890
Yeah. Yes.

591
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,900
Just give us five minutes.

592
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,790
Please.

593
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,090
You know what this is?

594
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,990
This is really you.

595
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
Like, future you.

596
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,830
Come on, look--

597
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,780
You told 'em, right?

598
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,590
I'm gonna tell them, yeah, when this is finished.

599
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,210
When this is finished?

600
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,110
Even though you're about to lead them through an alien war?

601
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,090
Even after Flashpoint?

602
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,700
After everything you've messed up?

603
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,340
All the lives you've changed?

604
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,450
You still don't think you should tell them?

605
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Tell us what?

606
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,900
Jax and Professor Stein found a message from me in the future

607
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,060
saying that, right now, I can't be trusted.

608
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,660
And why would future you say that?

609
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,890
I think because I went back in time and changed the timeline,

610
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,430
and now things here are different than before I left,

611
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,870
including some of your lives.

612
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,510
Some of our lives? Like who?

613
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
Cisco.

614
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,030
Caitlin. Wally.

615
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,600
Dig.

616
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,560
Me?

617
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,850
Why? What happened?

618
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,950
Apparently, you had a daughter.

619
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,570
I had a daughter, Barry?

620
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,020
Baby John was Baby Sara.

621
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,430
So, wait, you-- let me get this straight.

622
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,490
You just, uh--

623
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,080
You just erased a daughter from my life?

624
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,730
Yeah.

625
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,420
You can't go back and just change things

626
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,000
- like that, Barry. - I know.

627
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,200
You know how hard it is for me to not alter events?

628
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
To bring my sister back?

629
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,040
But I don't, because I know the implications.

630
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,470
And all those aberrations we spent the last eight months

631
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,400
traveling through time trying to correct--

632
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,250
you just decided that it was okay for you to create your own?

633
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,880
We should've told 'em before.

634
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,580
Guys? Guys, it's Lyla.

635
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,080
The President's been abducted by the Dominators.

636
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,160
She needs us now.

637
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,270
Okay, you guys go.

638
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,970
All right? I'm gonna sit this one out.

639
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,120
Obviously, you have Supergirl. She's just as fast as I am.

640
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,340
Get the President. We can talk about this later.

641
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,710
You still trust me, right?

642
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,150
I'll always trust you,

643
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,020
but it might take more to convince them.

644
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,850
If you need me, I'll be there.

645
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,500
Guys, this is cr--

646
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,120
This is crazy!

647
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,760
Everyone is going, including Barry.

648
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,530
I-- I'm not going without him.

649
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,880
Then you'll be here, Oliver.

650
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,730
Okay.

651
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,040
You know what? Oliver, it's okay.

652
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,770
I will go with them.

653
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,660
We'll get the President.

654
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,250
You stay here with Barry.

655
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,220
Sure we're in the right place?

656
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,980
Well, this is the last place

657
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,950
the President's tracer gave a signal.

658
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,520
Must be nearby.

659
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,450
Yep. He's in there.

660
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,590
How do you know that?

661
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,150
I can see him.

662
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,790
Oh, I have X-ray vision.

663
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,920
Oh. You can see everyone's bits

664
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,340
with those little peepers, huh?

665
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,220
- No, I-- - Ignore him.

666
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,420
How did you get the name Heat Wave?

667
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,730
I burned my family alive,

668
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,590
and I like to light things on fire.

669
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,250
Aah. Well, that's a colorful backstory.

670
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,940
Well, my shrink thinks so.

671
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,070
By the way, I'm not gonna call you Supergirl.

672
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,110
It's stupid.

673
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,660
You could call me Kara.

674
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
That won't work either.

675
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,610
Well, what're you gonna shout if you need my help?

676
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
Skirt.

677
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,640
Seriously?

678
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Seriously.

679
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,040
But I'm not gonna need your help.

680
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,650
Look! The President!

681
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,990
Get me out of here!

682
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,220
This doesn't feel right.

683
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,510
I agree, Jefferson.

684
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,260
Something's coming.

685
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,210
Release the President!

686
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,450
We knew you would come.

687
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,750
Did you guys hear that? 'Cause I heard it in my head.

688
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,080
Yeah, we heard it.

689
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,730
Well, if nobody else is freaked out by it,

690
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,170
far be it for me to panic.

691
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,710
You don't need to harm him

692
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,580
to get whatever it is you want from us.

693
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,280
Release him and nothing will happen to you.

694
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,800
He's not who we want.

695
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,780
It's a trap!

696
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,510
Supergirl, do something!

698
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,640
I didn't think about it, Oliver.

699
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,270
I didn't think about the future.

700
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,830
I was so focused on the past,

701
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,670
I didn't think about it until now.

702
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,900
I changed so much.

703
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,200
What is this?

705
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,640
This is an article from the future.

706
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,450
It's a story about me vanishing.

708
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,030
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

709
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,980
But now, I don't know.

710
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,830
Something's-- something's changed with Iris.

711
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,540
Something's changed with our future.

712
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,180
God, what did I do?

713
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,310
Barry, this is a weird-looking newspaper article.

714
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,320
It doesn't mean anything.

715
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,740
You need to stop beating yourself up over this.

716
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,920
I'm sorry, but how can you say that?

717
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,620
I'm responsible for all of this.

718
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,280
Maybe. Maybe not.

719
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,230
Barry, you made a choice.

720
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,380
You wanted to see your parents alive again.

721
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,290
Do you honestly know anyone that,

722
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,560
if they were in your shoes,

723
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,400
wouldn't do the same exact thing?

724
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,120
I would do the exact same thing.

725
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,100
Barry, after the Gambit went down,

726
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,860
it was me, my father, and a crewmember on a life raft.

727
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,930
Lost at sea.

728
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,280
Enough food and water for one person, maybe.

729
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,630
My father took a gun, shot the crewmember,

730
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,850
told me to survive,

731
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,260
and then turned the gun on himself.

732
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,530
He shot himself in the head.

733
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,270
He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

734
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,230
Nothing I could do. No choice.

735
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,020
Slade Wilson drove a sword right through my mother's heart,

736
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,590
in front of my sister and I.

737
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,780
I was there. I was helpless on the ground.

738
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,770
I was powerless to stop it. No choice.

739
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,430
Do you not think that I wouldn't give anything

740
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,620
to go back and to make things different?

741
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,140
You never told me that.

742
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,110
Barry, the world isn't different

743
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,910
because you changed the timeline.

744
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,730
Change happens. Tragedy happens.

745
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,260
People make choices,

746
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,710
and those choices affect everyone else.

747
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,700
You're not a god, Barry.

748
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,490
Hey, guys, wherever you are right now, we need you.

749
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,520
Oh, things just got so much worse.

751
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,180
Guys.

752
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,840
Can we talk about this?

753
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
Guess not.

754
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,260
What's wrong with them?

755
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,110
I don't know, but we need to find out.

756
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,980
Okay!

757
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,400
You really did it this time!

758
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,060
Seriously?

759
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,370
Yeah, seriously.

760
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,220
- What's that? - That would be heat vision.

761
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,120
Okay.

762
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,680
What is going on?

763
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,070
Barry and Oliver stayed behind

764
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,480
while everyone went to go save the President,

765
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,650
but now everyone's crazy

766
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,230
and going all "Kill Bill" on the both of them.

767
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,410
The Dominators have them under some sort of mind control.

768
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,100
They can't hold them off forever.

769
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,970
- I got to get out there. - The hell you do.

770
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,100
They can't beat them by themselves,

771
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,910
especially not with Supergirl against them.

772
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,390
Wally?

773
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,390
Kid Flash.

774
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,670
Wally? Talk to me,

775
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,250
Hey! Come on.

776
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,280
Guys. Wally's hurt bad, but he's alive.

777
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,560
Let's get an ETA on overriding the mind control!

778
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,010
- Bingo! - Yahtzee!

779
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,660
You go first. You go first. It's your office.

780
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,410
There's a weird signal coming from the salt mines.

782
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,060
For the record, that is what I was gonna say.

783
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,150
Can you jam it?

784
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,010
Uh, no.

785
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,680
How many of those do you have left?

786
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,930
Probably not enough.

787
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay, this hallway leads to a bunker under the building.

788
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,640
Just hold 'em off as long as you can.

789
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Where are you going?

790
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,950
If they can't shut it down, maybe she can.

791
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,970
Hey, Supergirl!

792
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,950
Let's finally see who's faster.

793
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,400
Too slow.

794
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,700
- What is he doing? - He's making her angry.

795
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,090
But he knows Supergirl is invincible.

796
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,130
Think maybe that's the point.

797
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,780
Barry?

798
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,700
Guys, they're back.

799
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,360
What happened?

800
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,650
You didn't kill me, so my day's looking up.

801
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,560
I'm so sorry.

802
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,030
Hey, you're not the first superhero to be mind-controlled.

803
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,400
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,

804
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,310
but I had to do something.

805
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,170
I'm glad you're okay.

806
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,500
Don't ever do that again.

807
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,940
Sorry. Not sorry.

808
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,960
Come on. Let's get you checked out.

809
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,750
And then we can talk about how dumb that was.

810
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,970
Okay.

811
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,470
Okay.

812
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,610
Okay what?

813
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,200
They don't see your potential.

814
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,090
I do.

815
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,400
One of my many gifts.

816
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,360
You want to train?

817
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,970
I'll train you.

818
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,910
So, what was it like being all mind-controlled and stuff?

819
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,190
I didn't realize he had a mind to be controlled.

820
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,890
Barry, about before.

821
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,170
Message or no message, we're with you.

822
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,280
Thank you.

823
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,210
Where's Supergirl?

824
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,710
Scanning the city to make sure there aren't

825
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,850
any more of the orbs that whammied all of you.

826
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,130
- Okay, so now what? - We call Lyla.

827
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,520
Tell her these Dominators aren't here peacefully.

828
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,480
Sara!

829
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,870
Everybody inside! Go!
