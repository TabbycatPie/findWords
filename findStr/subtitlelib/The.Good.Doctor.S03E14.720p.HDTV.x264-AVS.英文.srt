18
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,380
What?

19
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,800
It's time to wake up.

20
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,250
It's still dark outside.

21
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,790
I'd like to have sex.

22
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,600
As romantically as that was put,

23
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,120
it's too early, Shaun.

24
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,330
It's exactly early enough to have sex

25
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,170
for the average duration it takes us

26
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,960
and still allow precisely enough time

27
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
to get ready for work.

28
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,290
How long have you been up figuring that out?

29
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,430
Since 4:53.

30
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,960
But it only took two minutes.

31
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,390
You've been waiting since then to propose this?

32
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,220
I let you sleep as long as possible.

33
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,700
That's... very considerate.

34
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,690
Sorry, I'm late.

35
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,380
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,620
Kayley has a sore throat.

37
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,870
More like this constant feeling

38
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,670
like there's something stuck in my throat.

39
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,950
And I've fainted a couple times,

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,830
which I first thought was just random.

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,060
And I'm obviously losing my voice.

42
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,830
Since I've only just met you,

43
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,520
I have no idea what your voice normally sounds like.

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,900
Well, not this.

45
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,530
Sometimes when swallowing, I get a super intense pain,

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,600
like, worse than an ice cream headache.

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,880
My internist sent me to an ear, nose, and throat guy,

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,110
an orthopedic surgeon, um, three gastroenterologists,

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,870
a voice issues specialist dude.

50
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,730
An otolaryngologist.

51
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,780
A-a neurosurgeon who thinks it might be a messed up nerve

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,540
connecting the throat to the brain.

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,090
The ninth cranial nerve, glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,930
He recommended, like, brain surgery.

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,740
Microvascular decompression.

56
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,180
Which a second neurosurgeon said I don't need.

57
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,110
You're not happy with the answers you're getting

58
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,280
from a whole bunch of recommended specialists,

59
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,120
so you came to the ER?

60
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,740
I ran out of recommended specialists.

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,040
It is an intriguing combination of symptoms.

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,530
We'll admit you and run some tests.

63
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,710
Uh, Dr. Murphy?

64
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,460
You're...

65
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,820
interesting.

66
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,570
I have autism.

67
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,430
That's so cool.

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,290
Uh, I mean, no...

69
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,320
Sor... Not... not cool that you are.

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,530
Be more insensitive, Kayley. Um...

71
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,810
It's cool that you're this...

72
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,890
totally chill, super knowledgeable medico.

73
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,330
Compliments... are very awkward.

74
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,320
Cute doctor who's gonna cure me.

75
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,860
Severe abdominal discomfort.

76
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,090
Fever, tachy, hypotensive.

77
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,500
It's okay, sweetie.

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,260
What's your name?

79
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,710
That's Marla.

80
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,750
No one to leave her with.

81
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,750
We're gonna take care of your mommy.

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,960
Abdomen tender and distended.

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,290
Dehydrated.

84
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,000
Delayed capillary refill.

85
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,960
Rapid respiratory rate.

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Skin cool and bluish, looks cyanotic.

87
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,620
She's going into shock.

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,290
We need aggressive fluid resuscitation.

89
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,550
Start broad spectrum antibiotics,

90
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,070
place an NG to decompress distended abdomen.

91
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,170
Trend her lactates, initiate complete sepsis bundle.

94
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,010
Her CBC, BMP autoimmune panel,

95
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,060
nasal swab, and blood cultures.

96
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,090
All normal.

97
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,560
That's exciting.

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,730
Negative tests are exciting?

99
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,540
No one's been able to find out what she has.

100
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm going to get brain FIESTA and time-of-flight MRI

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,310
to assess the cranial nerves and vessels,

102
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,940
and Doppler ultrasound to...

103
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,650
I have to get back to work.

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,540
Our pre-dawn romantic interlude made me late.

105
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,230
Yes. There was a flaw in my methodology.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,210
My calculation was based on

107
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,030
the mean duration of our sex overall, but generally,

108
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,200
we take statistically significantly longer

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,880
in the morning than at other times of day.

110
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,530
Well, maybe we can discuss

111
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,610
this whole timing-our-sex thing at lunchtime.

112
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,250
No, thank you.

113
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,600
I can't have lunch today.

114
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,610
Too much to do.

115
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,000
{\an9}BGM: Domino by Dylan LeBlanc

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,470
Sorry I'm late.

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,830
I was going to cancel our lunch.

118
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,870
Let me guess.

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,510
A patient more interesting than me.

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,860
Exactly.

121
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,680
Yeah.

122
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,850
She has a mysterious condition.

123
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,830
But I realized I could use our lunch to help understand it.

124
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,950
- I ordered you a salad. - Thank you.

125
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,840
How do I get an ice cream headache?

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,340
I've never had one.

127
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,680
You don't want one. Brain freeze is horrible.

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,860
The scientific term

129
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,180
is sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia.

130
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,640
The trigeminal nerve reacts to

131
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,620
rapid temperature change in the mouth,

132
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,660
sending a signal to the brain,

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,270
which responds with changes in blood flow and dura irritation,

134
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,000
which combats what it perceives as a dangerous, noxious stimuli,

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
but is just ice cream.

136
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,980
I need to experience that.

137
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,530
Okay.

138
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,740
The technique I usually use is,

139
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,080
eat way too much, way too fast.

140
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,400
I'm quitting my job.

141
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,530
The job you came back from Hershey for?

142
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,340
Don't tell Glassy. He already thinks I'm a flake.

143
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,510
You kicking me out is just what I needed.

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,740
I was in a complete rut.

145
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,970
In my personal life, at work, super stale.

146
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,520
I mean, we weren't developing anything,

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,190
just market testing designs...

148
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
That's awful!

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,790
- What's the cure? - Time.

150
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,600
- How much time? - Depends.

151
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,490
Do you think I should include my job in Hershey on my resume?

152
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,740
It hurts so much!

153
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,770
Or does it make me look like

154
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,770
I'm unable to commit to anything?

155
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,520
Okay.

156
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,790
The ultrasound showed your colon is distended.

157
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,610
We placed a rectal tube and an NG

158
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,190
to try to get that decompressed.

159
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,010
Mommy, can we go home?

160
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,940
Not yet, sweetie.

161
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,640
It would be helpful to try to find out

162
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,860
what could've triggered this.

163
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,630
Any history of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis?

164
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,580
No.

165
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,360
I, um...

166
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,960
I have had some UTIs lately.

167
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,380
That's likely not connected.

168
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,180
- Okay. - Diverticulitis?

169
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,870
Any recent international travel?

170
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,840
I have a three-year-old and no husband.

171
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay.

172
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,260
We're gonna need to keep you on IV antibiotics

173
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,810
and monitor the distention.

174
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,690
In the meantime, is there anyone who can look after Marla?

175
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,680
No one.

176
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,630
My whole family's back east. It's... It's just us.

177
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,870
I'll get a social worker to look after her.

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,010
Thank you.

179
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,250
Go ahead, honey.

180
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,640
Why is my mom upset?

181
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,510
If her anterior inferior cerebellar artery

182
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,760
is encroaching on her glossopharyngeal nerve,

183
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,760
it's very minor.

184
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,940
Certainly not enough to justify

185
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,720
microvascular decompression surgery.

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,410
I agree.

187
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,760
It could also be acid reflux, temporal arteritis,

188
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,490
laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia. We need to...

189
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,800
We need to do $50,000 of tests,

190
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,580
and it might be acid reflux?

191
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,030
Or temporal arteritis or...

192
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,910
It's a constellation

193
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,870
of relatively insignificant symptoms.

194
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,260
Have you ever had an ice cream headache, Dr. Andrews?

195
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,230
Yes.

196
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,660
I believe it didn't require brain surgery, Dr. Murphy.

197
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,630
As a compromise, we could do an MRI

198
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,890
and CT her neck and a swallow...

199
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,570
Shaun.

200
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,290
You don't compromise with your boss.

201
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,170
Start her on dilantin for her pain and send her home.

202
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,520
Can I just leave her with you?

203
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm a receptionist, not a social worker.

204
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,700
And I'm a surgeon.

205
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,570
I didn't mean I'm more important.

206
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,400
I just meant we both have more important things to do.

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,010
When will the social worker be here?

208
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,060
She said half an hour.

209
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,100
Can you page her again?

210
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,830
I want my mama.

211
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,950
Why don't you just go play with the toys, okay?

212
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,810
Do you have her number? I'll call her myself.

213
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,600
I made Mommy sick.

214
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,150
No, sweetie. It's not your fault.

215
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,620
Sometimes people just get sick.

216
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,780
Mommy drawk ma poop.

217
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,880
- Your mommy drew your poop? - No!

218
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,380
Drawk. Mommy drawk.

219
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,820
Drank?

220
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,050
Yes.

221
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,790
Mommy drawnk my poop.

222
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,880
The good news is, we've ruled out glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

223
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,380
You don't need brain surgery.

224
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Never any good news without bad news.

225
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,210
We've got a list of a few things you don't have,

226
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,920
but we don't know what you do have.

227
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,520
So you'll run more tests.

228
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,050
We can't.

229
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,140
There are 21 different things this might be,

230
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,460
but they don't want us to run 37 more tests.

231
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,260
Well, this is lame.

232
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,650
I can afford the tests. I make good money.

233
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,030
I can't keep talking like this!

234
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,160
I need a...

235
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,540
She's hypotensive.

236
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,880
Code stroke.

237
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,240
We need stat brain CT and MRI.

238
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,880
Call angio. She may need mechanical thrombectomy.

240
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,410
3 cc's of 2% lidocaine.

241
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,230
I-I didn't drink it. I just...

242
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,230
I just used her stool to do a home fecal transfer.

243
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,850
And you didn't think to mention that?

244
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,170
You said my UTIs were unrelated.

245
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,640
They didn't get better with antibiotics,

246
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,830
so I did exactly what I was supposed to do.

247
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,110
The video swore that it was completely safe.

248
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,910
Make sure your friend is completely healthy.

249
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,810
I've had the best results with vegans,

250
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,240
though if it were between an 18-year-old carnivore

251
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,010
and a 60-year-old vegan...

252
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,640
Well, don't make me choose.

253
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,540
We're gonna add the saline solution.

254
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,100
Should be a one-to-one match, more or less.

255
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,350
Then, we're gonna puree...

256
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,280
...puree, and then puree some more.

257
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,740
While it's mixing...

258
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,610
let's talk enema bags.

259
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,450
Marla must have seen her using the blender,

260
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,230
assumed she drank it.

261
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah, that's the mystery here,

262
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,670
not how anyone this stupid is still alive.

263
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,700
It's not completely irrational.

264
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,110
The E. Coli strain in drug-resistant UTIs

265
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,480
can hide out in the gut.

266
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,540
Repopulating the colon microbiome using FMT

267
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,030
has shown some success.

268
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,830
In a hospital, under controlled and sterile conditions.

269
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,320
Prep her for surgery.

270
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,860
Between the dilation and rigidity,

271
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,590
there may be colon perforation.

272
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,820
And test Marla's stool for toxins and infectious bacteria.

273
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,660
She was suffering a mini-stroke, and I saved her.

274
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,330
- I saved her. I need to celebrate.  - Outside?

275
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,990
I want to celebrate by kissing you.

276
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,770
A lot.

277
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,200
I-inside would be inappropriate.

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,770
Eagle Syndrome is very rare.

279
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,560
A longer-than-normal styloid bone

280
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,370
coming off the base of the skull.

281
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,040
- And... - I only get a five-minute break.

282
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,440
It impinged on her nerves,

283
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,280
causing the confusing symptoms

284
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,200
that baffled eight expert doctors.

285
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,440
And then when she turned her head suddenly,

286
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,410
it pinched her carotid, causing her TIA.

287
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,190
Yeah, it's him!

288
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,060
It's Dr. Murphy!

289
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,400
How do I know you?

290
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,820
He is cute!

291
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,810
Is that his girlfriend?

292
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,520
Kayley's hotter.

293
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,880
He's so cute!

294
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,560
My personal... Chernobyl.

295
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,760
What?

296
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,180
Seriously, guys.

297
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,250
Ohh, come on.

298
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,180
A zone of exclusion should be imposed around my kitchen.

299
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,860
Millions of people have watched that?

300
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,640
As of 9:00 A.M.

301
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,520
You're an influencer.

302
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,610
And you posted how I saved you?

303
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,300
But I take it I'm not saved yet? You still have to operate?

304
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,890
A normal styloid process

305
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,840
is 2.5 centimeters in length. Yours measures...

306
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
Don't do that.

307
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,000
There are two surgical options.

308
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,740
Transoral, where we go in through your mouth.

309
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,320
It's non-invasive, but creates surgical challenges

310
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,200
for physical and visual access.

311
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,380
The alternative transcervical procedure

312
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,090
involves an incision in your neck

313
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,930
with none of those access issues,

314
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,120
but with some post-operative scarring.

315
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,480
So one way is safer, but the other way, I'll look better?

316
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,110
It's a pretty bad-ass scar.

317
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,580
Can I take a bit to decide which?

318
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,870
Of course.

319
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,890
You had no right to tell the world about me.

320
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,220
It was flattering.

321
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,060
Not everyone wants to be famous.

322
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,690
If it's any consolation,

323
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,640
you've had over 70 marriage proposals.

324
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
It's not.

325
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,870
Some of us are more comfortable in the spotlight than others.

326
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,560
I think you're great.

327
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,960
Thanks.

328
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,740
I don't have to poop.

329
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,470
Be patient.

330
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,420
I don't have to poop!

331
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,780
Is there something your mom does

332
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,370
to help you when you can't go?

333
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,400
Sometimes she hold my hand.

334
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,690
Would you like me to?

335
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,310
You're not my mom.

336
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,310
Well, just keep trying.

337
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,710
Sweetie, we really need you to go.

338
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,280
If you can't, there is another way we can do this.

339
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,940
How?

340
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,660
Well, it's not fun.

341
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,490
For either of us.

342
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,820
Isolate and divide middle colic artery and vein.

343
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,970
It's an epidemic.

344
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,900
People taking online medical advice.

345
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,780
It's not the problem. It's the symptom.

346
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,060
Medical care is a financial stress for lots of people,

347
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,040
not to mention physician arrogance,

348
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,970
incompetence, impatience.

349
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,130
So it's our fault?

350
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,660
Resect and cut the colon proximal and distal

351
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,890
to the perforation with GIA stapler.

352
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,460
A friend of a friend self-diagnosed

353
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,550
her own Cushing's disease online

354
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,700
after a series of doctors barely listened to her,

355
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,550
told her to get more rest.

356
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,670
I'm guessing she didn't then perform

357
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,450
do-it-yourself brain surgery at home.

358
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,050
Claire's right.

359
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,480
I was... supporting your point.

360
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,180
She convinced me I was wrong.

361
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,220
Divide mesentery with LigaSure.

362
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,410
We have a bleed.

363
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,380
- It's major. - Tension during mobilization

364
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,330
must have caused a splenic capsule tear.

365
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,580
We need to do a splenectomy.

366
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,020
Cut the connecting attachments.

367
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,910
Kidney.

368
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,250
Diaphragm.

369
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,380
Take the vascular pedicle with a white load stapler.

370
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,350
Do not get the tail of the pancreas.

371
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,750
Dr. Melendez?

372
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,770
Can this wait?

373
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,650
I'm not sure.

374
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,220
The fecal sample that your team sent me...

375
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
It might be normal, but was it mislabeled?

376
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,310
It seems to be from a 70-year-old.

377
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,540
It's from a three-year-old.

378
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,710
SCFAs, elevated isobutyric and isovaleric acid.

379
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,080
She is at high risk for serious cardiac problems.

380
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,490
Her social media posts about Shaun have gone viral.

381
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,310
I've got reporters clamoring to speak

382
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,290
to the "twice-exceptional" Dr. Murphy.

383
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,110
Bad idea. Luckily, he won't do it.

384
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,040
He went off on Kayley about his privacy.

385
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,750
The publicity would be good for the hospital.

386
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,000
And I'm sure Dr. Glassman can make him see the wisdom of that.

387
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,910
I'm with Andrews.

388
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,060
It smacks of us patting ourselves on the back.

389
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,100
It could also come off as exploitative.

390
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,390
But the bigger issue is, it could blow up in our face.

391
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,100
Shaun is a complete communications wild card.

392
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,840
Who knows what he'll say about you, about me,

393
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,700
about being demoted, about screw-ups.

394
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
Well, we would have to coach him.

395
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,740
Do we have six years before they need to go to press?

396
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,470
I can go with him, manage the situation.

397
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,800
No, no, no.

398
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,510
If we consider Shaun an asset,

399
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,410
we shouldn't treat him like a liability.

400
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,340
I'll talk to him, see what he says.

401
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,860
You can see the proximity of her elongated styloid

402
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,410
to the nerves and carotid.

403
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,320
The trick is to break off the excess length

404
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,630
without injury to local neurovascular structures.

405
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,850
If done transcervically, entry point is key.

406
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,030
Minimizes risk of a marginal mandibular nerve injury.

407
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,460
Has she made a decision?

408
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,550
Not yet.

409
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,830
I'd like to lead.

410
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,820
Being that it's such a rare surgery,

411
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,910
I may not get another chance at it during residency.

412
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,820
When I have the benefit of supervision.

413
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,400
And it wouldn't have anything to do with hoping

414
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,090
Kayley might then post glowingly about you?

415
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,030
Not at all.

416
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,530
Well, undoubtedly, a little.

417
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,620
Given the attention this case has drawn,

418
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,460
I think we should put our best,

419
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,570
most experienced choice forward.

420
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,230
Well, this is a teaching hospital.

421
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,740
It's exactly the type of surgery we'd give to a third-year.

422
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,730
The fact that she has an online presence shouldn't be a factor.

423
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,990
And yet here you are, the Chief of Surgery

424
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,070
working a case you say a third-year can handle.

425
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,800
It also might reflect well on this place

426
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,330
to have a young woman be the face of Kayley's surgery.

427
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,020
Assuming it goes well.

428
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,100
Live by the Internet, die by the Internet.

429
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,950
You still want to lead?

430
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,590
Yes.

431
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,320
It's yours.

432
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,870
Ann?

433
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,120
Ann.

434
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,270
Am I okay?

435
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,130
You're fine.

436
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,730
We had to wake you up a little earlier than we'd like

437
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,890
because we need to discuss something with you.

438
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,010
Do you understand?

439
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,820
Your gut biome showed markers for elevated cholesterol.

440
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,220
Which you don't have.

441
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,520
Your daughter does.

442
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,750
Marla has high cholesterol?

443
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,250
She has a genetic condition, hyperlipidemia.

444
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,920
Coronary testing showed 90% narrowing

445
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,030
of the left main artery to her heart.

446
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm afraid your daughter needs urgent heart surgery.

447
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,290
- I don't want to. - Okay.

448
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,140
I'll tell the reporters that.

449
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,170
But can... can we talk about why?

450
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,360
Your computer just beeped.

451
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,380
I know.

452
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,740
I can think of a few reasons why you might be reticent.

453
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,490
- You're shy. - No, I'm not.

454
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,060
Well, you do have trouble with social interactions,

455
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,990
and you have trouble anticipating

456
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,620
what people might ask and how you might respond.

457
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,290
Yes, that is a problem when I'm meeting with a patient

458
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,290
or I'm at a job interview or I'm on a date.

459
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,800
Then my answers matter.

460
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,670
But if I'm talking to a reporter, they don't matter.

461
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,510
It beeped again.

462
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,470
Yes, I know. We're digitizing.

463
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,890
Every time a patient needs to take a drug,

464
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,010
we send them a reminder.

465
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,100
For some unknown reason, they keep sending me one, too.

466
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,810
I think stories do matter.

467
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,100
I think what you do and what you have done

468
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,760
might be inspirational for people to hear.

469
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,110
Okay.

470
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,030
Okay, you'll do it?

471
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,860
Okay, you've convinced me I should be nervous about it.

472
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,740
Now I have two reasons not to do it.

473
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,780
What's the other reason?

474
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,540
I'm very busy between doing my job and having sex.

475
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,270
I don't have a lot of free time.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,440
You should hire Lea.

477
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,330
- No. - Yes.

478
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,050
She's very good at tech

479
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,620
and isn't happy in her job right now.

480
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,740
I'll tell you what, Shaun.

481
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,140
You think about this, you really think about this,

482
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,380
how your story can benefit people,

483
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,960
and I will...

484
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,550
interview Lea.

485
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,930
Excellent.

486
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,720
I'll think about it.

487
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,020
I'll really think about it.

488
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,180
Okay.

489
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,170
Some people definitely thought I would look amazeballs

490
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,670
rocking a neck scar.

491
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,120
But the consensus was,

492
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
there's only so many turtleneck days in a year.

493
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,370
So I'm going with the no-scar approach.

494
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,710
Which one did you vote for?

495
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,430
Well, these are my people. I mean, they know me.

496
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,500
They know what's best for me and my brand.

497
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,170
"Wisdom of the crowd."

498
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,510
My warrior goddess lead surgeon.

499
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,550
We'll get you prepped for surgery.

500
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,140
New blouse? It's nice.

501
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,940
Dr. Murphy, do you have a minute?

502
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,780
I really am sorry I upset you.

503
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,910
And I really am grateful.

504
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,130
Being sick was...

505
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,760
You don't need to explain

506
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,260
why you're grateful we diagnosed your illness.

507
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,290
Well, I do.

508
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,380
You saved me and my career.

509
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,650
At first, my followers were super into

510
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,380
what I was going through, but after a while,

511
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,070
you just start being "the sick girl."

512
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,490
You give up your privacy. Doesn't that bother you?

513
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,890
I have nothing to hide.

514
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,470
No one should.

515
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,770
We should all just be who we are.

516
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,650
We are...

517
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,200
the decisions we make.

518
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,870
And you let other people make them for you.

519
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,790
So you're not being anyone.

520
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You know how you and I like to do so many things together?

521
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,360
We make clay mugs.

522
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,350
That's right.

523
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,390
Mommy was sick, and she needed to be fixed.

524
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,100
And you're sick, too.

525
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,950
I don't feel sick.

526
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,980
That's good.

527
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,670
And the doctors just want to make sure

528
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,530
everything is all better before you do.

529
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,740
How?

530
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,010
They're gonna go inside you and...

531
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,800
How?

532
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,550
They're gonna make a little cut...

533
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,510
No!

534
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,720
You're gonna be asleep.

535
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,140
- No! - Just like Mommy.

536
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,470
- I... - No, no, no, no, no!

537
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,720
I'll be with you, Marla. I'll take good care of you.

538
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,670
- No, no, no, no, no! - It's okay. Just breathe, sweetie.

539
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
- Count to three. - No!

540
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,340
- No! - Hey, sweetie, you have to be brave.

541
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,880
Code blue!

542
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,590
What's happening?

543
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,050
Please help my baby.

544
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,720
She's had a heart attack!

545
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,810
Marla.

546
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,140
Marla?

547
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,270
Marla!

548
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,600
Baby, I'm right here.

549
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,610
Marla.

550
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,480
Uh, would you like my CV?

551
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,990
No. ..

552
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,360
I know who you are. I don't need to see a list.

553
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,160
Where do I work?

554
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,950
It's a tech company.

555
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,010
You were there.

556
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,330
Cars. Something about cars.

557
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,690
You have no interest in hiring me, do you?

558
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,600
No. It's not personal.

559
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,520
It's a little personal.

560
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,940
I'm doing a favor for Shaun. I don't really need anyone.

561
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,760
Did he ask you to waste my time?

562
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,890
Yeah... It's okay.

563
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,950
I didn't really want to work for you anyway.

564
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,160
You're a bit of a grouch.

565
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,490
But make sure whoever does do the job shores up your firewall.

566
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,080
A kindergartner can hack it.

567
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,860
Thank you. I'm sure we'll be fine.

568
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,920
And you're right, you know.

569
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,360
We are not a good fit.

570
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,750
And our mutual affection for Shaun

571
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,120
isn't enough to stop us from killing each other.

572
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,830
I...

573
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,760
Your Chronicle subscription is about to expire

574
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,970
because they don't have your updated credit card.

575
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,680
The coffee maker you ordered,

576
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,520
third new one in the last six months,

577
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,560
will be delivered Tuesday.

578
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,480
And you're deducting way too much money

579
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,570
out of Debbie's paycheck for FICA.

580
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,720
Would you like to hear about your Google searches?

581
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,390
Thank you.

582
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,360
Lea!

583
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,500
Severe proximal LAD disease with mid total occlusion.

584
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,800
Angioplasty won't resolve that stenosis.

585
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,030
High risk of rupture in someone this young.

586
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,260
A stent?

587
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,460
Won't be enough effective revascularization.

588
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,580
She needs a left IMA to LAD anastomosis.

589
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,210
I've never done a coronary bypass on a three-year-old.

590
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,510
Neither have I.

591
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,570
I guess it was the right call

592
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,980
to put her daughter's poop up her tush.

593
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,610
Cost her a large chunk of her colon.

594
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,530
- Saved her daughter's life. - Yeah, lucky coincidence.

595
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,890
I'm sure the mother doesn't regret a thing.

596
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,350
At least she shouldn't.

597
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,850
I'm with Claire.

598
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,450
Do you have time for lunch?

599
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,470
And by "lunch," you mean...?

600
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,660
Lunch.

601
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,160
I need advice.

602
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,880
I need to really think about something.

603
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,210
Then yes, of course.

604
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,170
It could be patronizing,

605
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,260
being put up as some kind of feel-good, human interest story.

606
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,650
Or objectified and glorified

607
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,470
as some kind of a symbol for people who are different.

608
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,190
But I also know that when I told my sister your story,

609
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,560
she cried.

610
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,410
She was sad?

611
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,860
No, she was inspired.

612
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,760
I... don't know what your advice is telling me.

613
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,290
I don't know what you think I'm supposed to do.

614
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,620
Shaun, you aren't supposed to do anything,

615
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,130
except what you believe is right.

616
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,420
Thank you.

617
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,720
Now I'm going to go see what Lea thinks.

618
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,610
I thought you had a surgery.

619
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,900
I'm just going upstairs.

620
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,560
Lea's meeting with Dr. Glassman about a job.

621
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,280
- A job here? - Yes.

622
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,240
Lea told me at lunch yesterday

623
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,410
that she was looking for different work, so...

624
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,830
Wait, you... you had lunch with Lea? Yesterday?

625
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,400
And... and you kept it from me?

626
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,240
I didn't keep it from you.

627
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,430
There was no reason to mention it

628
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,660
until just now, when I did.

629
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,210
Shaun...

630
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,900
You know how I feel about how Lea hovers over our relationship.

631
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,900
And... you're just sneaking around with her?

632
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,490
Arranging for her to work here,

633
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,970
where she'll just loom all the more.

634
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,100
She won't be looming or hovering.

635
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,270
She'll be on a whole other floor.

636
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,700
Yeah, where you can go and get her two cents

637
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,620
whenever the advice given by your actual girlfriend

638
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,320
is deemed insufficient.

639
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,110
Yes.

640
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,840
What are you doing?

641
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,220
Eh, fresh air.

642
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,350
You?

643
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,440
Shaun lied to me about having lunch with Lea.

644
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,900
No, he didn't.

645
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Shaun is incapable of deceit.

646
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,610
He must have genuinely thought that you wouldn't mind.

647
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,260
Well, then, he is completely tone deaf and insensitive,

648
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,530
which are not better qualities in a boyfriend.

649
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,930
True.

650
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,390
But not exactly unanticipated

651
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,580
when you get into a relationship with Shaun.

652
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,390
And it's never really about the lie.

653
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
It's what's underneath.

654
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,510
You're jealous of Lea.

655
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,320
I am not jealous. I am concerned...

656
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,350
You don't need to justify. I'm on team jealousy.

657
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,560
It's flattering, stimulating, it...

658
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,120
It means you're committed and you care.

659
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,910
It's ugly and reflects underlying trust issues

660
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,620
that I don't want to...

661
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like all things,

662
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,110
a little is good, and a lot will kill you.

663
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,230
My advice...

664
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,490
Admit you're jealous, give in to it,

665
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,780
and then get over it.

666
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,560
Finding the styloid

667
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,580
via digital palpation of the tonsillar fossa.

668
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,590
There.

669
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,840
Making incision vertically along the mucosa of mandible.

670
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,470
Next?

671
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,100
I will free the styloid process from its muscle

672
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,400
and ligament attachments.

673
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,520
Done.

674
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,570
Dissecting away from the internal carotid medially,

675
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,920
and external, laterally.

676
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,830
Now fracture and excise the styloid.

677
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,310
- Bradycardia. - Hypotensive.

678
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,520
Loss of EEG waveform. Cerebral ischemia.

679
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,610
You may have injured the carotid.

680
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,440
Or compressed it by fracturing the styloid.

681
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,650
See if the fragment is impinging on the vessel.

682
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,140
Dr. Murphy, extend her head.

683
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,020
Yes. Found it. Easing it away.

684
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,360
Carotid decompressed.

685
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,870
EEG back to baseline normal.

686
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,250
Resuming styloid extraction.

687
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,070
Kayley's in ICU, stable.

688
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,740
CT shows no signs of any permanent damage.

689
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,620
No reason to anticipate any future problems.

690
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,270
So, the question is, what do we tell her?

691
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,830
That the surgery was a success.

692
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,000
She had a cerebral ischemia on the table.

693
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,340
That did no damage and that there's no evidence of.

694
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,590
Hospital policy is transparency...

695
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,420
We don't tell them what music we played,

696
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,720
what we talked about.

697
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,640
This isn't relevant to the outcome or to her prognosis.

698
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,970
Would you be taking the same position

699
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,560
if Kayley wasn't someone whose criticism could go viral?

700
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I don't know.

701
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,630
But it would be delusional to think it's not relevant.

702
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,920
Dr. Reznick.

703
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,710
Any thoughts?

704
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,230
I don't think I can fairly offer an opinion,

705
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,510
because my career could hang in the balance.

706
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,070
Yeah, well, none of us are disinterested parties,

707
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,680
given the hospital's reputation is also at stake.

708
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,940
Did you screw up?

709
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,230
Could that crisis have been avoided?

710
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,900
If it could have been, then we are all responsible.

711
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,050
We were watching everything she was doing,

712
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,820
and none of us told her to stop.

713
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,470
This is an easy call.

714
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,390
There's only one reason to tell her everything,

715
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,100
and that's you might feel guilty if you don't.

716
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,580
On the other hand, there's the future of this hospital.

717
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,510
Okay.

718
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,620
Shaun, if the patient asks for details about the surgery,

719
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,390
can you limit your answers?

720
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,980
I...don't know.

721
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,940
- Okay, we need to know if - No.

722
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,870
Dr. Murphy, I hope you will limit your answers.

723
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,530
But I won't order you to defy your conscience.

724
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,400
We don't normally have patients share rooms, but...

725
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,730
- She's...? - Gonna be completely fine.

726
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,030
And once she's recuperated,

727
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,820
we'll begin her on statins and Ezetimibe,

728
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,970
and she'll undergo lipid apheresis.

729
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,660
It's kind of like dialysis,

730
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,480
but it'll allow us to extract LDL out of her blood.

731
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,230
Should get her cholesterol to within normal range.

732
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,210
She'll need those drugs and that other stuff

733
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,420
for the rest of her life?

734
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,530
Yes. But hopefully a very long one.

735
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,160
Thank you so much.

736
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,290
Thank God I did what I did.

737
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,640
Everything went great?

738
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,330
The repair was successful. You should have no...

739
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,900
Everything went great. Say it. Say it to your fans.

740
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,900
Everything went great. 

741
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,240
You rocked it.

742
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,950
You'll be with us another few days, and then you...

743
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,530
She rocked it, right?

744
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,590
She was lead surgeon in a successful...

745
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,180
And how gorgeous is that hair?

746
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,330
Dr. Morgan Reznick, take a bow!

747
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,850
She was wrist-deep all up in my mouth, y'all.

748
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,840
She is a damn hero!

749
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,940
You've got work to do.

750
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,180
We're proud of you.

751
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,060
Any reason you screwed up?

752
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,270
I didn't. It could've happened to anyone.

753
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,080
Not anyone suffers from arthritic pain.

754
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,620
That didn't affect anything.

755
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,730
You sure about that?

756
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,400
'Cause I'm not.

757
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,380
Did you speak to Lea?

758
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,210
Yes.

759
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,010
I know she's a good friend.

760
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,400
And it would be unfair

761
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,510
for me to expect you to cut her out of your life.

762
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,890
But...

763
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,770
You going to ask her opinion right after I had given mine,

764
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,690
it just called up Wyoming all over again.

765
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,690
That you preferred Lea to me.

766
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,700
I was jealous.

767
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,160
And it's something that I have to work out.

768
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,130
For the two of us to work out.

769
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,590
Together.

770
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,720
What was Lea's advice?

771
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,940
That it'd be selfish not to share my story with the world.

772
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,650
I liked your advice better.

773
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,340
Actually, yeah.

774
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,470
There's something awkward we need to talk about.

775
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,720
You and Claire.

776
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,220
You can reopen the door.

777
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,140
There's nothing remotely improper going on.

778
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,940
I received an anonymous favoritism complaint.

779
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,230
We need to deal with it.

780
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,500
I don't want to talk to reporters.

781
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,500
I know.

782
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,020
So if I talked to reporters,

783
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,010
it wouldn't be honest to who I really am.

784
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,550
Well, sometimes, Shaun,

785
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,320
people present a different version of themselves

786
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,070
depending upon the circumstances.

787
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,660
Like, I'm not always the same here as I am at home.

788
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,980
I don't.

789
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,730
No, you don't.

790
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,230
I considered all the arguments.

791
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,280
I want to be known as a good doctor.

792
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,160
Not a good autistic doctor.
