1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,365
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,444
It's not Woodall coming after us.
It's...

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,766
Sean Cahill.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,044
Your hands weren't full with Eric.
They will be full with me.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,762
What happened to
"You think I'm staying if you leave?"

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,201
Yeah, that was before I knew you were
going to screw over Sidwell.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,890
HARVEY: Forstman
doesn't throw money around

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,970
- without getting something in return.
- I have no other choice.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,123
You two are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,368
and your girlfriend is your associate.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,005
Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,167
Oh, you went right there, didn't you?

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,161
So, we're just gonna
go back and forth, trading favors?

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,886
Are you my lawyer or not?

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,606
Seriously, Rachel,
I couldn't have done it without you.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,731
(WHISPERING)
Logan, I should go.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,769
Damn right, you get one, Hunley.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,763
Eisenheim, you silly son of a bitch.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,445
You think I'd leave you out of the fun?

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,484
Bryceman, after you killed
the Singer depo? (CHUCKLES)

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,246
Out of my way, Johnson. Coffee is
for closers. You don't get a mug.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,522
Am I to assume I'm getting
my own personal Litt Up mug?

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,880
Absolutely not.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,691
Those are mere mugs.

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,126
This, milady,

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,285
is a chalice.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,962
Okay. (WHISPERING)
It looks like all the other ones.

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,368
No, Donna. What makes
this a chalice is not the mug.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,290
It's what's inside.

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,211
- Wait a second. Is that...
- Mmm-hmm.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,570
An exact replica of the one
Dame Judy Dench wore as Ophelia.

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,167
Louis, this must have cost a fortune.

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,965
Donna, please. You helped me
overcome my stage fright.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,486
You can't put a price on that.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,931
- I don't know what to say.
- That's all you have to say.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,606
I got one for Harvey, too.

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,808
- You know, Louis, I don't think that...
- I know.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,361
He is still upset with me
for leading Mike to Forstman.

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,369
But I just thought maybe if he...

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,847
Give it to me. I will take care of it.

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,007
Thank you, Donna.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,843
Hey, Mike, Sidwell wants to see you.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,968
- Shit.
- What?

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,525
He took Forstman's money last night.

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,527
You think he knows you're going
to cut him out of the deal?

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,322
There's only one way to find out.

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,649
- You wanted to see me?
- Damn right I did.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,961
Something you want to tell me?

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,765
Jonathan, I don't know what to say.

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,730
Well, you better think of something.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,525
'Cause I just got off the phone
with some asshole from the SEC

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,166
who accused you of colluding
with Harvey Specter.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,843
(CHUCKLES) That's bullshit.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,889
Then, why the hell were the two of you
sharing a porterhouse

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,526
when you were supposed to be buying
stock for me two nights ago?

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,324
- It's not what you think.
- What I think

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,602
is you better start telling me
what's going on around here.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,801
There's nothing going on.

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,331
Look, I know that guy.
He's full of shit.

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,771
Well, I don't know him
from a hole in the ground,

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,370
but I know that
you're keeping stuff from me.

62
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,322
Jonathan, I...

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,646
First, you don't transfer
Forstman's money.

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,410
Then, you blow a straight-up
stock purchase

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,045
that any first-year trader
could do in his sleep.

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,286
It wasn't straight-up.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,926
I had to set up an auction
which happened to get postponed.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah, 'cause you were sipping wine
with Harvey Specter behind my back.

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,331
It got postponed because my girlfriend
was in the hospital.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,762
What?

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,850
Rachel passed out at school.

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,203
Harvey and I went to the hospital,
so we pushed the sale.

73
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,405
- Then, you should have told me.
- You're right. I should have. I'm sorry.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,201
But that's what happened.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,929
- That's it?
- That's it.

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,965
Fine.

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,648
But if there is anything else
that you're not telling me,

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,851
now's the time.

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,370
There isn't.

80
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,005
WOMAN: (SINGING)
I remember when

81
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,682
I remember; I remember
when I lost my mind

82
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,044
There was something
so pleasant

83
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,567
- Well?
- Allison is at dinner with some friends,

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,286
but she'll be home soon.
I have to go.

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,169
Come on. We're working.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,280
(LAUGHS)

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,011
We're not working.

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,249
I am sneaking around
pretending to work,

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,010
so that I can
spend time with you.

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,406
Sneaking around?

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,681
That's what I'd call it, wouldn't you?

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,010
I don't know. I just don't really want
to think of it like that.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,324
I have to go.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,647
Well, she's with her friends.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,008
Aren't you allowed
to be with your friends?

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,964
Is that what we are?
We're... We're friends?

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,524
I was actually

98
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,402
hoping that we're more than that.

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,043
Mmm, we shouldn't be
having this conversation.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,484
You wouldn't be here

101
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,009
if you didn't want to be
having this conversation.

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,001
LOGAN: Rachel.

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,724
We have had chemistry
from the second we met.

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,004
You know it.

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,651
And I know it.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,008
WOMAN: (SINGING)
Bless your soul

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,931
Really think
you're in control

108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,042
I think you're crazy

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,961
I think you're crazy

110
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,961
I think you're crazy

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,527
Just like me

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,730
- Rachel. Hey.
- Hi.

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,924
- What are you doing here?
- I am here because I wanted

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,044
to talk to you before you came in
to see Harvey this morning.

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,006
- Do you want some coffee?
- No.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,884
I won't be here long enough for that.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,685
Are you sure?

118
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,807
- Look, Logan...
- I know why you're here.

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,407
If you knew why I was here,
then I wouldn't need to be here.

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,681
I think you're here to tell me

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,724
that what's happening
isn't really happening.

122
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,687
But it is.

123
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,766
(LAUGHS)

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,244
I have a boyfriend that I love.

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,323
So, I need you to stop pursuing me.

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,684
No more flowers, no more looks,
no more attempted kisses.

127
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,450
No more anything, okay?

128
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,684
Look, you said that if
I knew why you were here,

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,326
you wouldn't need to be here.

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,609
I think you do need to be here.

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,643
And we both know why.

132
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,405
You're wrong.

133
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,124
I don't think I am.

134
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,604
You once told me that we had chemistry
the second that we met.

135
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,769
(SOFTLY) Logan, please.

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,246
Tell me to stop and I'll stop.

137
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,967
- I can't.
- Rachel. Rachel!

138
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,169
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,682
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

140
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,009
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

141
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,482
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

142
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,730
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

143
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,764
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

144
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,767
All right!

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,768
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

146
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,564
The greenback boogie

147
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,727
- Harvey, I need to...
- What the hell is this?

148
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,771
It's from Louis.
He wanted you to have it.

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,370
What do you mean,
he wanted me to have it?

150
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,720
(SIGHS)

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,207
You haven't talked to him

152
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,607
since Mike landed Forstman.
It's a gesture.

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,767
Now, can I please get back to what...

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,769
Oh! Why didn't you say
it was a gesture?

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,770
Mike has access to Forstman
and his four billion dollars.

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,968
Logan's on his way over
to discuss our next move,

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,287
which we can't make for two more weeks

158
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,801
because Louis thought
Sheila was marrying Lorenzo Lamas.

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,366
But I just got a mug
with something stupid printed on it,

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,845
so now, everything's okay.

161
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,164
Great. Are you done being a dick?
Because everything's not okay.

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,770
- What did Louis do now?
- Nothing.

163
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,923
And Logan Sanders isn't
on his way here

164
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,769
because he just got
brought down to the SEC.

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,966
What the hell do you think you're doing
talking to my client without me present?

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,081
Oh, he hasn't said a word yet.

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,446
We're waiting for you
to get the party started.

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,562
And what gives you the right
to bring him here in the first place?

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,761
The United States government

170
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,484
gives me the right.
So, if you don't mind,

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,761
I have a few questions
I would like to ask him.

172
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,689
You've got questions for him,
you ask me.

173
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,642
Okay. Here's one.

174
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,526
What makes you think you can get away
with collusion on my watch?

175
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,370
I already told you,
we're not colluding.

176
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,403
And you harassing my client
won't change that.

177
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,443
Will me telling him about
your date the other night

178
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,801
- with Mike Ross change that?
- What?

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,809
See, I think he and
Mike Ross are colluding

180
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,649
to allow you to purchase
Gillie Industries stock

181
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,922
- at a cut-rate price.
- That's bullshit.

182
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,405
Then, why would you set up
a private auction

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,289
while neither one of you
ended up bidding

184
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,930
and Logan here, mysteriously

185
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,929
bought the stock
without any competition?

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,929
That's it. We're done.

187
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,243
You didn't bring us in
here to ask him questions.

188
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,931
You brought us in here
to ask me questions in front of him.

189
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,371
Am I smart enough to do that?

190
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,528
You're dumb enough to try.
And we're leaving.

191
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,091
I have not dismissed you yet.

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,963
- Then, arrest us on the way out.
- (CHUCKLES) Gentlemen.

193
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,130
DONNA: Hey. What's going on?

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,851
You look upset.

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,687
No, it's nothing. Um, I just found out
I have to go to Columbia.

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,767
So, could you just tell Harvey

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,245
that I won't be able
to make the Logan meeting?

198
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,088
Rachel, there is no meeting.
Logan got hauled down to the SEC.

199
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,329
What? I just saw him this morning.

200
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,211
- That doesn't make any...
- Well, it must have been before...

201
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,960
Wait a second.
They picked him up at his condo.

202
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,569
Why were you at Logan's condo?

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,281
Donna, please don't
do your thing on me.

204
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,244
Rachel. What is going on?

205
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,328
The other night, I was working
with Logan and things got intense.

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,606
- And...
- And?

207
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,886
And he tried to kiss me.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,809
Okay. So, what did you do?

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,401
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

210
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,888
Then, why were you
at his condo this morning?

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,163
I went to tell him that I didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

212
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,489
Rachel, if you went to his place,
you were giving him the wrong idea.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,126
(SIGHS)

214
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,845
Something happened, didn't it?

215
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,006
I kissed him.

216
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,364
- How long?
- Too long.

217
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,206
Oh, God, I feel horrible.
I'm a horrible person.

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,845
No, you're not.

219
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,763
You are a great person
who had a not-so-great moment.

220
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,848
Donna, please.
You can't say a word to anyone.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,808
Of course not.

222
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,569
But, Rachel, you can't
say a word to anyone either.

223
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,524
Go ahead. Say what you're going to say.

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,330
You know what I'm going to say.
ls what he said true?

225
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,723
Logan, I'm not colluding
with Mike Ross.

226
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,729
Well, if I thought that,
I wouldn't even be standing here.

227
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,251
I'm talking about
you buying that stock.

228
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,804
- Look, I can't talk about that.
- Why not?

229
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,127
Because telling you about it
would make it parking.

230
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,366
But that doesn't matter anymore

231
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,289
because now that
that guy hauled you in,

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,890
we can't do a thing
with those shares, anyway.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,809
Well, what can we do?

234
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,207
You and Mike Ross can get
in a room together

235
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,288
and put this thing
to bed once and for all.

236
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,846
No, that's a bad idea.

237
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,008
Logan, if we don't finish this now,

238
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,766
you're going to have the SEC
crawling up your ass day and night.

239
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,402
Look, you can try to scare me all
you want, but I did nothing wrong.

240
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,888
And the last guy I'm getting in a room
with is Mike goddamn Ross.

241
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,324
Don't you ever knock?

242
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,448
Logan Sanders got taken
downtown this morning.

243
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,005
- Sean Cahill.
- Son of a bitch

244
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,724
is throwing shit at the wall
to see what sticks.

245
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,171
And what stuck?

246
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,482
Wexler. Logan found out
we bought that stock.

247
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,370
Did you tell him why
we kept it from him?

248
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,006
- He didn't seem to care.
- All right. Well, it doesn't matter,

249
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,924
because you're going
to end this takeover battle now.

250
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,327
What do you think I've been
doing for the past month?

251
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,091
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

252
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,248
This guy's already
looking at us for collusion.

253
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,805
The longer this thing drags on,

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,890
the more likely he is to come after us
for buying that stock.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,641
- In other words, end this thing.
- Not in other words.

256
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,724
In those exact words.

257
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,329
So, I guess Jonathan didn't know
you sold him out.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,480
- How'd you know that?
- Uh, because if he knew,

259
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,125
he'd have come by your office
and ripped it to pieces.

260
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,004
Instead, you're out here
enjoying a bagel

261
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,282
without the courtesy of coming
by to tell me that he didn't know.

262
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,771
My bad.

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,890
- So, now, what are we going to do?
- We're going to kick some ass.

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
Wait... What...
What are you talking about?

265
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,650
If the SEC called Sidwell,

266
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,001
then I guarantee you
they also called Logan Sanders.

267
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,762
Which means Harvey can't use those
shares and I'm in the driver's seat.

268
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,331
Well, that explains it.

269
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,965
- Explains what?
- Harvey just called.

270
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,525
He wants to have a meeting.

271
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,769
- Jeff.
- Hey.

272
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,365
Did you hear what
Sean Cahill did this morning?

273
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,811
I did, yeah.

274
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,321
(SIGHS) Then, you know he's poking
around the Wexler purchase.

275
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,806
Ah, let him.

276
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,570
- You don't seem very concerned.
- I'm not concerned

277
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,809
because I did a damn good job
protecting this firm from any liability.

278
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,811
Yeah, well, the question is,
did you protect us from all liability?

279
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,005
Is there something that
you want to ask me, Jessica?

280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,843
I want you to go back over your work
with a fine tooth comb

281
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,088
and make sure it's airtight.

282
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,851
Jessica, you're the one
who asked me to buy that stock,

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,971
and I made it questionable,
like you asked.

284
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,450
But if Sean Cahill comes at us
for attempting to park it,

285
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,324
that is on you, not my work.

286
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,604
Jeff, just go back over everything,
like I said.

287
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,406
There's nothing to go back over.
We're as protected as we can be.

288
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,806
Hey, maybe you didn't hear me.

289
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,447
Every partner at this firm
goes over their work if I say so.

290
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,928
And you know what, Jessica?
I'm not every goddamn partner.

291
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,927
So, either you trust me or you don't.

292
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,724
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Such a serious expression.

293
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,522
It's because we need to have
a serious conversation.

294
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,927
Well, let's get to it.

295
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,806
I want you to come up with a number
that we can pay you to end this thing.

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,841
And why would I do that?

297
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,850
Because Sean Cahill hauled
Logan into the SEC.

298
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,291
Well, all that means is that

299
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,641
you can't vote the shares
that you stole from me.

300
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,888
And that is a 'you' problem.

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,129
Mike, it takes two people
to make a case for collusion.

302
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,447
So, if he's coming at us,
he's coming at you.

303
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,369
Which means it's a 'we' problem.

304
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,762
Yeah, you can try
and spin it any way you want.

305
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,723
But I'm happy right where I am.

306
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,281
I guess you agreed to this meeting
just to waste my time, huh?

307
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

308
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,528
Who said I don't want to deal?

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,242
- Don't play me.
- Here's the new deal.

310
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,005
You don't buy me out.

311
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,004
- I buy you out.
- What?

312
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,248
We tried it Logan's way.
Now, we're going to try it mine.

313
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,202
Mike...

314
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,845
Because the only way I get
in a room with that guy

315
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,009
is if you guarantee
that I leave with Gillie Industries.

316
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,921
- He's not going to agree to that.
- And that's another 'you' problem.

317
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,727
Rachel, I need to know what's
going on with Logan Sanders.

318
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,847
What?

319
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,851
You spent an extra
20 hours with him last week,

320
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,363
it wasn't billed to the takeover,
and I need to know what it's about.

321
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,523
We were looking at future deals.

322
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,040
- We?
- Yes, we.

323
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,650
He asked me if I could help him

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,445
- put together some ideas and...
- Why?

325
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,881
What are you getting at?

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,843
I don't know if you've been
paying attention around here,

327
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,849
but we need to wrap this thing up.

328
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,884
So, I need to know if whatever
you and Logan were up to

329
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,884
can force him to end this thing with Mike
once and for all.

330
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,405
- It can.
- How?

331
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,844
Logan is under pressure from his board.

332
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,970
And if he doesn't close this deal soon,
he might lose control of his company.

333
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,411
LOUIS: Jessica, I must say,

334
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,285
an impromptu lunch in the middle of the
day is exactly what the doctor ordered.

335
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,561
Thank you, Louis.

336
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,531
Now, I must admit
that I brought you here because

337
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,769
I have something that I didn't want
to discuss at the office.

338
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,405
If you're firing Harvey,
I can't be in on it.

339
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,727
I just bought him an amazing mug and
we're in a really good place right now.

340
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,322
And I'm happy for you.
But this isn't about Harvey.

341
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,441
It's about the firm.

342
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,006
We recently purchased
a large block of stock

343
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,090
without realizing that we represent
a client with the same interests.

344
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,330
You're worried about the appearance
of parking the stock.

345
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,650
Exactly. And I just want to make sure
that we are as protected as possible.

346
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,211
Sure, I can do it.

347
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,449
- You seem upset.
- No, I'm not upset.

348
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
I mean, why would I be upset, Jessica?
You take me to an amazing restaurant.

349
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,845
Then, you feed me some bullshit story

350
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,928
about a stock purchase
with a fabricated company

351
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,884
when it's clear as day
this is Gillie Industries.

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,968
- Louis...
- The very same stock purchase

353
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,009
that you went to Malone to structure.
And now, you want me

354
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,610
to double check his work
because you don't trust him?

355
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,449
The question is, can I trust you?

356
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,042
- What?
- This lunch isn't about him.

357
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
It's about you.

358
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,291
You knew I'd figure this out.

359
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,844
Just like I know you'll figure out
whether or not we have exposure.

360
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,610
Now, the question is, can you
do it without telling Jeff Malone?

361
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,525
I can.

362
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,205
And I Will.

If you're going to discuss
what happened, you can just forget it.

365

Because I...

366
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,722
I am not here to talk about that
and you know it.

367
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,645
- What?
- You told Harvey

368
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,524
about my problems with the board.

369
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,003
I told your attorney about a situation
you discussed with your other attorney.

370
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,090
And now, he's using it to strong-ann me
into caving to Mike.

371
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,965
No, now, he's using it to give you the
opportunity to impress your board.

372
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,730
Did you bring Harvey that information
to get rid of me?

373
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,163
Logan, I didn't bring Harvey that
information. He asked me for it.

374
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,562
And I don't need to get rid of you

375

is never going to happen again.

Okay, Rachel,
you got what you wanted.

I'm going to get in a room with Mike
and come to an agreement.

What do you mean,
you're going to get in a room with him?

379
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,091
Well, how else did you
see this happening?

380
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,771
Did you think I was going to let Harvey
take care of it?

381
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,202
Logan, please.
You can't tell him what happened.

382
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,842
Rachel, I would never do that.

- Thank you.
- But just to be clear, it's not for him.

It's for me.

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,766
Because you say what happened this
morning will never happen again,

386
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,082
and I'm still hoping that it will.

387

you're on the losing side.

Yeah, and this is our
chance to patch it up.

- And what about Logan?
- What about him?

Because this time,
I've got all the leverage.

Well, if you have all the leverage,

412
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,287

for one more thing.

was he knows that

Jessica has nothing to do with this.
You just agreed to those terms.

465

Those were bullshit terms.

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,722

- What does it look like?

Mike, you didn't have to
blow up the deal like that.

469
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,050
- Your client blew up the deal.
- Because you blindsided him.

470
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,640
Fine. Then, once he's had
time to think about it,

471
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,761
you go back and you convince him.

472

Convince him?

I wasn't rubbing anything
in anyone's face.

475
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,047
Oh, bullshit. You had leverage

476
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,525
and you were going to
make sure he knew it.

477
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,608
And when he had leverage,
he made sure I knew it.

478
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,841
And I didn't agree to a deal

479
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,849
and then break my word
10 seconds later.

480
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,928
And I'm giving you my word.

481
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,410
Close this deal, and as soon
as it's wrapped up, he's out.

Is she going to agree to it?

and your office is within
earshot of Jeff Malone.

to hear what you're about to tell me.

backwards and forwards.

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,970
- We can't sell them back.
- I'm not talking about selling them back.

501
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,526
This mistake makes
the entire sale invalid.

502
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,243
And we don't have exposure
because the sale never happened.

503
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,966
You just give me the word and I'll
David Blaine this whole thing away.

504
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,684
Louis, this is great work.

505
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,089
But I don't want you to do anything
until you talk to Harvey.

506
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,809
- Are you sure? Because I can just...
- Louis.

507
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,285
I bought these shares
without telling him.

508
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,449
I'm not getting rid of them
without telling him. Are we clear?

509
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,965
As a bell.

510
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,047
- Well, someone saved the day.
- Do tell.

511
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,447
Jeff Malone just dropped
a giant deuce on Jessica's desk.

512
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,011
Please tell me you're
being metaphorical.

513
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,806
Nope. He made a huge mess
of the Wexler purchase.

514
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,890
- And you cleaned it up?
- Even better.

515
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,690
Because of his blunder,
I'm going to make it as though

516
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,847
his shitty deal never even happened.

517
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,770
- What did Jessica say?
- Oh, she loved it.

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,763
- And what about Malone?
- That's the best part.

519
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,763
That asshole doesn't
even know about it.

520
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,571
What do you need me to do
to make this unwind happen?

521
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,046
Nothing.

522
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,209
Jessica just wanted me
to run it by Harvey first.

523
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,051
- But I haven't been able to reach him.
- Able to reach him?

524
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,606
Louis, what do you think
is going to happen

525
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,485
if Malone gets wind of this
before you talk to Harvey?

526
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,045
Oh, shit. He's going
to try to fix it himself.

527
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,806
And once again,
he'll be taking what's rightfully yours.

528
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,367
And I'll be left holding a big bag
of Jeff Malone's giant deuce.

529
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,722
- Where are you going?
- To do what needs to be done.

530
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,328
Rachel. What the hell did you do?

531
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,487
What are you talking about?

532
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,001
Mike demanded that Harvey
dump Logan as a client

533
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,804
and it blew up the whole deal.

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,729
And based on what I know
and Harvey doesn't,

535
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,524
it wasn't Mike behind that demand,

536
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,847
it was you.

537
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,121
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry? What good does sorry do?

538
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,164
Donna, I thought it was the best thing
for everyone involved.

539
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,770
You thought it was
the best way to get Logan

540
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,245
out of the picture
and not deal with what happened.

541
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,608
No. I tried to deal
with what happened

542
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,882
without telling anyone,
which is what you told me to do.

543
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,641
I did not tell you to let your personal life
affect Harvey's business.

544
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,843
I was just trying to get Mike and Harvey
back on the same team.

545
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,325
I want you to understand

546
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,081
that the way to do that isn't to pull
strings behind their backs.

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,686
I do.

548
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,848
Okay, well, there's got
to be some way to fix it.

549
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,048
That's not the point.
It's being fixed.

550
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,491
What are you talking about?

551
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,643
Harvey's going over Mike's head.

552
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,807
He went to see Charles Forstman
20 minutes ago.

553
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,563
HARVEY: Whoever said size
doesn't matter never saw this table.

554
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,811
Is that an insult or a compliment?

555
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,605
Knowing you, Charles,
you'll take it as both.

556
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,401
How did you get in here, Harvey?
You crawled in through the vents?

557
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,801
I told your secretary I was
George Clooney's brother.

558
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,888
She said it was obvious
who got the looks in the family.

559
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,451
(LAUGHS) Great.

560
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,684
Do me a favor.
Tell her she's fired on the way out.

561
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,611
Can do.

562
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,001
But first, I wanted to show you these.

563
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,409
You want to give me the Aston Martin?

564
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,006
Give is a strong word.

565
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,406
(LAUGHS)

566
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,325
- You want me to buy you out.
- You're going to buy me out.

567
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,289
So, why come to me
instead of Mike Ross?

568
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,250
Because I put him and Logan Sanders
in a room together,

569
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,967
and those two assholes let their personal
shit get in the way of business.

570
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,443
So, what makes you think these two
assholes are going to do any better?

571
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,608
Because as much
as you hate my guts,

572
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,926
you want this deal
and that car as much as I do.

573
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,044
Harvey, taking your car
is tempting, but...

574
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,566
I don't think buying
you out makes sense anymore.

575
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,647
Why not?

576
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,810
Because you're standing
there asking me to do it.

577
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,566
Now, walk your sorry ass
out of my office.

578
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,171
Okay, Charles.

579
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,683
But I'm afraid you're forcing me
to use my leverage on you.

580
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,569
You don't have shit on me, pal.

581
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,921
Who do you think bought that
Wexler block three days ago?

582
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,486
I don't give a shit who
bought it three days ago

583
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,171
because it just went back
on the market 30 minutes ago

584
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,442
and you're looking
at the man who owns it now.

585
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,602
Jonathan, what are you doing here?

586
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,967
Forstman bought the Wexler shares.

587
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,841
What?

588
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,170
They went back on the market
and he snatched 'em right up.

589
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,802
- Holy shit.
- We win.

590
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,564
- We do?
- Mmm-hmm.

591
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,807
You do.

592
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,966
(LAUGHS)

593
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,441
It's not over yet.

594
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,682
I want you to draw up
a tender offer right away.

595
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,322
- Jonathan.
- What?

596
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,083
- I've been thinking about Forstman.
- And?

597
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,441
You know we wouldn't have been able
to do this without him, right?

598
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,402
No shit.

599
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,204
So, think about what else
we can do with him.

600
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,245
You want to team up with him?

601
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,288
Well, you don't need to convince me,

602
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,890
but how the hell are you
going to convince him?

603
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,326
- By giving him a discount on this deal.
- How much of a discount?

604
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,809
Thinking somewhere
in the neighborhood of 100%.

605
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,650
HARVEY: Goddamn it, Louis!
What the hell did you do?

606
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,125
- What are you talking about?
- I just came from a meeting

607
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,651
with Charles Forstman.

608
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,000
And when I reached
for my bargaining chips,

609
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,724
he told me I didn't
own them anymore.

610
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,524
Because you unwound
the Wexler sale.

611
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,324
I was trying to save
the firm from exposure.

612
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,647
- And who the hell told you to do that?
- Jessica did.

613
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,603
She told you to goddamn
wait and you know it.

614
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,246
Check your phone. I tried calling you.
I left three messages.

615
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,482
I don't care if you left me
a million messages.

616
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,130
You were told to wait
for my approval

617
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,766
and you didn't listen
because you never goddamn do.

618
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,291
You know what, Harvey?
I always listen.

619
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,761
I always play the good soldier.
And what do I get for it? Nothing.

620
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,921
I may not be a name partner,
but I am a senior partner. You get it?

621
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,405
(YELLING) I couldn't reach you,
and I made a goddamn judgment call.

622
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,881
You want to know why you're
not a name partner, Louis?

623
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,163
Because every judgment call
you make turns to shit.

624
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,008
Well, then, what do you want, Harvey?

625
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,570
I'll do anything to make up for it.

626
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,564
You want to do something, Louis?

627
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,129
Instead of using Donna to give me
some stupid goddamn mug...

628
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,651
(MUG CLANKING)

629
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,081
...stay the hell out of my business.

630
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,008
You mind grabbing me
a couple of packs of sugar there?

631
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,168
I don't work here.
I'm with Pearson Specter.

632
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,722
I don't give a shit who you're with.

633
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,251
If you're not here to give me something...

634
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,124
I'm here to give you Harvey Specter
on a silver platter.

635
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,530
I already have Harvey Specter
on a silver platter.

636
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,290
Not like you will
if you let me buy you out.

637
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,920
Listen, asshole.

638
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,800
Harvey came by last night
and tried to make a deal.

639
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,888
I told him to shove it up his ass.

640
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,081
You don't think I know good cop,
bad cop when I see it?

641
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,771
Good cop, bad cop doesn't work
when one of them hates the other one.

642
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,886
And what the hell is this?
Your niece's diary?

643
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,409
It's a time capsule of my rage.

644
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,764
"April 22nd, 2009.

645
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,405
"Harvey told me to file a motion

646
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,364
"to dismiss the odor
emanating from my armpits."

647
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,127
- This is a joke.
- Once again, he picked my biggest fear

648
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,170
and put it on display
for the entire world to see.

649
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,005
Oh, yeah. I can go on.

650
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,610
He hates you that bad, huh?

651
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,246
No. He doesn't give a shit about me
at all. I hate him that bad.

652
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,810
You know, you don't have
the authority to buy me out.

653
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,849
I went to Harvey's client
behind his back and I got it.

654
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,930
Oh, I see. I agree to this,
you steal his client.

655
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,890
And he'll have lost to me,

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,890
which is far more humiliating
than losing to you.

657
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,282
You'd go to all this trouble
to stick it to Harvey.

658
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,928
Read May 9th, 2012.

659
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,767
I'd go to the ends
of the goddamn Earth.

660
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,082
What was so important
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

661
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,564
I want to offer you something.

662
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,210
It's my lucky day.
Everyone's bearing gifts.

663
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,288
You want me to buy a controlling interest
in Sidwell Investment Group.

664
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,206
I want you to buy it
at an $80 million discount.

665
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,322
The exact amount I was going
to cut him out of.

666
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,887
Was?

667
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,761
Did you change your mind?
You're not going to cut him out of Gillie?

668
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,609
Guess you haven't heard.
I'm done with Gillie.

669
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,850
I sold my interest to Logan Sanders.

670
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,201
What the hell are you talking about?
That... That wasn't our deal.

671
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,401
What can I tell you?

672
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,723
When you're the biggest
bully in the yard,

673
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,128
people give you their lunch money
without you even asking for it.

674
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,242
Oh, my God.
You son of a bitch.

675
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,886
You promised me

676
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,241
that I would control what
happened to that company.

677
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,808
I promised you if we won.
We didn't.

678
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,809
- You did.
- Yes, I did.

679
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,569
Then, our other deal is off the table.

680
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,127
And you're going to give
Jonathan Sidwell his goddamn cut.

681
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,846
How about I give you
something even better?

682
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,562
- What the hell is this?
- A job offer.

683
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,650
(LAUGHS)

684
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,210
You've got to be kidding me.

685
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,884
What, you think I was going
to hang you out to dry?

686
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,571
I could use a smart son of a bitch
like you working for me.

687
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,002
You're the last person in the world
I'd want to work for.

688
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,968
I'm the only person in the world
you want to work for.

689
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,924
- And why is that?
- Because you're a nobody.

690
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,642
You're a fonner lawyer who's been
an investment banker all of 10 minutes,

691
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,331
and is about to blow the biggest deal
that ever came his way

692
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,051
unless you come over to me.

693
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,651
Go to hell.

694
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,245
Harvey, we need to have a little talk.

695
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,442
I said everything
I needed to say last night.

696
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,244
- Now, get the hell...
- I made a deal with Forstman.

697
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,326
What? You stuck your nose
in my goddamn business

698
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,807
after I told you
to never do that again?

699
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,400
No. I saved your goddamn business
after you told me to never do it again.

700
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,161
- You got him to sign this?
- Damn right.

701
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,126
And who authorized it?

702
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,641
Nobody. I lied and told Forstman
I had Logan's approval.

703
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,726
Can we get Logan's approval?

704
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,041
You're goddamn right we can.

705
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,371
Louis.

706
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,810
This has got to be

707
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,921
the most genius thing you have ever
done in your entire wonderful,

708
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,000
miserable life.

709
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,887
So, you're not mad at me?

710
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,809
Mad at you?
I could kiss you.

711
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,841
And I can let you.

712
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,646
Then go grab a couple of your mugs.
I'll crack open the scotch

713
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,649
and let's see where this thing goes.

714
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,330
Can do.

715
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,000
Hey, Louis.

716
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,204
How the hell did you get him to go for it?

717
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,804
We found common ground.

718
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,806
One more thing.

719
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,320
Charles Forstman got Litt the hell up.

720
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,764
Hey, Mike. Mike.

721
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,804
Sidwell wants to see you.

722
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,487
- Don't tell me...
- He knows.

723
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,366
Shit.

724
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,522
- You little piece of shit.
- Jonathan, let me explain.

725
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,091
There's nothing to explain.

726
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,282
You sold me out the second
you connected with Forstman.

727
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,811
No, I...

728
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,244
I... I thought I could get
out of it, all right?

729
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,771
But then, you took
Forstman's money and I...

730
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,484
Oh, you're... You're going to
put that on me?

731
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,729
I took his money because
I thought we were partners.

732
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,968
I didn't know you were going to
stab me in the goddamn back.

733
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,809
Stab you in the back?

734
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
If I didn't make this deal happen,
you said you were going to fire me.

735
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,284
I don't give a shit what I said.

736
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,846
I took a chance on you.
You spat in my face.

737
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,849
- Jonathan...
- You stood right there

738
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,169
selling me on Forstman to stop me
from finding out you betrayed me.

739
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,090
No, I did that to stop me
from having to betray you.

740
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,043
Jonathan, he still
owes us money, all right?

741
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,047
We can still go after it.

742
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,322
There isn't enough money in the world
for me to ever trust you again.

743
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,488
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

744
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,681
There is no goddamn "we".

745
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,930
You're fired.

746
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,840
Jonathan, we...
We can still talk to Forstman.

747
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,769
- All right?
- You think I didn't try that?

748
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,609
Who the hell do you think

749
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,848
told me that you sold me
out in the first place?

750
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,611
Here.

751
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,326
Put this on your mantle.

752
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,930
Remember me every time
you goddamn look at it.

753
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,648
There is the man of the hour.

754
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,811
Why didn't you tell me
what you were going to do?

755
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,362
If it didn't work, I didn't want you
to take any of the blame.

756
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,846
Well, why didn't you
tell me afterwards?

757
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,443
- It's all anyone can talk about.
- I don't care.

758
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,127
Louis.

759
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,805
Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

760
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,720
through Switzerland and the Caymans
before it comes out on the other side.

761
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,091
What?
He's trying to avoid taxes.

762
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,650
- You're obligated to report it.
- I didn't.

763
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,604
And I'm not going to.

764
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,651
Louis, that's illegal.

765
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,245
You didn't see the look on Harvey's face

766
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,727
when he found out that I was the one
who saved the day.

767
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,080
And I am

768
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,208
not going to be the one

769
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,122
to see the look on his face
when he finds out that I didn't.

770
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,291
Louis.

771
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,090
Leave me alone.

772
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,921
DONNA: Hey. Did you hear
the good news?

773
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,921
There is no good news.

774
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,729
(WHISPERING) Logan won,
which means he's not going anywhere.

775
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,645
(SIGHS) You want to tell Mike
what happened, don't you?

776
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,564
I am going to tell Mike
what happened.

777
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,841
No, you're not.

778
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,850
Harvey said he would drop Logan
when this is over, and he will.

779
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,924
And there's no way
that he's dropping Logan

780
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,289
- if Mike can't even be a client.
- What are you talking about?

781
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,925
I just got a text from Amy.

782
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,003
Donna, Mike got fired.

783
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,724
Now, you really can't tell him.

784
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,485
You said I shouldn't go behind his back.

785
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,841
But not telling him
is going behind his back.

786
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,566
Even if you were going to tell him,
this is the absolute worst time.

787
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,728
If not now, then when?

788
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,968
I mean, just wait till he recovers,
and then smack him down again?

789
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,969
How about not smacking him
down at all?

790
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,963
That would be great.

791
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,883
But I already did
when I betrayed him. And I...

792
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,967
Rachel,

793
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,450
if you do this, I am telling you,
it will bore a hole in his brain.

794
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,801
And you will be risking
your whole life with Mike.

795
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,930
I am risking it if I don't.

796
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,087
- Rachel...
- Donna,

797
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,284
Mike kept a secret from me

798
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,208
that almost ripped us apart
before we even got started.

799
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,566
And he found the courage
to trust me with it.

800
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,971
So, I need to find the courage
to trust him with this.

801
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,327
MAN: (SINGING) One day,
you'll come back here

802
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,969
For my help

803
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,328
Someday,
you'll ask to leave me

804
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,650
Couldn't it be easy

805
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,043
Silent screams, honey

806
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,569
Just ask for my help

807
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,767
Well, I'm drowning
in my clothing

808
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,801
And I'm hoping
you aren't going

809
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,809
If you need my help

810
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,730
Take a hold

811
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,571
Or a part of me

812
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,046
And ask for my help

813
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,761
