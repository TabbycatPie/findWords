1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,161
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,328
MIKE: Walter, I can't
guarantee you we'll win,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,003
but I can guarantee you that
I will never sell you out.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,565
You told me that
Mike Ross wasn't a threat,

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,409
and then he handcuffed us with a TRO.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,488
I want proof that he's giving up his bid.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,285
And if I don't get it by the morning,
I'm going to call my private investigators

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,481
and I'm going to finish what I started.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,011
What did Harvey tell you?

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,130
WALTER: Looks like he told me the truth.
We're done.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,447
I want you to stop
the personal attacks on Mike.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,085
You told me this wasn't going
to be a problem.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,807
You don't have to stop this
because you're some changed man.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,763
You have to stop this
because you owe me.

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,009
Mr. Ross. Eric Woodall.
I'm the U.S. Attorney...

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,282
For the Southern district of New York.
Yeah, I know who you are.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,845
Since when does the SEC

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,964
go around intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,846
They don't, but they will when Eric
Woodall starts there next week.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,045
Seven clients, seven subpoenas.
All coming tomorrow.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,286
Back to sin again
must be fate

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,042
The wait was all day

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,605
Uh, excuse me.
You don't have an appointment.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,803
I don't need an appointment.
Sit down, shut up, and listen.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,204
Harvey might forgive you because you
returned those recordings, but I don't.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,685
- Donna.
- Not done.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,201
What Harvey did with Gillie,
it was harsh,

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,926
but using what I told you
in a private conversation?

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,849
That crosses a line
that even Harvey never would.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,610
- Donna.
- Still not done.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,844
When you left our firm,
you left me too.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,531
But I honestly thought
that we'd always be friends.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,085
Now, I'm not so sure.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,688
Amy, did you send
Donna the package?

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,404
Guilt gift. Didn't open it.

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,602
It was a Balenciaga Classic Town bag.

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,121
- Ivory?
- Anthracite with an outside pocket.

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,241
His idea or yours?

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,448
Don't answer that.
It was yours.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,165
I'm sorry, Donna.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,847
You and Harvey want to knock each
other out, you go right ahead.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,769
But don't ever betray me again.

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,846
Nice shoes.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,642
She's even better than I imagined.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,889
And nothing ever lasts
that hesitates

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,926
HARVEY: Looking for this?

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,885
Harvey Specter.

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,206
What brings you to Montclair
at 7:00 in the morning?

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,129
Oh, you know what
brings me here.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,210
I woke up to find these
on my welcome mat.

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,443
As much as I'd love to have
been responsible

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,404
for subpoenaing
seven of your firm's top clients,

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,285
I didn't even
know about this until just now.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,721
You didn't even have
the balls to come at me directly.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,002
- Get off my property.
- What's the matter, Eric?

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,125
- You're afraid I'll get you fired again?
- (CHUCKLES) I get it.

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,525
You want to hear me say
I'm using my new position

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,449
to destroy your business,

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,291
because you're the piece of garbage
that got me fired.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,765
Isn't that what you want
to hear me say?

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,803
Oh, I know you'll never say that.

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,604
But I do want you
to admit that you sent

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,202
- an Agent Brian Harris after my firm.
- Sorry.

64
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,607
I don't even have jurisdiction
over that department.

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,246
That department's run
by a man named Sean Cahill.

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,407
So, all on his own,

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,091
Sean Cahill just happened
to target my firm.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,285
Well, he is a killer attorney
with a nose for sleazy lawyers.

69
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,084
And I should know. We came up together
at the Justice Department.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,682
You know, that little governmental
agency that protects their own?

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,770
Well, Eric, your big brother couldn't
protect you from getting fired before,

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,644
and I don't see how this is gonna
be any different.

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,043
By the way, that's yesterday's paper.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,770
- You wanted to see me?
- Sure did.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,650
Have a seat.

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,449
I was going over our trade sheets.
I couldn't help but notice

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,325
you bought another
100,000 shares of Gillie Industries.

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,291
- It's gonna be fine...
- Do I look like an asshole to you?

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,563
- Where the hell did you get the money?
- You know where I got the money.

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,605
I bought the shares on margin.

81
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,643
- And leveraged my company.
- The bylaws said I can do it.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,644
I don't care what the bylaws say.
You did this without asking.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,201
- Look, I know you're pissed...
- Oh, I'm not pissed.

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,603
I've been waiting for you
to have the balls

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,449
to do something like this
since you got here.

86
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,850
You raised my risk, but you also raised
my reward, and on top of it,

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,440
you did it like an investment banker...

88
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,686
Without permission.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,371
(CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,568
Well, thank you, Jonathan.

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,041
Go get 'em.

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,165
- One more thing.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,806
You have a week
to deleverage my company.

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,127
If you don't, you're out of a job.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,606
You wanna explain to me why you went
to Eric Woodall's house this morning?

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,200
I understand you're bent out of shape
because I stepped on your territory.

97
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,004
You think I give a shit
about my territory?

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,122
(SCOFFS) Then what the hell
are you doing in here?

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,130
Listen, I really don't care
if you work this thing or I do.

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,722
- But whoever it is has to not be an idiot.
- And how exactly am I an idiot?

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,241
- You poked the bear.
- Eric Woodall isn't the bear.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,203
No, I am.

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,721
And whatever you were about to say,
don't say it.

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,687
Harvey, this is his case.
It's why we brought him in,

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,007
- and I don't want you involved.
- Me?

106
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,805
I'm the one who found out
it's not Woodall coming after us. It's...

107
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,605
Sean Cahill.
You think I didn't know that?

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,166
HARVEY: These are my clients,
and when they call in a panic,

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,282
I need to be the voice
on the other end of the line.

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,641
Then be the voice
on the other end of the line,

111
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,364
but you're not handling the SEC.

112
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,289
I'm the reason they're coming after us.

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,402
Which is why you wanted to hire Jeff
in the first place.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,204
JEFF: That was before
all this became real.

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,641
Now that it's happening,
he doesn't want to sit on the sidelines.

116
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,364
- Damn right, I don't.
- JESSICA: Well, then, find yourself

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,087
a comfortable spot on the bench.
Because like it or not, Jeff's in charge.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,202
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

119
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,728
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,889
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,129
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,483
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

123
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,571
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,806
All right!

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,727
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,529
The greenback boogie

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,640
So, did it go
just like you said it would?

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,091
Exactly. Except for the part

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,806
where if I don't find a new investor
in a week, I'm out of a job.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,809
Well, I'm surprised he gave you a week.

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,524
(SIGHS) Amy, it's not funny.

132
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,610
I know it isn't. I was just trying
to make the best of the situation.

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,165
Well, if you want to make
the best of the situation,

134
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,765
get me a meeting
with Tony Gianopolous.

135
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,531
Because if I can't get in there...

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,007
(SIGHING) I'm in trouble.

137
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,400
We're in trouble.

138
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,886
You really mean that?

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,690
You think I'm staying
here if you leave?

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,883
- Thank you, Amy.
- I'm just kidding.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,163
Epstein's been trying to peach me
since the day I got here. Mmm.

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,248
Yeah, you think those
flowers bought themselves?

143
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,361


144
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,365
You...

145
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,805
Wow.

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,090
Can I talk to you a second?

147
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,166
If you want an update on the takeover,
you should talk to Harvey.

148
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,645
That's not why I'm here.

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,483
- Look, Logan, I... I know that you...
- I have five companies here

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,127
that I'm looking at for my next deal,
and I need someone to evaluate them

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,125
from a legal standpoint.

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,442
- Your next deal.
- Yeah, my next deal.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,167
Harvey told me not to hurt my future
by going below the belt with Mike.

154
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,250
So, instead of not hurting my future,
I thought I'd start planning for it.

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,648
So, then, maybe Harvey is who
you should be planning it with.

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,131
Well, Harvey's got stuff to do.

157
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,561
And he's not the one who convinced me
to back off Mike.

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,245
(CHUCKLING) Are you
saying that I owe you?

159
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,931
No. I'm not saying that,
but that is what you said to me.

160
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,327
So, we're just gonna
go back and forth, trading favors?

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,925
Rachel, this isn't a favor.

162
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,646
I have a board meeting on Friday.
I need to be prepared.

163
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,570
So, are you my lawyer or not?

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,687
- I will get right on it.
- Thank you.

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,961
Louis, I need your help.

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,043
- We're gonna need to...
- Don't speak.

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,611
You may speak.

168
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,166
What were you doing?

169
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,443
Just thanking the Lord God Almighty.

170
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,050
We taking down Jessica?
We firing Malone?

171
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,447
I am tingling. What, Harvey?
Just tell me what.

172
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,450
Mike Ross just bought another 2%
of Gillie Industries.

173
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,170
He must be leveraged up
to his scrawny little neck.

174
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,726
Exactly. And he's gonna be
scrambling for funding.

175
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,729
You want me to get
your TRO removed.

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,842
How do you know that?

177
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,328
Because you pissed off Judge Ramos,
and now she can't stand you.

178
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,441
How do you know that?

179
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,449
Oh, because I keep a list of
your enemies. You want to see it?

180
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,130
- Just get it done.
- Oh, I'm gonna get it done.

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,805
It's like taking candy from a baby.

182
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,288
Louis, we're splitting Mike's focus.
That doesn't mean he won't be prepared.

183
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,927
Oh, he can prepare all he wants, but
the student is about to meet the master.

184
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,641
Because Ralph Macchio doesn't stand
a chance against Mr. Miyagi.

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,723
You know The Karate Kid?
(CHUCKLES)

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,203
That's not cool, Harvey.

187
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,650
Oh, let me see
if I can guess why you're here.

188
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,924
You came to tell me the way I handled
Harvey this morning was sexy.

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,327
Oh, you mean when I told him
to leave you alone.

190
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,286
And the way that I allowed you
to do that was very sexy.

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,007
- Uh-huh.
- And this is...

192
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,091
The Griffen Cosmetics subpoena.

193
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,601
I looked them all over.
This is the weakest one.

194
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,609
- The weakest one.
- Exactly.

195
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,564
Once this one goes down,
the others fall like dominos.

196
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,569
First of all, if I were going
to take that strategy,

197
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,205
I would go for the hardest one.

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,606
Second of all,
why don't you walk yourself

199
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,848
back to your office
and let me do my job?

200
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,965
Excuse me?

201
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,048
You told Harvey you brought me in
to handle this.

202
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,801
(SIGHS)

203
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,287
Your job isn't to worry
about what I told Harvey.

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,484
Your job is to worry
about what I'm telling you.

205
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,728
Mmm-hmm.
And what I'm telling you

206
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,606
is that I'm not walking into an SEC
negotiation with a babysitter.

207
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,008
- Negotiation? This is going to be a war.
- I know that.

208
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,770
And I'm gonna win it with one shot.

209
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,245
Then I suggest
you warm up to this.

210
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,204
You're not walking into the SEC
with a babysitter.

211
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,288
You're walking in there with a bazooka.

212
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,486
(EXHALES)

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,084
- Hey, Mike, you need to see something.
- No, I don't have time.

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,611
I'm working on
the Gianopolous proposal.

215
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,644
Yeah, that proposal
isn't gonna matter if they win this.

216
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,447
Goddamn it.

217
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,683
- Harvey's trying to roll back the TRO?
- No, it's not Harvey. Check the docket.

218
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,723
It's some woman named Lois Litt.

219
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,566
(CHUCKLES)

220
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,771
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,130
I know how to handle her.
Um, here.

222
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,805
This is 90% done.
Check it over.

223
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,604
Make sure there's not
one comma out of place.

224
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,165
Uh, Mike, come on.
You know I can do more than...

225
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,442
I don't have time, Amy.
Just do it.

226
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,561
Okay-

227
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,444
(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING)

228
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,809
How long did you work
in this shithole?

229
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,047
Sorry, I'm late.
Been up to my neck in work.

230
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,083
Just filed seven huge subpoenas.

231
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,611
- Yeah, we know what you filed.
- Oh.

232
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,007
I see you brought the missus.

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,805
JEFF: Jessica, whatever
you're about to say, don't say it.

234
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,328
- How about I say it with this?
- Ooh, a subpoena?

235
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,727
- (SNIFFING) Smells fresh.
- It is.

236
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,490
And you'll be answering it
in court tomorrow.

237
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,683
Oh. Well, then, I better see what flavor
bullshit you're sewing up.

238
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,563
(READING INDISTINCTLY)

239
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,409
Ah. Ah, now, this is a good one.

240
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,808
"Malicious prosecution
of Pearson Specter clients."

241
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,291
- And how exactly are we doing that?
- JESSICA: I'll tell you how.

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,485
You come at our clients, our clients leave
us, you drop their cases.

243
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,331
Well, I certainly wouldn't tell them
that's how to avoid SEC scrutiny.

244
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,729
But it's not my fault if dropping
Pearson Specter starts catching on.

245
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,802
JESSICA: Enough bullshit.

246
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,482
You're targeting my clients on behalf
of Eric Woodall, and you know it.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,484
That is a lovely theory,
but if you had any proof,

248
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,130
you wouldn't be
standing here right now.

249
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,049
I have proof, Sean.

250
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,891
I have proof you filed seven cases
in one day against our clients,

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,129
which we both know has never
happened in the history of the SEC.

252
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,605
It has now.

253
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,530
We've filed nine cases
against clients of Weil Gotshal,

254
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,881
eight against Skadden
and six against Cravath.

255
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,727
Welcome to the new SEC.
We target law firms.

256
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,683
And as long as we're not
only targeting yours,

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,406
the only way to shut this down
is to shut us down.

258
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,808
You and I both know
what's really going on here, Sean.

259
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,201
- And I'm gonna prove it.
- Well, good luck.

260
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,251
But how do you think Judge Hopkins
is gonna respond to your allegations

261
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,569
when I tell him they're coming
from a man who was about to be fired?

262
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,203
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you didn't tell her?

263
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,608
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(WHISPERS) That's awkward.

264
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll see you in court.

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,691
- JEFF: Jessica.
- I don't wanna hear it.

266
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,644
- JEFF: Well, you need to hear it.
- What? That you lied to me?

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,444
- You know, I didn't actually lie to you.
- Oh, no, no. No.

268
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,561
You tell me that you didn't lie

269
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,250
because we never directly
asked you the question,

270
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,566
and I will knock your head off.

271
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,322
All right, fine. I lied.
I lied because it doesn't matter.

272
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,522
I wanna fight for you
and I'm the best man to do it.

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,326
Well, the new part of the equation
is that you just made me look like a fool.

274
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,891
- Jess.
- Don't pull that "Jess" shit with me.

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,286
I wanna know what it says in your file.

276
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,004
- I don't know what it says.
- How the hell do you not know?

277
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,849
Because whatever it is, is bullshit.

278
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,803
Because the reason
they were gonna fire me

279
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,331
is that I refused to go after you.

280
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,731
Then why didn't you tell me that
when you came at us demanding a job?

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,006
Because good lawyers negotiate from
a position of strength, not weakness.

282
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,446
Well, the position you just put us in
is pretty goddamn weak.

283
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,645
Ah, well, if it isn't the Boy Wonder.

284
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,603
- Louis. Hey.
- Don't "Louis" me.

285
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,121
You left without even the courtesy
of a "How's your father."

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,480
What does that mean?

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,690
It means that I'm not here
to exchange pleasantries.

288
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,963
- I'm here to get that TRO lifted.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

289
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,809
I'm also sorry to hear about Sheila.

290
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,969
Bullshit, you're sorry to hear about
Sheila... What are you talking about?

291
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
Come on, you have to have heard.

292
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,887
- Heard what?
- She's engaged.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,128
It's all over Harvard's Facebook page.

294
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,364
Oh, my God.
How could she do this?

295
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,289
She said she could never be attracted
to a handsome man.

296
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,607
Yeah, and that picture
doesn't even do him justice,

297
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,687
but this one, however...

298
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,882
- A thong?
- Yeah.

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,570
- Uh...
- What the...

300
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,411
Yeah, it's a whole, like, beach thing,
I guess.

301
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,851
Long weekend.

302
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,681
You're a son of a bitch, Mike.
You're not even sorry at all.

303
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,564
- You're using this to get into my head.
- Louis.

304
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,602
Come on. I can't believe you.

305
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,006
You think I would use
Sheila's engagement

306
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,043
- just to get you off your game?
- Never gonna work.

307
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,082
That I would stick it in your face

308
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,727
that she's all up in this guy's business
in a way that you've never seen before?

309
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,682
Water off a duck's back.

310
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,245
That right now,
she's probably scrapbooking

311
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,805
the first day of their relationship,

312
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,571
which apparently happened
just weeks after you broke her heart?

313
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,365
- You're the devil.
- BAILIFF: Next up on the docket,

Sidwell Investment Group
v. Sanders International.

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,127
Looks like that's us.
I'll see you in there.

316
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,563
HARVEY: Louis, I can't believe it.
I give you one goddamn job to do,

317
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,091
and you... What are you doing up there?

318
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,850
Harvey, please. I can explain.

319
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,011
Explain why you stood
in front of the judge like a moron?

320
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,283
- What possible explanation...
- Sheila got engaged.

321
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
What? When?

322
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,371
This morning.

323
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,686
Louis, I'm sorry.

324
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,243
I was so sure that she would
just come around

325
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,771
about having children,
you know?

326
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,769
That's why I've been

327
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,167
turning down all those JDate requests.

328
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,486
We'll get Mike another way.

329
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,681
Oh, you're goddamn right
we're gonna get him.

330
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,531
I'm going to get that son of a bitch
if it's the last thing I do.

331
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,926
What are you talking about?

332
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,969
He used the Sheila news
to get into my head, Harvey.

333
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,601
Used the news,
or gave you the news?

334
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,131
Oh, please.
What difference does it make?

335
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,971
What difference does it make?
It makes all the difference.

336
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,605
Like, on the one hand,
I feel for you,

337
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,563
and on the other,
you're the world's biggest idiot.

338
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,889
Look at my computer. I've been staring
at it for three hours. It's real.

339
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,726
I don't believe it.

340
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,650
Yeah, that Adonis on that yacht
is Sheila's fiancé.

341
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,891
That Adonis is a photoshopped picture
of Lorenzo Lamas from 1998!

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,810
- Who the hell is Lorenzo Lamas?
- Well, I can tell you who he isn't.

343
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,729
He isn't Sheila's fiancé!

Are you even listening?

347
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,520
It was bad enough that Nigel rattled you
with your unread cat letters.

348
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,971
Now, you're letting Mike do this?

349
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,724
- Harvey, please.
- Shut the hell up!

350
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,763
Look, I tried to warn you.

351
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,121
And you stood there
with your stupid leg up in the air

352
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,210
telling me that the student
was no match for the master.

353
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,804
And all it took was one doctored picture
for you to shit the bed!

354
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,321
- I didn't mean to.
- Shut the hell up!

355
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,926
(SOFTLY) God!

356
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,401
- Well, fancy meeting you here.
- Rachel, get out of here.

357
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,282
I was just coming
to make some copies.

358
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,561
(WHISPERS) Louis, what's wrong?

359
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,045
I don't wanna talk about it.
Nothing is wrong.

360
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,690
- Well, obviously, something's wrong.
- Well,

361
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,007
if you're so curious, why don't you just
go ask the man of your dreams?

362
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,481
I'm sure the two of you will have
a big laugh about it later.

363
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,967
Okay, I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

364
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,368
But seeing you like this, there is
no way that I would laugh at you.

365
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,561
What is it?

366
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,682
Mike convinced me
that Sheila was engaged

367
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,410
to throw me off my game.

368
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,248
- I'm so sorry, Louis.
- Yeah, well, he sure wasn't.

369
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,046
He stuck a knife in me and twisted it
with the thought of her and another man.

370
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,403
It felt like a... drill in my skull all day,

371
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,211
and then to top it all off, it cost me

372
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,642
the respect of my best friend.

373
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,929
- Maybe...
- Oh, don't you even try to defend him.

374
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,646
No, I wasn't going to.
I was going to say,

375
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,042
maybe this is what you needed
to decide to reconnect with Sheila.

376
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,643
What about Harvey?
How do I, uh, repair that?

377
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,130
I'm really sorry for what happened,
Louis. I am.

Did you eat?

382
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,410
Are you asking because
you're concerned about me

383
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,761
or because you wanna know
if I left you any food?

- Tough day?
- I'm sorry.

387
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,084
I've just been working 16-hour days
and I'm really...

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,611
Stressed.

389
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,727
- Yeah, I know the feeling.
- Really?

390
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,923
Because I heard that you had
a pretty big win today.

391
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,608
- You talked to Harvey.
- I talked to Louis.

392
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,728
Mike, I know you wanna win, but do you
have any idea what your lie did to him?

393
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,888
It wasn't a lie.
It was a strategy.

394
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,161
It was both.

395
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,525
- And it ended up with him near tears.
- Come on, Rachel.

396
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,927
It just seems like all that matters to you
is winning and you don't

397
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,769
care about what
it does to your friends.

398
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,691
You know what?

399
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,609
I'm sorry that I hurt Louis.

400
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,721
But he was going to that courtroom

401
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,922
so they could put their tender offer
to a vote.

402
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,485
I know.

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,921
And you also know, because
we've had this discussion before,

404
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,090
that if he got his way,
they would rip that company to shreds.

405
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,451
So, instead of coming down on me
for what I did to Louis,

406
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,562
why don't you start
worrying about all the lives

407
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,331
that Logan Sanders
is gonna destroy if that happens?

408
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,802
You know, it's funny. You told me
you didn't care who's in charge.

409
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,321
You just wanted whoever it was
to not be an idiot.

410
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,490
- Are you saying that I was an idiot?
- I'm saying we both were.

411
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
I shouldn't have gone to Woodall,
and you shouldn't have lied to us.

412
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,766
You don't seem pissed.

413
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,761
I've had enough
happen already today.

414
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,289
Besides, lying to me was wrong,

415
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,291
but lying to the woman you're in a
relationship with is a whole other level.

416
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,009
When do you think
she's gonna get past it?

417
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,282
From personal experience,
that could take a while.

418
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,131
That's not my problem.
That's yours.

419
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,890
Then what are you doing here, Harvey?

420
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,327
I'm here to tell you
what you're gonna do about it.

421
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,364
No. No way.
I'm not taking the stand.

422
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,811
Then what are you doing here?

423
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,763
Because Woodall telling you
to go after our clients

424
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,168
is how you got this job in the first place
and happens to make our case.

425
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,647
He didn't outright tell me to do it
and you know it.

426
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,525
- You had to find out somehow.
- I found out from Brian Harris.

427
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,290
He told me he had this funny feeling
that the day after Woodall arrived

428
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,769
that I was gonna start issuing
subpoenas to Pearson Specter clients.

429
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,168
When I asked him why,
he said, "You know why."

430
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,282
Then you're going to get up on the stand
and tell them that.

431
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
I can't. I have no proof.

432
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,127
It was vague,
and it's a third party conversation.

433
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,368
Which makes it hearsay,
and I don't give a shit.

434
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,926
Well, I do, because it opens me up
to slander at best

435
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,202
- and pel'jury charges at worst.
- Well, Jeff,

436
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,402
you used that story
to get your ass in here.

437
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,090
Now use it to get the job done.

438
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,287
Amy!

439
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,044
I thought I asked you to leave the
Gianopolous proposal on my desk.

440
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,481
And I did.
Twenty minutes ago.

441
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,567
What? Okay.

442
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,569
- Did you proof it?
- No.

443
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,206
I thought you'd have a better chance
if the document was riddled with typos.

444
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,606
- This is important.
- I know it is.

445
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,563
Which is why I read it
backwards and forwards.

446
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,411
Okay. Did you add the part about
the leveraged recap, like I asked?

447
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,127
I did. But your figures on
the non-voting stock didn't add up,

448
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,323
so I proposed a staggered board
to make up for the imbalance.

449
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,171
- Staggered board?
- Yeah, don't act so surprised.

450
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,691
I'm sorry, I just thought that you...

451
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,290
You just thought that
I didn't know anything

452
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,845
about what goes on here?
(CHUCKLES)

453
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,291
Listen up, T. Boone Pickens.

454
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,528
I actually know a lot
about this business.

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,483
- Okay, I said I'm sorry.
- And I know more than enough

456
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,400
to know that that looks like every other
proposal that's come across my desk.

457
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,251
Well, that gives me a shitload of
confidence going into this meeting.

458
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,691
I'm not trying to destroy
your confidence.

459
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,211
That's the one thing
you have going for you.

460
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,606
- Then, what are you trying to do?
- Mike,

461
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,927
you're not here because you crunched
Sidwell some numbers.

462
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,606
You're here because you solved
a problem for him.

463
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,170
- All right. Get rid of this.
- And bring you everything I can find

464
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,362
on Tony Gianopolous. On it.

465
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,481
Amy.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,770
- Why aren't you...
- Why am I an assistant

467
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,680
and not an investment banker?
I'm getting my PhD in Psychology.

468
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,211
Money bores me.

469
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,131
I don't know why you needed
to talk to me in chambers, Mr. Malone.

470
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,767
I was clear on my ruling.

471
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,770
Well, with all due respect, Your Honor,
your ruling didn't cover the fact

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,565
that the SEC has a vendetta
against Pearson Specter.

473
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,365
- That's a serious accusation.
- And if it were the truth,

474
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,811
he would have said it out there,
not in here.

475
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,887
I'm doing it in private, Sean,

476
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,525
because I don't want to slander
an entire department

477
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,450
- based on the actions of two men.
- SEAN: Translation.

478
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,641
He doesn't want to be charged
with perjury,

479
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,171
because he's lying, and this is a joke.

480
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,567
It wasn't a joke when I was asked
to do the exact same thing

481
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,523
that he's doing right now.

482
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
What the hell are
you talking about?

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,604
Before I left the SEC,

484
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,762
I was told to target
Pearson Specter clients.

485
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,564
- And who exactly told you?
- Brian Harris.

486
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,768
Then, go after him,
'cause all you've got on me is hearsay.

487
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,325
And might I point out,
this is the accusation

488
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,965
of a man who was about to be fired,

489
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,765
which I'd say should be taken
with a cubic meter of salt.

490
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,441
Well, that cubic meter of salt

491
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,449
might actually get a little bit smaller
if Sean here

492
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,609
would, say, open up his files
and show us his paper trail.

493
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,088
Our work product is covered under
federal regulation and he knows that.

494
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
I also know you're hiding behind your
office and using his court to do it.

495
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,683
All right, all right. That's enough.

496
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,531
Mr. Malone, I don't appreciate
you using my chambers to testify.

497
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,051
And he may not have proof.

498
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,802
But if one client leaves his firm

499
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,962
and their charges
miraculously disappear,

500
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,445
you're looking
at more than sanctions.

501
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,289
You're looking at jail time.

502
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,167
Thank you.

503
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,001
Rachel.

504
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,400
It's only been a day. You already have
a suggestion for my new deal?

505
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,527
I do.

506
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,483
Good. Then which of those five
companies should I go after?

507
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,522
None of them.

508
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,247
So, you've brought me nothing.

509
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,448
No, I brought you five better options.

510
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,483
- What was wrong with the options?
- Just take a look.

511
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,762
These companies
have no disposable assets.

512
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,723
No, they don't.
They have under-performing assets

513
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,569
that can be turned around
and built into something.

514
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,729
Did you even look into the companies
I gave you?

515
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,683
- Yes, I did. But I...
- But what?

516
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,882
Sounds like someone's been drinking
her boyfriend's Kool-Aid.

517
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,604
Well, maybe if more people did,
there just might be...

518
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,291
Oh, goddamn it, Rachel.
I'm not in business to save the world.

519
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,129
I asked for a professional opinion.

520
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,766
And I gave you a professional opinion.
You just don't like it.

521
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,086
No, I don't.

522
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,611
And now we're gonna have to work
all day tomorrow

523
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,563
to do what I asked you to do
in the first place.

524
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,966
You mean spend all day together.

525
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,127
- If that's what it takes.
- Mmm-hmm.

526
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,924
Did you call this board meeting

527
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,451
just so we could spend
more time together?

528
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,530
Did you bring me deals you knew
I'd reject just to avoid it?

529
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,882
Look,

530
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,767
like I said, I have a meeting on Friday
and I need to be prepared for it.

531
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,009
So maybe you should go back
to your office, get cracking and...

532
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,924
Just give me a call when
you have something.

533
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,641
Okay-

534
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,285
TONY: You're kidding me.

535
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,451
- So this is all mine?
- Yep.

536
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,969
In 20 days, the public access
will be gone,

537
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,687
and you will have yourself
a quarter mile of private beach.

538
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,802
What about the Southampton
City Council?

539
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,081
What about them?

540
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,521
They're a bunch of public
access-loving assholes.

541
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,091
Like I said... What about them?

542
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,529
How did you do this, Mike?

543
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,723
The question isn't "how" I did it,
it's "why" I did it.

544
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,361
Oh. You want something from me.

545
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,370
Just your consideration.

546
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,762
Well, you've earned it. Go ahead.

547
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,121
Not interested.

548
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,451
- You didn't even look at it.
- Oh, I don't have to.

549
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,608
You just said that I earned
your consideration.

550
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,131
Mmm-hmm, and you just got it.

551
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,602
Look, Gillie Industries
is ripe for a turnaround.

552
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,644
- And I already own 7%.
- Well, congratulations.

553
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,287
Now, go beg someone else for money,
'cause you're not getting mine.

554
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,723
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to.

555
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,565
Now get the hell out of my office.

556
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,682
- Mr. Gianopolous...
- I said get the hell out.

557
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,048
Hey, Mike. How's it going?
Fancy meeting you here.

558
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,889
- It was you.
- What was me?

559
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,367
I'm just here to thank you
for the advice you once gave me.

560
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,603
You know,
back when we were friends.

561
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,171
- Louis...
- No, no, no.

562
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,443
No, no, no. You once told me that
my actions have consequences.

563
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,121
Remember? Your actions yesterday
have consequences, too.

564
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,562
- What did you say to Gianopolous?
- Not much.

565
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,886
Just that you were
the person responsible

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,445
for his number two leaving him.

567
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,085
I was responsible? He agreed to it.

568
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,690
Well, what he didn't know was that

569
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,531
it was his own lawyer
who came up with the idea.

570
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,721
- Now, he does.
- And what does that...

571
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,727
Have to do with it?

572
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,688
He may have agreed to it,
but it was a betrayal by you.

573
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,842
And here's a little something
you obviously do not know

574
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,042
about investment banking.

575
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,209
The only thing more satisfying
to these guys than money,

576
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,368
is sticking it to someone
who stuck it to them.

577
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,440
Louis.

578
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,724
I'm sorry for hurting you with Sheila.

579
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,320
Don't you ever mention
her name to me again.

580
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,282
Okay-

581
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,489
But it was a move...

582
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,364
Like you just did. So...

583
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,801
- Can we move on?
- Move on?

584
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,045
You used the woman I love
to extend your goddamn TRO.

585
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,640
You knew how I felt about her
and you did it anyway.

586
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,204
I will never, ever forget it
until the day I die.

587
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,809
Good luck beating Harvey
without money.

588
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,810
I have good news.

589
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,729
James Dolan died
and left me the Knicks?

590
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,002
Louis stopped Mike
from getting Gianopolous.

591
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,288
- He blocked his funding.
- Good.

592
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,522
You went to Louis with a problem,
he fixed it,

593
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,165
and all you're gonna say is "good"?

594
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,725
Donna, I'm glad
he fixed the problem,

595
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,763
but it was a problem he created.

596
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,446
He created it because when it comes
to people he cares about,

597
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,050
Louis has a blind spot.

598
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,561
Yeah, for people and cats
and who knows what else.

599
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,523
I'll tell you what else.

600
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,205
He cares about you.

601
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,208
(SIGHS) What do you want
from me, Donna?

602
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
I want you to tell him
he did a good job.

603
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,803
I'll tell him when we come out on top.

604
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,446
Okay, Harvey.
You do what you're gonna do.

605
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,489
But just remember,
when Louis asked Sheila to marry him,

606
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,762
you were the one
he picked to be his best man.

607
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,046
And you said, "yes."

608
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,242
I'm sorry, but we're not hiring today.

609
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,361
I'd think you'd be looking for a job,

610
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,244
given the beat down
you took in chambers.

611
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm not sure what Jeff disgruntled
employee here told you,

612
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,847
but I'm still standing.

613
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,928
Well, what I told her is that you lost.

614
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,406
- Then why are you here?
- We're here to make you an offer.

615
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,760
You drop all seven cases,

616
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,564
we drop the malicious
prosecution claim.

617
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,882
No deal.

618
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,651
Judge Hopkins is going to be waiting
for you to take action.

619
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,242
Now, too much time goes by,
he's gonna think you're full of shit.

620
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,284
But if you fold right now, he's only
gonna sanction you for the exact claim

621
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,686
that we're willing to drop.

622
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,006
JESSICA: Which is why
we'll tell the judge

623
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,610
that in exchange
for those cases being dropped,

624
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,645
we'll give the SEC unprecedented access
to our clients' books.

625
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,363
Which, of course,
you won't be doing.

626
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,891
No, we won't.

627
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,929
So, what exactly am I getting out of this?

628
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,168
- You get to save face.
- I do like my face.

629
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,566
However, I also like my ass,

630
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,569
which will be on the line
if I take this deal.

631
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,844
Then you have 24 hours to decide
which one you like more.

632
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,286
- Mr. Forstman, Mike Ross.
- No.

633
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,962
- Sir, I think that if you hear me out...
- How the hell did you find me here?

634
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,721
The article in Forbes said you can't go
more than three hours

635
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,366
without one of Rosa's Cafe Cubanos.

636
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,562
That article in Forbes
was six years ago.

637
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,648
It also said you never change.

638
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,842
Did you also read where I have
every Bud Fox wannabe

639
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,450
dumped in a local landfill?

640
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,289
If you do that,
you'll miss the opportunity

641
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,323
to get back at Harvey Specter.

642
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,201
And what does a little shit like you
know about Harvey Specter?

643
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,846
I know that he bought that '63
Aston Martin out from under you,

644
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,291
and you've hated him ever since.

645
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,971
You know he keeps it in a garage?
Doesn't even drive it.

646
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,286
What do you want?

647
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,729
- Gillie Industries.
- Gillie Industries

648
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,842
is a black hole of distressed debt.

649
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,042
- I want nothing to do with it.
- No, it isn't.

650
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,527
It's a '63 Aston Martin.

651
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,847
Who do you work for?

652
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,530
Who says I work for anyone?

653
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,371
Because a young kid like you
with enough clout to go after Gillie?

654
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,131
I'd know you.

655
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,567
- I work for Jonathan Sidwell.
- Okay. You've got my 230 mil.

656
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,845
I only need 80.

657
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,804
You don't know what you need.

658
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,248
What happens to the company is my call.

659
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,441
Done.

660
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,723
Oh, one more thing,
when you get those papers.

661
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,569
I have a feeling there will be a provision

662
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,846
buried in there that says that once
the deal closes, you cut Sidwell out.

663
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,884
- I'm... I'm sorry. What?
- I don't know him.

664
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,843
And I don't want him
sucking a chunk out of a deal

665
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,048
that can't happen without me.

666
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,731
- Well?
- He went for it.

667
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,162
- That is great.
- It's not all great.

668
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,887
He'll only give me the money
if I agree to cut out Sidwell.

669
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,842
What? What...
(CHUCKLES)

670
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,088
What does "cut him out" even mean?

671
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,522
It means make sure Sidwell
doesn't get a penny from this deal.

(WHISPERS) Mike.

673
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,928
The second he finds that out,
you're gone.

674
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,042
He's not gonna find out
until the deal closes.

675
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,806
And if I don't find the money,
I'm out of a job anyway.

676
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,761
Oh. I... (CHUCKLES)

677
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,327
I get it. At least, this way,
you get to leave on the winning side.

678
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,489
- We leave on the winning side.
- Who says I'm gonna do that?

679
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,241
What happened to
"You think I'm staying if you leave?"

680
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,886
Yeah, that was before I knew
you were gonna screw over Sidwell.

681
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,162
- Amy, I...
- No. He may be a dick sometimes,

682
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,124
- but he's the reason you're here.
- You think I want this?

683
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,124
I have to make a choice between
the promise I made to Walter Gillie

684
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,241
and what I owe Jonathan.

685
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,045
Mike, Walter Gillie doesn't give a shit
about that promise anymore.

686
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,286
Yeah, but I do.

687
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,727
And so do all the people
that work for him.

688
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,849
So you're gonna do it.

(WHISPERS) I don't know.

to do shitty things just to win this thing,

for one of them right now.

I'm sorry I didn't do
what you asked me to do.

- I should have evaluated your ideas.
- You should have.

that you don't always do
what people expect of you.

- Well, I, um...

in the first place.

Waiting for you. I figured if I tried
to go upstairs, you'd have me killed.

Oh, is that a joke?
Because I'm not laughing.

703
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,124
Louis, I didn't say it right the first time.
I want to say it again. I'm sorry.

704
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,003
You think "I'm sorry" makes up
for what you did?

705
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,442
No, but... I'm hoping that we can move
past it and be friends again.

706
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,848
Well, the only problem with that is,
is that you and I both know

707
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,962
that you're only here because
I took away your sugar daddy,

708
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,445
and now you want me to
take it easy on you.

709
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,564
Louis, if you don't wanna
accept my apology, that's fine.

710
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,011
But I'm not here
from a position of weakness.

711
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,690
I'm here from a position of strength.

712

Bullshit. Where did you get money?
You don't have any friends out there.

No, but Harvey has enemies.

What's that supposed to mean?

715
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,880
You told me these guys hold grudges.

716
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,446
I just found a guy
with one against Harvey.

717
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,324
You son of a bitch.
You didn't come here to apologize.

718
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,283
You came to rub it in my face.

719
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,731
Oh, and I bet you just
can't wait to tell Harvey

720
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,763
that I'm the one
who gave you the idea.

721
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,723
Louis, I wasn't even gonna tell you
how I got the idea at all.

722
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,730
- I'm still not gonna tell Harvey.
- Because you want me to owe you?

723
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,327
Because I'm not as much of an asshole
as you think I am.

No, they don't.

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,721
So, when you told me you should have
evaluated my ideas first,

732
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,490
you weren't saying
that they were good.

733
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,728
I was saying I wasn't doing my job.

734
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,681
Which was to let me figure out for myself
that my ideas weren't good.

- And I thought...
- Yeah, I know.

That I only even arranged it
to spend time with you?

742
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,045
- You really didn't.
- No.

743
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,451
And now they're gonna ask me tomorrow
how Gillie is going,

744
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,403
and I'm gonna have to tell them
we might lose.

745
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,090
And then they're gonna ask me
what else I have,

746
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,680
and I'm gonna have
to tell them, "Nothing."

747
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,404
Well, maybe you won't.

748

that you should be.

get your files.

I just wanted to tell you
you did a good job anyway.

You see, that's the, uh, thing.

I stuck it in his face

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,407
and I told him that people
hold grudges and I...

772
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,610
He must have known
your history with Forstman,

if I'd ever crossed any lines
in his presence.

our clients to leave us.

At least none of them did
or we'd be in trouble right now.

to drop those cases anyway,

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,087
to show up with your thank you
and your friendly advice.

824
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,127
- This isn't some move.
- You only make moves.

825
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,651
- Mike...
- Okay, tell me right now

826
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,161
that you wouldn't do the same thing
if you were in my position.

827
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,727
I was.

828
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,926
And I did.

829
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,888
What? You think our grudge
is about some car?

830
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,411
What the hell
are you talking about?

831
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,727
When I was younger,
I made a shady deal with him

832
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,841
and I paid for it.
(SIGHS)

833
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,128
- Who says that I'm making...
- If you haven't, you will,

834
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,288
because Forstman
doesn't throw money around

835
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,890
without getting something in return.

836
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,731
- He's gonna get money in return.
- Money is third on his list.

837
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,724
The first two are getting back at people
and getting control of people.

838
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,966
Maybe you should
have thought of that

839
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,242
before you had Louis cut me off
from Gianopolous,

840
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,442
because now, I have no other choice.

841
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,483
You always have a choice.

842
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,082
Here's to turning around
Piedmont Avionics.

843
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,169
- What?
- Nothing.

844
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,561
What time is it?

845
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,206
Too late for you
to change your mind.

846
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,968
- Logan, the board is going to be wowed.
- Well, I wish I had your confidence.

847
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,527
You are not short
in the confidence department.

848
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,286
Oh, you don't have
to pay me compliments.

849
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,767
I meant it as an insult.
(CHUCKLES)

850
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,928
You know, if this law thing
doesn't work out...

851
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,123
Then, I could have a career
in venture capital?

852
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,368
No, I was gonna say
you could be my assistant.

853
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,321
Hilarious.

854
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,610
Seriously, Rachel, I...

855
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,007
(STAMMERING)
I couldn't have done it without you.

856
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,450
Yes, you could have.
It just wouldn't have been as good.

857
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,648
Humility. Another thing I love about you.

858
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,723
(WHISPERING)
Logan, I should go.

859
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,643
(SOFTLY)
Rachel, I... Um...

860
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,525
Good luck tomorrow.

861
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,410
Your eyes,
they did flutter again

862
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,844
When you told me
every little thing's

863
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,008
Going to be all right

864
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,887
But we were younger then
And now we're not

865
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,891
And if there was a plan made

866
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,129
Then we forgot about it

867
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,561
And if there was time

868
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,243
Well, I could figure it out now

869
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,806
But life is short

870
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,723
<i>And I don't care for most of it</i>

871
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,691
Because you're all that
All that I want

872
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,684
Because you're all that
All that I want

873
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,725
Because you're all that
All that I want

874
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,647
Well, I know
I'm hard to take

875
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,641
And my bones are
calling out your name

876
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,922
While I beat your cold windows
Break the locks on the gate

877
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,885
While I try to forget
I used to be something great

878
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,088
Because you're all that
All that I want

879
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,928
Because you're all that
All that I want

880
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,445
Because you're all that
All that I want

881
