深吸口气  姑娘们  我的人生之旅从今天开始

29
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,800
终于能给这个世界带来我引以为傲的事物

30
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,250
莱特兄弟小时候梦见过会飞的机器

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,270
而我小时候梦过建造宏伟建筑
And I dreamed of building something magnificent.

35
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,970
最近 杰和我买了一块空地
Well, recently, Jay and I bought a vacant lot

36
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,210
准备在上面建邓菲塔
on which we are building Dunphy tower.

37
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,220
我愿意付出一切  换取回到过去的机会
What I wouldn't give to reach back in time

38
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,000
告诉画出这幅画的15岁梦想家
to tell the 15-year-old dreamer who drew this,

39
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,620
"我们成功了  孩子"
"We did it, kid."

40
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,860
克莱尔  你看起来真糟糕
Claire, you look terrible.

41
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,590
"谢谢"啊
Thanks.

42
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,800
不  我意思是你很紧绷
No. I mean, you're all locked up.

43
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,590
是的  是的
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,930
看来我明天帮你预订的水疗
I guess the Spa Day that I booked for you tomorrow

45
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,740
正是时候
came at the perfect time.

46
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,020
对  水疗
Oh, right, that.

47
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,280
我生日这天要特别顾虑歌洛莉亚的心情
I have to be very delicate with Gloria around my birthday.

48
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,980
去年  不知道发什么疯
Last year, for some insane reason,

49
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,920
她居然送给我
She got me this gift certificate

50
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,500
可笑的莎莎舞课程礼券
for ridiculous salsa-dancing lessons.

51
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,020
好像我真的会去一样  拜托
Like I'm ever gonna use that. Come on.

52
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,150
后来她不知道为什么
Anyway, somehow, she's convinced herself

53
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,490
就觉得我不"感激"她的礼物
I didn't "appreciate" her gifts.

54
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,520
你也知道
You know.

55
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,870
有些人就是戏太多
Some people.

56
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,560
明天公司可能会有点忙乱
So, tomorrow at work might be a little bit hectic.

57
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,220
最近公司有很多事
Just a lot of stuff going on at the office.

58
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,040
不是我不想去  我真的很想去
And it's not that I don't want to do it, 'cause I do.

59
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,380
省省吧  克莱尔  咱俩今年别再演这戏了
No, Claire, let's not do this dance again.

60
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,550
我们都知道你不喜欢跳舞
We all know how you feel about dancing.

61
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,720
真是值得骄傲的日子  菲尔
Proud, proud day, Phil.

62
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,650
谢谢  搭档
Thanks, partner.

63
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,260
也许我们该赶快开始
Maybe we should get this show on the road.

64
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,210
摄影师趁海莉不注意时
The photographer's been taking shots of Haley

65
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,300
一直在拍她
when she's not looking.

66
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,260
好奇怪  我并没有请摄影师啊
That's weird. I didn't hire a photographer.

67
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,110
邓菲  对吗  我是杰瑞德·库克
Dunphy, right? Jared Cook.

68
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,080
铲子挺好看的
Nice shovel.

69
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
谢谢  我自己上的漆
Thanks. I painted it myself.

70
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,120
这位是我的搭档  杰·普里契特
This is my partner, Jay Pritchett.

71
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,240
我代表杰塔科技公司而来  你有听说过我们吗
I represent Jetatech. Are you familiar with us?

72
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,220
完全没有
Not in the least.

73
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,460
你得原谅杰
Oh, you'll have to forgive Jay.

74
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,460
他有点反高科技
He's a bit of luddite.

75
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,930
反正我们公司就在隔壁第二栋
Anyway, our building is two doors down,

76
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,610
我们正打算扩大园区
and we're looking to expand our campus.

77
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,700
我们想买下这块地
We want this lot,

78
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,610
准备付给你们比买入价
and we're prepared to offer you

79
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,410
高20%的价格  外加你们其他开销
20% over what you paid plus expenses.

80
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,660
这个报价挺不错的  杰瑞
That's a nice offer, Jare,

81
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,670
但你好像没搞清楚状况
but I don't think you understand what's happening here.

82
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,370
这跟暴利无关
It's not about the huge profits.

83
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,450
我们在建造的是我女婿的梦想
We're building my son-in-law's dream,

84
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,080
而这栋建筑将会大获成功
and it's gonna be a giant success

85
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
因为他是个有远见的男人
because this is man of vision.

86
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,260
我可了解梦想了
Oh, I know all about dreams.

87
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,000
我还希望某天能进军加密封包交换领域呢
Someday, I hope to get into encrypted packet switching.

88
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,140
祝你们好运  先生们
Good luck to you, gentlemen.

89
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,030
杰  我有远见的双眼已被感动的泪水模糊
Jay, this man's vision just got blurry with tears.

90
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,960
你能不能控制一下你自己
Would you get ahold of yourself.

91
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
我刚说的那些鬼话都是为了抬高价格
I just said that crap to drive the price up.

92
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,550
他会回来的
He'll be back.

93
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,710
我不想要他回来
I don't want him to come back.

94
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,490
不管你刚说的是不是真心话  这真是我的梦想
Whether you meant it or not, this is my dream.

95
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,780
我们做这件事是为了赚钱
We're in this to make money.

96
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,790
我们会赚到的
And we will.

97
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
根据商业规划委员会赋予我的权力
By the power vested in me by the commercial zoning board,

98
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,580
我宣布正式破土动工
I do hereby officially break ground

99
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,180
未来要在这建起邓菲塔
on the future home of Dunphy tower.

100
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,290
这土还真硬
Oh, that's...strong soil.

101
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,920
这是个好兆头
That's a good omen.

102
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,190
我用弹簧高跷那招试试
I'm gonna pogo it.

103
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,820
还有人带铲子来了吗
Anybody else bring a shovel?

104
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,660
你终于来了  里面就是个噩梦
Oh, thank god you're here. It's a nightmare.

105
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,170
员工因为预算缩减的事都炸锅了
The staff is in an uproar about these budget cuts.

106
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,140
跟他们说以后再也没有加班费已经很糟了
Telling them there's no more overtime was bad,

107
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,300
但当我告诉他们以后再也不提供贝果了
but when I had to tell them there were no more bagels,

108
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,660
有人用杯子扔我的头呢
someone threw a cup at my head.

109
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,580
我不知道还能做什么
I don't know what else to do.

110
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,850
我们圣诞期间的销售额
Sales-wise we didn't exactly have

111
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,870
并没有达到我预想中的成绩
the Christmas I was hoping for.

112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,650
圣诞节大家不送衣柜都送啥啊
What do people give each other, anyway?

113
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,700
我就随便提议一下
Well, just spitballing here --

114
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,260
也许我们可以炒掉仓库的肯尼
Maybe we could fire Kenny from the warehouse.

115
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,180
没有要炒掉任何人
No one's getting fired.

116
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,240
可是他常丑化模仿我
But he does a really hurtful impression of me.

117
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,940
来吧  各位  都围过来
come on, guys. Everybody gather round.

118
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,410
我跟你们一样不喜欢预算缩减的决定
I don't like these budget cuts any more than you do,

119
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,990
但我希望你们知道  我跟你们一条心
But I want you to know I'm in this with you.

120
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,460
我已经削减了我的开销
I've cut my expenses.

121
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,350
主管出差搭飞机都只坐经济舱
All the execs are flying coach.

122
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,950
但我想要你们觉得自己也有发声权
But I do want you to feel like you have a voice in this.

123
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,340
所以  我办公室的门不仅随时为你们开着
So, not only is my office door always open to you,

124
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,220
我甚至直接叫人把它给拆了
I've actually had it removed.

125
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,250
没有门所代表的意义很有震慑力  老板
That's a very powerful metaphor, boss.

126
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,140
没有门所代表的意义很有震慑力  老板
That's a very powerful metaphor, boss.

127
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,920
肯尼  谢谢你让气氛保持轻松
Kenny, thanks for keeping it light.

128
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,070
太棒了
So good.

129
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,850
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

130
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,830
你来这里干什么
What are you doing in here?

131
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,810
你说你太忙了
You said that you were too busy

132
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,850
没时间离开办公室去庆祝生日
to get away from the office to celebrate.

133
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,900
所以我把庆祝仪式带来公司
So I brought the celebration to you.

134
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,060
犀利
Snap.

135
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,920
-那是鱼子酱吗  -没错
- Is that caviar? - Yes!

136
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,000
还有美酒相配
And something to wash it down.

137
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,710
香槟耶
Oh, yay, champagne.

138
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,940
快给我搞扇门来
Get me a door.

139
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,440
如果你给我搭的这东西在科学展览不能获奖
If I don't win the science fair with this thing you built me,

140
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,190
比赛肯定有黑幕
It's rigged.

141
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,640
说得好  姐们
Amen, sister.

142
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,750
拜托  你们怎么不等我就开始了
Oh, come on, you started without me?

143
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,080
不  我们不等你就完工了
No, we finished without you.

144
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,240
是的  我们想搭个能正常运作的
Yeah, we wanted it work.

145
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,070
那我猜你们是故意弄得这么"简朴"
I guess you also wanted it to be really simplistic,

146
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,740
因为那里可以改良
Because right there, you can make it better

147
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,320
只要加一个...
If you just added --

148
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,140
好吧
Okay.

149
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,390
就那里
So, right there,

150
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,970
那里可以改良  只要加一个...
You can make it better if you just added --

151
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,630
你不是说你们已经完工了吗
Okay, I thought you said you were done!

152
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,290
米奇尔  我爱你
Okay, Mitchell, I love you.

153
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,170
但是呢
But...?

154
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,750
没有"但是"
No "But."

155
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,390
可是我们都知道我才是更技术型的爹
Yet we both know I'm the more mechanically-inclined daddy.

156
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,580
我的手也很巧的
I'm handy.

157
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,810
不知道这话能不能安慰到你
If it makes you feel any better,

158
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,250
我也一点没搭手
I didn't do anything, either.

159
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,680
不  没有安慰到我
No, that doesn't make me feel better.

160
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
你本该从这个过程中学习的
You're supposed to be learning from this.

161
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,020
我新学了一句脏话
I learned a new swear word.

162
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,040
我手被木刺扎了嘛  不过也值了
Uh, um, I got a splinter. It was worth it.

163
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,420
看着
Watch.

164
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,930
这就完了吗
Is that it?

165
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,510
我太不懂  因为我不是技术型的爹
I'm confused 'cause I'm not mechanically inclined.

166
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,360
您真幽默
Hardy-har-har.

167
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,730
没完  我只要稍作调整
No, I just need to make a little adjustment.

168
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,600
小心
Watch out!

169
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,670
我的天啊
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

170
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,760
你还好吗
Are you okay?

171
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,220
这不是设计里的
That's not part of it.

172
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,800
我尽快赶来了
I got here as quick as I could.

173
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,470
求求你告诉我是个好消息
Please tell me this is good news.

174
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,570
求求你告诉我这是挖到石油了
Please tell me that's oil.

175
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,020
挖到了一段横穿过这块地的下水道
Found a sewer line running straight through the property.

176
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,060
还有总水管
Also, a water main,

177
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,700
不知道为什么  还有大量甲烷
And for some reason, giant pockets of methane.

178
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,680
快和我说说  皮特
Talk to me, Pete.

179
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,020
我觉得我刚已经说了啊
I feel like I just did.

180
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,450
处理费要多少
How much is it gonna cost?

181
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,610
钱的话  少说得六位数
Money-wise, you're looking at mid-six-figures.

182
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,920
你说的六位数包括小数点后两位吗
When you say six, does that include the two-cent figures?

183
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,860
不包括
No.

184
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,710
另外  时间上可能要耽误一年
Plus, time-wise, you're looking at maybe a year delay

185
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,780
来申请水电许可  环境许可
with permits and utilities, environmental --

186
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,280
别跟我说了  皮特
Stop talking to me, Pete.

187
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,230
我的天  杰怎么来了
Oh, my God, why is Jay here?

188
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,240
我也给他打电话了
I called him, too.

189
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,170
如果他看到这些会叫停整个工程的
He'll shut this whole project down if he sees this.

190
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,370
找点胶合板把洞盖住
Put some plywood over the hole.

191
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,220
托尼  想办法盖住甲烷的气味
Tony, do what you can to cover the methane smell.

192
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,860
其他人  都装忙
Everybody else, just look busy.

193
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,670
怎么会这样
How could this happen?

194
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,910
今天有只瓢虫落在我肩头  还以为是吉兆
I had a ladybug land on my shoulder today.

195
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,110
遇到什么问题了
What's the problem?

196
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,250
问题是我饿了
Problem is I'm hungry.

197
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,500
解决方法是  走几步到小印度餐厅吃饭
The solution -- we're walking distance to Little India.

198
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,220
-我们走吧  -那是什么味道
- Shall we? - What's that smell?

199
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,290
嘘  那是皮特的体臭
Shh, that's -- that's Pete.

200
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
他对这事特别敏感  千万别提
He's, uh, very sensitive about it. Don't bring it up.

201
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,580
既然你来了
While I got you,

202
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,970
我想在这装个自行车架你说怎么样
I was thinking about putting in a bike rack over here.

203
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,580
-那是怎么回事  -我什么都没看见
- What the hell is that? - I didn't see anything.

204
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,320
我很肯定如果真有什么麻烦  会有人...
I'm sure if something was wrong, someone would --

205
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,740
一到下班时间大家就特别兴奋
Oh, they love quittin' time.

206
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,290
就像卡通《摩登原始人》一样
Just like "The Flintstones."

207
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,270
我开始怀疑
I'm starting to develop a theory

208
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,630
这些情况就是皮特打电话给我的原因
that maybe all this is related to why Pete called me.

209
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,620
杰  我觉得你的疑心病有点重
Jay, I think that's just a little paranoid.

210
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,610
好吧
Well, there...

211
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,850
的确是有点问题
There was one thing.

212
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,940
抱歉  这杯绝对是香草味的没错
Sorry. This one's definitely vanilla.

213
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,410
我还以为你点的是"摩卡咖啡"
I thought you said "Mocha."

214
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,790
我"不小心"做了杯我最喜欢的咖啡
Oops, I accidentally made my favorite drink.

215
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,770
多谢提点
Thanks for the tip.

216
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,190
我已经在这做了五年了
I've been working here for five years.

217
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,870
不开窍的话可做不了这么久
Didn't get this far by being stupid.

218
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,260
我在想今晚要不要在我家办个小派对
I'm thinking about having a little party at my place tonight.

219
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,690
走起吗  艾狗
You down, a-dogg?

220
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,390
如果"走起"代表参加
If "down" means attending

221
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,650
"艾狗"代表艾丽克斯  那绝对的
and "A-dogg" means Alex, then yes.

222
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,890
我本打算回学校时就辞掉咖啡店的工作
I thought I'd quit the coffee shop when I went back to school,

223
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,710
但我还挺喜欢这份工作的
But I'm kind of loving it.

224
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,230
再说  这份工作教会了我一件重要的事
Plus, it taught me something important.

225
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,730
如果你装成人们期待中的样子
If you pretend to be who people want you to be,

226
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,770
朋友要多少有多少
you can have as many friends as you want.

227
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,880
天啊  我要是能重读一次高中该多好
God, I would love another crack at high school.

228
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,240
天啊  他又来了
Oh, God, here he comes.

229
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,110
谁
Who?

230
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,720
这个40多岁的小矮子每周五都来
This little guy in his 40s -- here every friday.

231
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,880
总是点无比复杂的咖啡
Always has a super-complicated drink order.

232
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,770
艾丽克斯
Oh, hey, Alex.

233
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,010
我要特大杯榛子味的脱脂冰玛奇朵
I'll have a 20-ounce iced skinny hazelnut macchiato,

234
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,790
要无糖糖浆  双倍浓缩咖啡
sugar-free syrup, double shot of espresso,

235
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,660
薄冰  不能没有冰  不要奶泡
Light ice -- not no ice -- no whip.

236
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,550
多谢你来见我
Thank you for meeting with me.

237
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,810
我尽快赶来了
I came as fast as I could.

238
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,870
我对我男朋友说谎了
I lied to my boyfriend.

239
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,260
每个人在恋情刚开始的时候都这样
Everybody does it at the beginning of a relationship.

240
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,860
"我喜欢爵士"  "男人哭的时候超性感"
"Oh, I love jazz." "It's sexy when a man cries."

241
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,610
"你女儿好可爱"
"Your daughter is so sweet."

242
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,780
我呢  我告诉雷纳我喜欢他最爱的电视剧
Me -- I told Rainer I love his favorite show,

243
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,520
《权力的游戏》
"Game of thrones",

244
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,250
所以现在他要带我去动漫展
So now he's taking me to comic-con.

245
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,790
我根本不喜欢《权力的游戏》
I don't love "Game of thrones".

246
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,210
我连看都没看过
I've never even seen "Game of thrones".

247
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,650
另外郑重声明  他女儿就是个魔鬼
And for the record, his daughter is kind of a monster.

248
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,720
4小时要讲完全部挺辛苦
This is a lot to cover in four hours.

249
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,950
先说说对于乔治·R·R·马丁的这部巨作
Let's start with everything you know

250
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,860
你都知道些什么

Well, I know this guy dies, there's lots of boobs,

252
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,150
还有...  宇宙飞船吗
and I want to say... a spaceship?

253
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,130
你还是别说了  这样还能快点
This will go a lot faster if you don't talk.

254
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,210
他算是我亲戚  但有点复杂
So, he's kind of related to me, but it's a long story.

255
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,030
没事
Hey, it's okay.

256
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,210
我们都来自混乱的大家庭
We all come from messed-up families.

257
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,670
我叔叔是我爸
My uncle's my dad.

258
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,220
班表出来了
Shift schedule is up.

259
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,970

今天两班倒  明天早上六点上班
Double shift today and 6:00 A.M. tomorrow?

261
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,830
-这不公平  -管理层才不管我们死活
- That's not fair. - Management don't care.

262
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,370
今晚的派对得取消了
Party tonight is off.

263
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,910
啥也不会取消  艾狗会搞定的
Nothing is off. A-dogg is on it.

264
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,790
"艾狗"吗
"A-dogg"?

265
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,840
你别管
Let me have this.

266
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,690
你在顶上放一点奶油
So, you put a little bit of the cream on top.

267

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,520
我该怎么做
Okay, what do I do?

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,290
你做什么了
What did you do?

275

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,750
你总是讨厌我的礼物  我干嘛还要尝试

283
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,630
不不  请让我说完
No, no, please, uh, let me finish.

284
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,060
我一直觉得
I've always appreciated the thought

285
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,430
在办公室按摩是个好主意
of a massage in my office,

286

我部门的人问还会不会提供咖啡

293
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,570

294
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,790
这是谁
Who -- who's this?

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,740
他在面试仓库里的那个职位

296
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,550
他是叉车操作员

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,930
没错  2017年了

298
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,460
现在有好多叉车操作员是基佬呢
There are plenty of gay forklift drivers.

299
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,540

我不需要做核磁共振

是你跟医生说能品尝出颜色才让你做的
The doctor ordered when you told her you could taste colors

310
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,410
还是用法国口音

311
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,000
好吧
Oh -- all right.

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,630
我都不会法国口音
Well, I don't even do a french accent.

313
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,670
我也没说你模仿得好
I didn't say it was a good one.

314
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,360
两位  通常我们不会拖拉头部受伤的事情
Guys, we usually try to move the head injuries along.

315
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,900
好的
Yes. Okay.

316
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,960
这
Well, it's...

317
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,220
这太小了
It's just so small.

318
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,520
这比看起来的大
It's bigger than it looks.

319
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,870
你看  我脑子根本没问题
See, there's nothing wrong with my brain,

320
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,200
因为他那句话  我想到了三个绝佳的吐槽
'cause I have three funny comebacks to that.

321
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,150
小卡  别闹了  就听鲍比的吧
Cam, come on, let's listen to, uh, Bobby.

322
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,540
人家懂这自己是在干嘛
He knows what he's talking about.

323
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,390
我认为我们不能相信
I don't think we can really trust

324
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,590
一个名叫鲍比的成年人所说的任何话
anything a grown man named Bobby says.

325
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,990
好啦  亲爱的  没事的
Come on, honey, you got this.

326
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,120
罗伯特  你好
Okay. Uh, Robert, hi.

327
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,160
我能问件事吗...  是这样的
Can I have -- question. So, listen.

328
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,700
我知道这是个大磁铁
I know this is a giant magnet,

329
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,470
我有好多补牙
and I have a lot of fillings.

330
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,080
它们会穿过我脑袋被吸出来吗
Are they just gonna fly out of my head?

331
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,850
-从没发生过  -好吧
- That never happens. - Okay.

332
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,820
我正在服用补铁营养品
Um, I'm also on an iron supplement.

333
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,650
-那会...  -有影响吗  不
- Is that - An issue? No.

334
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,300
快上去台子吧
Let's just get you on that table, huh?

335
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,460
快点
Come on.

336
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,040
不  不行
No, okay, not happening.

337
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,250
我有阴影
I'm having flashbacks.

338
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,330
我不知道我有没有告诉过你
I don't know if I ever told you this,

339
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,040
小时候  我掉进井里过
But when I was kid, I fell into a well.

340
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,570
和也掉井里的杰西卡宝宝同一天
It happened the same day as baby Gessica,

341
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,000
{\an8}1986年18个月大的杰西卡宝宝掉入井里
搜救人员花了连续58小时最后成功将她救出

342
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,840
但她得到所有的媒体关注
but she got all the press.

343
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,810
现在我还好受伤
It still stings.

344
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,000
人人都爱小宝宝
Everybody loves a baby,

345
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,940
却没一个人为我这个高大的少年祈祷
but not one single prayer for a husky teen

346
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,160
我可是头朝下被困井里大半个小时啊
who's stuck head-first in a well for the better part of an hour.

347
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,850
小卡  别这样
Okay, Cam, come on.

348
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,110
你得冷静下来  好吗
You have got to calm down, all right?

349
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,660
这一眨眼就结束了
It'll be over before you know it.

350
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,420
-要一个小时  -我  我做不到
- In an hour. - I'm... I can't!

351
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,660
-我不做了  不做了  -等等  小卡
- I'm done, I'm out! - Okay, wait, wait, Cam, Cam.

352
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,510
鲍比  能不能让我进去
Okay, Bobby, is it okay if I get in there

353
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,200
让小卡看到进去是不会怎么样的
to show Cam that it's all right?

354
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
有这个时间吗
Do we have time for that?

355
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
行啊  预约我4点的人内出血了
Sure, my 4:00 hemorrhaged.

356
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,870
你能别...  好吧
Can you not -- okay.

357
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,830
好了  瞧瞧  小卡
All right, look at this, Cam.

358
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,760
小心点
Just be careful.

359
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,830
很舒服
It's comfortable.

360
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,480
我们就在这儿
We've got you.

361
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,360
我很好  没事的
Okay, I'm good. Okay.

362
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,200
老实说  小卡  这里很平静
Actually, Cam, this is very peaceful.

363
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,640
那里简直是酷刑室
It was a torture chamber.

364
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,400
我刚进去一分钟就哭了
I was in there one minute, and I cried.

365
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,890
我感觉很闲适  真的  真的
I feel so rested. I do, I do, I really do.

366
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,560
该你上了  没事的
Now you. It's all good.

367
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,180
去吧  没事的
There you go. All right.

368
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,760
我就在你旁边陪着你
And I will be right here beside you.

369
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,450
除了病人  旁人禁止逗留
Uh, no one's allowed in here except the patient.

370
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,420
我就在你隔壁房间陪着你
I will be in the next room right beside you.

371
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,020
好了  戴上耳机
Okay, so put your headphones on.

372
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,230
他们会让你听些东西来转移注意力
They're gonna play you something to get your mind off of it.

373
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,010
这是应急按钮
This is a panic button.

374
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,410
需要出来就按这个
Just push it if you need to get out.

375
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,710
好吧  我想我可以的
Oh, okay. Well, I think I can do this.

376
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,280
"艾拉·格拉斯为您带来《美国生活》
"This American Life," I'm Ira Glass.

377
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,140
今日节目"初汪之恋"
Today's program -- "Puppy love."

378
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,280
我们将听到一个男人
We'll hear the story of a man

379
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,770
通过走丢的雪纳瑞犬遇到灵魂伴侣的故事
who met his soul mate through a lost schnauzer,

380
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,250
还有俄勒冈州库斯湾的一只小猎犬
a beagle from Coos Bay, Oregon,

381
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,210
当了一周市长
who, for one week, was mayor.

382
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,380
开始第一幕
And we start with act 1,

383
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,580
搜救柯利牧羊犬寻找
a search-and-rescue collie looking for his owner,

384
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,670
遭活埋18天的主人
who was buried alive for 18 days.

385
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,180
在喝自己的尿液一周后
After drinking his own urine for a week,

386
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,640
贺拉斯·劳顿再也无法忽视残酷的事实
Horace Laughton could no longer ignore the terrible truth --

387
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,910
他氧气不足了"
he was running out of oxygen."

388
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,430
救命  救命
H-help. Help!

389
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,060
救命  让我出去
Help! Get me out of here!

390
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,900
我要杀了你
Hey! I will kill you!

391
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
小卡  别这样  这很严肃
Cam, come on, this is serious.

392
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,130
天啊  我无法呼吸了
Oh, my god. I can't breathe.

393
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,880
我需要氧气
I need air.

394
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,740
我要氧气
I need air!

395
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,190
抱歉  他太孩子气了
I'm sorry. He is being such a baby, huh?

396
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,920
里面有摄像头  我看到你哭了
There's a camera in there. I watched you cry.

397
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,020
最后  员工应该对排班有发言权
And finally, employees should have a say in the shift schedule.

398
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,530
这样我们才能相应安排自己的生活
It would allow us to plan our lives accordingly

399
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,220
也会让缺勤日更少
and would result in fewer missed days.

400
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,110
总之  无发言权无动力
In summation, no caffeination without representation.

401
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,090
一句话  我被炒了吗
So, am I fired?

402
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,360
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

403
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,380
仿佛大杯咖啡里满溢出特大杯级的建议
Those are 20-ounce ideas in a 16-ounce cup.

404
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,200
我忽略了眼皮子底下的冉冉新星
I have overlooked a rising star right under my nose.

405
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,050
但这是...
But that's the --

406
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,350
是的  助理经理的围裙
Yes, the assistant manager's apron.

407
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,620
我不是为这个来的
I didn't come in here for that.

408
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,250
正因为这样所以才给你
That's exactly why you're getting it.

409
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,340
但我不能...
But I -- I can't.

410
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,540
天啊  太复杂了
Oh, my God, this is so confusing.

411
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,850
演过《圣诞精灵》的侏儒
So, the little guy from "Elf"...

412
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,820
提利昂·兰尼斯特
Tyrion Lannister.

413
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,100
随便  我不关心演员的名字
Whatever. I don't know actors' names.

414
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,460
{\an8}那是他出演的角色名
接下来也都是《权力的游戏》剧中角色名

415
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,290
他是詹姆的弟弟还是瑟曦的
Is he Jaime's brother or Cersei's brother?

416
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,460
都是  詹姆和瑟曦是兄妹
Both -- Jaime and Cersei are brother and sister.

417
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,770
但他们刚还在塔里搞了  好扭曲
But they were just doing it in the tower. That is so twisted.

418
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,220
赶紧继续
Go on.

419
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,120
大伙  刚发生了超疯狂的事
Guys, the craziest thing just happened.

420
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,490
我进去提了一系列要求
I went in there with a list of demands.

421
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,510
结果却阴险地成功升职
And weaseled your way to a promotion.

422
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,910
不  相信我  一切都和原来一样
No, trust me -- n-nothing is going to change.

423
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,940
不过既然我都看到了
But while I'm staring at it,

424
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,600
你们哪个能找时间把垃圾丢了吗
would one of you guys mind taking out this trash at some point?

425
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,280
向助理经理问好[纳粹礼]
Heil, assistant manager.

426
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,530
不不不  这对我们都好
No, no, no, no, no! This is good for all of us.

427
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,340
现在我们内部有人了  就是我
Now we have someone on the inside -- me.

428
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,590
艾狗
A-dogg.

429
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,930
是"艾"道夫·希特勒吧
More like Adolf.

430
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,390
你把纳粹暴行想得也太小了吧
I-I-I think you're really minimizing that atrocity.

431
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,750
待会我来说
Now, let me do the talking.

432
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,810
好  我正好不想说
Good. I don't feel like talking.

433
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,110
实在是怀着这梦想30年
It's just you nurture a dream for 30 years,

434
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,630
最后眼睁睁看它像皮特的眉毛般烧毁了
only to see it go up in flames like Pete's eyebrow.

435
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,660
我感觉像是...
I feel like a part of --

436
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,850
说好的不说话呢
This is you not talking?

437
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,770
他来了  上
There he is. Go.

438
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,280
是你啊
Oh, it's you.

439
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,720
先告诉你一声
Now, before you say anything,

440
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,560
-我们还是不感兴趣  -好
- we're still not interested. - Okay.

441
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,860
但假如我们感兴趣
But if we were interested,

442
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,220
也要比你出的价高很多
it would take a hell of a lot more than what you offered.

443
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,420
那些下水道怎么办
What about all the sewage?

444
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,370
习惯成自然
You get used to it.

445
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,430
先生们  我出价时
Gentlemen, when I made that offer,

446
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,810
还没发现这些问题
we didn't know about any of the problems.

447
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,300
我们公司对那块地已经失去兴趣了
I'm afraid we're no longer interested.

448
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,970
杰瑞德  我挺欣赏你
Jared, I like you.

449
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,700
我们愿意接受原价加5%
We're willing to go 5%.

450
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,530
我说了  交易取消
Like I said, the offer's off the table.

451
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,220
要捎你们一程吗
You guys need a ride?

452
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,600
我自己有车  谢谢
I have a car. Thank you.

453
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,610
希望不是那边那台
Hope it's not that one over there.

454
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,740
我的狗还在里面呢
My dog is in that car!

455
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,720
阿多堵着门救他的朋友布兰·史塔克
And as Hodor blocked the door to save his friend Bran Stark,

456
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
布兰用余光看着年轻的阿多说
Bran had a vision of a younger Hodor saying,

457
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,310
"挡着门  挡着门
"Hold the door, hold the door.

458
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,390
挡着门"
Hold door."

459
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,840
最后  挡着门[阿多]变成他余生中
And finally, "Hodor," the only word he would say

460
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,220
说的唯一一句话
for the rest of his life,

461
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,910
而他的生命也到此终结
A life that was now ending.

462
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,150
他早就知道了
He knew.

463
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,650
阿多一直都知道
Hodor knew his whole life

464
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,680
救小伙伴是他的使命
that his destiny was to save his little friend.

465
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,190
就像你拯救了本要在动漫节上出糗的我
Just like you have saved me from embarrassment at comic-con,

466
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,040
谢谢你  曼尼
so thank you, Manny.

467
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,960
不客气  我得走了
My pleasure. I should get going.

468
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,450
我也是  得去换我的卡丽熙装扮了
Oh, my God, me too. I have to change into my Khaleesi costume.

469
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,690
我再多待个几分钟还是可以的
I could probably stick around for a few more minutes.

470
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,950
派对可以挪到周一
Maybe I'll move the party to Monday.

471
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,340
周一我有空
Oh! I'm free Monday.

472
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,620
咱们待会聊
Let's talk later.

473
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,760
别  求你们了  我从没想过背叛你们
No, please. I never meant to betray you.

474
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,130
你们的友谊比这个傻逼职位重要得多
Your friendship means more to me than this stupid apron.

475
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,260
傻逼
Stupid?

476
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,970
斯科特
Oh, Scott.

477
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,890
世上有很多人会为了围这围裙
There's a whole world of people

478
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,130
而争得头破血流
that would kill to wear this apron,

479
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,890
但这条路不属于我
but this just isn't my path.

480
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,820
这新增的职责令我感到被孤立
This extra responsibility has me feeling alienated.

481
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,730
一人之下万人之上何其孤单
It's lonely one step down from the top.

482
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,910
信不信由你
You may not believe this,

483
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,560
但我一人独霸天下更感寂寞
but it's even lonelier way up here.

484
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,750
在我往上爬的路上  我忘了自己的梦想
Somewhere on my climb, I forgot my own dream --

485
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,840
成为南加州都会区最出色的速度金属鼓手
to be the best damn speed-metal drummer in the Inland empire.

486
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,290
现在还不晚  斯科特
There's still time, Scott.

487
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,270
说得对  我辞职
You're right. I quit.

488
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:27,830
什么
What?

489
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,290
现在你是经理了
You are the manager now.

490
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,760
你们俩  来我家开派对  快
Hey, you two, party at my house. Come on!

491
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,030
-棒  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

492
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,960
跟你说一声  有个马桶堵到满出来了
Oh, FYI, one of the toilets is overflowing.

493
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,250
不是吧  躲到屋顶
Seriously, the roof?

494
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,560
我到处找你呢
I've been looking for you everywhere.

495
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,790
我只想有点空间  呼吸一下新鲜空气
I just needed some space and some fresh air.

496
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,760
闻起来有一种紫紫的感觉
It smells so purple.

497
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,830
好了  快回去体检  快走
Okay, you're going in that tube. Come on.

498
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,630
你的力气就这么点吗
Seriously, that's as hard as you can pull?

499
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,200
我才不弱
I am not the weak one here.

500
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,210
你连这么简单的体检也不做
You're the one who won't even get a simple medical test.

501
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,320
怎么  害怕了
What are you -- scared?

502
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,160
你是胆小鬼吗
Huh? You're chicken?

503
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,930
对  都吓尿了
Yeah, and I thought I made that clear in there

504
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,740
难道还不够清楚吗
when I peed a little.

505
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,540
行  那你就安心地死去吧
Fine, you just go ahead and die.

506
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,250
我自己把莉莉抚养长大
And I'll raise Lily by myself,

507
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,450
她这辈子再也不会去任何农场或马戏团了
And she will never step foot in another farm or circus.

508
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,630
那我做鬼也不会放过你
I will haunt you.

509
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,200
或者你就去检查一下吧
Or you could just get your head checked

510
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,930
我们就不会因你害怕而失去了你
so we don't lose you over some stupid fear.

511
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,710
你知道1987年10月14日
Do you know what I went through in that well

512
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,490
我掉到井里的时候经历了什么吗
on October 14, 1987,

513
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,820
全世界的目光都聚焦在
while the whole world was focused

514
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,210
杰西卡那个小贱人身上
on that media whore Gessica?

515
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,460
她当时还小  不过我记得
She was a baby, but yeah.

516
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,440
太可怕了
It was hell.

517
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,370
我可能早就一命呜呼了
And I would not have survived

518
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,300
还好消防员找到方法
if those firemen wouldn't have figured out a way

519
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,170
把我小姑姑艾德娜送到井下
to lower my little aunt Edna into that well

520
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,260
摸着我的脚告诉我不会有事的
and touch my feet and tell me it was gonna be okay

521
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,710
我陪着你
and that I wasn't alone.

522
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,690
小卡  我要是能在里面陪你
Cam, if there's a way that I could be in there with you,

523
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,780
我一定去  可我...
I would, but I --

524
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,220
等等
Wait a minute.

525
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,340
很好
Hey, you're doing great.

526
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,020
好的  我就在你身边
Okay, I'm right there with you.

527
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,320
我陪着你
You're not alone.

528
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,630
谢谢
Thank you.

529
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,040
你真是个好丈夫
You're a good husband.

530
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,450
多谢夸奖
Oh, that's very sweet.

531
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,150
对了  小卡
Oh, and, Cam.

532
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,180
要是扫描发现你没事  你就吃屎吧
If the scan shows that you're fine, you can suck it,

533
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,950
因为非技术型的这位爹
because this mechanically-challenged daddy

534
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,360
一个人做了这个挠脚机器
made this foot-rubbing machine all by himself.

535
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,070
我做的  我做的
I did. I did this.

536
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,810
舒服吧
It's good, right?

537
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,760
看你已经开始放松了
I see you unclenching.

538
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,480
我怕被别人看见
I'm just concerned that other people are gonna see me.

539
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,440
麻烦别乱动
Keep still, please.

540
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,320
我说了  她在开会
I told you, she's in a meeting right now.

541
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,650
放开我的领带
Let -- let go of my tie.

542
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,050
你完全没有放松下来啊
You're not getting any looser.

543
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,250
好想知道原因哦
Oh, I wonder why.

544
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,340
快回去工作
Come on, get back to work.

545
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,380
老闻到你女朋友办公室飘来松露巧克力的味道
It's a little hard to focus with the smell of truffles

546
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,520
注意力好难集中
just wafting out of your girlfriend's office.

547
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,660
我女朋友是你们老板
My girlfriend is your boss, okay?

548
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,180
她也不是我女朋友
And she's not my girlfriend.

549
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,870
我不否认我们对彼此来电
I won't deny we have chemistry,

550
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,100
有某种似是而非  若即若离的情愫
A certain will-they, won't-they kind of vibe.

551
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,300
好了  各位  你们好
Okay, guys, hi.

552
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,650
如果你们能给我20分钟
If you could just give me 20 minutes

553
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,040
处理一下个人事务
to deal with a personal situation,

554
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,870
我保证处理完会出来给大家一个交代
I promise I will come out and address all of your concerns.

555
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,200
-里面是在干嘛  -对啊
- What is going on in there? - Yeah.

556
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,330
有一点医疗方面的事情
Well, um, it's a medical situation.

557
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,480
其实还挺难以启齿的
Actually, and it's kind of embarrassing,

558
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,690
我很感激大家在如此困难时刻的体谅包涵
So I appreciate your support in this difficult time.

559
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,640
这事得赶紧弄完  你还需要多久
We got to wrap this up. How long do you need?

560
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,020
最少15分钟
At least 15 minutes.

561
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,120
我给你5分钟
You got five.

562
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,140
女士  这工作已经很不容易了
Ma'am, this job is hard enough.

563
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,860
有个小问题
Uh, hey, so, small problem.

564
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,990
可以登
It can wait!

565
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,020
没有等不了的问题
Every problem can wait.

566
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,710
一边凉快去吧  这位先生
So now go, mister.

567
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,480
你不是吧  我都去过你家了
Come on, I've been in your home.

568
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,130
说吧  本  是什么事
All right, Ben. What is it?

569
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,590
今天是玛格丽特的生日
Today's Margaret's birthday... Uh-huh.

570
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,750
但是当时已经来不及取消蛋糕
...but it was too late to cancel the cake.

571
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,100
大家都看到蛋糕送来了
Everyone saw it get delivered.

572
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,660
没事  那就让他们吃蛋糕吧
It's fine. Let them eat cake.

573
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,220
什么  她是不是在开玩笑
What? Is she kidding?

574
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,050
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant!

575
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,250
克莱尔  深呼吸
Claire, breathe.

576
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,230
不要  才不要
No, no!

577
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,510
歌洛莉亚  够了
Gloria, we're done.

578
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,050
别冲我嚷嚷  我只是想哄你开心
Don't scream at me. I just wanted to make you happy.

579
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,680
而我也是在哄你开心
And I'm just trying to make you happy

580
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,950
因为你对别人喜不喜欢
because you're so damn sensitive

581
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,940
你的生日礼物这件事超级玻璃心
about me not liking your birthday presents.

582
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,120
而我今天最最不需要的就是这个
Come on, this is the last thing I needed today.

583
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,210
天啊  快看她的手
Oh, my God. Look at her hands.

584
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,920
她就在这里面做指甲吗
She's just been in here getting a manicure.

585
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,050
你的良心不痛吗
How do you sleep?

586
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,730
拿下她
Get her!

587
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,840
冷静点  乔茜
Whoa, whoa, back it up, Josie.

588
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,990
没有人要拿下她
Nobody's gonna get her.

589
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,140
我知道这场面看起来有点糟糕
I realize that the optics are a bit troubling,

590
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,920
尤其是在今天
Especially today.

591
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
一个你在里面喝着香槟
A day when you've been sipping champagne

592
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,800
而我们在外面超过一小时吃不到零食的一天
while we've gone over an hour without snacks.

593
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,810
够了
Enough!

594
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,060
你们这帮人真该觉得自己丢脸
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

595
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,620
我都认识你们多久了
How long have I known you people?

596
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,770
多明  肯尼  乔茜
Dom, Kenny, Josie,

597
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,510
-两个赫姆  -你不是吧
- The two Herms. - Seriously?

598
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,570
你们所有人5点准时下班  而她从来不下班  
You all go home at 5:00. This woman never punches out.

599
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,560
她回了家也很少睡觉
She goes home and never sleeps

600
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,310
因为她不停在想怎么让公司更好
because she's thinking how to make this company better.

601
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,510
你们看不出来她人都要废了吗
Can't you tell what a mess she has become?

602
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,240
看她有多神经紧绷  还开始抽抽
How tense she is, her awkward tics,

603
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
压力大磨牙都要把牙磨没了
The way she grinds her teeth to dust.

604
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,040
我觉得她应该被宠爱照顾一下
I think that she deserves some pampering.

605
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,070
你们都快滚出去吧
So now get out of here!

606
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,160
走吧  走吧
Let's go. Come on.

607
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,580
歌洛莉亚
Gloria.

608
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,650
对不起啦
I am sorry.

609
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,880
我今年真的想把送你礼物搞好
I just wanted to make it right this year.

610
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,380
有的  你真的做到了
Oh, you did. You really did.

611
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,240
那就好  现在回去坐好
Okay, good. So go back and sit down

612
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,400
因为抱你就像抱个衣帽架似地
Because hugging you is like hugging a coat rack.

613
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,850
好了
Okay.

614
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,970
很好
Oh, that's good.

615
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,620
对不起
I'm sorry.

616
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,340
我做了力所不能及的大梦
I dreamt too big.

617
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,240
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

618
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,600
是我自己相信了你
I'm the one who believed in you.

619
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,460
也是你抬价把我们抬到太平间
You're also the one who overplayed his hand.

620
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,640
我们已经知道我们都犯了错误
We've already established mistakes were made.

621
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,110
现在该想想接下来该怎么走
We need to be thinking about next steps.

622
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,650
或许我们该盖个小一点的项目
Maybe we need to build something smaller,

623
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,350
比如一个很酷的小餐厅之类的
Like a cool restaurant or something.

624
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,490
我也想过  但谁会来这里吃啊
I've thought about that. Who's gonna come down here?

625
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,350
这里都没地方停车
There's nowhere to park.

626
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,890
天啊  就是这个了  停车场
Oh, my God, that's it -- a parking lot.

627
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,640
这主意还不错
That's not bad.

628
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,360
盖这个都不要什么成本
We could build it for nothing

629
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,670
而且很快就能把贷款给还上
and pay off the majority of the loan by tomorrow.

630
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,410
咱们还是换个地儿聊吧
Let's talk about this somewhere else.

631
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,640
或许15岁的菲尔的计划并没有错
Maybe 15-year-old Phil had it right.

632
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,290
有时候你只需要把你的梦想
Sometimes you have to look at your dream

633
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,630
换个角度看
from a different angle.

634
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,670
或许梦想一直都是个停车场
I guess it was a parking lot all along.

635
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,180
求你告诉我是晚餐做好了
Please tell me that's dinner.

636
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,020
-我要饿死了  -不  是大爸的闹钟
- I'm starving. - No, that's daddy's alarm.

637
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,590
因为脑震荡  我们不能让他
We can't let him nap for more than two hours

638
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,870
小睡超过两小时
because of the concussion.

639
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,560
看他睡的样子  多么平静安宁
Oh, look at him. He looks so peaceful.

640
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,230
他今天太辛苦了
He's had such a rough day.

641
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,390
我上次试着叫醒他的时候  他超不开心
When I tried to wake him up last time, he got so upset.

642
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,300
我来吧
I'll do it.

643
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,980
谁教你的啊
Who raised you?

644
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,770
好吧  温柔点啊
Fine, just be gentle, okay?

645
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,490
谢谢惠顾
Thanks.

646
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,820
还有  别碰这个
Also, don't touch this.

647
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,140
这是我的美术作业
It's my art project.

648
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,180
-我能帮忙你一起弄吗  -不能
- Oh, can I help you with that? - No.

649
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,800
大爸说应该他来帮  因为他比你有美术细胞
Daddy said he should because he's more artistic than you.

650
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,580
拿来
Okay.

651
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,770
怎么了  怎么了  咋啦
What?! What?! Why?!

652
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,390
太好了你还活着
So good you're alive
