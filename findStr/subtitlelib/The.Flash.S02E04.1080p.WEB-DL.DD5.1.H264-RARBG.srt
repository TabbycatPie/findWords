1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,935
<i> Barry: My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:05,337
<i> and I am</i>
<i> the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,141
<i> To the outside world, I'm</i>
<i>an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:12,177
<i> but secretly, with the help</i>
<i>of my friends at s.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,881
<i> I fight crime and find</i>
<i> other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,816
<i> I hunted down the man</i>
<i> who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,120
<i> but in doing so, I opened up</i>
<i> our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,490
<i> and I am the only one</i>
<i> fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,726
<i> I am the flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,328
<i> Iris:</i>
<i> Previously on "the flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,763
<i> - Iris's mom is alive.</i>

12
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,698
- And you thought
you could pay me

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,466
to walk away
from my own daughter.

14
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,435
- Last time you walked away
for free.

15
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,736
- When you created
the singularity,

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,405
you also created
a breach--

17
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,240
<i> a portal connecting</i>
<i> our two earths.</i>

18
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,641
<i> - You really think he's just</i>

19
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,876
<i> bringing these guys here</i>
<i> to kill me?</i>

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,677
- Zoom is obsessed
with destroying me.

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,179
Now he wants
to destroy you.

22
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,216
- I'm starting to perceive
things--horrible things.

23
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,386
- We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons

24
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,155
by separating
in the eye of it.

25
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,222
- No!

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,294
Ronnie died saving me,
and I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,562
No, no, no, get back.
Come here.

28
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,765
- Professor Stein,
can you hear me?

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,104
<i> Barry:</i>
<i> Everyone secretly thinks</i>

30
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,539
<i> they've figured out</i>
<i> what their life</i>

31
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,107
<i> is gonna be like,</i>

32
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,310
<i> but what no one ever considers</i>
<i> is that life has</i>

33
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,414
<i> its own plans for you,</i>
<i> whether you like them or not.</i>

34
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,950
<i> And so you're left</i>
<i> with a choice.</i>

35
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:29,455
<i> You can either embrace</i>
<i> the change and move forward,</i>

36
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,590
<i> or fight it,</i>
<i> and be left behind.</i>

37
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,326
- Dude!
I knew you could do it.

38
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,931
- That was some touchdown, man.
You won us the game!

39
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,867
- Hey, no, man.
<i> We</i> won us the game.

40
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,135
- Hey, that's not what
the cheerleaders were saying.

41
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,637
- Oh, yeah? For real?
A'ight.

42
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,440
- Jefferson,
great game.

43
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,942
- Hey, thanks, coach.

44
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,344
- I'm not the only one
that noticed.

45
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,580
Lot of scouts in the stands
tonight,

46
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,181
and after that touchdown,

47
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,684
they all pulled out
their cell phones.

48
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,120
You're gonna get your pick
of colleges, son.

49
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,187
- You really think so?

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,989
- I know so.

51
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,192
You get home and celebrate
with your mom.

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,507
- Everybody, run!

53
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,346
- Oh!

54
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,916
- Hey, hey, come on, man,
i got you!

55
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,554
We gotta get
inside the tunnel!

56
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,526
Ugh!

57
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,261
Aah!

58
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,735
- Hold him steady!

59
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,036
- He's dropping out.

60
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,337
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

61
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,472
- Cisco,
we're losing him!

62
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,740
- Got it!

63
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,118
Oh, dios mio.
Thank god.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,519
- He's getting worse.

65
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,488
- Look, I did what I could
to re-engineer

66
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,889
doctor Wells's
original stabilizer

67
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,424
to quell the reaction,
but I don't know

68
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,859
what he used
as a power source.

69
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,527
Best I could find was
the one from his wheelchair.

70
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,162
- And how long
will that last?

71
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,997
- Well, that's the problem,
is we had already used up

72
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,066
most of its energy trying
to dampen the metas' powers

73
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,636
during our little rogue air trip
with weather wizard and company.

74
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,271
I think we got
a few days tops.

75
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,306
- And he's stuck in bed?

76
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,674
- Yeah,
when he wakes up,

77
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,442
I'm gonna transfer
the stabilizer to this,

78
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,277
give him a power cane,
get him moving.

79
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,513
- We gotta figure out
a way to save him.

80
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,282
- I think I might know
how to do that.

81
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,284
When the particle accelerator
exploded,

82
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,020
the dark matter that collided
with professor Stein

83
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,256
fused with the firestorm matrix
and altered

84
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,559
the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

85
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,295
Those highly reactive
molecules needed

86
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,531
something to bond with
in order to stabilize.

87
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,865
- And that's where
Ronnie came in.

88
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,535
- Yes, and now that
Ronnie is no longer

89
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,070
a part of professor Stein--

90
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,738
- those molecules don't have
anything to bond to.

91
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,440
- And the longer he goes
without merging,

92
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,009
the more unstable
he becomes.

93
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,844
- Ugh.

94
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,814
All right, so,
what do we do?

95
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,683
- We find another...
Participant.

96
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,752
- Okay, cool, so,
how do we do that?

97
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,886
Are we just gonna make
a tinder app

98
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,455
for potential meta-humans?

99
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,556
'Cause I'm pretty sure
merging with Stein

100
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,924
and randomly bursting
into flames

101
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,392
sounds like the biggest
"swipe left" of all time.

102
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:24,096
- I mean, even if we could
find someone willing,

103
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,931
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

104
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,667
- No he can't,
but I have done some research,

105
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,602
and found two potential
candidates

106
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,204
that might be compatible
with him.

107
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,306
They both were affected
by the dark matter,

108
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,841
and they were both admitted
to the hospital

109
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,810
showing symptoms
of gene rearrangement mutation.

110
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,712
And they both share
the same blood type

111
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,080
as professor Stein
and Ronnie.

112
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,115
- All right.

113
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,218
I mean, this is more
than organ donation.

114
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,719
We'll need more
than tissue typing

115
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,655
to see if their bodies
are compatible.

116
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,790
- If I can isolate
the genetic locus

117
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,126
of the two candidates
and cross-reference it

118
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,128
with the mutations
in professor Stein,

119
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,699
I might be able to find a match
and save his life.

120
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,170
- What do you need
to do that?

121
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,626
- All right, blood samples
from both potential candidates.

122
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,294
- Damn, that was fast
even for you.

123
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:33,031
- I may have skipped
the asking for permission part.

124
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,033
- Let's see if we can't
find a match.

125
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,441
- You were two
in that picture.

126
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:46,211
You'd just got some shots.
You were so mad at the nurse.

127
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,113
You kept saying,
"she pinched me."

128
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,717
- So we took you to the park
afterwards to cheer you up,

129
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,518
gave you your first
ice cream cone,

130
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,588
which was a mistake, because
all we heard the next month was,

131
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,757
"mint-choplat chip,
mint-choplat chip."

132
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,258
Oh,

133
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,328
that's where the obsession
started.

134
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,898
- Babe, you don't
have to do this.

135
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,336
If you don't want to meet
your mother tomorrow, I get it.

136
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,740
- No, it's okay.
I want to meet her.

137
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:18,443
I need to meet her.

138
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,313
It's gonna be fine.

139
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,781
Both: Mm.

140
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,349
- My brave baby girl.

141
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,852
- Take after you.

142
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,523
- Love you.

143
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,725
- Love you more.

144
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,030
- Barry?

145
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,999
Hey, I was just looking for you.

146
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,801
I would've called, but I don't
have your number yet, so.

147
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,236
- Oh, yeah--

148
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,071
- no, no, no, I just wanted
to show you this.

149
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,339
These were just found

150
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,673
in an alley
off of Eastwood Avenue.

151
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,975
- What are these, teeth?

152
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,276
- Shark teeth.

153
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,111
And I have an eyewitness
that says

154
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:57,816
he saw a shark walking
on land--a man-shark.

155
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,251
- Man-shark?
- Yeah.

156
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,852
- Sounds like
a bad Sci-Fi movie.

157
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,621
- Or awesome Sci-Fi movie.

158
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,523
Totally.

159
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,191
Um...

160
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,726
Are you for real?
You think there's actually,

161
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,060
like, a shark--

162
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,097
- yeah, I mean, I know
it sounds really wacko...

163
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,165
- Mm-hmm.
- But, I mean,

164
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,166
nothing seems impossible
now that

165
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,767
we have meta-humans,
right?

166
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,068
And I thought it would be fun,
you know,

167
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,237
for us to work together again
on a case.

168
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,739
- Yeah, I mean,
i really--

169
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,274
I'd love to work on anything
with you.

170
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,376
Um, it's just,
you know,

171
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,813
meta-humans aren't
really my thing.

172
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,715
- Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
I can handle it.

173
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,118
- No, you--look,
how about I just--

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,688
I'll run a test,
see where the teeth came from.

175
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,823
- That would be amazing.

176
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,824
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

177
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:39,825
- Yeah, sure.

178
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,460
- Detective spivot.

179
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,727
- Detective.

180
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,796
- How's your man-shark case
coming?

181
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,198
- It's good.
I was just gonna go

182
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,933
and canvas the area,
see what else I can dig up,

183
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,569
and Barry here agreed
to run some tests for me.

184
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,636
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,939
- So, progress.
Thanks again.

186
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,974
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,375
- If I didn't know
any better,

188
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,778
I'd say you were flirting
with my partner.

189
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,279
- What, Patty?
No, I'm--

190
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,781
what are you talking about?

191
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,082
I'm not--

192
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:08,220
- what is it with you and Iris
and my partners?

193
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,088
- Hey, how is Iris,
by the way?

194
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,690
- Eh, she's pretty nervous

195
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,757
about seeing her mother

196
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,925
after all these years.

197
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,327
- Yeah.

198
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,995
Hey, you know what,
i gotta go.

199
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,964
It's cisco.
It's about professor Stein.

200
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,532
- Okay, go.
I'll cover you with Singh.

201
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,534
- All right, thanks.

202
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,505
- Well, I must admit,
i never imagined

203
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,875
the sphinx's riddle about a man
requiring three legs

204
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,109
would ever apply to me,

205
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,745
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

206
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,213
then I will
gratefully oblige.

207
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,216
- Hopefully, you won't need it
for much longer.

208
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,285
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

209
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,120
and cross-matching
was negative for both,

210
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,722
and it appears that
the dark matter

211
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,257
from the particle accelerator
explosion

212
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,259
mutated their genes
in a very similar way

213
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,460
it did to yours.

214
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,662
I think they're both
potential matches.

215
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,863
- So who do we go with?

216
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,099
- Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

217
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,269
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson university

218
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,937
with a double major
in applied physics

219
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,138
and bioengineering.

220
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,673
- A Hudson boy,
i like him already.

221
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,476
- Now, what about this other guy
Jefferson Jackson?

222
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,978
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

223
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,548
He's got the physical
attributes.

224
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,584
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

225
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,120
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

226
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,356
- On paper, perhaps,
but Hewitt is a scientist.

227
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,992
Clearly, he's trying to make
something of his life.

228
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,395
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

229
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,696
- I think we should meet
with both of them

230
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,764
before we make a decision.

231
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,032
- That's an excellent idea.

232
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,700
- I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

233
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,068
- All right, in the meantime,

234
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,236
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

235
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,904
- And I will try to find
something else

236
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,540
to help keep you stable.

237
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,565
- Are you sure this is
the right place?

238
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,501
- Yeah.
Jefferson's a mechanic.

239
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,838
- Could indicate
a strong technical aptitude.

240
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,139
That's a positive.

241
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,275
Oh, prone to allergies.

242
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,544
That's definitely a negative,

243
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,046
not to mention
his taste in music.

244
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,615
Would you prefer Celine Dion

245
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,083
instead?

246
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,884
I got the "Titanic" soundtrack
in the back there.

247
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,919
- No, thank you.

248
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,454
- Jefferson Jackson,
right?

249
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,688
- People call me Jax.

250
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,357
- Ooh, catchy.

251
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,493
- My name's Barry Allen,
and this is Martin Stein.

252
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,261
We're with
the department of safety.

253
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,697
It's a small,
newly formed agency.

254
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,067
- Very new, we probably don't
even have a website yet, do we?

255
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,369
- You need to see
our licenses?

256
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,870
I mean, we're all
up to code here.

257
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,805
- No, no, nothing like that.

258
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,242
We are compiling data
on people who were affected

259
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,177
by the particle accelerator
explosion two years ago.

260
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,146
- Look, man, I lost
enough time in my life

261
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,748
'cause of that stupid thing
going wrong.

262
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,950
Now, you don't got a car
i can fix, I can't help you.

263
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,020
- If you would consider coming
back to s.T.A.R. Labs with us,

264
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,721
I believe we can help you.

265
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,156
- Help me how?

266
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,226
- Well, we know what
the particle accelerator did--

267
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,695
- look, I already told you,
i don't talk about that night.

268
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,996
- Why is that?

269
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,564
- Because that's when
everything changed.

270
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,599
I got hit hard.

271
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,234
When I woke up,
i was in the hospital.

272
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,136
Busted up leg,
torn acl.

273
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,705
The look on my mom's face,
i knew any dreams I had

274
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,640
of playing pro ball
were over.

275
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,808
- I'm sorry to hear that.

276
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,476
- Yeah, well...

277
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,211
Look, I gotta get
back to work.

278
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,614
- Yeah, um...

279
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,016
Here, it's just...

280
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,886
It's our number.

281
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,621
Just think about it, okay?

282
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,504
- Thank you for putting this
together, Joseph.

283
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,074
- Iris's idea,
not mine.

284
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,043
Hey, baby.

285
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,045
- Hi, dad.

286
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:02,053
- Iris...
This is Francine.

287
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,988
- Hello.

288
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,826
- Hi.
Hello, Iris.

289
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,696
- Can I get you a coffee
or something?

290
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,200
- Um, no, thanks.

291
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,570
Let's just sit.

292
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,039
- I can't get over
what a beautiful young woman

293
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,407
you've become.

294
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,845
And a journalist?
I'm so proud of you.

295
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,214
- Why are you here?

296
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:33,118
Why now,
after two decades?

297
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,153
- I want to make this
right with you.

298
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,055
- How about you start
by apologizing

299
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,490
for walking out on us?

300
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:43,328
- I am sorry,
so very, very sorry.

301
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,931
There's so much
you don't know.

302
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,269
- I'm sure that you've
been through a great deal,

303
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,538
and I can appreciate
you feeling like this is

304
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,609
suddenly the right time
for you to want me in your life,

305
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,844
but that doesn't mean that it's
the right time for me.

306
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:00,845
- Iris...

307
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,514
- No, dad, it's okay.

308
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,349
I've thought about this
a lot,

309
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,719
and it wasn't fair for me
to make you the bad guy.

310
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,955
So I want you to hear this
from me.

311
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,358
I don't hate you, Francine.

312
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,994
I do wish you well,

313
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,298
but we have lived separate lives
for over 20 years.

314
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,201
Let's keep it that way.

315
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,544
I've always thought

316
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,746
my destiny was
for greater things.

317
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,214
And people, of course.

318
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,448
- Well, when it's all
said and done,

319
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,150
flying will be
the least impressive

320
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,885
of your new abilities.

321
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:45,356
- Man finally achieves
the promise of the atomic age.

322
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,592
- Caitlin,
what's going on?

323
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,296
- Hi, I'm glad you're back.
This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.

324
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,565
This is Barry Allen and
professor Martin Stein.

325
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,432
- How do you do?

326
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,334
- The illustrious
Martin Stein.

327
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,236
I've read all your papers
back at Hudson,

328
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,073
especially on transmutation.
Fascinating.

329
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,808
You're a legend.
- Oh, please.

330
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,844
I think you're overestimating
my contribution to the field.

331
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,545
I--i appreciate your enthusiasm.
- Isn't he great?

332
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,214
- He's got an ego
the size of Texas,

333
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,616
but, yeah,
he's all right.

334
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,952
- So, where's
Jefferson Jackson?

335
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,486
- We just need
more time.

336
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,754
- We don't have more time.

337
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,323
I couldn't find
another power source

338
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,791
for the cane
and that thing's running out.

339
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,793
- Okay, then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

340
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,994
- What do you mean?
You told him the details

341
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,495
of the firestorm matrix?

342
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,698
- Absolutely, becoming firestorm
is a huge life change.

343
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,499
He needs to know what
he's getting himself into.

344
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,836
- If I remember correctly,
vector, variance, hypotenuse--

345
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,239
- proton, neutron,
go h.U.!

346
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,940
- Aw, look at that,
that's so cute.

347
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,209
We'll have two professor steins
if this works.

348
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,210
- It's gonna work.

349
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,079
- Yeah.

350
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,680
- Okay.

351
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,916
- When I put this splicer
on your chest

352
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,584
you're gonna feel a rush.

353
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,419
That's a molecular primer
being released into your body.

354
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,188
Then you can make
physical contact

355
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,156
with professor Stein, and...

356
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,692
Firestorm matrix
will take over.

357
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,693
- Easy enough.

358
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,961
- Ready?

359
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,564
- No time like the present.
Thank you, my dear.

360
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,065
- Okay.

361
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,751
- Try again.

362
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,434
This is unexpected.

363
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,338
- Something's supposed to be
happening, right?

364
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,372
Why isn't it working?

365
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,774
- I don't know.

366
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,642
- Uh, well,

367
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:48,079
looks like you two aren't
compatible after all.

368
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,415
I'm just gonna...

369
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,750
- So all this was
for nothing?

370
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:56,521
- Believe me, no one is
more disappointed than I am.

371
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,856
- Yeah, don't be so sure
about that.

372
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,626
Next time, try to get
your act together

373
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,829
before you get
someone's hopes up.

374
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,554
- Move the show-and-tell
to next Tuesday,

375
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,888
remind me to call Richard
tomorrow

376
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,590
about the shareholders meeting,
and where are we

377
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,392
with the replacement
for doctor snow?

378
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,095
- Uh--

379
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,131
- applied sciences.

380
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,209
- Stop!

381
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,543
Don't move!

382
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,682
- Harrison?

383
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,522
- Detective west,
thank you for coming.

384
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,890
- Doctor McGee,
this is my new partner,

385
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,891
detective spivot.

386
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,159
- It's nice to meet you.

387
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,461
I was saddened
by detective thawne's passing.

388
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,597
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

389
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,298
- Thank you.
On the phone

390
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,868
you mentioned this was
a sensitive matter.

391
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,736
- It is, and I called you
directly

392
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,906
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

393
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,042
- Of course, can you tell me
what was stolen?

394
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,911
- It's not so much what was
stolen, but who stole it.

395
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,048
The person who broke into
my facility last night

396
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,816
was Harrison Wells.

397
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,019
- Harrison Wells is dead.

398
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,988
- I seem to recall
the circumstances

399
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,357
around his passing were
a bit inconclusive.

400
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,559
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

401
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,927
- Zero possibility.

402
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,929
- I knew the man
for over 20 years.

403
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,798
I know who I saw.

404
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,068
The only thing distinctively
different was...

405
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,204
He's walking again.

406
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,374
Like I said,
i trust your discretion.

407
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,342
You have full access
to the facility.

408
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,546
Thank you again,
detective.

409
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,985
First a shark-man,
now a dead man walking.

410
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,254
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

411
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,491
- Barry can't hear
about any of this.

412
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,959
- What--why?

413
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,694
- Because he's got
a lot on his plate.

414
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,129
He's got a friend who's sick
who he needs his help,

415
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,265
and Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

416
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,267
Once he hears that--

417
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,268
- is he okay?

418
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,837
- He's fine, but...

419
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,506
Not a word to him or anyone,
okay?

420
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,041
- Okay.

421
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,578
Yeah, it's just,
I'm not really good at lying.

422
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,614
- Well, you better learn,
quick.

423
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,817
- Yeah, definitely.

424
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,827
- Spivot, go on ahead.

425
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,596
- Sure.

426
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,098
- This is the last time
you ever show up here.

427
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,099
Do you understand?

428
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,434
- I needed to
talk to you again.

429
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,970
- How much clearer
do we need to be?

430
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,139
Iris and I do not want you
in our lives.

431
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,141
Leave, please.

432
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,776
Go home, live your life.

433
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,012
- Joe, there's
something else.

434
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,214
I wanted to tell you
when I first saw you, but--

435
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,217
- what is it?

436
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:19,390
- Few months ago,
i started getting weak.

437
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,591
The doctors ran
a bunch of tests,

438
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,094
they couldn't
figure it out.

439
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,796
But finally, they did.

440
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,133
Said I have something
called macgregor's.

441
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:34,739
Supposedly it's pretty common
among ex-addicts.

442
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:39,744
Told me I had till the end
of the year if I'm lucky.

443
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,547
- Is--is that why
you came back?

444
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,017
- I just want my daughter
to know me...

445
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,019
This me.

446
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,729
- I'm really glad
you decided to come.

447
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,399
- I thought s.T.A.R. Labs
had to shut down.

448
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,934
- It's under new management.

449
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:03,901
- Huh.

450
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,504
Whoa, what kind of treadmill
is that?

451
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,738
- Cosmic.

452
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,741
Cool.

453
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,677
So, let's get started.

454
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,712
You got some kind of
"billion dollar man" technology

455
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,180
that gonna fix my knee?

456
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,383
- Actually, Jax, this isn't
about fixing your knee.

457
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,118
- What are you
talking about?

458
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,054
- When the particle accelerator
exploded,

459
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,623
the energy wave
that collided with you

460
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,425
is known as "dark matter."

461
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,794
- And it didn't just hurt
your knee.

462
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,564
- It--it changed the molecular
structure of your body.

463
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,132
- Whoa, hold on, grey.

464
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,001
So you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

465
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,669
I keep hearing about
on the news?

466
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,839
- Yes, I am.
Please, call me professor.

467
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,575
- We think you have
potential capabilities.

468
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,810
- What kind of capabilities?

469
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,346
- The same
as professor Stein:

470
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:52,183
The ability for your body
to process fission and fusion.

471
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,218
- And you can harness
excess energy

472
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,688
and turn it into these massive
nuclear blasts.

473
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,891
And you can fly.
There's also that.

474
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,760
- So you're saying
you can do all this?

475
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,695
- Only during
times of convergence

476
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,897
with a willing partner.

477
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,934
- Convergence?
You and me?

478
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,835
- Yes.

479
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,840
No, this is crazy.

480
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,875
- No, Jax,
this is your chance

481
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,577
to right the wrong
that was done to you.

482
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,545
- Yeah, sorry,
you got the wrong guy.

483
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,980
I don't want nothing
to do with this.

484
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,248
- Wait a second, we are
giving you the chance

485
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,816
to be a superhero,

486
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,385
and you're gonna say no
that quickly?

487
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,786
- Yeah,
not my kind of thing.

488
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,122
- If the man isn't willing
to participate--

489
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,391
- look, I saw your
test scores, Jax.

490
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,293
Your grades were good enough
to get into college,

491
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,496
but you didn't go.
Why?

492
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,830
Is this the type of guy
you are?

493
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,265
One setback and you fold?
Well, then maybe

494
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,134
you're not the guy for us
anyway.

495
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,135
- Well, maybe I'm not.

496
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,003
- Jack--

497
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,206
- maybe this just wasn't
meant to be.

498
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,613
- Cait, come on, I mean,

499
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,448
Jax could be our last chance

500
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,949
at saving
professor Stein.

501
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,119
He said no to being a superhero.
Who does that?

502
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,221
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

503
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,256
Cisco, would you?

504
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,858
- Chance to have superpowers?
Sign me up.

505
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,861
- Look, we're asking Jax
to change his entire life,

506
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,797
to sacrifice
what he does have.

507
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,833
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

508
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,802
It took me a long time

509
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,637
to figure out this whole
hero thing.

510
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,274
- Exactly, which is why we need
someone who wants to do this.

511
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,110
- Where are you going?

512
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:30,014
- To get Hewitt back.
We have to try again.

513
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,788
- Human DNA?

514
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,124
- Yup, definitely not
a man-shark.

515
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,726
Not even a land shark, ma'am.

516
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,260
- Well, thanks for testing it
for me.

517
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,529
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do now?

518
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,832
- I don't know, probably file it
under "never gonna happen."

519
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,999
I have another case anyway.

520
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,868
- Oh, anything I can
help you with?

521
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,038
- No, no, no, no,
detective said definitely n-not.

522
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
- Is everything all good?

523
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:56,974
- Sure, why?

524
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,309
I don't know,

525
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,510
you're just acting
kind of different.

526
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,845
- No!
No.

527
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:05,249
I'm the same old p. Spivot,
you know?

528
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,252
What--actually, I have to go,
but thank you so much

529
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,855
for testing this,
and I'll see you.

530
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,157
- Okay, i--

531
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,368
yo, Joe.

532
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,337
Hey.

533
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,407
You good?
Everything all right?

534
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,742
- Yeah.
No, I'm--

535
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,144
just had hell of a day.

536
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,645
- Yeah?

537
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:39,650
Iris's mother,

538
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,453
she told me she was dying.

539
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,955
Yeah, and I know Francine.

540
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,558
She's telling the truth
about this.

541
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,660
- Okay.

542
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,495
Does Iris know?

543
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,264
- Not yet.

544
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,501
Did--
did you need something?

545
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,938
- Uh, no, no.
I just, um...

546
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,074
Patty said you that
you don't want me on some case

547
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,543
that she's on with you.

548
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:06,944
- No.

549
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,546
I was checking out a lead.

550
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,281
I'll let you know.

551
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,249
- All right, cool.

552
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,819
- What is up with you
and my partner, anyway?

553
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,387
Come on, i--

554
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,990
- bar, you can't
take your eyes off that girl.

555
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,692
- I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

556
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,360
I mean, she's great,
you know.

557
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,863
She's adorable and funny

558
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,132
and we have
a lot in common, but--

559
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,867
- "but, um."

560
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,605
- I don't know.
She's not Iris, I guess.

561
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,408
- Right.

562
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,344
You've known Iris
since you were ten.

563
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:44,148
You've been in love with her
since forever.

564
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,954
I mean, you two are friends now,
but she was your first love.

565
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:54,825
You're never gonna feel
the same about anybody else,

566
00:24:54,827 --> 00:25:00,231
but you can't let that stop you
from exploring something new.

567
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,334
- Yeah.

568
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,404
<i> - And in happier news,</i>
<i> remember flash day,</i>

569
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,106
<i> the downtown celebration</i>
<i> to honor</i>

570
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,308
<i> central city's</i>
<i> one and only superhero?</i>

571
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,843
<i> Well, just weeks--</i>

572
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,413
- Hewitt, you have
those nucleosome results?

573
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,314
- Tomorrow.

574
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,416
- I told you
i needed them tonight.

575
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,319
- And I'm telling you
you'll have them tomorrow.

576
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,954
- You know, I know you think

577
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,956
you're smarter than
everyone here, Hewitt,

578
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,858
but I'm sick of
your not doing your job,

579
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,360
your not showing up.

580
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,263
If I have any more trouble
from you, you're done here.

581
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,631
- What, you're gonna
take the test away

582
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,332
and give it to another
lab rat of yours?

583
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,368
You're gonna report me
to the board?

584
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,069
Or maybe you're thinking
of firing me?

585
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,771
I'd like to see you try!

586
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,407
Now get the hell
out of my lab!

587
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,853
<i> - What's being described</i> as

588
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,254
<i> a "spontaneous</i>
<i> energy malfunction"</i>

589
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,089
<i> erupted last night</i>
<i> at eikmeier technologies.</i>

590
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,159
<i> Wanted for questioning</i>
<i> is scientist Henry Hewitt.</i>

591
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,061
- Hewitt's dormant abilities
must have been triggered

592
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,696
when we attempted
the merger.

593
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,765
- This could be
catastrophic.

594
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,133
If his powers are
anything like mine,

595
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,535
he requires
a grounding mechanism

596
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:14,305
to stabilize his volatility.
Otherwise--

597
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,240
- yeah, he's gonna
pop his top,

598
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,808
and he's got a long history
of violence,

599
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,976
according to
his police record.

600
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,177
- Police record?

601
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,312
- I didn't find
a police record.

602
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,479
- Yeah, of course not,
it was sealed,

603
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:25,249
but guess what,
ya boy hacked in and--

604
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,184
hold on, wait for it.

605
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,620
One count battery,
two counts aggravated assault,

606
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,388
court-ordered
anger management therapy.

607
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,890
- He seemed like
such a nice guy.

608
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,825
He even knew
your Hudson nerd song.

609
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,562
- Whoa, you okay?

610
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,031
- It appears Mr. Hewitt's
stability

611
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,701
isn't the only one
in question.

612
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,135
I think I need to lie down.

613
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,503
- Yeah,
I'll come with you.

614
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,172
- Thank you.

615
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,909
- Professor Stein is
getting worse.

616
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,378
And Hewitt's like this
because of me.

617
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,780
And now Jefferson Jackson
will never come back

618
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,483
because of what I said.

619
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,988
I just didn't believe
that he has what it takes.

620
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,425
- This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

621
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,564
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

622
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:16,934
and we don't see them,
because we choose not to.

623
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:23,007
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

624
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,752
- She's dying?

625
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,920
- A few months left.

626
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,156
- I just don't think
i can see her, dad.

627
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,791
- And that's fine.

628
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:44,561
But you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

629
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,797
If you want to have
a relationship with Francine,

630
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,333
it's okay with me.
You don't have to protect me.

631
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,135
I'm a grown man and
I've dealt with these feelings

632
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,471
a long time ago.

633
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,142
So you--you just
believe her?

634
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,977
- She's done some bad things
in her life,

635
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,080
but she wouldn't lie
about this.

636
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,748
- Dad, she shows up
out of nowhere,

637
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,652
and only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away.

638
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:12,222
- Look, she didn't come
to central city to see me.

639
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,124
She came because of you.

640
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,592
I just wanted you
to know everything

641
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,327
so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

642
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,698
I mean, she is still
your mother.

643
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,169
Either way, whatever you decide,
just know, I got your back.

644
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,140
- I know.

645
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,916
Let me guess,

646
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,551
you don't got car troubles.

647
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,488
- I came to apologize.
I'm sorry for what I said.

648
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,924
- It's fine.
Apology accepted.

649
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,625
- Look, we could really
use your help

650
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,993
to save professor Stein.

651
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,595
That desperate, huh?

652
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,230
- Yes.

653
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,367
My husband, Ronnie,

654
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,104
he used to be
professor Stein's other half.

655
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,539
He actually helped
build the particle accelerator,

656
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:08,579
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it too.

657
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,448
Ironically, that's how
he got the chance

658
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:17,254
to show the world
what he was truly capable of.

659
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,356
And he died
saving this city.

660
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,926
- Wait, he was the guy that flew
into the black hole?

661
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,595
That was him?

662
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,896
- He was a hero.

663
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,998
You can be one too.

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,633
- I never wanted
to be a hero.

665
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,335
What I wanted was
to go to college,

666
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,903
but we couldn't
afford it.

667
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:36,006
Football was my way in,
until that got taken from me.

668
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,442
- I know.
Look, I know

669
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,511
the particle accelerator
took something from you.

670
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,614
But it also gave you
something in return,

671
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,750
something
even more spectacular,

672
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,354
the opportunity to be
part of something bigger,

673
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:53,323
to be part of a team
that's working to protect people

674
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,325
from losing what you lost.

675
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:00,030
I believe you were meant
to be a hero.

676
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,704
- Whoa, hold on.

677
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,606
- I've been looking for you,
Dr. snow.

678
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,342
- Hey, look, man, we're--
ugh!

679
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,450
- You did this to me!

680
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,654
But it's not
what you promised, is it?

681
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,690
Is it?

682
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,196
- Come on!

683
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,268
- Where to?

684
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,270
- S.T.A.R. Labs.

685
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,586
- Caitlin.

686
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:58,021
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

687
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,523
- Oh, good, you're here.

688
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,458
This thing, it ran out,
like, 30 minutes ago.

689
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,294
- His temperature is 142 degrees
and rising fast.

690
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,495
- He's going into
rapid oxidation.

691
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,797
We need to find
a coolant.

692
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,800
- I think it's too late
for that.

693
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,668
- I'll do it.

694
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,370
I'll merge with him.

695
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,538
You said this is a chance
for me to be

696
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,640
a part of something bigger
than myself,

697
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:19,676
to help people.
That's what I want.

698
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:20,978
- You're sure?

699
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,780
Once you merge, there's no
going back on this.

700
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,250
- And you said I could fly,
right?

701
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,118
- Damn right.
- Okay.

702
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,586
So what do I do?

703
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,521
- Okay, well,
here's the abridged version.

704
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,390
- Professor Stein?

705
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,792
- Professor Stein?
- Clarissa, five more minutes.

706
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,861
- No, professor,
you have to get up.

707
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,929
Jax is here.

708
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:39,930
- Yeah.
- What?

709
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,198
- Jax is here.
- What?

710
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,266
- Here, grab onto me.
- Jax?

711
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,267
- Yeah.

712
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,337
- This is it.

713
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,875
- Whew.

714
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,850
- You came back, Jefferson,
thank you.

715
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,585
- Well, like my coach
always said,

716
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,488
"out of yourself
and into the team."

717
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,789
So, how's this work?

718
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,958
- Okay, all you're gonna do
is touch him.

719
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,959
- And then what happens?

720
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,227
- You become firestorm.

721
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,962
- Okay.

722
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,280
- Jax?

723
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,818
Is professor Stein--

724
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,019
- how will I know?

725
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,287
<i> Professor Stein:</i>
<i> Hello, Jefferson.</i>

726
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,522
<i> Now you know.</i>

727
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,791
- Oh, so I get grey
as my copilot.

728
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,827
<i> - Did no one ever inform you</i>
<i> of that fringe benefit?</i>

729
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,530
- So when do we get to take this
for a test spin?

730
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,701
- Uh, how about now?

731
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,436
It looks like
Hewitt's re-charging

732
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,237
at central city high school's
football stadium.

733
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,908
- Wait, that was where
i got hurt.

734
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,327
- Cisco, cut the power
to the field

735
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,695
so he can't draw
anymore energy.

736
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,397
- I'm on it.
Stand by.

737
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,502
Boo-ya ka!

738
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,278
- Hewitt!
You need to stop!

739
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,180
This is not who you are!

740
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:43,687
- Stein?
You chose him over me?

741
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,857
That's who I'm supposed to be!

742
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,726
I deserve
the firestorm matrix!

743
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,595
<i> Professor Stein:</i>
<i> Move, now!</i>

744
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:55,098
<i> Calm down, Jefferson,</i>
<i> focus.</i>

745
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,769
<i> Use your natural athleticism</i>
<i> to gain control.</i>

746
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,740
- Hey, you okay?

747
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,576
- I was a quarterback.
I know how to take a hit.

748
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,612
- Hey, guys,
cutting the power didn't work.

749
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,947
It's like the more we anger him,
the stronger he gets.

750
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,783
- That's it, it's like
one of those, uh,

751
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,052
controlled fusion devices.
Um...

752
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,053
- Tokamak?

753
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,287
- Yes, exactly,

754
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,455
and the more powerful
they become,

755
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,856
the more unstable
they become.

756
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,893
Barry, make him angry,
and he'll blow his fuse.

757
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,196
- You up for a little game
of "catch me if you can?"

758
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,632
- Let's go for it.

759
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,167
Okay.

760
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,776
- Hey, Hewitt, over here!

761
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,780
Paging Dr. Hewitt.

762
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,148
Boo!

763
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,683
- Aah!

764
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,352
- Man, you are not
good at this.

765
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,454
- Aah!

766
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,089
- Do you need a hug, doctor?

767
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,257
- Aah!

768
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,129
- Come on, Hewitt,
give me your best shot!

769
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:00,163
<i> - Now.</i>

770
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,837
- Is that all you got,
Hewitt?

771
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,405
- Man, no wonder you didn't
make the cut

772
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,439
if that's how you fight.

773
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,379
- Aah!

774
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,958
- Not bad for your first go
at this.

775
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,327
- Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

776
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,695
Isn't that right, grey?

777
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,263
<i> Professor Stein:</i>
<i> Despite my initial</i>

778
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,532
<i> reservations, we make</i>
<i> a pretty fantastic team.</i>

779
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,669
- Welcome aboard, firestorm.

780
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,187
- Hi.

781
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,758
Thank you for coming.

782
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,495
You have no idea
what this means to me.

783
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,665
- My dad told me
you were sick.

784
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,068
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

785
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,505
so I did some checking.

786
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,007
Turns out you're
telling the truth.

787
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:21,077
- I would never lie to you
about something so big.

788
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,280
- Really?

789
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,048
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you

790
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,986
another chance
after hearing that news.

791
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:34,858
But you're still lying,
still keeping secrets.

792
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,062
I'm an investigative reporter,
Francine.

793
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:43,400
I uncover things that people
want to keep hidden,

794
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,335
like having a son.

795
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,770
- Iris--

796
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,239
- he was born eight months
after you left central city.

797
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,340
- Let me explain.

798
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,943
- Who's the father,
Francine?

799
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:56,346
Is it my dad?

800
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:59,349
Do I have a brother?

801
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:03,486
Wait, you know, I don't even
want--i don't want to know.

802
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,721
I mean, I wouldn't
be able to tell

803
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,989
if you were telling the truth
or if it was

804
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,058
another one of your lies,
anyway.

805
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,427
- Oh.

806
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,762
- I want you to leave.

807
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,199
You stay away from me, and
you stay away from my father.

808
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,902
If he finds out that he might
have a son that grew up

809
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,405
without even knowing him,
it would crush him.

810
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,174
Just...

811
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,444
Leave us alone.

812
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:30,213
- Iris, I was--

813
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,853
- and how is Mr. Hewitt?

814
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,289
- Seems like that last burst
of energy has burnt him out.

815
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,890
- Our tokamak's gone dark.

816
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,392
- Yeah, we're just gonna
keep him

817
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,827
safe and sound
in the pipeline

818
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,929
till he decides to keep
quiet about all this.

819
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,731
- So you're gonna
meet up with Clarissa?

820
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,366
- We're meeting in Pittsburgh
in three days.

821
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,700
- Why Pittsburgh?

822
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,535
- A colleague of mine
was monumental

823
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,371
in helping train
Ronald and me.

824
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,740
She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

825
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,074
- How's she gonna help us?

826
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,076
- Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

827
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,145
that we never
quite achieved.

828
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:06,349
Hopefully now, we can
fully realize that potential.

829
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,887
Oh, my dearest
Dr. snow.

830
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,896
Ronald may be lost to us,
but he will never be forgotten.

831
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,668
- Speaking of...

832
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,270
This was Ronnie's.

833
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,340
He always used it to
find his way back home.

834
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,875
I want you to have it.

835
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,981
- Thank you.

836
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,849
You know,
this whole thing is strange,

837
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,618
being 50% of someone.

838
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,354
- Yeah, but you're
100% a hero.

839
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,658
- I went ahead and recalibrated
the splicer

840
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,560
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

841
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:51,861
- Thank you.

842
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,699
If I may offer
a bit of parting advice.

843
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:58,935
Cisco, I know
you're scared,

844
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:03,406
but this ability you have
is a gift, not a curse.

845
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,875
It's natural to be apprehensive
about the unknown,

846
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,377
but look at Jefferson.

847
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:13,383
He took a leap, and it changed
his life for the better.

848
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:16,519
The very thing that makes
you different

849
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,521
is what makes you special.

850
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,425
Tell your friends.

851
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,967
And now I believe it's time
to take this show on the road--

852
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,370
or to the sky,
if I am to be literal.

853
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,413
Are you ready, Jefferson?

854
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:01,698
- All right.

855
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,367
- See you later.
- Yeah.

856
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,369
- That was one hell
of a leap of faith

857
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,671
that kid took,
merging with professor Stein.

858
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,173
- Yeah, it was.

859
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:14,444
- There's a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

860
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,213
<i> Barry: Things aren't always</i>
<i> what they seem.</i>

861
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,215
<i> Our fears can</i>
<i> play tricks on us,</i>

862
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,584
<i> making us afraid</i>
<i> to change course,</i>

863
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,386
<i> afraid to move on,</i>

864
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,388
<i> but usually,</i>
<i> hidden behind our fears</i>

865
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,425
<i> are second chances</i>
<i> waiting to be seized...</i>

866
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,898
<i> Second chances at life...</i>

867
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:43,306
- Whoo!
<i> - At glory...</i>

868
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,808
- Whoo!

869
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:50,213
<i> - At family...</i>

870
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,220
<i> At love.</i>

871
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,989
<i> And these opportunities</i>

872
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,325
<i> so when they do,</i>
<i> we have to be brave,</i>

873
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,862
<i> take a chance,</i>

Put him down!

877
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,415
Put your hands--
your fins in the air!

878
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,370
- Who the hell are you?

879
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,505
<i> - Greg, move your head.</i>
