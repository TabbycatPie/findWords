1
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:02,660
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:05,396
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,363
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,399
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,003
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,905
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:21,275
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:24,645
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:27,581
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,850
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:31,051
Why are you here?

12
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,419
Because I want to go faster,

13
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,954
and you're the only one who can teach me.

14
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:36,323
Everything you need is on this drive.

15
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,492
It means a lot, you looking after Barry.

16
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,496
Barry's not the only person
here I wanna keep safe.

17
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,598
We found Barry's double,
so where the hell am I?

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
Reverb.

19
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:49,770
You don't even know how powerful you are.

20
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,572
My name was Hunter Zolomon.

21
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,841
I thought that if I could find
my doppelganger on this Earth,

22
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:57,011
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

23
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,280
I've been vibing Zoom,
and every time it's happened,

24
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:00,681
I've been near that thing.

25
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:04,151
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

26
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:07,388
Sometimes terrible things happen to us

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,123
when we're children.

28
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,458
Things that can define who we become,

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,827
whether we want them to or not.

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,195
Run, Barry, run!

31
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:16,830
Some of us become stronger.

32
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:18,699
The people who took me and helped me heal

33
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,468
and move past everything that happened.

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,305
They're responsible for who
I've become today.

35
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:26,473
But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.

36
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:27,975
Come on, Barry.

37
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:30,177
Not everyone gets that kind of support.

38
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,513
Without it, I don't know where
I would have ended up

39
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:35,983
or what I could've become.

40
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:43,791
- James...
- Who do you think you are?

41
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:46,360
Do you know what I went through over there?

42
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:49,863
Do you know the sacrifices I made for you?

43
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:53,200
I come back after years
of fighting for this country

44
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,502
and this is my welcome home?

45
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,839
You think you can walk out on me?

46
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:00,274
I'm your husband!

47
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,742
You're not my husband.

48
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:03,777
I don't know what you are right now.

49
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,580
I am a hero, Ashley.

50
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:10,451
No. You're a monster.

51
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,853
Run, Hunter, run.

52
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,288
Stay, boy!

53
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:27,101
It's okay.

54
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,470
Please. Please don't do this.

55
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,106
- Shut up!
- No, please.

56
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:41,148
No.

57
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,518
You're gonna want to see this, son.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,854
No, James!

59
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:49,757
Please.

60
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,993
No. No, James.

61
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:54,661
No!

62
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:20,954
- Name?
- Hunter Zolomon.

63
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:24,391
Father killed the mother.
Kid saw the whole thing.

64
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:25,659
Next of kin?

65
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,428
No relatives wanted him.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,431
He is all alone.

67
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:33,600
Follow me.

68
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:36,336
And don't dawdle.

70
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,959
Okay, you guys. I'm here.

71
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,061
- You got my location?
- You're good?

72
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,496
You don't need to, like,
stretch or something?

73
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,231
No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

74
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,934
Let's take this tachyon
enhancer out for a test drive.

75
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,102
All right.

76
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:14,541
Hoo, yeah. I feel that.

77
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:17,010
That is the tachyon device
powering up the Speed Force

78
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:18,579
in your cells like a quick charge battery.

79
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,814
- How do you feel?
- Different.

80
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,716
Let's see how long
it takes you to get back here.

81
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:26,086
On my count.

82
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,722
Three, two, one.

83
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:30,924
Go!

84
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:36,296
Dang, this thing got you cruising.

85
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,866
- How fast does he normally go?
- Not this fast.

86
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,301
Not even close. Are his vitals okay?

87
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,971
Yeah, they're perfect.

88
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:48,008
Cool. It's like having a
pit-stop attached to your chest.

89
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:56,183
Guys, I can go faster.

90
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,718
Do it.

91
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm back.

92
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:15,969
What... how long was I gone?

93
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,337
Let's put it this way,

94
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,673
you just annihilated your old record.

95
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,676
Yeah, you went four times
faster than you have ever been.

96
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,811
Four times?

97
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,314
- That's as...
- Fast as Zoom.

98
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:31,385
Well, faster actually.

99
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,487
Hey, uh, do we think that, um,

100
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:36,290
we can get this thing smaller?
It kind of sucks.

101
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:42,162
If it sucks, then, yeah.

102
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,097
All right, so now all we have
to do is figure out

103
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,232
how to get back to Zoom.

104
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,001
Yes, uh, just a minor issue.

105
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:49,202
We closed all the breaches

106
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:50,637
and have no idea how to reopen them.

107
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,573
We don't... Um, Wells?

108
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:53,907
Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.

109
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,342
Let's keep the breaches closed forever.

110
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:58,045
Forget about the breaches.
Forget about Zoom.

111
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,346
Wait, I'm sorry,

112
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:00,681
I thought that you were on board with this.

113
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:04,318
No. No. I said I would help you get faster.

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,119
I did not say I would help you give the man

115
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,921
who kidnapped my daughter and tortured her

116
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,389
a chance to do it again.

117
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,192
Hey, we are not gonna let that happen.

118
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:13,827
Oh, you're not gonna let that happen.

119
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,462
Gosh, I wish I'd known that the first time.

120
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:19,633
You don't understand
Zoom is different than us.

121
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,535
Zoom is not tied to anything.

122
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,237
Zoom does not care for anyone.

123
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,739
I do.

124
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:27,307
My daughter's out here
on this Earth somewhere.

125
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,643
I have to find her. We all have people

126
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,112
that we care about.
Zoom will use that against us.

127
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:36,083
Believe me.

128
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,684
Maybe we should just leave it be.

129
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,786
No, no. Look, no. Look, we're...

130
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,788
We're not turning our backs
on another Earth.

131
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,857
We're not gonna let Zoom

132
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,525
get away with everything that he's done.

133
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:51,131
Right now, there is no way
to another Earth, Allen.

134
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,300
Let's keep it that way.

135
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:58,705
We're getting back to Earth-2.

136
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:01,141
With or without his help.

137
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,310
Let's go to work.

138
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:07,914
Hey, where are you going?

139
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,650
We could use your help.

140
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,284
Uh, yeah, I would.

141
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:15,322
It's just I have a date with Scott.

142
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,158
- That's the editor?
- Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,027
That's good. No, I'm glad
that you're finding a way

144
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,928
to move on without anything
holding you back.

145
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,163
You deserve that.

146
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,631
Yeah, and well, I would have been able

147
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,166
to do it without your support.

148
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,834
It means a lot to me, so...

149
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,969
- Of course.
- Thanks.

150
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,971
Yes, for sure.

151
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,507
Well hey, I mean, if you don't
get this breach problem

152
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,810
fixed by tonight, pencil me in for tomorrow?

153
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,879
I can do that.

154
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,247
Okay.

155
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,623
Man, I love it when you train

156
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,358
- in Keystone City.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,959
Hey, you sticking around after dinner?

158
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,328
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula 1.

159
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,298
Mm. No, I can't.

160
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,900
I got to get back to the lab.

161
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,468
I'm still trying to find a way
back to Earth-2.

162
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,969
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

163
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,705
No, he refused.

164
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:08,375
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

165
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,810
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

166
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:12,212
about a man I shot at...
And punched in the face,

167
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,814
but I think you should listen to him.

168
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:14,615
Why?

169
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,058
Barry, it worries the hell out of me

170
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,993
the thought that you want
to go back to Earth-2.

171
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,107
I'm faster now.
I'm faster than I've ever been.

172
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,409
I'm faster than Zoom.

173
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,511
I can take him down.

174
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:27,580
All I'm saying is,

175
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,203
you already escaped the hornet's nest once.

176
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,871
Why go back and kick it again?

177
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:35,109
- Hey.
- Wally!

178
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,378
We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

179
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,647
Hope it's cool I brought my laundry over.

180
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,615
Of course. Barry used to do his laundry here

181
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,217
all the time when he was in college.

182
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,551
That's cause those machines in the dorm

183
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:46,286
always eat your quarters, right?

184
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:48,589
Actually, I'm not, uh,
living on campus anymore.

185
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,924
What? Since when?

186
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,193
Since room and board
became way more expensive

187
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,762
than I thought.

188
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,463
Man, I can help you out with that.

189
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:57,998
I mean, I figured your money must be tight

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,135
after paying
all your mother's medical bills.

191
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,837
How much more is it?

192
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,372
No, it's, uh, it's cool.

193
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:06,774
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

194
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,742
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.

195
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:09,910
You can use that, too, if you want.

196
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:12,980
Joe, I'm good. Really.

197
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,915
All right.

198
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,985
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

199
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:23,924
Man, I can't figure that kid out sometimes.

200
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,260
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

201
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,669
Hey. Wow.

202
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,538
Um, any ideas?

203
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,808
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

204
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,276
is to set off a nuclear warhead

205
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,877
next to the city's electrical grid, so...

206
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,780
We're not gonna do that. Um...

207
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:49,016
I think I thought of something though.

208
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:54,521
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

209
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,889
Reverb.

210
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,392
What were Reverb's powers on your Earth?

211
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,494
He could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies

212
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,096
between Earths.

213
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,031
He could see through dimensions.

214
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,100
Find breachers, like Ramon.

215
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,602
I mean, we... we saw Reverb
do more than that though, right?

216
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:11,605
I mean, we saw him shoot vibrational bursts

217
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,007
out of his hands. Really painful ones.

218
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,409
What do you mean?

219
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,579
I... I mean, Reverb had
the ability to somehow

220
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:21,048
manipulate that multi-dimensional energy.

221
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,283
- What's your point, Allen?
- My point is...

222
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:25,686
if his powers are linked to the energy

223
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:28,122
that ties together the multi-verse...

224
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,857
if he can manipulate it...

225
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,725
Then he can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

226
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,262
Exactly. And if Reverb could do it...

227
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:37,498
I could do it too.

228
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,336
Cisco, I think the way back
to Earth-2 is you.

229
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,630
I got nothing.

230
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:57,132
Try again, okay?

231
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,433
Barry, what if he can't do it

232
00:10:58,435 --> 00:10:59,701
because he thinks he can't do it?

233
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:01,803
He can do it though. You can do it.

234
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,952
You... it's gonna work, okay.

235
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,954
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

236
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:21,189
Or maybe I'm just not
the right man for the job.

237
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,692
Right? Let's go.

238
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,994
Cisco.

239
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:29,631
I'm sorry, Barry.

240
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,834
It's gonna work.

241
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,346
Detective, um,

242
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:46,915
I need to ask you...

243
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,617
Oh, you've got company. Um...

244
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:53,188
No, it's, uh, cool.
I should be studying anyway.

245
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,323
Do you know
you kind of look like that guy...

246
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:58,827
- I'm not him.
- Okay.

247
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,029
Later, Joe.

248
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,834
Ah.

249
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,742
Thank you. Look, um,

250
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:16,545
I apologize for dropping by unannounced.

251
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:18,380
I just...

252
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:21,449
have you had any luck locating my daughter?

253
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,152
Not yet, but I circulated her picture

254
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,720
through every department in the region.

255
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:28,156
And I reached out
to some friends in Keystone.

256
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,192
She's smart.

257
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,826
She's gonna know how to stay hidden.

258
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:34,095
She's... We'll find her.

259
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,664
Right.

260
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,767
There's another thing also, Detective.

261
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,636
A favor.

262
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:44,506
I would ask you to talk Barry out

263
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,908
of reopening the breaches to my Earth.

264
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:54,749
Ah, I can't do that.

265
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,818
No.

266
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,688
You can't find a way to change his mind

267
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,790
for both our children's sakes?

268
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,692
Look,

269
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:08,563
I think it's just as dumb as you do.

270
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,599
but I learned a long time ago
that I can't talk Barry

271
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,734
out of anything once he sets his mind to it.

272
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:16,204
Zoom is terrorizing
this other world... your world.

273
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:19,808
He can't let it go.

274
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,945
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

275
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:26,314
Go with Barry.

276
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:27,415
Help him.

277
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,552
Help him?

278
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:32,387
Why would I do that?

279
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:35,757
'Cause he's got a much
better chance of defeating Zoom

280
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,460
if you're involved.

281
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,034
This area has the highest levels

282
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,703
of residual trans-dimensional energy.

283
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,106
Should be able to open
the breach that used to be here.

284
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,444
It's right here. This is it.

285
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:58,446
For real? In this Patch Adams
nightmare right here?

286
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:00,782
- Yeah.
- Love it.

287
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:02,284
All right.

288
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,053
Look, dude, if this doesn't work,

289
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,123
I'll stop asking you to do this, all right?

290
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,992
Okay.

291
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:23,071
What?

292
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:25,540
I can't do it.

293
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,809
That's right.

294
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:29,377
You can't.

295
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,212
What are you doing here? You said...

296
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:33,682
I know what I said.

297
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:35,850
But you're not gonna stop, are you?

298
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:37,485
No.

299
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:39,654
Okay, Barry Allen,
then I'm gonna do what I can

300
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,691
to make sure you don't get killed.

301
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,626
I recalibrated these

302
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,995
to the electromagnetic frequency
of this Earth.

303
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:51,333
It should help you access enough
of the trans-dimensional energy

304
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:54,703
to manipulate it.

305
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,805
Just like Reverb.

306
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,173
All I'm missing is the guyliner

307
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,508
and the transformation's complete.

308
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,277
Take 'em out for a spin.

309
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:36,678
It's working.

310
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,666
Keep coming, Cisco. Keep coming.

311
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,568
It's working.

312
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:16,251
Hey, what... what happened?
You were doing it.

313
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,420
No, no, no, no. I-I can't do this.

314
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,221
- What?
- Don't.

315
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,924
Please, don't ask me to do this.

316
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,226
Please.

317
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,281
Hey. What do we got?

318
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,350
It's your tachyon
absorption enhancer upgrade.

319
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,452
Retrofitted from when
it was used to steal your speed,

320
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:40,559
to now give you more of it.

321
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,899
Almost done.

322
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,501
That's amazing. Thank you.

323
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,369
You're welcome.

324
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,171
Is Cisco back yet? Have we seen him?

325
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,407
- I haven't seen him.
- Check his workshop.

326
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,275
Yeah, all right.

327
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,277
- Hey.
- Hey.

328
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,681
We just came by to see
if you guys needed some help.

329
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,850
- Oh.
- Uh, sure.

330
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,017
- Yeah.
- We can always use

331
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,285
an extra set of hands.

332
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,353
Do you want to help me in the med bay?

333
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,322
Yeah.

334
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,690
- So this...
- Huh?

335
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,525
- This whole Wally thing...
- Uh-huh.

336
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,193
He won't let me help him.

337
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,995
It's probably 'cause you're not

338
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,131
offering the right kind of help.

339
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,000
Wally doesn't want your help
paying for a place to live.

340
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,570
He wants you to offer him a place to live.

341
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,572
- Why didn't he just say that?
- I don't know.

342
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,241
So he does want to live in our house?

343
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,842
Yeah, man.

344
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,545
Look, Wally's never lived
with his father before.

345
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,514
And trust me, that is a big deal.

346
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,848
Huh. And you're good with it?

347
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,550
Mm-hmm. I mean, you know,

348
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,519
it's been you and me
for so long, and I love that,

349
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,254
but having Wally around would be cool too.

350
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:40,124
Just we won't get to have
as much pizza from Keystone.

351
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,826
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.

352
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,362
Have to get used to that.

353
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,798
They really have a special bond, don't they?

354
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,235
Yeah, they sure do.

355
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,472
Are you okay?

356
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:58,543
I don't know what I am.

357
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,511
Last night, I was supposed to go on a date.

358
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,047
My first real date since Eddie died,

359
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,018
but at the last second,
I just... I couldn't do it.

360
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,088
Is it because of Eddie or because of Barry?

361
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
I've noticed the way you've been
looking at him recently.

362
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,293
Is it that obvious?

363
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,562
Only to a woman who's been
through the same thing.

364
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,030
Everything seems to be telling me

365
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,432
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

366
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,568
I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

367
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,137
In the future, we're supposedly married.

368
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,306
And now that I'm finally ready to move on,

369
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,075
I just wonder if that should be with Barry.

370
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,045
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

371
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,315
Do you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

372
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,483
Maybe for you.

373
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,090
Hello?

374
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,796
- Joe?
- Wally, I'm up here.

375
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,001
Hey. What are you doing?

376
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,269
It's not done yet.

377
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,537
I mean, you can decorate it how you like.

378
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,539
- Make it your own.
- Whoa, wait, Joe.

379
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,207
What is this?

380
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,509
Wally, forgive me.

381
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,378
When Barry and Iris went to college,

382
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,647
they couldn't get away fast enough.

383
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,115
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

384
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,751
It didn't even occur to me

385
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,387
that you might feel differently.

386
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,856
It's embarrassing, but it took Barry

387
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,658
to help me see that.

388
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,894
So, if you still haven't
found a place to live,

389
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,162
live here.

390
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,900
I mean, it's yours if you want to.

391
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,669
You're serious?

392
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,671
I'm not gonna do your laundry.

393
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,506
And I'm not washing dishes after you.

394
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,541
And this bed is going to be made
every morning before you leave.

395
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,377
And there will be no beer in that fridge,

396
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,046
but yeah, it's yours.

397
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,583
When can I move in?

398
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,852
Whenever you want.

399
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,720
All right.

400
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,522
Thanks, Dad.

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,734
Hey, man.

402
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,809
Look, um...

403
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,045
I know what it's like...

404
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,615
Zoom, getting in your head,

405
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,384
how scary that can be.

406
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,624
It's not Zoom.

407
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,492
It's me.

408
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,261
What do you mean it's you?

409
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,931
It's like right now I'm Anakin Skywalker.

410
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,466
I got the midi-chlorians.

411
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,268
I've got the goods.

412
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,170
The force is strong with me.

413
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,938
That is something I can feel.

414
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,042
But if I start opening breaches
into other worlds,

415
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:50,014
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then...

416
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,516
what if this is how I become Vader?

417
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,385
Dude, you're never going to become Vader.

418
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,721
You don't know that.
That is what happened to Reverb.

419
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,156
He learned how to use his abilities,

420
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,425
and when he felt that,

421
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,928
when he felt that power,

422
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,963
he succumbed...

423
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,765
to the dark side.

424
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,136
Look, I get it. I... I really do.

425
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,739
Every time I've learned a new ability,

426
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,208
I've been terrified
about what it might mean for me.

427
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,943
What it could do to me, you know?

428
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,480
But you were there with me

429
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,349
when I learned how to run on water,

430
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,284
when I ran up a building,

431
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,988
or traveled through time.

432
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,356
Just like I'm gonna be there

433
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,526
every step of the way with you.

434
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,495
You got something that Reverb never had,

435
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,564
and that's Caitlin and Joe

436
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,600
and Iris and Wells and me.

437
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,802
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

438
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,337
And we're more than just friends.

439
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,039
We're your family.

440
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,441
So what do you say?

441
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,710
Ready to put those things on again,

442
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,812
and go another round?

443
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,750
Let's do it.

444
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,685
All right.

445
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,761
You're all set.

446
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,530
He won't even know it's there.

447
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,366
'Cause whoever said
aesthetics aren't important.

448
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,368
Not me.

449
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,305
Let's go.

450
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,941
Hey, Cait, I know how hard

451
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,510
this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

452
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,878
I know, and I want to be supportive.

453
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,548
I just... I can't face Jay.

454
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,683
Or whatever his real name is.

455
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,351
What does that mean?

456
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,686
Well, you remember when I was looking

457
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,021
for his doppelganger, right?

458
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,023
Yeah. And you couldn't find him.

459
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,258
Because there is no
Jay Garrick on this Earth.

460
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,195
His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.

461
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,798
Hunter Zolomon?

462
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,400
Are you sure?

463
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,603
Yeah, why?

464
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,574
Well, because on my Earth,

465
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:00,578
Hunter Zolomon was
a convicted serial killer.

466
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,181
That's Jay?

467
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,818
No, that is Hunter.

468
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,787
Last public photo of Hunter Zolomon.

469
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,889
Instantly recognizable.
And people from my Earth...

470
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,858
on my Earth, serial killers are an anomaly,

471
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,193
so a lot of media attention to this.

472
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,062
There was a podcast.

473
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,232
When Hunter was 11,
his father killed his mother

474
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,766
right in front of him.

475
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,134
Father sent to prison,

476
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,936
Hunter grew up in the foster care system.

477
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,773
Years later he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder.

478
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,879
23? That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter type level.

479
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,147
After the trial, Hunter was sent

480
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,916
to the Saint Perez Mental Asylum

481
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:43,487
for the Criminally Insane...

482
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,590
given daily electroshock therapy.

483
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,460
Cure him of his urges
and then faded from view.

484
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,363
Until the night your
particle accelerator exploded.

485
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:55,499
That's right. The dark matter
crept into the mental asylum.

486
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,535
I had thought...

487
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,637
piping the explosion underground
would limit exposure.

488
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,071
I was wrong.

489
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,040
All it did was create
an unstoppable monster.

490
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,334
He's not unstoppable.

491
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,071
Jay doesn't know that we know
who he really is.

492
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,807
He thinks that his past is a secret.

493
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,811
- So?
- I think I have an idea

494
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,213
of how we can stop him.

495
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:23,840
Are you sure Jay can't get in here?

496
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:26,409
Pretty sure, but just in case.

497
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:27,810
How do you use this?

498
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:29,579
All right, so you aim it,

499
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:31,981
- and then you pull the trigger.
- Smart ass.

500
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,182
Barry and Cisco are in position.

501
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,484
Let's hope this thing works.

502
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:37,520
- You ready, buddy?
- Yeah.

503
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,956
You've always believed in me.

504
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:43,926
- Thank you.
- You got this.

505
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:07,583
Reverb's doppelganger

506
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:10,486
has increased his powers.

507
00:26:10,488 --> 00:26:13,056
Hatred is a strong motivator.

508
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:17,960
You were unwise to reopen the breach.

509
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:20,897
I'm not gonna let you
terrorize another world anymore.

510
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:25,034
Without your speed,

511
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:28,104
you won't be able to stop me.

512
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:30,273
Let's see.

513
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:40,116
- Zoom's gaining on Barry.
- He can't catch him.

514
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:41,751
He better not.

515
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:56,733
- That was close.
- Too close.

516
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,768
The tachyon device is working.

517
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,138
Here they come.

518
00:27:05,677 --> 00:27:07,844
They're here.

519
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:19,288
Ah, you've gotten faster.

520
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,093
Good. There'll be more for me to take.

521
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,661
You want my speed?

522
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,470
Catch me.

523
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,563
You're gonna want to see this, son.

524
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,877
- Get him, Barry.
- It's working.

525
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,922
No!

526
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:44,440
How did you figure out who I was?

527
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,880
You made a mistake.

528
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:54,717
You told Caitlin who your doppelganger was.

529
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:58,988
I had to do something
to get her to stop trying

530
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,458
to fix me.

531
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,726
She's a smart girl.

532
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:09,365
- And that I was Zoom?
- The Velocity-9.

533
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,833
When you run fast enough,

534
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:14,570
it turns a speedster's lightning blue.

535
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:16,239
We would have helped you.

536
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:20,142
We would have done anything
we could to save your life.

537
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:23,012
Not everything.

538
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:25,548
Caitlin found you a cure.

539
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,450
A temporary one!

540
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:29,318
I'm dying, Barry!

541
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,288
There's only one thing
that can get me what I need.

542
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,689
And you just don't care

543
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,892
how many lives you destroy trying to get it?

544
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:39,462
- How many people you kill?
- No, I don't!

545
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:43,366
That feeling was taken from me
a long time ago.

546
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:50,539
We're not so different, you know.

547
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,576
What happened to us when we were kids.

548
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:56,779
You could have just as easily become me.

549
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:58,514
No.

550
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:01,250
I'd never become like you.

551
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:04,954
I got to say...

552
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:10,693
that was smart. Using, uh,
my parents against me.

553
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:15,331
Oh, family. Such a weakness.

554
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,133
Not for all of us.

555
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:21,170
Well, that's where you're wrong.

556
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:23,606
It's time I get what I came for.

557
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:28,511
You're not getting anything from me.

558
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:32,348
You're not getting anything
from anybody ever again.

559
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,851
On any Earth.

560
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:39,221
You can't lock up the darkness.

561
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:41,324
What did you just say?

562
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:49,699
You can't lock up the darkness.

563
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,146
No!

564
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,640
- He was right there.
- I know.

565
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:13,208
I mean, we had him.

566
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,511
We had him. I can't believe it.

567
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,657
- Wally?
- Up here!

568
00:31:58,022 --> 00:32:02,157
Hey, hey, hey. Where are we?

569
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,994
Where are we?

570
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:08,731
Help! Somebody please help!

571
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:19,675
There's only one person
who can help you now.

572
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:28,183
The Flash.

573
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,519
The Flash? Why would he help me?

574
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,888
He doesn't even know who I am.

575
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,759
Someone he cares about...

576
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:42,765
cares about you.

577
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:50,239
Dad?

578
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:51,607
Dad.

579
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,776
Coffee?

580
00:32:57,148 --> 00:33:00,182
We're gonna get him back.

581
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:03,085
What if we could stop Zoom
through a vibe somehow?

582
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:04,386
We could weaponize the goggles...

583
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:05,821
Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.

584
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,422
Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle

585
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:09,224
to emit a low-level EMF?

586
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,393
We don't have the equipment
to modify the pulse rifles now.

587
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:13,162
Then we do another snatch and grab mission.

588
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,230
By the time we scale those
cliffs, Zoom could already...

589
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:17,499
I need a minute.

590
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:50,465
Barry, I know you...

591
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:54,603
can't give up your speed
to that monster, but...

592
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,238
I also know that I want to get my son back,

593
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,374
and I don't know what to do.

594
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,877
I do.

595
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:07,783
Wally, he's... he's part of the family.

596
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:10,118
He's... he's a part of...

597
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,955
our family.

598
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:14,957
And we do whatever we have to

599
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:18,393
to keep the ones we care about safe.

600
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:20,062
No, you...

601
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:21,830
you can't give up your speed.

602
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:24,166
That's not your decision.

603
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:31,673
This is the only way, Joe.

604
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:42,184
- Barry, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

605
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,319
I mean, we don't even know
if he'll be able to hear me.

606
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:46,488
He'll hear you.

607
00:35:03,974 --> 00:35:06,108
I see him.

608
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:12,214
Wally's alive.

609
00:35:12,216 --> 00:35:16,218
Thank God.

610
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,120
Do you see Jay?

611
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:26,428
I see him.

612
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:30,899
He can sense me.

613
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,734
Jay?

614
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:38,740
Vibe.

615
00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:40,943
He'll do it.

616
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:44,846
Barry will give you his speed.

617
00:35:58,836 --> 00:36:01,537
Babe.

618
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:08,710
- Dad?
- Wally, hold on.

619
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,879
Let him go.

620
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:18,587
We had a deal.

621
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:21,457
My speed for Wally's life.

622
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:27,396
Hand him over, and it's yours.

623
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:28,697
- You okay?
- Yeah.

624
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:30,466
You need to get out of here now.

625
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:31,967
- Okay.
- Go fast.

626
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,503
- Cisco!
- Let's go.

627
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,942
Let's get this over with.

628
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:01,597
This thing is how I stole

629
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,298
The Flash's speed the first time.

630
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,167
Now all he needs to do is run,

631
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:10,105
and his Speed Force
will transfer into this vial.

632
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,841
but only as long as I calibrate it.

633
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:16,078
Get to work.

634
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,946
Wells.

635
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,791
One day...

636
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:33,028
I'm gonna knock that smug
expression clean off your face.

637
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:43,238
So this was your plan all along, huh?

638
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,275
Ever since the skies parted
and showed me another world...

639
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:48,143
with another speedster.

640
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:50,646
Once I saw you, I came here,

641
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:54,049
figured out what I had to do.

642
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:55,851
How are you still alive?

643
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,319
We saw you die.

644
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,787
You did.

645
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:01,623
So what was that? A speed mirage?

646
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,826
Speed mirage?

647
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:09,698
Uh, no. Even I'm not that fast.

648
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,168
I knew that I couldn't be
on two Earths at the same time,

649
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,371
so I went back in time and, uh,

650
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:18,407
met another version of myself.

651
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:21,476
Your time remnant. Like the Reverse-Flash.

652
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:24,513
I also knew that the only way
to make Barry become faster

653
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:29,585
was if you all witnessed
your old pal Jay die.

654
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:32,487
When did you decide to do that?

655
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,857
Oh, once you closed all
the breaches, went to Earth-2.

656
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,859
Believe me, getting my time remnant

657
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:41,863
to agree to me murdering him
took a bit of convincing.

658
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:45,567
But once he saw the...
well, the genius in my plan,

659
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:48,604
he was all for it.

660
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:53,909
Who's the man in the iron mask?

661
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,411
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

662
00:38:58,115 --> 00:38:59,881
Why the charade?

663
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:01,883
Running around dressed like The Flash?

664
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:03,986
To give people hope, Detective.

665
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:05,087
Hope?

666
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,557
So I could rip it away from them.

667
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,492
It's so fun

668
00:39:10,494 --> 00:39:13,729
pretending to be a hero.

669
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:18,266
You are no hero.

670
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:20,502
You're nothing but a monster.

671
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:25,173
You're a monster.

672
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,342
No!

673
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:37,352
- Barry.
- It's all right, Joe.

674
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,995
He's slowing down.

675
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:23,298
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

676
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,401
He's becoming human again.

677
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,816
Barry, are you okay?

678
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:44,753
I'm okay. I'm okay.

679
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,073
Ahh!

680
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:10,579
- Thank you, Flash.
- Jay, stop.

681
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,547
Please.

682
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:18,720
If anything you ever said to me was true,

683
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:21,223
or anything we ever shared was real,

684
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,359
then please just let him go. Please.

685
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:27,562
I know some piece of you did care for me,

686
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:30,432
so if you have any humanity left,

687
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:32,968
then please, let him go.

688
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,450
Caitlin!
