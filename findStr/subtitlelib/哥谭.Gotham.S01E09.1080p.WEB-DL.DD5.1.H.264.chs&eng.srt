I thought I could be strong and brave for you, but I can't.

无论我去哪里  眼前都会出现法尔科内和萨斯
Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz.

33

我紧张不安  渴求安慰  一片混乱
I'm nervous and needy and screwed up,

你一定不想要也不需要这样的我

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,080
硬币那招挺有意思
That was some trick with the coin.

156
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,580
假如那孩子猜错了怎么办
What if the kid guesses wrong?

157
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,000
你会把他送进监狱吗
You gonna send him to jail?

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
青少年几乎都会猜头像
Teenagers, they nearly always call heads.

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,750
我也不知道为什么
I don't know why.

160
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,030
两面都是头像
Two-headed coin.

161
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,860
管用就好  是吧
Whatever works, right?

162
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,630
到底是谁  吉姆
So who is he, Jim?

163
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,830
是谁杀了韦恩夫妇
Who really killed the Waynes?

164
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,400
我们现在只有这张画
This is what we have.

165
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,810
不知道身份
No I.D.

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,160
但这是根据一位目击证人的描述画的吗
But this is from an eyewitness?

167
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,820
而且你已经安置好这人了
That you have in safe custody.

168
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,910
这点证据远远不够诉诸法律
It's not nearly enough to go to the law with.

169
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,350
即使我们掌握了这人的身份
Even if we had I.D. on this guy,

170
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,130
我们真正想找的是雇他杀人的人
it's the people who hired him we really want.

171
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,090
我同意
I agree.

172
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,160
你的目击证人在法庭上是没有用的
Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.

173
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,480
但你有个证人的说法
But the idea of your witness

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,630
是可以非常有价值的
could be immensely valuable.

175
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,940
听过迪克・洛夫克拉夫特吗
Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft?

176
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,700
当然听过  亿万富翁
Sure. Billionaire.

177
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,750
地产  建筑  化工都有涉足
Property, construction, chemicals.

178
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,470
而且腐败透顶
And as corrupt as they come.

179
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,110
法尔科内  马罗尼  甚至韦恩集团
Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises,

180
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,890
洛夫克拉夫特与他们都有交易
Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.

181
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,020
自韦恩夫妇死后  他财产倍增
Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his fortune.

182
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
从阿卡姆项目也分得一大杯羹
Including a huge piece of the Arkham deal.

183
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,180
洛夫克拉夫特与托马斯・韦恩在
Lovecraft had a long feud with Thomas Wayne

184
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,830
生意与政见上长期不合
over deals and politics.

185
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,930
他们对高谭的未来看法完全不一样
They couldn't have had a more different vision for Gotham.

186
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,920
我愿以我的事业打赌
I'm willing to bet my career...

187
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,510
他有参与韦恩夫妇谋杀
on his involvement in the Wayne murders.

188
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,640
这赌还挺大
That's a big bet.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,850
我想利用你的目击证人扳倒洛夫克拉夫特
I want to use your witness to go after Lovecraft.

190
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,010
怎么扳  我的证人无法证明
How? My witness can't connect

191
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,610
洛夫克拉夫特与罪犯有关
Lovecraft to the perp.

192
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,560
洛夫克拉夫特又不知道
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

193
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,960
我会让信息流出
I'll let it leak out

194
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,640
说我们有秘密目击证人
that we have a secret eyewitness

195
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,500
可以让案子豁然开朗
who's going to blow the case wide open

196
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,080
并证明洛夫克拉夫特与韦恩案有关
and connect Lovecraft to the Wayne killings.

197
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,670
洛夫克拉夫特会紧张
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

198
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,810
他身边的人也会紧张
And the people around him will get nervous.

199
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,190
然后就会有人松口  这种事你懂的
And that's when people start talking; you know how that goes.

200
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,540
除非洛夫克拉夫特没有参与韦恩谋杀
Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved in the Wayne murders.

201
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,710
即便如此  而我深表怀疑  我们也赢了
If so, which I doubt, we still win.

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,500
不管是谁参与了韦恩谋杀案
Whoever was involved in the Wayne killings

203
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,270
绝对会惊慌失措  对吧
will get their cage rattled like the dickens, won't they?

204
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,800
我打赌他会有所行动
I bet he makes a move.

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,290
你真喜欢打赌
You like to bet a lot.

206
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,520
对我们没有坏处
Well, what do we got to lose?

207
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,860
我的证人可能会成为目标
My witness becomes a target.

208
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,740
不会
No.

209
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,790
这就是美妙之处
That's the beauty of it.

210
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,390
我们不出书面文件
We never actually file papers.

211
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,060
完全不提名字
We never name names.

212
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,100
就只是一个有力的故事
It's just a powerful story.

213
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,810
你的证人绝对安全
Your witness is perfectly safe.

214
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,180
你们也认同这计划吗
And you're on board with this?

215
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,540
我们早认同了  吉姆
We've been on board, Jim.

216
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,860
哈维是咱们这边的
Harvey's one of us.

217
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,130
我与你的目标一致  吉姆
I want what you want, Jim.

218
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,660
我想让这个城市变得更好
I want to make this city a better place.

219
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,880
不提名字
No names.

220
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,440
不提我  不提我的证人  都不提
Not mine, not my witness, nothing--

221
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
只有一个故事
just a story.

222
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,890
只有一个故事
Just a story.

223
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,970
好吧
All right.

224
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,670
我们试试
Let's try something.

225
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,180
我以为要自己去办这个案子了呢
Hey, I thought I was gonna have to work this case without you.

226
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,130
你去哪了
Where the hell have you been?

227
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,020
等等
You know what?

228
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,290
我改主意了  别说  我不想知道
On second thought, never mind, I don't want to know.

229
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,570
什么案子
What do we got?

230
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,610
一个大案
A biggie.

231
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,970
黑门监狱囚犯在转移去圣马可
Blackgate prisoner escaped while in transit

232
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,760
进行精神病治疗时逃走
to St. Mark's for psychiatric care.

233
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,090
他名叫伊恩・哈格罗夫  确诊精神病
His name's Ian Hargrove, clinically insane,

234
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,330
对炸东西有着强烈渴望
with a compulsion for blowing things up.

235
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,460
他炸掉了哥谭不少老建筑
He exploded a bunch of old buildings around Gotham.

236
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,970
最后一次  炸死了两个守卫
Last one, two janitors were killed.

237
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,240
这里说他被四名枪手劫出
Says here he was busted out by four gunmen?

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,570
是啊  很奇怪  哈格罗夫从没有同伙
Yeah, which is odd-- Hargrove never used accomplices.

239
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,390
好吧  哈格罗夫在黑门监狱里和谁有接触
All right, so who did Hargrove spend time with at Blackgate?

240
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,110
他和外面什么人有联系
Who did he communicate with on the outside?

241
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,380
他服刑期间一直与其他犯人隔离开
His entire stretch, he was isolated from gen pop.

242
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,010
从没打过或接过电话
Never made or received phone calls.

243
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,150
两年来只有一位探访者
Only one visitor in those two years--

244
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,420
他哥哥  约翰
his brother John.

245
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,530
-有地址吗  -有的
- Got an address? - We do.

246
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,570
警员正带他来接受询问
Unis are bringing him in right now for questioning.

247
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,710
幸好你还想着过来
We're lucky you deigned to show up.

248
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,070
抱歉
Yeah, sorry.

249
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,600
没事
No problem.

250
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,690
女人问题
Girl trouble?

251
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,780
嗯
Yeah.

252
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,610
早跟你说过
I told you.

253
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,010
上流社会的女人  会让你晕头转向
Those high society dames-- get you all twisted.

254
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,280
保持警惕
Keep your guard up.

255
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,290
动作快点
Knock lumps out of ya.

256
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
小心脚下
Watch your feet.

257
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,200
好了  刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Right... jab, jab, right.

258
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,620
先出拳
Lead with the...

259
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,730
刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Jab, jab, right. Jab, jab, right.

260
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,160
刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Jab, jab, right.

261
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,560
保持警惕  刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Keep that guard up-- jab, jab, right.

262
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,090
出拳  刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Lead... jab, jab, right.

263
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,620
刺拳  刺拳  右拳
Jab, jab, right.

264
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,310
保持...
Now keep that...

265
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,310
就这样
Yes.

266
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,720
对不起  阿尔弗雷德
Sorry, Alfred.

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,590
-你好  -布鲁斯
- Hello. - Bruce.

268
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,400
这样很疼
That hurt.

269
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,740
不疼才怪呢
Yeah, it's supposed to, isn't it?

270
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,870
承受打击
Taking a punch is

271
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,200
和出拳一样重要  布鲁斯少爷
just as important as throwing one, Master Bruce.

272
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,860
你在做什么
What you doing?

273
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,720
阿尔弗雷德在教我如何打拳
Alfred's teaching me to fight.

274
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,710
为什么
Why?

275
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,950
如果有坏事发生  我就会有所准备
So I'll be prepared if something bad happens.

276
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,080
是啊  因为你住的社区治安很差
Yeah, 'cause you live in a pretty rough neighborhood.

277
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
不是这里  是在哥谭
Not here, in Gotham.

278
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,240
在哥谭  没人戴手套打架
In Gotham, people don't fight with gloves on.

279
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,540
你的房间怎么样
How's your room?

280
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,530
还不错吧
Everything good?

281
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,010
还行
It'll do.

282
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,080
但是我饿了
I'm hungry, though.

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,470
早餐是上午8点  小姐
Right. Well, breakfast was served at 8:00, Miss,

284
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,180
你睡过头了
which you slept through.

285
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,740
午餐是中午12点
Lunch shall be served at 12:00.

286
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,790
厨房里有很多吃的
There's plenty to eat in the kitchen.

287
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,910
阿尔弗雷德会很乐意为你做一些
And Alfred will be happy to fix you something.

288
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,780
不  他不会
No, he won't be, will he?

289
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,430
因为这里不是酒店
Because it's not a bloody hotel.

290
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,220
算了  老头子
Relax, old man.

291
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,850
我自己会搞定的
I'll figure it out.

292
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,090
好  你可以顺便注意一下礼貌
Yeah, you can mind your manners as well,

293
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,920
你个厚脸皮的小丫头
you cheeky little minx.

294
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,380
对她好点  阿尔弗雷德  她是我们的客人
Be nice to her, Alfred, she's our guest.

295
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,410
万分抱歉  布鲁斯少爷
Well, I'm terribly sorry, Master Bruce.

296
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,390
没想到你喜欢她
Didn't realize you fancied her.

297
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,390
什么意思  我没喜欢她
What do you mean? N-No.

298
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,320
不必感到害羞
Well, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

299
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,770
这很自然嘛
It's only natural, isn't it?

300
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,960
但是你防着她点
But you watch her.

301
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,040
她很傲慢
She's a lairy one.

302
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,310
好了  左拳  左拳  右拳
Right... left, left, right.

303
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,010
保持警惕  孩子
Keep your guard up, son.

304
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,830
你很了解女孩子吧  阿尔弗雷德
You know about girls, do you, Alfred?

305
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,670
看得比你清楚
Fair sight more than you.

306
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,860
而她  伙计
And she, mate,

307
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,930
是个麻烦精  小心
is trouble-- watch.

308
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,210
莉莎  莉莎
Liza, Liza...

309
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,090
你打的什么主意
what are you up to?

310
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,070
紫丁香
Lilacs.

311
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,800
我告诉你  我对他逃走的事一无所知
I'm telling you, I don't know anything about his escape.

312
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,120
我还没和他谈过
I haven't talked to him.

313
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,080
你的亲弟弟逃狱了  却没给你打电话
Your own baby brother busts out of prison, and doesn't call you,

314
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,520
这两年来他只和你一个人说过话
the only person he's talked to in two years?

315
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,660
发生了什么事
What happened?

316
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,780
你们俩闹翻了吗
You two have a falling out?

317
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,630
没  伊恩和我关系非常好
No, Ian and I are close.

318
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,710
一直都是
Always have been.

319
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,760
即使在他炸死了那些守卫之后吗
Even after he bombed those janitors?

320
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,030
那是场意外
That was an accident.

321
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,430
他们都这么说
That's what they all say.

322
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,910
这是事实
It's the truth.

323
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,370
我弟弟不是杀手
My brother's not a killer.

324
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,660
从来都不是
He never was.

325
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,260
他炸了哥谭12栋大楼
He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham.

326
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,530
没错  军工厂和他们的办公室
Yes, munitions factories and their offices.

327
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,350
制造枪支  弹药和导弹的地方
Places that made guns and bullets and missiles.

328
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,300
我知道他做错了
I know he was wrong,

329
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,700
但伊恩以为他是在做好事
but Ian thought that what he was doing was good.

330
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,330
最后一次爆炸案前他从未伤过人
He didn't hurt a soul until the last bombing.

331
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,830
而且他对伤到人万分难过
And he felt terrible about it.

332
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,770
他基本上是自己向警察投案的  还认了罪
He practically handed himself in to the cops and pleaded guilty.

333
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,520
伊恩从小就有精神问题
Ian has had mental problems ever since he was a kid.

334
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,130
我父母没钱给他治疗
My parents didn't have the money to get him the help he needed.

335
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,830
更别指望在黑门监狱得到治疗了
And he sure as hell wasn't getting it at Blackgate.

336
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,800
{\an8}GGC冶金

337
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,330
听着
Look...

338
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,570
我弟弟不是坏人
my brother's not a bad man.

339
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,640
那他是什么样的人
Then what is he?

340
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,670
他是个病人
He's sick.

341
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,390
这是有区别的
There's a difference.

342
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,110
好吧
Okay...

343
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
那有谁会想劫囚
so who would want to bust him out?

344
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,290
我不知道
I don't know.

345
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,720
但我弟弟需要帮助
But my brother needs help.

346
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,540
你们一定要找到他
You have to find him.

347
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,740
做好了
It's done.

348
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,940
哥谭军工厂

349
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,430
有你的快递
I have a delivery for you.

350
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
给我吧
I'll take that.

351
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,000
谁送来的啊
Who sent this, anyway?

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,930
管他呢
Who cares?

353
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,930
等等
Wait a second.

354
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,570
你们听到了吗
You hear that?

355
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,400
像是走表的声音
Sounds like ticking.

356
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,700
爆炸震动哥谭

357
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,820
早上好
Good morning.

358
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,900
-睡得好吗  -你家房子一个劲儿响
- How'd you sleep? - Your house makes noise.

359
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,250
是老房子了
It's old.

360
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,750
你来的时候都没带什么东西
You didn't come here with much.

361
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,710
愿意的话  阿尔弗雷德可以为你买点衣服
If you want, Alfred can buy you some clothes.

362
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,160
不用
Pass.

363
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,900
戈登警探告诉我你在街头流浪
Detective Gordon told me you live on the streets.

364
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,470
没错
Yeah.

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,790
怎么了
So?

366
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,320
那是什么样儿
What's it like?

367
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,800
没这里好
Not as nice as here.

368
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,280
你一个人住吗
Do you live alone?

369
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,230
你打算盘问我一早上吗
Are you going to ask me questions all morning?

370
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,260
你不是应该去学校什么的吗
Aren't you supposed to be in school or something?

371
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,440
我有自己的课程计划
I'm developing my own curriculum.

372
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,680
这样我就可以按自己的速度
It lets me move at my own speed

373
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,200
专攻我感兴趣的学术领域
and focus on academic areas that interest me.

374
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,210
为什么
Why?

375
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,740
你已经是亿万富翁了  还有什么好学的
You're a billionaire, what's to learn?

376
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,130
这观点好奇怪
That's a strange attitude.

377
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,490
你爸妈呢
So, where are your parents?

378
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,810
他们还活着吗
They alive?

379
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,020
是啊
Sure.

380
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,820
他们还在
They're around.

381
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,940
在哪里
Where?

382
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,400
跟你有什么关系
What's that to you?

383
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,330
没什么  我只是想...
Nothing, I just thought...

384
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,140
是吗  那你想错了
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

385
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,890
我不是孤儿
I'm not an orphan.

386
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,190
我有的是家人
I got family all over.

387
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,440
光是逃狱就已经够糟了
This was bad enough when it was just a prison escape.

388
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,680
现在又死了五个保安
Now we've got five dead security guards,

389
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,480
媒体已经称哈格罗夫为都市恐怖分子了
and the press is calling Hargrove an urban terrorist.

390
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,260
爆炸现场找到什么线索了吗
Did you get anything from the bombing site?

391
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,440
鉴证科还在调查
Forensics is still looking into it,

392
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,720
但整个办公室都毁了
but the entire office was destroyed.

393
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,310
-包括所有监控录像  -嗯
- Including all security footage. - Yeah.

394
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,230
不过我们能确定哈格罗夫和他的团伙偷走了
We do know that Hargrove and his guys made off

395
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,240
一种叫做环四亚甲基四硝胺的化合物
with a compound called HMX.

396
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,590
军方等级炸药
It's military grade.

397
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,560
威力是C4炸药的十倍
Ten times more powerful than C-4.

398
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,860
很恐怖的玩意儿
Nasty stuff.

399
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,450
用炸药来偷炸药
Using explosives to steal explosives.

400
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,030
这是要干什么
What's that about?

401
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,000
升级行动
Trading up?

402
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,760
他肯定还有其他目标
He must have another target in mind.

403
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,040
不易爆破的地方
Some place difficult to crack.

404
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,450
你们知道我要说什么吧
You know what I'm gonna say.

405
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,090
去吧  行动
So, go, do it.

406
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,980
我是戈登
This is Gordon.

407
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,300
你好  警探
Yes, detective.

408
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,620
是我  阿尔弗雷德
It's Alfred.

409
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,280
阿尔弗雷德  一切还好吗
Alfred, is everything all right?

410
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,250
塞琳娜还好吧
Is Selina okay?

411
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,640
她很安全
Well, she's safe.

412
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,990
但是呢
But?

413
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,760
但是警探  恐怕这样下去不行
But I'm afraid, detective, this isn't gonna work out.

414
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,260
她...挺麻烦的
She's a... a tough nut, this one.

415
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,390
要找到杀死韦恩夫妇的凶手
Well, look, we need her help if we have any chance

416
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,870
就需要她帮忙
of catching the Waynes' killer.

417
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,460
暂时看住她
Just hold onto her for now,

418
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,620
我会尽快抽空去看她的
and I'll be out to check on her as soon as I can.

419
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,120
那我们就耐心等你来了
We shall patiently await your arrival,

420
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,250
警探
detective.

421
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,220
一切都好吧
Everything good?

422
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,380
好得不得了
Right as rain.

423
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,000
你确定真要这样做
You sure you want to go through with this?

424
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,340
布奇  可不要现在退缩
Butch, don't you go getting scared on me now.

425
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,490
不会  老大
Never, boss.

426
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,200
奥斯瓦尔德  你回来了
Oswald, you're back.

427
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,740
我开始觉得你喜欢受伤
I'm starting to think you enjoy being hurt.

428
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,360
我只是路过
I was passing by.

429
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,850
就进来打个招呼
Thought I'd say hello.

430
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,260
招呼打完了
Well, you said it.

431
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,040
你怎么还不走
Now why are you here?

432
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,990
说实话  我只是想尽量对你友好些
Honestly, I'm just trying to be friendly.

433
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,990
紫丁香
Lilacs.

434
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,030
你真香
You smell good.

435
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,440
你真臭
You don't.

436
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,160
还是这么犀利
Snappy as ever.

437
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,680
再见了
Well, good-bye then.

438
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,210
抱歉你还这么生我气
Sorry you're still grumpy with me.

439
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,880
但是嘛
But, you know,

440
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,220
寻求友谊总错不了
reaching out in friendship is never wrong.

441
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,400
这家伙太}人了
Man, that dude's creepy.

442
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,390
别管他
Forget him.

443
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,650
他不值一提
He's nothing.

444
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,320
这些是哈格罗夫进黑门监狱之前的
Hargrove's contacts and phone records

445
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,110
所有联系人和通话记录
from before he went to Blackgate.

446
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,280
-你还好吧  -很好
- You all right? - Yeah, yeah.

447
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,220
芭芭拉离开了
Barbara left.

448
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,230
-彻底离开  -是的
- Left left? - Yeah.

449
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,980
去哪了
Where'd she go?

450
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,080
不知道
I don't know.

451
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,810
策略而已
It's a ploy.

452
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,810
是以退为进地逼婚
She wants you to set a date.

453
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,170
典型手法
It's a standard move.

454
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,200
她会回来的
She'll be back.

455
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,430
你们玩电子游戏吗
Do you play video games?

456
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,010
爱德  再不许这么干了
Ed, don't ever do that again.

457
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,500
抱歉  警探
My apologies, detective.

458
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,100
你们俩谁玩电子游戏吗
Do either of you play video games?

459
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,380
我玩
I do, I...

460
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,310
我超喜欢电子游戏
I love video games.

461
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,930
我觉得每个游戏都是新的挑战  一个谜
I find that each one presents a new challenge, a puzzle.

462
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,710
很像警探办案
It's a lot like detective work in that way.

463
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,390
爱德
Ed.

464
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,550
抱歉

我分析了保安室找到的弹片

467
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,380

468
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,010
因为爆炸有些受损
It was damaged in the bombing,

469
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,930

要干票大的  是个保险库
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

491
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,570
所以他们需要我来做炸药
That's why they needed me to build explosives.

492
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,170
-什么情况  -找掩护
- What's this? - Take cover.

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,590
她看起来不错
She looks nice.

509
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,550
是啊
She was.

510
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,640
她被杀那晚
You saw her...

511
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,150
你看见她了吗
the night she was killed?

512
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,000
你看见我了吗
And you saw me?

513
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,600

00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,910
她实际上是政府的间谍

她在执行秘密任务

等她结束工作后  就会回来找我

529
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,690
那不错
That's good.

530
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,340
是啊
Yeah.

531
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,200
你亲过女孩子吗

532
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,010
没有
No.

533
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,790
你想亲吗
Do you want to?

534
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,680
你问这个干什么
Why-why do you ask?

535
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,130
只是好奇

回见
I'll see you later.

541
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,540
你知道我们这周接到了多少
Do you have any idea how many angry phone calls

542
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,030
愤怒的电话吗
we've been getting this week?

543
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,940
外头有个恐怖分子
Got a terrorist out there.

544
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,840
是我们的错吗
And that's our fault?

545
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,600
吉姆
Jim!

546
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,020
不  没事
No, no, please.

547
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,940
告诉我  警探
You tell me, Detective--

548
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,430
这怎么成了我的错呢
how is this my fault?

549
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,860
首先
Well, for starters,

550
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,880
你把精神病人关在黑门
you have the mentally ill housed at Blackgate,

551
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,750
那座监狱没有任何相关设施
a prison with no facilities for them.

552
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,070
你只好送他们出去就医
So, you send them out for treatment,

553
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,040
哈格罗夫正是在外出就医的路上
which was exactly where Hargrove was headed

554
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,530
被劫囚了
when he was broken out.

555
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,530
给我找到他
I want him found.

556
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,550
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

557
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,290

好的  先生
Yes, sir.

559
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,020
你什么毛病
What is wrong with you?

560
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,190
对了  哈格罗夫的哥哥约翰
By the way, Hargrove's brother John,

561
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,190
我对他和他的家人进行了保护性监禁
I went ahead and put him and his family in protective custody.

562
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,230
挺好
That'll help.

563
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,780
是啊  唯一的问题是
Yeah, only problem is--

564
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,260
哈格罗夫还不知道
Hargrove doesn't know that.

565
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,660
好了  丹特
All right, Dent.

566
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,470
你把我找来了  你想怎样
You dragged me down here, now what?

567
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,550
我找到了最后一块拼图
I got the last piece of the puzzle in place.

568
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,580
我要起诉你
I'm bringing charges against you.

569
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,910
又老调重弹啊
Oh, that old song again?

570
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,250
你永远别想证明欺诈
You will never prove fraud.

571
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,190
这你清楚  我也清楚
You know that, and I know that.

572
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,370
欺诈指控只是诸多罪名中的一项
Fraud charges are only part of it.

573
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,570
是吗  还有什么  乱穿马路吗
Oh, really? What, then? Jaywalking?

574
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,280
合谋犯下一级谋杀罪
Conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

575
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,240
谋杀
Murder?

576
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,620
告诉我  丹特
So, tell me, Dent--

577
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,030
我杀谁了
who did I kill?

578
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,260
托马斯和玛莎・韦恩夫妇
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

579
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,840
我的天
Oh, God...

580
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,670
我有个目击证人能指证你与这起案子有关
I have an eyewitness who can tie you to the crime,

581
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,440
并指认其他的涉案人员
you and all the others involved.

582
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,990
一派胡言
That's absurd.

583
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,210
帮你自己个忙吧  迪克
Help yourself out here, Dick.

584
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,910
慎重考虑你的选择
Think about your options.

585
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,790
情势对你很不利啊
This is gonna get ugly.

586
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,570
你个傻子
You're a fool.

587
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,930
你根本不知道你在跟谁
And you have no idea who

588
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,010
跟什么势力打交道
or what you're even dealing with.

589
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,160
你再威胁我试试
Don't you ever threaten me!

590
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,220
我生撕了你
I will rip you open.

591
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,710
见到你很愉快  迪克
It was good to see you, Dick.

592
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,350
吉姆
Jim!

593
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,720
有发现
Got it.

594
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,680
是吗
Yeah?

595
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,380
这是格莱戈・卡西亚诺夫
Meet Gregor Kasyanov.

596
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,700
罪行累累
Long rap sheet.

597
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,510
尼古拉活着的时候是他手下
Worked for Nikolai before he died.

598
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,070
他现在给谁干活儿
Who does he work for now?

599
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,950
我不知道
Beats me.

600
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,840
那好
All right.

601
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,200
哈格罗夫说是一个大单  一个保险库
Hargrove said it's a big job, right? A vault.

602
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,480
肯定有人背后出钱
Somebody's got to be bankrolling it.

603
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,190
是啊  某个和法尔科内有嫌隙的有钱大佬
Yeah, someone with cash and pull and beef with Falcone.

604
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,950
问题是在哥谭
Problem is-- in Gotham,

605
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,220
随便哪个有钱大佬都和法尔科内有过节
anyone with cash and pull has beef with Falcone.

606
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,760
那能是谁呢
So, who is it?

607
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,170
你让我好等啊
You kept me waiting.

608
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,640
碰上了点麻烦
Ran into a little trouble.

609
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,610
没什么可担心的
Nothing to worry about.

610
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,230
那就好  我对这单活儿寄予厚望
Good, I've got a lot riding on this job.

611
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,560
你说过了
You've said.

612
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,130
你老板尼古拉死了
Your boss Nikolai is dead

613
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,750
都因为法尔科内
because of Falcone.

614
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,390
你要是想报复他
You want to get back at him,

615
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,230
就得戳他痛处  拿他的钱开刀
you hit him where it hurts-- his money.

616
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,880
对不对  布奇
Ain't that right, Butch?

617
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,220
对头
Yep.

618
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,780
万恶之源
The root of all evil.

619
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,300
我们会抢他的钱
We'll take his money.

620
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,710
这点没问题
No problem.

621
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,500
只要你提供的地点准确
As long as it's there, like you said.

622
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,450
绝对准确
Oh, it's there.

623
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,780

这是你要的卡车

627

你是我见过的最怪的孩子
You're the weirdest kid I've ever met.

628
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,220
你为什么那么做
Why are you doing that?

629
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,400
训练
Training.

630
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,990
就像拳击
Like the boxing.

631
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,370
那么  如果有人用跳水板抢劫你
So, if anyone mugs you with a diving board,

632
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,690
你就会有所准备了  是吗
you'll be ready, huh?

633
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,840
对
Yes.

634
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,750

635

我在培养自我控制和意志力
I'm developing self-discipline and willpower.

636
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,660
为什么
Why?

637
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,930
好变得强壮
So I can be strong.

638
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,000
我懂  但这是行不通的
I get you, but it won't work.

639
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,720
在外面  在哥谭是没用的
Not on the streets, not in Gotham.

640
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,080
为什么
Why's that?

641
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,710
在外面混
Out there on the streets,

642
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,280
光强壮是不够的
it's not enough to be strong.

643
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,020
你得坏
You gotta be mean.

644
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,120
你得无情
Gotta be ruthless.

645
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,150
你知道那是什么意思吗
Do you know what ruthless means?

646
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,390
当然
Of course I do.

647
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
是吗
Yeah?

648
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,210
你不是那样的
Well, you ain't.

649
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,100
你是个好孩子
You're a nice kid.

650
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,850
你在外面混5分钟  就会被人宰割
Five minutes on the street, you'll be mincemeat.

651
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,810
会闭气对你毫无帮助
And holding your breath won't do a damn thing.

652
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,880

应该是42个
The number you were looking for is 42.

668
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,870
一双眼睛是两只眼睛哦
You forgot to double it for two eyes.

669
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,820

十分不稳定
It's highly volatile,

678
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,150
而且很难制造

679
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,960
只有一个用处

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,540
不不  那都是钢板

现在没人拿铁做东西了
No one makes anything out of iron anymore.

684
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,580
至少有一世纪了
Not for... A hundred years, at least.

685
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,660
哥谭军械库

那里有铁保险库
Yeah, they have those iron vaults

688
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,520
里面有火药
they used to keep the gunpowder in.

689
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,380
几年前
A few years ago,

690
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,930
那里被一个私人投资集团买下了
a private investment group bought it.

691
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,920
肯定是法尔科内叫人做的
Ten to one, Falcone's behind it.

692
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,000
你们要...
Do you...?

00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:47,900
哥谭军械库地下室

694
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,840

向我保证不会再有人受伤了

700
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,890
你们被包围了
You're surrounded!

701
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,190
无路可退了
There's no way out!

702
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,430
放下武器
Drop your weapons!

703
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,080
别过来  退后
Don't do it! Get back!

704
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,890
哈格罗夫
Hargrove!

705
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,470
伊恩・哈格罗夫
Ian Hargrove!

706
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,210
你哥哥和他家人都安全
Your brother and his family are safe.

707
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,270
我们把他们保护监禁起来了
We have them in protective custody.

708
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,080
他如果跑  就打死他
If he runs, shoot him!

709
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,960
别开枪
Don't shoot!

710
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,410
你开枪打他  他们会打我们
You shoot him, they shoot us!

711
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,290
放下武器
Drop your weapons!

712
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,620
未知来电

713
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,340
快离开车
Get away from the truck!

714
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,620
趴下
Everybody down!

715
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,310
你干什么
Why'd you do that?

716
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,510
你肯定不会打我
Bet you can't hit me.

717
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,330
我能
I could.

718
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,790
但我为什么要打你
But why would I want to?

719
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,760
试试吧
Try.

720
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,830
为什么
What for?

721
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,300
打我
Hit me, and...

722
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
我就让你亲我
I'll let you kiss me.

723
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,640
没打着
You didn't get me.

724
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,880
糟糕
Ah, no!

725
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,270
早啊  阿尔弗雷德
Morning, Alfred.

726
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,310
警探
Ah, Detective.

727
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,290
我一直想过去
I've been trying to get out there.

728
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,510
真抱歉  一切都好吗
I'm sorry, uh... Is everything okay?

729
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,680
她乖吗
Is she behaving herself?

730
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,650
不怎么乖
Well, uh, not really, no.

731
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,610
不过没关系
That's all right.

732
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,440
是吗
It is?

733
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,060
嗯  她...
Yes, well, she's...

734
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,060
可以说是一股清新之风
a breath of fresh air, I might say.

735
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,640
那太好了
Glad to hear it.

736
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,490
我会尽快过去的
I'll be out there as-as soon as I can.

737
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,560
好的  先生
Very good, sir.

738
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,200
抱歉不请自来
Forgive me for the intrusion,

739
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,090
但我必须马上跟你谈话
but it's urgent that I speak with you.

740
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,240
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

741
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,300
嗯
Yeah.

742
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,170
法尔科内如果知道你来这里会杀了你的
And Falcone would kill you if he knew you were here.

743
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,830
或许吧
Perhaps.

744
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,580
但如果我告诉他
What would he do if I told him

745
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,070
你在替菲什・穆尼监视他  他会怎么做
that you were spying on him for Fish Mooney?

746
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,270
你没有证据
You don't have any proof.

747
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,550
没有
No.

748
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,200
但怀疑  是件有趣的事
But suspicion, it's a funny thing.

749
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,210
法尔科内起初或许不会信我
Falcone might not choose to believe me at first,

750
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,720
但他每次看见你
but every time he looked at you,

751
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,030
都会自问  她是间谍吗
he'd ask himself-- is she?

752
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,080
可能吗
Could she?

753
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,580
会吗
Would she?

754
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,310
你错了
You're wrong.

755
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,070
他在乎我
He cares about me.

756
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,900
那我们就打给他  看看谁对谁错吧
Let's call him and find out, shall we?

757
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,040
住手
Stop!

758
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,780
我不会泄露你的秘密
Your secret is safe with me.

759
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,750
我不说出去
I won't tell,

760
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,540
因为你
because you...

761
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,870
要继续为菲什工作
are gonna keep working for Fish.

762
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,920
这事你谁都不能说
And you are not going to tell anyone.

763
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,630
否则你会没命
Or you'll die.

764
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,660

有
Uh, yeah.

768
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,760
我见过洛夫克拉夫特了
I met with Lovecraft.

769
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,740
怎么样
How'd it go?

770
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,000
他怕了
He was scared.

771
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,320
他肯定与这事有关
He's involved, all right.

772
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,190
怕不是证据
Scared isn't proof.

773
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,570
你没见到他的样子
You didn't see him.

774
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,690
我在其他地方也散播了这个说法
Told the same story in a few other spots.

775
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,990
现在重要的人物都该听说了
All the big players will know by now,

776
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,100
肯定会有人松口的
someone will start talking.

777
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,290
到时候
If and when they do,

778
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,410
我们要先商量再行动
neither of us makes a move without talking first.

779
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,530
我们要一起进退
We move together on this.

780
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,530
当然
Absolutely.

781
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,450
哈格罗夫案干得好
Hey, nice work on the Hargrove case.

782
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,480

You saved the poor guy's life.

783
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,410
你真是个圣人
You're a regular saint.

784
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,290
谢了  希望我们很快能再聊

792

他要把黑门监狱的所有精神病罪犯

793

转移去阿卡姆
sending them to Arkham,

794
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,680
好让他们得到妥善治疗
so they can get appropriate treatment.

795
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,550
简直是疯了
That's nuts.

妥善...那栋建筑都两百岁了

Oh, and get this-- Hargrove said that the bomb that blew up the money

799
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,360
不是他安放的

800

那是谁
Whose was it?

801

他不知道
He didn't know.

802

我只能当机立断
I had to make the call.

不能留下麻烦
I can't stand loose strings.

妥善治疗的直接结果
