8
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,040
Previously on "The Flash"...

9
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,180
We just beat Zoom.

10
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,890
Why does it feel like I just lost?

11
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,990
I feel more broken than I've ever felt.

12
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,300
Wherever you need to go,

13
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,450
whatever you need to do, do it.

14
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,620
I'll be here.

15
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,340
You're safe.

16
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,720
So what should we call this brave new world?

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,970
I was thinking Flashpoint.

18
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,670
My name is Edward Clariss.

19
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,390
Rivals should know each other's names.

20
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,260
It's like I'll be thinking of a moment

21
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,030
from my past and it vanishes.

22
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,820
This isn't your home, Barry.

23
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,170
It's a mirage.

24
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,460
Things are back to how they should be.

25
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,110
Well, for me, anyway. For you?

26
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,370
I guess you'll just have to wait and find out.

27
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,620
Where's Iris?

28
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,280
You know Iris isn't here.

29
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
They don't talk, Barry.

30
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,300
Oh, God. What did I do?

31
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,690
I made a big mistake.

32
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,540
I just couldn't take it anymore, you know?

33
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,660
What happened with Zoom, my dad dying,

34
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,630
my mother's death, me becoming The Flash.

35
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,750
All of it. I wanted a new life.

36
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,970
I wanted to start over. And that's what I did.

37
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,250
But somehow I-I made things worse.

38
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,880
- No. - So I reset everything.

39
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,420
I put everything back to the way that it was before.

40
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,720
Except some things weren't the same anymore.

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,130
Not even a little bit.

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
Slow down.

43
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,500
Take a breath.

44
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,200
You were talking way too fast.

45
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,760
- Yeah. - What happened?

46
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,520
I really screwed up, Felicity.

47
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,620
And this time I don't know if I can fix it.

50
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,740
Okay, let me get this straight.

51
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,830
- You ran back in time? - Yeah.

52
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,670
Stopped Reverse-Flash from killing your mom

53
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,660
and then lived in an alternate reality

54
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,950
where both your parents were alive?

55
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah.

56
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,410
And then you restored the timeline,

57
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,990
came back to the moment you left,

58
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,560
- and noticed that things were different? - Exactly.

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,090
Does that just happen when you travel through time?

60
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,550
Do things just change like that?

61
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,000
No, I mean, not like this.

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Not on--I don't know. I don't know Felicity.

63
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,120
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

64
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,900
Okay, why don't you just run me through--

65
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,680
walk me through what happened?

66
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,560
And we'll, we'll try and figure it out.

67
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,060
So what changed?

68
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,000
I knew once I got back last night

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,870
some things had changed,

70
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,630
but before I could figure out exactly how much,

71
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,160
I had to deal with someone this morning.

72
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,720
You are not gonna get too far

73
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,530
on that thing anymore, are you?

74
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,580
I will be taking these back to the jewelry store

75
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,630
you stole them from.

76
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,670
But, you can keep these if you'd like.

77
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,140
Good luck with that.

78
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,100
After he was taken care of, I went to S.T.A.R. Labs,

79
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
and that's when I found out

80
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,730
a lot more had changed than I realized.

81
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,880
What kind of idiot still thinks

82
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,300
I can't outrun bullets?

83
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,710
That guy should be the criminal poster boy

84
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,450
for what not to do against The Flash.

85
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,700
So what are we gonna call him?

86
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,180
- You mean like a nickname? - Yeah.

87
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,470
Cisco does it for all of them, he's like the master of it.

88
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,640
Can't just call him Suspect on a Motorcycle,

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,980
Right? What do you think?

90
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,500
- I don't know. - I'll take this one.

91
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,650
The Crook. Lame?

92
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,990
- A Five-Finger-- - How about Thief?

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,530
He robs stuff. Let's just call him Thief.

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,270
Gotta get to the gym. Excuse me.

95
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,480
The gym? Is he--is he, like, working out now or--

96
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,970
You know, Barry, sometimes your jokes

97
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,400
just aren't very funny.

98
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,950
I should--I should get back to the paper.

99
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,770
It's okay. I was just leaving.

100
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,010
Hey, guys--hey, Joe. Look, hey, I'm sorry.

101
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,410
Look, I just, I know you guys aren't speaking

102
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,040
to each other right now, but I was just thinking

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,670
maybe we could talk about why that is for a minute. I--

104
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,560
- No. - Dude.

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,170
- No, we can't. - Okay, I'm sorry. I just-- look.

106
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm sorry, I just thought, I don't know,

107
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,470
maybe it would be good for you guys just to...

108
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,800
hear it said out loud.

109
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,540
This is because of what he did, Barry, not me.

110
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,890
- Iris. - What?

111
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,110
What could you possibly have to say?

112
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll just see you at the station, all right?

113
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,630
Nice job with, Thief.

114
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,670
- Give me a lift to CCU? - Sure.

115
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,560
So you're still taking engineering classes.

116
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,620
- Yeah. - Yeah, cool.

117
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,540
All right, well, good-- good luck with that.

118
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,490
- What is wrong with you? - Nothing.

119
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,480
Are you trying to make me as mad at you as I am at him?

120
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,420
No, no, look, I'm-- I'm sorry, I--

121
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,780
I guess I don't fully understand why you're so upset at him.

122
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,940
Then maybe you shouldn't bring it up again.

123
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,730
Yeah.

124
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,990
How about we talk about us instead?

125
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,100
Us? You--you mean you and me,

126
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,260
like, trying this?

127
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,200
I just thought with everything

128
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,390
that's happened lately and everything

129
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,670
that you've been through,

130
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,390
I wanted to make sure that you still felt the same.

131
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,140
Well, Iris, I did what you said.

132
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,190
I went where I needed to go,

133
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,640
I did what I needed to do,

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,050
and I'm ready.

135
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,970
I never told you to do that.

136
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,080
Yeah, no, you did-- on the porch,

137
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,900
right after we beat Zoom, right before you--

138
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,210
- Wow, you kissed Iris. - Well, not anymore.

139
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,340
I've kissed Iris West twice,

140
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,730
and I have managed to erase both times from existence.

141
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,310
Man, I hate it when that happens.

142
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,000
That's just the least of my problems today.

143
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,540
Joe, hey-hey, man, um, can we talk for a second?

144
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah, I just gotta drop this off for Singh.

145
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,090
Oh, Captain Singh's back? That's just terrific.

146
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,580
Yeah, why, did he go somewhere?

147
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,140
No-- maybe. I don't know, I--

148
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,980
Is that cowl cutting off all the oxygen in your brain?

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
What? No, I'm fine. Why? Why?

150
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,310
Because you've been acting real odd lately.

151
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,130
Asking why Iris wasn't at the house last night.

152
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,770
And that stunt you pulled at S.T.A.R. Labs this morning.

153
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,880
You know damn well why she's not talking to me.

154
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,520
Of course. Uh, because sh--

155
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,670
Because I should have told her her mother was alive

156
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,740
but I didn't.

157
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,070
Yeah, but she forgave you for that.

158
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,940
One would think that she would have.

159
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,880
I don't know if she ever will or not,

160
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,030
but you sticking your nose into it isn't helping, Bar.

161
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,720
- Good intentions and all. - I was-- okay.

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,470
We found another husk this morning.

163
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,380
Husk?

164
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,620
Singh wants this processed ASAP.

166
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,560
Yes, the skin husks we've been finding around the city

167
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,010
are the ones we think are attached to the meta-humans.

168
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,550
This is now the fourth one.

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,900
Well, let's figure out what's happening

171
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,340
before there's a fifth.

172
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,430
Yes, sir.

173
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,980
Deep breaths.

174
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,680
Hello?

175
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,830
Yes. Hello, Mr. Allen.

176
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,700
I can still see you're there and no,

177
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
I don't want your help, thank you.

178
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,310
What are you doing here, Julian Albert,

179
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,360
meta-human CSI specialist?

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
I did tell you the meta-human conference was only for two days.

181
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,810
Okay, but this is--

182
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,590
Still our lab... unfortunately.

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,060
Yes, County forgot to mention that significant detail

184
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,050
before assigning me, but here we are.

185
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,390
Looks like you and I get to be roomies

186
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,170
for a little longer than we'd hoped.

187
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,400
Roomies.

188
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,670
There's a whole new guy at work

189
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,660
that you didn't even know about?

190
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,630
Yeah. And he's worked there for almost a year.

191
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,380
And he doesn't like me very much, apparently.

192
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,470
Well, that's impossible. Everybody likes Barry Allen.

193
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,710
You're like pudding. Everybody likes pudding.

194
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,790
Not everyone.

195
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,650
37.

196
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,980
I hated that we never spoke.

197
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,540
I think the thing that haunts me the most is the fact

198
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,940
that I never told him I loved him.

199
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,030
Or that I idolized him.

200
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,000
I have memories of Dante all the time.

201
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,890
But they don't feel like gifts.

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,440
They feel like reminders...

203
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
of what I did wrong,

204
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,660
and how I'll never make another memory with Dante again.

205
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,420
Excuse me.

206
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,900
What are you doing here?

207
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,240
Oh, wait a second. Now you wanna be there for me?

208
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,490
I'm just trying to understand.

209
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,600
My brother's dead.

210
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,630
There's nothing to understand.

211
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,340
Exit's that way.

212
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,550
So you altered the timeline,

213
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,970
Joe and Iris don't talk anymore,

214
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,040
there's a guy at work-- a new guy--

215
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,470
who doesn't like you,

216
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,850
you never kissed Iris,

217
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,210
and Cisco's brother is dead.

218
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,170
Admittedly, that is an issue.

219
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,330
And what if there's more?

220
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,160
Well, has anything here changed?

221
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,710
No, I don't know. I mean,

222
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,880
everything seems the same, I think.

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,840
Good.

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,710
Can I use-- hold on.

225
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,910
I'll be real careful.

226
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,150
I got it, don't worry. I got it.

227
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,300
Yeah, I don't know-- I mean, everything looks okay.

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,500
Wait.

229
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,090
Who's that young boy with Dig?

230
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,120
No way. He didn't have kid before?

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,340
No, he had a kid. He has-- he has a kid.

232
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,730
Yeah, it was baby Sara.

233
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,710
Baby John.

234
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,540
- No. - Are you--

235
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,100
Oh, my God. It really can affect us.

236
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,750
Okay, you know what? I don't wanna know anymore.

237
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,050
Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure,

238
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,800
but everything's gonna be all right.

239
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,670
I screwed up everyone's life.

240
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,360
Yeah, well, maybe you should tell them.

241
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm not gonna tell them.

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,930
I mean, how is that gonna help?

243
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,180
That's just gonna make everything worse.

244
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,450
I mean-- I don't know how to fix this.

245
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,480
Okay, well, you're gonna figure it out.

246
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,810
If there's one thing I've learned from you,

247
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,210
is that with you, anything is possible.

248
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,070
Why? 'Cause I'm The Flash?

249
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,550
No. Because you are Barry Allen.

250
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,680
And sweet, loving, kind Barry Allen

251
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,890
that everybody likes,

252
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,090
the Barry Allen who's just like pudding,

253
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,370
can fix this.

254
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,850
So go and fix this.

255
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,210
Yeah.

256
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,980
Okay, you're right. Yeah.

257
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
- Now! - Right now?

258
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,250
- Yes! - Okay, all right.

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,270
Stop!

260
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,620
Find me.

261
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,770
Who? Who?

263
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,060
I am Alchemy.

264
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,500
I have visions...

265
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,610
of another life.

266
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,720
Please, make them stop.

267
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,950
Is that what you really want?

268
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,830
To make the visions stop?

269
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,210
Or do you want them to come true?

270
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,650
To be fast again?

271
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,170
- To have speed? - Yes.

272
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,740
Do you want that other life?

273
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,860
That's what I want.

274
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,230
Once again, you will have power.

275
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,020
And no man will be your rival.

276
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,680
Julian, I thought you could use some help on this one.

277
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,300
You know, the two heads thing and all.

278
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,280
I don't need any help, Detective.

279
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,640
Especially from him.

280
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,850
- What is that? - Another epidermal husk, Allen.

281
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,910
A fully intact human pelt,

282
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,260
comprised of nothing but the stratum corneum.

283
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,050
You see what I mean?

284
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,110
Do we have any theories as to what's causing them?

285
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
Well, I'll take a wild guess at it

286
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,870
and say it's the same thing that created the last four husks.

287
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,740
Spalling could be caused from toxic epidermal necrolysis,

288
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,800
or maybe some kind of moist desquamation

289
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,690
from intense radiation exposure.

290
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,580
- We've had a lot of... - Radioactive metas.

291
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,690
Yes, thank you, Allen. I've read all the case studies.

292
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,530
I'll tell you what, when I figure it out,

293
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,240
I'll enlighten you then, shall I?

294
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,890
Thanks.

295
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,460
How have I worked with this guy for the past year?

296
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,820
Yeah, you say that all the time.

297
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,030
I'm sure I do.

298
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,790
Julian?

299
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,330
Are you certain that Barry can't

300
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,520
take a sample or something to speed things along?

301
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,080
I'm sure, Detective.

302
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,590
Quite sure.

303
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,250
You might wanna get that to S.T.A.R. Labs.

304
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,160
Yeah.

305
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,710
You know, there's really not that much here.

306
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,980
Yeah, no, I know. It's basically touch DNA.

307
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,270
I had to steal the sample because our meta-human expert

308
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,260
wouldn't let me take one.

309
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,020
Oh, you mean Julian Albert?

310
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,980
Yeah, you know him?

311
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,420
Yeah, we've known him for a while.

312
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,920
He's the best.

313
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,220
- You need me? - No, I think I got this.

314
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,670
- But thank you. - Okay.

315
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,230
Cisco told me you showed up

316
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,060
to his bereavement group last night.

317
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,490
Yeah, I did.

318
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,190
He also tell you it didn't go so well?

319
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,100
It's only been a few months since Dante

320
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,900
was killed by that drunk driver.

321
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm sure he just needs a little bit more time.

322
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,970
Wait, why is he so mad at me?

323
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,340
Oh, no. I'm staying out of that.

324
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,620
Cait, he'll-he'll barely look at me

325
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,360
unless other people are in the room.

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,740
Maybe it's just easier when the rest of us are around.

327
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,470
Do you think maybe you could convince him

328
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,670
to come with you to my house for dinner tonight?

329
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,320
- Why? - So I can try to fix things between us,

330
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,950
maybe between Joe and Iris, too.

331
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,500
Just all of us together again in one room

332
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,190
and try to work this out once and for all.

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,130
Think you can do that?

334
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,430
Okay.

335
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,630
But how are you gonna get Joe and Iris there?

336
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,700
Joe? Hey, Joe.

337
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,580
So I talked to Iris

338
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,670
and she just has a few things that she wants to say to you.

339
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,330
Bar, I thought I told you to stay out of this.

340
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,210
Oh, no, no, no. This was all her, I swear.

341
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,460
So she just, out of the blue,

342
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,920
decided now she wants to talk to me?

343
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,410
So Joe said that he'd give you

344
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,360
what you need about the husks for a story.

345
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,570
What? He just decided, out of the blue, to tell me?

346
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,160
No one at the precinct will say anything.

347
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,020
- Even Julian. - Oh, I hate that guy.

348
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,450
Yeah, you always say that.

349
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,110
When does he want to do it?

350
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,410
Uh, tonight, at the house.

351
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,490
He said he's making your favorite.

352
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,750
Okay, he's out of his mind.

353
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,990
He knows I will not go back there,

354
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,670
even if he does make one of Grandma Esther's recipes, so...

355
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,690
When?

356
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,300
Uh, tonight. Tonight, yeah.

357
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,800
- Um, at the house. - At the house?

358
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,440
Yeah.

359
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,320
She vowed she'd never set foot in the house again.

360
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,670
Unless you made dinner.

361
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,190
- Dinner? - Yeah, like old times.

362
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,120
So, one of her favorites,

363
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,060
like Grandma Esther's recipes, maybe.

364
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,600
Okay. I suppose I can make something.

365
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,710
Which dish?

366
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,740
He said he'd make the chicken.

367
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,140
I hate the chicken. I like the noodles.

368
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,050
- Oh, noodles, okay. - Why are you out of breath?

369
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,570
I'm not out of breath. Uh, Joe also thought

370
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,620
maybe just to take some pressure off

371
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,440
that he'd invite Caitlin and Cisco.

372
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,980
- Okay, um, what time? - Uh, 7:00.

373
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,050
All right.

374
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,660
7:00 will work, by the way.

375
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,520
Okay, but which dish?

376
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,030
I mean, I was thinking maybe to take some pressure off,

377
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,350
you could invite Caitlin and Cisco.

378
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,080
That's a good idea,

379
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,530
'cause if we're gonna do this, I gotta get started.

380
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,230
Yeah, I got it. No problem, yeah.

381
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,460
- Bar? - Yeah?

382
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,730
- Which dish? - Noodle dish.

383
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,440
Yeah, noodle dish.

384
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,450
This hits the spot, huh?

385
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,470
You can thank Grandma Esther.

386
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,520
No, I mean, it's good. I just meant, um...

387
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,460
all of us, actually, just here, together.

388
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,470
I was actually thinking, um, that maybe it'd be fun

389
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,270
if we all went away together for a few days.

390
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,880
Just like a little Team Flash vacay.

391
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,060
- And do what? - Bond.

392
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,390
- Reconnect. - You mean like a retreat?

393
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,190
- Nah. - With trust exercises?

394
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,470
Epic fail, party of six.

395
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,760
I just--I just feel like we're not the team

396
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,250
that we were or can be.

397
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,590
No one?

398
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,650
I'd be down for it.

399
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,130
Okay.

400
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,490
So other than Wally,

401
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,330
I'm the only one that thinks that's a good idea?

402
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,250
I don't think The Flash really takes vacations.

403
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,440
Especially with all these husks showing up all over town.

404
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,290
Speaking of husks, I'm glad you're finally ready

405
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,540
to open up about them.

406
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,940
Iris, I already told you, I can't tell you

407
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,440
anything about this case.

408
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,930
Oh, really?

409
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,200
Because that's not what I was told.

410
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Strange. I was under the impression

411
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,890
you had some things to say to me, too.

412
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,170
Isn't that right, Bar?

413
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,480
Told you. Epic fail.

414
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,650
Okay, look, yeah. I arranged this.

415
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,990
I put all this together. I'm sorry, guys.

416
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,100
Look, I just-- we're not acting like a team,

417
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,610
and I just wanted things back to how they were. Just fixed.

418
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
If you wanted things fixed,

419
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,290
maybe you should have gone back in time

420
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,180
and stopped my brother from dying.

421
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,710
You want me to change the timeline to save Dante?

422
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,510
Why would you do that? It's not like he's your brother.

423
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,700
Meta-human app. We gotta go.

425
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,150
Remember me, Flash?

426
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,830
Clariss?

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,050
Clariss?

428
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh, you do remember, Flash?

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,430
Good, yeah.

430
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,220
Because I remember everything, too.

431
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,700
- How are you here? - It doesn't matter.

432
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,260
You see, what does matter

433
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,400
is that I know your little secret.

434
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,790
You changed the timeline.

435
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,460
Because if I recall correctly,

436
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,240
the only Speedsters in my other life

437
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,270
were me and that smartass Kid Flash,

438
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,120
until you showed up and stole everything from me!

439
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,010
I didn't steal anything from you, Clariss.

440
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,050
I-I was just trying to put things back

441
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,350
to the way they're supposed to be.

442
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,940
This is how my life is supposed to be!

443
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,460
For years, I felt like something was missing.

444
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,690
And now I know why.

445
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,050
Well, I'm sorry.

446
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,000
I didn't mean to do this to you.

447
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,430
Yeah, well, you did.

448
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,460
And here I am.

449
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,880
Your Rival, back again.

450
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
Believe me, Flash, this time,

451
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,010
you're not gonna steal my life so easily.

452
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,790
We finally get rid of Zoom,

453
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,510
and there's another evil Speedster?

454
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,450
Who is this guy, now?

455
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,620
I can help you with that.

456
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,000
I finally got the results back

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
from the test I ran on the husk

458
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
that Barry gave me this morning.

459
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,890
And it's weird, because there's no traces of dark matter,

460
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,000
but there are traces of the Speed Force.

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,640
And that's the husk from this Speedster?

463
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,550
Appears so. His name is--

464
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,800
Edward Clariss.

465
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,490
And somehow Barry is exactly right.

467
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,860
Can I talk to you for a second?

468
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,330
Yeah.

469
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,280
S.T.A.R. Labs isn't the only one

470
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,560
with access to the city's security cams.

471
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,570
It's pretty obvious that this guy knows you.

472
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,210
You want to tell me what that's about?

473
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,890
This is why you've been acting so weird lately--

474
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,020
trying to get me and my dad talking again,

475
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,610
tricking all of us into dinner tonight--

476
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,090
because you're keeping something from us.

477
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,340
You need to tell me what is going on, Barry.

478
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,590
Right now.

479
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,730
And if you lie to me...

480
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,150
this thing between us, it cannot happen.

481
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,080
You're right, and, uh, I'm sorry, I--

482
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,520
I did this. All of this.

483
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,060
It's my fault and I've been trying to fix it.

484
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,600
But I think that there's only one way to do that now.

485
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,510
I'm sorry, Iris.

486
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,900
Flash?

487
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,170
Flash.

488
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,480
Here, put these on.

489
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,190
We need to talk.

490
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,100
Where are we?

491
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,490
Motorcar Diner in Central City.

492
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,180
Yeah, I meant what year?

493
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,430
1998.

494
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,620
Care to get something to eat? 'Cause I'm starved.

495
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,720
The corned beef hash here is the best I've ever had.

496
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,590
This is why you pulled me out of the Speed Force?

497
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,580
- Buy me a meal? - Because you were about to

498
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,700
reset the timeline again after screwing it all up.

499
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,130
Oh, yeah, I know about that.

500
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,730
- How did you-- - After your

501
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,960
not-so-subtle reaction when you first met me...

502
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,010
Harry told me all that happened with Zoom and your mom

503
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,430
and your dad, so I decided

504
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,390
I'd keep my eye on you for a bit.

505
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,040
- He tell you anything else? - He did.

506
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,120
I'm your father's doppelganger.

507
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,690
Sorry about that.

508
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,610
It's just... really weird.

509
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,440
And really sad, too... I'm sure.

510
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,630
Having a loss like that in your life,

511
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,230
I see why you'd wanna erase it.

512
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,470
Who wouldn't try to save their parents?

513
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,570
I understand that, Barry, completely.

514
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,780
But the thing is, there are consequences to time travel.

515
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,450
I have heard all of this before.

516
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,230
Not from me you haven't.

517
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,180
I'm not some Doctor with a theory, Barry.

518
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,530
I'm a Speedster, like you, who's travelled in time,

519
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,750
and made these same mistakes you are making right now.

520
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,440
Here, let me show you something.

521
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,710
- Okay, you know what? - Humor me, kid.

522
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,810
- This coffee cup right here. - All right, yeah.

523
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,120
Think of it as the space-time continuum.

524
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,630
Whenever you go back in time it breaks.

525
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,010
- Now... - For real? I mean--

526
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,060
you can reset the timeline, you can try to fix it,

527
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,340
but no matter how hard you try...

528
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,870
It's never gonna be exactly how it was.

529
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,450
Look, I've learned all this stuff

530
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,800
that I didn't know before, okay?

531
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,760
- I'm not gonna make the same... - Mistakes.

532
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,870
Yeah, what you just said right there?

533
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,220
That is the paradox of time travel,

534
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,670
and also the paradox of life.

535
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,940
I mean, if I only knew then what I know now.

536
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,330
Why have these powers if I can't go back

537
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,580
and fix what I broke?

538
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,690
We're not gods, we're men,

539
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,740
who, for whatever reason, have been given extraordinary abilities.

540
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,180
The question you need to ask yourself is,

541
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,200
what kind of hero are you gonna be?

542
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,310
Are you just gonna take a do-over

543
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,210
every time you make a mistake?

544
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,420
Or will you live with them and move forward?

545
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,300
Where's Barry?

546
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,020
I need to tell you all something.

547
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,880
The truth.

548
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,740
The truth about what?

549
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,530
Okay, um...

550
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,270
after Zoom killed my dad,

551
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,200
after we defeated him, um...

552
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,180
I wasn't in a great space,

553
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,240
and I felt like the only way I could fix that was

554
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,160
to run back in time and save my mom.

555
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,920
You stopped the Reverse-Flash from killing your mom?

556
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,330
Yeah.

557
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,020
Wait, so, is she alive?

558
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,280
She was. For a few months.

559
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,490
I lived with her and my dad.

560
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,170
I had a completely different life.

561
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,180
I wasn't even The Flash for most of it.

562
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,340
I don't understand.

563
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,500
You created a whole other existence.

564
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,930
How is that possible?

565
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,360
Okay, um...

566
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll do the-- this is the timeline.

567
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,080
This is the point that we exist on it right now.

568
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,100
This past point is where my mom was murdered.

569
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,340
So when I saved her, I created a new reality.

570
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,160
A new timeline.

571
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,860
- I was living in-- - A mirror universe.

572
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,850
It's called a Flashpoint, apparently.

573
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,930
But you decided to leave it. Why?

574
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,150
That life started to spin out of control.

575
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,100
This guy, Clariss,

576
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,870
he was a Speedster there, too.

577
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,380
He was known as the Rival.

578
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,240
He caused a lot of problems.

579
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,540
So, um...

580
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,090
I decided to run back in time again

581
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,190
and let things happen

582
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,650
as they were supposed to, in hopes of...

583
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,240
resetting the timeline, but...

584
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,450
- But what? - But, um,

585
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,490
when I came back, things weren't the same.

586
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,760
You mean people. Like us.

587
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,710
Yeah, yeah.

588
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,200
I created another timeline.

589
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,530
Uh, it's the one we're living in now.

590
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,810
It's not as different as the last one.

591
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,890
Not in large ways, but in some ways,

592
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,450
in smaller ways, and, uh, meaningful ways

593
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,530
for all of you or anybody that's close to me.

594
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,650
And I can't ever really put it back together.

595
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,880
Barry, that's a lot to take in.

596
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,220
Yeah, it is.

597
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,430
We got along in that other life,

598
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,600
my dad and I, didn't we?

599
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,660
That's why you've been working so hard

600
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,370
to get us talking again.

601
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay, here's the thing. Um, I will tell you

602
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,510
what's different,

603
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,620
all of you, if you wanna know.

604
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,290
But you have to live with those differences

605
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,530
because I can't change it again.

606
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,330
But at least you'll know.

607
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,640
And you all deserve that choice.

608
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,360
So you decided it was okay to change things

609
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,510
when someone in your family dies,

610
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,560
but when it's someone in my family...

611
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,250
I'm gonna go talk to him.

612
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,510
What are you working on?

613
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,720
These are the gauntlets for my suit.

614
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,200
And you probably know nothing about that, do you?

615
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,190
I'm really trying here, Cisco.

616
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,260
Barry, I'm the one who's been trying.

617
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,150
I've been trying this whole time

618
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,950
to get you to do this one thing for me,

619
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,100
but you kept saying, "No, Cisco.

620
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,400
I can't, Cisco. I would never do that, Cisco."

621
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,590
And now you're telling me you went and did it for yourself.

622
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,960
Were you listening?

623
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,910
It -- it went bad. It went really bad.

624
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,440
I don't care!

625
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,590
At least I'd have my brother back.

626
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,430
Yeah, you would have him back,

627
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,170
but because of it, somebody might have something

628
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,750
happen to them that's just as awful

629
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,530
as what happened to Dante, and trust me,

630
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,830
you don't want that on your conscience.

631
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,900
It's a heavy burden to bear.

632
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,820
And I don't know how many times I've said this, but...

633
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,880
I'm really sorry about Dante, man.

634
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,210
Sorry doesn't change anything.

635
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,280
No, it doesn't, but I can't go back.

636
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,010
I can't change it.

637
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,410
All I can do is move forward.

638
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,970
I really hope you can, too.

639
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,120
Hey, um, I need your help.

640
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,480
It's the four words I seem to hear you

641
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,650
most often say, Barry.

642
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,300
That and, "I hate that guy."

643
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,830
Which, the feeling's mutual, so...

644
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,010
This is gonna be hard for you,

645
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,260
but I just, for a second,

646
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,820
need you to imagine that we're actually friends.

647
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,630
Can't do it.

648
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,360
Friendly.

649
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,550
Equally as challenging, Barry.

650
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,170
But I'll give it a whirl.

651
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,070
What are you after?

652
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,500
I need to read your report

653
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,250
- on one of the husks. - Which one?

654
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,650
The one from this morning. Edward Clariss.

655
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,610
- Edward Clariss? - Yeah.

656
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,790
- Why? - May help me figure out a case I'm working on.

657
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,730
Well, the nutshell is,

658
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,660
the hyaluronic acids were found to be above normal.

659
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,570
Androgen degradation atypically low.

660
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,350
Cellular regeneration seemed to occur at a staggering rate.

661
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,260
It's quite a bit different

662
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,450
from the previous husks that we found. That's about it.

663
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,090
Could I -- could I maybe just take a peek at it?

664
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,660
I'm sorry, it's just something I need to see

665
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,020
to know what I'm looking for.

666
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,050
- Sure. - Great, thank you.

667
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,100
Wait, why does this say the body's place of discovery

668
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,880
was Williamson

669
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,980
when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood?

670
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,660
The body ended up in Leawood.

671
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,300
There was a strong current this morning,

672
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,930
so chances are that it originated from Williamson.

673
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,210
Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.

674
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,910
- You done? - Yeah, uh, yes. Thank you.

675
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,040
You found me again, Flash.

676
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,460
I wondered how long it'd take you this time to figure it out.

677
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,600
Wasn't too hard.

678
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,530
I see you didn't bring your little sidekick with you, though.

679
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,960
- Nope. Just me. - That's too bad.

680
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,950
I brought one.

681
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,750
Oh, and Flash? A little, uh,

682
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,360
quaking in your boots wouldn't be inappropriate.

683
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,620
So?

684
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,290
He changed our lives, Iris.

685
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,080
And he kept that secret from us.

686
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,350
You really just want us to just be okay with that?

687
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,910
All I'm saying, Wally, is that he made a mistake.

688
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,560
- Yeah, he did. - Cisco, we all make mistakes

689
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,610
to protect the people that we love.

690
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,720
I mean, you told Captain Cold that Barry was The Flash

691
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,450
in order to protect your brother.

692
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,250
Okay. Not my finest moment.

693
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,660
That's my point. It was one decision made in one moment.

694
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,360
One very heart-wrenching moment.

695
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,640
Look, guys, we're like a family here, okay?

696
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,360
And sometimes families get mad at each other for screwing up.

697
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,470
I know that all too well.

698
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,940
But they also forgive.

699
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,630
Because after a while, it just seems silly

700
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,290
when you stop and think about it.

701
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,080
Guys, Iris is right.

702
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,240
We all have secrets.

703
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,490
We've all screwed up, but this is Barry

704
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,950
we're talking about.

705
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,840
Who apparently is in trouble.

706
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,530
And who are you?

707
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,500
I am Alchemy.

708
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
Okay, well, what do you want?

709
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,680
To help people achieve their true potential...

710
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,270
such as he has.

711
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,150
And why are you doing this?

712
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,430
Because I'm preparing this world.

713
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,270
Remember what happened here last time, Flash?

714
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,950
It's where I died.

715
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,290
And I'm not gonna waste this second chance I've been given.

716
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,150
This time, I'm gonna show you who's the fastest man alive.

717
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,380
Barry? Barry!

718
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,030
His coms aren't working.

719
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,360
He's at the Prescott Mill.

722
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,670
That's right around the corner.

723
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,110
We gotta do something.

724
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,170
Having fun yet, Flash?

725
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,500
'Cause I'm having a blast.

726
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,880
Time to look for a new rival.

727
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,580
Stay away from my friend.

728
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you.

729
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,510
Sorry it took so long.

730
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,820
You were just in time.

731
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,850
Nothing. No mention of Alchemy anywhere.

732
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,390
No mask-wearing monk metas.

733
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,540
Not even close.

734
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,310
I didn't find any known aliases

735
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,700
in any of the records at CCPD.

736
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,400
And Clariss won't say anything either.

737
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,380
All right, well, keep at him. Alchemy is the one

738
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,960
that gave Clariss back his speed.

739
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,310
He's kinda like a doctor, that way, don't you think?

740
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,510
Come on, don't pretend like "Doctor Alchemy"

741
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,030
doesn't have a nice ring to it.

742
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,300
Okay, well, that explains why he didn't have

743
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,990
any traces of dark matter in his cells.

744
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,440
He didn't get his powers from the particle accelerator,

745
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,700
he got them from Alchemy.

746
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,570
What was that?

747
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,330
Doctor Alchemy.

748
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,460
How could he do that?

749
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,420
I don't know, but we need to figure it out.

750
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,060
There's gonna be more.

751
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,870
Alchemy-- Doctor Alchemy said that he is

752
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,770
preparing this world.

753
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,180
Preparing the world?

754
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,230
For what? Like, the second coming or something?

755
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,290
I think that everyone that had powers in Flashpoint

756
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,170
is gonna get them back.

757
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,750
Well, we already found four other husks,

758
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,730
which means there's at least that many

759
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,300
running around Central City right now.

760
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,950
We need to find him before he changes more people's lives.

761
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,080
Speaking of changing lives,

762
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,190
we all talked about it, Barry, and we don't want to know

763
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,630
what our lives were like in Flashpoint.

764
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,370
You sure?

765
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,870
To quote the wise words of Harry,

766
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,650
"What's the point, Allen?"

767
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,730
I gotta get to the precinct.

768
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,330
Stop by Jitters on the way?

769
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,240
Yeah, it's on me.

770
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,360
Oh, good. Then I'm coming, too.

771
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,620
Yo, um, I've just been thinking that

772
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,000
it was pretty cool

773
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,100
having someone out there with me last night.

774
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,090
And, I don't know, maybe we could

775
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,280
make that a thing every once in a while.

776
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,660
I-I got some things to work on

777
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,210
before I start doing that.

778
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,680
Yeah.

779
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,230
Maybe someday.

780
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,540
It'd be pretty bitchin'.

781
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,070
Glad to see everything's starting to

782
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,750
get back to the way it was.

783
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,560
Yeah. I mean...

784
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,930
mostly.

785
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,980
You have nothing to worry about, Cait.

786
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,250
I think out of everyone, actually, you're the only one

787
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,140
that wasn't really affected when I messed with the timeline.

788
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,320
I mean, unless you're secretly moonlighting

789
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,710
as an ophthalmologist.

790
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,810
- A what? - Kidding, nothing.

791
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,740
Just a Flashpoint joke. I'll see you later.

792
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,520
What's that?

793
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,420
That's the finished Edward Clariss report.

794
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,970
Or should I say The Rival?

795
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,330
At least, that's what The Flash called him

796
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,550
last night when he took him into Iron Heights.

797
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,780
I thought you might want to see it.

798
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,380
You know, to do with your other case.

799
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,310
Actually it turns out there was no connection.

800
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,280
You know, I have to ask you.

801
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,990
- How did you know his name? - What?

802
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,180
Yesterday, you came in and you asked

803
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,970
for Edward Clariss' report,

804
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,080
but I didn't tell you

805
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,500
who that husk belonged to, so that means

806
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,190
you stole a sample when you showed up to my crime scene.

807
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,820
How did you do that?

808
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,710
I--

809
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,740
You've really got this good guy routine thing down, haven't you?

810
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,480
And everyone just buys it.

811
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,370
There is something not right about you, Allen.

812
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,980
They don't see it... but I do.

813
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,810
- Is that right? - Yes.

814
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,740
You know why I don't actually like you, don't you?

815
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,850
I don't trust you.

816
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,680
And I don't like things that I don't trust.

817
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,730
See you tomorrow, roomie.

818
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,720
I was hoping you'd be here.

819
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,150
Yeah. Dad and I just polished off

820
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,390
Grandma Esther's noodle dish.

821
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,380
Oh, did you leave me some?

822
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,780
Too slow, Flash.

823
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,990
So you guys are...?

824
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,540
We're good.

825
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,030
Are you sure you don't wanna know about the other timeline?

826
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,500
No, I guess, in my mind, wherever you go,

827
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,200
you'll always be Barry,

828
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,450
and I'll always be Iris.

829
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,950
And we always find each other.

830
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,780
You failed.

831
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,290
You failed, Clariss.

832
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,560
I'm sorry. Please...

833
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,050
let me try again.

834
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,800
Alchemy!

835
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,360
No, no, no, no, no.

836
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,540
No!
