1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,776
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,946
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,115
by something impossible.

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,151
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,321
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,558
To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,962
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,497
and find others like me.

9
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,999
And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,568
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,604
That day is today.

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,545
What?
No Big Belly Burger?

13
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,447
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

14
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,982
We're out of cows
where I come from.

15
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,185
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

16
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,121
Not sure where to start...
Thawne.

17
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,358
That is your real name...
Eobard Thawne.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,060
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

19
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,594
136 years from now.

20
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,698
That's not what
you want to know.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,835
Go ahead, Barry.

22
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,103
Ask it.

23
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,940
Why did you kill
my mother?

24
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,042
Because I hate you.

25
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,211
Not you now.
You years from now.

26
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,281
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

27
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,183
We're enemies, rivals,
opposites,

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,451
reverses of one another.

29
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,186
Why?
Wh-why were we enemies?

30
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,788
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,524
It doesn't...
matter anymore.

32
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,593
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

33
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,362
to defeat the other.

34
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,099
Until I learned your secret.

35
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,835
I learned your name.

36
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,504
Barry Allen.

37
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,374
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

38
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,278
Travel back in time,
kill you as a child.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,148
Wipe you
from the face of the earth.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,085
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

41
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,020
and we fought.

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,858
We both landed
some pretty solid shots.

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,829
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

44
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,599
I was so mad.

45
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,370
But then I thought...

46
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,207
what if you were
to suffer a tragedy?

47
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,911
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

48
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,514
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

49
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,049
Then you would not become
The Flash.

50
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,253
And so I stabbed your mother
in the heart,

51
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,854
and I was free.

52
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,725
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

53
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,996
only to realize
that in traveling back

54
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,698
I'd lost my way home.

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,068
Lost my ability to harness
the speed force.

56
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,505
And without it,
I was stuck here.

57
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,542
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

58
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:01,180
And the only way back
was The Flash.

59
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,716
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,024
Why train me?

61
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,593
Why help me save
so many people?

62
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,330
Because I needed you
to get fast.

63
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:23,001
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

64
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,970
and create
a stable wormhole

65
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,973
through which
I could return home.

66
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,575
Why would I
ever do that?

67
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,043
Because...

68
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:36,281
Barry Allen,
if you give me what I want,

69
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,517
I'm gonna give you
what you want.

70
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,722
You can go back
and save your mother.

71
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,925
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

72
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,629
You can reunite
the Allen family.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,434
No.

74
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,836
No, I don't
believe you.

75
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,341
I want to kill you
right now.

76
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,042
I know that rage.

77
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,778
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

78
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,649
And now, somehow,

79
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:15,687
I know
what Joe and Henry feel

80
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,890
when they look on you
with pride.

81
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,125
With love.

82
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,293
No. No.

83
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,162
Don't you
ever say that to me!

84
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,031
I know you're upset,

85
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,134
but I'm giving you
a chance.

86
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:35,207
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

87
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,743
Don't you want that chance?

88
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,594
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

89
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,830
and save your mother's life...

90
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,767
Quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

91
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,970
The chance to be
with someone you love?

92
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,838
Seems pretty cut and dry
to me.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,541
At first blush, Dr. Snow,
it would appear so,

94
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:14,680
but this gift
has unparalleled risk.

95
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,748
Barry, the night
your mother died,

96
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,817
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

97
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,555
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

98
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,757
and changed
the course of history.

99
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,328
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

100
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,496
Just like when
I time travelled before.

101
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,899
But he... he only changed
one day that time.

102
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:39,771
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

103
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,040
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

104
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,343
impacts everything that follows.

105
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,312
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices.

106
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:51,783
No relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

107
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,352
and you'd never know
the difference

108
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,455
because you'd never
remember any of it.

109
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:03,328
So if I go back
and save my mom,

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,165
my dad doesn't go to prison.

111
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,502
I never live
with Joe and Iris.

112
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:15,807
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

113
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:20,078
Truth is,
there's no real way

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,482
of knowing what
your life will be.

115
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,323
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

116
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,658
You gotta change the past.

117
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,467
Joe?

118
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,438
So what...
What, that's it?

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,007
You think I should
just do it?

120
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,912
Yeah, I do.

121
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,449
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

122
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,718
you're okay with that?

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,422
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

124
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,624
You don't have to grow up
without a mother.

125
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,192
What about growing up
without a father?

126
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:11,897
You will have a father...
Your real father.

127
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,101
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

128
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,970
This is why you became
The Flash, Barry.

129
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,872
To put things right.

130
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:26,211
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

131
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,046
Now it's time
to save yours.

132
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,736
Dad, look.
I know this sounds crazy.

133
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,206
I think
we're way past crazy, slugger.

134
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,710
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

135
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,079
No, I wouldn't be
turning time back.

136
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,716
I would be...
going back

137
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,285
to that night
to save her.

138
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,922
And what does Joe think
about all this?

139
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,160
He thinks
I should do it.

140
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,195
No.

141
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,763
You can't.

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,835
Dad...

143
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:29,241
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

144
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,742
We'll be a family again.

145
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,244
We are a family.

146
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,913
Not like this.
Not without Mom.

147
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,118
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

148
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,686
Things happen the way they do.

149
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,788
We may not know why
at the time,

150
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,924
but there must always be
a reason.

151
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,394
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

152
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:54,099
I... I can save Mom.

153
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,568
At what cost?

154
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,104
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

155
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,439
- I don't care.
- I do.

156
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,012
I am in awe

157
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:11,583
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

158
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:15,020
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

159
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,354
but you, Barry.

160
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,024
Your honesty.
Your heart.

161
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,495
You were always a hero.

162
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,165
And your mom would be
just as proud.

163
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,100
And if she had a say in this,

164
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,469
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

165
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,239
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

166
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,641
she would never want that.

167
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,114
Barry, what I hope for you,

168
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,618
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,190
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

170
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,392
And then you will know...

171
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,933
How much I truly love you.

172
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,008
98.6. Normal.

173
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,077
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

174
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,712
Me neither.

175
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,980
I know Barry
really appreciates you

176
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,648
coming back to help him
stop Wells.

177
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,284
That's not the only reason
I'm back, Cait.

178
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,152
I'm here now.
For good.

179
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,721
But I thought...

180
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,256
I thought too...
I thought too much

181
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,093
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

182
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,562
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

183
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,765
If we hurt you.

184
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:39,804
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

185
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,474
I'm not whole
unless I'm with you.

186
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,643
I love you, Cait.

187
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,515
- Are you sure?
- I am.

188
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,320
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

189
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,322
you agreed to marry me.

190
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,189
Yes, I did.

191
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,525
What do you say
we do that?

192
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,169
Thought I might find you here.

193
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,041
I needed to get
out of the lab.

194
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,280
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

195
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,682
Oh, it is.
Trust me.

196
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,719
I've done a lot
of thinking up here.

197
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,454
When I wasn't having
clandestine meetings

198
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,057
with the mysterious
"streak."

199
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,228
Yeah, not mad
we lost that name.

200
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,631
Hey, I thought that
had pizzazz.

201
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,902
- No.
- Uh-uh.

202
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,077
So are you gonna do it?

203
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,650
It's just so... huge.

204
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,185
It's the biggest decision
of my life,

205
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:04,422
and if I'm wrong,
I can't undo it.

206
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,091
Why would you
want to?

207
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:12,163
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,100
have a great career,

209
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,002
even get married.

210
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,006
Iris West-Allen, huh?

211
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,776
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

212
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,946
Must be a 2024 thing.

213
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,016
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

214
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:37,455
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

215
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,657
that's why things
are different there?

216
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,727
Growing up together and...

217
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:47,866
knowing so much
about each other...

218
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:52,036
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

219
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,142
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

220
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,249
But living with you
and Joe...

221
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,854
I've had a great life,
Iris.

222
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,692
Come here,
Barry.

223
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,535
What do you think
I should do?

224
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,637
I need someone to tell me.

225
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,811
I think...

226
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,447
that for once in your life,
Barry Allen,

227
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,917
you should stop thinking
about other people.

228
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,353
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

229
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,889
Do what you need to do
for yourself.

230
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,033
Ah!

231
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,069
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

232
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,637
it took you a whole hour
longer to decide

233
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,639
than I thought it would.

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,409
So how does this work?

235
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,045
Your grand plan?

236
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,414
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

237
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,082
In fact, it's rather simple.

238
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,617
We use
the Particle Accelerator.

239
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,085
The Particle Accelerator.

240
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,955
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

241
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,690
that hurt a lot of people.

242
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,893
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

243
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,528
the way it was designed to.

244
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,099
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

245
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,101
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

246
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,770
we're only going
to inject one particle

247
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,806
into the accelerator.

248
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,942
And I'm what
it collides with.

249
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,211
And if you can go fast enough,
Barry,

250
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,915
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

251
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,118
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,222
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

253
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,958
to infinite times.

254
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,293
A wormhole.

255
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,897
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

256
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,067
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

257
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,670
my time.

258
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,873
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

259
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,475
What happens if I don't?

260
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,312
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

261
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,747
you'll die.

262
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,788
According to
Wells' calculations,

263
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,491
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

264
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,027
Once Barry
reaches optimum speed,

265
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,764
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

266
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,234
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

267
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:40,471
opening a gateway
into time itself.

268
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,874
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

269
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,710
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

270
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,212
I'm uncommitted.

271
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,615
What do you think?

272
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,584
I mean, on the one hand,

273
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,620
it does make a kind of sense.

274
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,355
On the other hand,

275
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,690
why?

276
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,459
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

277
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,027
You know why.

278
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,863
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

279
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,834
By my estimates,
Mach Two at a minimum.

280
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,903
You've never gone that fast.

281
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,872
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

282
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,408
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

283
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,510
How far off am I?

284
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,546
Not very far,
I'm afraid.

285
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,983
Let me worry about
how fast I have to go.

286
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,150
We're gonna need
something else too.

287
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,219
Really?
And what's that?

288
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,088
'Cause I don't know
about you guys,

289
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,992
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

290
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,362
I need you to build
a time machine.

291
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,864
Go on.

292
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,733
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

293
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,735
what's he need
a time machine for?

294
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,270
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

295
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,007
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

296
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,274
He can't fully
control it.

297
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,709
So I was right
about the wheelchair.

298
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,244
He was using it
to charge himself.

299
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,546
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

300
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,949
to travel back
to the future.

301
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,851
He's been squirreling away
the parts.

302
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,652
Now we just need
to put it together.

303
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,856
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

304
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
not a bookcase from IKEA.

305
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
We got a problem.

306
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,994
These tiles...
They're made of tungsten.

307
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,362
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

308
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,764
of any other element.

309
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,899
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

310
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,534
The pressure exerted
from the wormhole...

311
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,969
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,105
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

313
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,408
It could explode.

314
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,043
Any ideas?

315
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,745
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

316
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,681
Which used to be
a name that made me smile.

317
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,389
Something on your mind,
Cisco?

318
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,591
No.

319
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,793
Yes.

320
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,595
How did you fit
your Reverse-Flash suit

321
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,963
into that little ring?

322
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,099
Is it some sort
of compressed micro tech?

323
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,702
Or actually, forget it.
I don't care.

324
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,406
Maybe a little.

325
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,908
Ronnie's right.

326
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,876
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

327
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,179
Glad we're still good
for something.

328
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:05,183
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

329
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,417
Or Ronnie's.

330
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,019
As a matter of fact,

331
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,689
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

332
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,024
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

333
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,258
It would have been
a lot more fun.

334
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,159
Yeah?

335
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,961
Well, doesn't change the fact

336
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,664
that your nifty little
Time Sphere...

337
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,065
Is that what you're calling it?

338
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,834
Whatever it's called.
It's gonna blow.

339
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,836
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

340
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,372
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

341
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,375
Okay. Fine.
We'll try that.

342
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,010
That's it? That's all?

343
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,011
Well, what do you
want me to say?

344
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,713
I don't know, Cisco.

345
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,448
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

346
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,416
of my predicament.

347
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,685
I don't belong here.

348
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,855
These barbaric times.

349
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,389
It's like
living amongst the dead.

350
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:49,160
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

351
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,465
What?

352
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,967
What did you say?

353
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,505
It was an alternate timeline.

354
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,573
One that Barry reset.

355
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,242
But I never forgot it.

356
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:08,079
It just kept
coming back to me.

357
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,249
And I can still picture

358
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,651
the way you looked at me

359
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,287
when you called me a son

360
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,392
and you crushed my heart
with your fist.

361
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,495
Cisco...

362
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,466
Yeah.
It sucked.

364
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,368
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

365
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,537
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

366
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,105
of another timeline.

367
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,375
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

368
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,710
It means...

369
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,513
I wasn't sure
until just now.

370
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,781
Sure of what?

371
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,487
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

372
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,926
You were affected too.

373
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,964
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,067
No.

375
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,904
I wasn't.

376
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,774
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

377
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:15,246
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

378
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:20,718
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

379
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,421
that you remember
who gave you that life.

380
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,327
And that it was given
out of love.

381
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,043
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

382
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,312
with enough power
to run these calculations.

383
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,481
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

384
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,949
Say no more.

385
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,451
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

386
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,885
but it seems
I'm only in the way.

387
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,623
Everyone has
a contribution to make.

388
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,158
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

389
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,927
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

390
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,395
about the future.

391
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,997
I don't matter.

392
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,199
As far as history's concerned,

393
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,301
I don't save the day
or get the girl.

394
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,803
And you believed him?

395
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,073
He had a newspaper
from the year 2024.

396
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:19,443
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

397
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,446
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify

398
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,583
to its authenticity.

399
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:31,622
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

400
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,294
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

401
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,762
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

402
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,530
Me?

403
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,867
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

404
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,069
and get stuck
in the exact same city

405
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,105
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

406
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,475
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

407
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,512
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

408
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:58,683
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

409
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:04,655
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

410
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,791
Which is?

411
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,026
Coincidence.

412
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:13,964
There is no science
to coincidence.

413
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,468
You, sir, are an anomaly.

414
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,138
A wild card, as it were.

415
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,041
You are the only person
in this whole story

416
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,912
who gets to choose
his own future.

417
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,848
At least, that's my opinion.

418
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,119
Wait, that can't be right.

419
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,588
Oh, dear.

420
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,590
- We have a problem.
- What?

421
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,859
The calculations.
There is a danger.

422
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,261
I know.
I'm ready to take the risk.

423
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,164
No, not just to you
but to everyone.

424
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,933
Wells didn't tell us everything.

425
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,370
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

426
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,305
colliding
with the hydrogen particle,

427
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:59,543
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

428
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,545
What's a singularity?

429
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,445
It's a black hole.

430
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,514
We could destroy
Central City.

431
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,882
For starters.

432
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:10,020
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

433
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:14,191
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

434
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:18,329
So long and thanks
for all the fish.

435
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,536
Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

436
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,171
I would hardly refer
to possibly causing

437
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,506
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

438
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,374
Yeah, and your accelerator's

439
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:33,043
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

440
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,045
Let me ask you a question.

441
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,682
How many meta-humans...

442
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,917
How many dangers...

443
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,287
Have we faced
this year together?

444
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,656
Or did you forget
that was me

445
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,092
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

446
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,661
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

447
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,129
It will work.

448
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,031
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

449
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,466
in the middle
of Central City?

450
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:58,102
So, once the wormhole
stabilizes,

451
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:02,039
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

452
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,908
and return to this time.

453
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,609
If and when he does that,

454
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,611
you can close the wormhole,

455
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,613
and we can all live
happily ever after.

456
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,948
Almost two minutes.

457
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,050
More than enough time
to save Nora.

458
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,187
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

459
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,556
Everything's a choice.

460
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,624
And what if I'm late?

461
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,427
You won't be.
I believe in you, Barry.

462
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,228
Always have.

463
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,863
So I guess the question is,

464
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,933
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

465
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,656
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

466
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,025
then I'm dust,
and if I do run fast enough

467
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,994
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

468
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,530
swallow up the city
and possibly the world.

469
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,800
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

470
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:05,069
this is for the best?

471
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,339
I'd be lying
if I told you I did.

472
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,311
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

473
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,646
I thought
you were the sure one.

474
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,548
I...

475
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,450
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

476
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,019
the first time.

477
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,021
I was faking it.

478
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,256
Sometimes parents do that.

479
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,425
Most of the time,
parents do that.

480
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,531
Look, of course I'm scared.

481
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,968
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

482
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,503
because you were worried
about me.

483
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,072
Well, I'll always worry
about you, Joe,

484
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,308
just like you'll always worry
about me.

485
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,011
Sorry,
but you can't stop that.

486
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,219
Do you think I can do this?

487
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,389
You think
I can save my mom?

488
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,324
I mean, do you think
I'm fast enough?

489
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,392
Yes.

490
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,428
I know you are.

491
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:12,836
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

492
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,205
saving her,

493
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,609
freeing my dad, and...

494
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,011
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

495
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,279
Barry...

496
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,583
Joe, it's true.
It's true.

497
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,252
I've always been
so focused on everything

498
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:33,557
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

499
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,395
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

500
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,130
another.

501
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,768
And I don't think
I can lose you.

502
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,504
You won't ever
lose me.

503
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,507
Ever, you hear me?

504
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,309
Ever.

505
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,019
Wow, slow news day?

506
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,558
If they only knew, right?

507
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,028
I thought you would be
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

508
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,496
I was.

509
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,732
Then I got hungry,
so I went to Mama Chows.

510
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,035
For dim sum?
Your favorite.

511
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,404
And to remind myself
of something.

512
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,406
What?

513
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:30,214
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

514
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:34,051
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

515
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,888
Katie Rogers.
She was a dancer.

516
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,124
We had plans to meet
at Mama Chows,

517
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,458
but she texted me.

518
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,926
She pulled a hamstring
and had to cancel.

519
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,496
Oh, those fragile dancers.

520
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,833
I was bummed 'cause I was
looking forward to it.

521
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,903
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home

522
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:57,107
when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

523
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,876
Your backpack.

524
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,812
And I arrested him.

525
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,448
That's how you and I met.

526
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,950
I remember.

527
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,020
Someone just told me how
powerful a coincidence can be,

528
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,124
and it made me realize how many
coincidences had to happen

529
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,027
for you and I to get together...

530
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,264
in this time.

531
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:24,034
We've all been so focused on
Barry's destiny,

532
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,104
I forgot that I have one too.

533
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,010
And it's you.

534
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:36,146
Iris West,

535
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:40,851
every moment of my life
led to meeting you.

536
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,456
Screw the future.

537
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,194
Screw the future.

538
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,901
Is this actually binding?

539
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,672
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

540
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,641
This will be "legit,"
as the kids say.

541
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,076
No kids say that.

542
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,277
Let's not fight
on our wedding day.

If it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.

546
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,625
I've learned a lot

547
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,995
about merging one's life
with another this past year.

548
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,799
Yet, for all the incredible
advancements in science

549
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,400
we've all been party to,

550
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:34,171
the mystery that brings
two people together through love

551
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,907
is still the province of magic.

552
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,509

I don't need one.

559
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,562
I have everything
and everyone

560
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,499

right here.

561
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,600
And...

562
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,469

of the past year

563
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:09,039

00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,109
it was worth it.

00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,344
I love you, Ronnie.

566
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,680
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

567
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,248
You may kiss the bride.

568
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,716

There are gonna be three yous
back there...

576
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,445
The you from the future

577
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,847
who saved younger you
from the Reverse-Flash

578
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,181
and now<i> you</i> you.

579
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:55,118
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there,

580
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,654
and then you can go
and save your mom.

581
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,123
Piece of cake.

582
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,459
May the Speed Force
be with you.

583
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,199
Good-bye, Dad.

584
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,372
Good-bye, Son.

585
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,642
Iris...

586
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,311
You don't have
to say anything.

587
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,913
I already know.

588
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,288
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you.

589
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,457
That it makes
you happy.

590
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,558
You too.

591
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,880
Remember, Mr. Allen,

592
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,549
assuming you achieve the proper
velocity and open the wormhole,

593
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,719
you will only have
1 minute and 52 seconds

594
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,755
to save your mother
and return.

595
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,757
Or else...

596
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,224
I know.

597
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,562
Well...

598
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:16,266
you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

599
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,902
And I know you can do it.

600
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,237
Now...

601
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,040
Run...

602
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,142
Barry.

603
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,443
Run.

604
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,221
The accelerator's structural
integrity is holding.

605
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,057
What was that?

606
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,258
Is Barry okay?

607
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,695
Yeah.
He just passed Mach Two.

608
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,740
I was waiting for you
to bring Barry home.

609
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:00,677
Looks like he's going to be
staying with us for a while.

610
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,113
Barry, what you're seeing is
the Speed Force:

611
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,283
your past, you present,
your future

612
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,818
all at once.

613
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,421
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

614
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,890
So think about...

615
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,926
that night.

616
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:19,730
Think about your mother.

617
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:23,033
Time for bed.
Good night, slugger.

618
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,535
Mom!

619
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,008
It's working.

620
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,479
It's working.

621
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,349
Inject the hydrogen particle
now.

622
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,088
What's that?
What happened?

623
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,356
Barry... he's gone.

624
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,225
- Look.
- The wormhole.

625
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,993
And it's stable.
Start the clock.

626
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,581
Mom!

627
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,083
Mom!

628
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,085
Barry!

629
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,819
Mom!

630
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:21,391
Nora! Hold on!

631
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:33,970
Run, Barry, run!

632
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,108
Barry, no!

633
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,712
No, no, no!

634
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,338
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

635
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,607
Please. My husband,
my son, are they...

636
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,409
They're okay.

637
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,944
They're both safe.

638
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,713
I promise.

639
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,748
Who are you?

640
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,017
I'm...

641
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,156
I'm The Flash.

642
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,924
I don't understand.

643
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,973
You look
just like my father.

644
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,448
This won't make
any sense,

645
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,917
but it's me, Mom.

646
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,786
It's Barry.

647
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:57,788
Barry?

648
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,222
Your Barry.

649
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,991
Oh, my beautiful boy.

650
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,064
I got a second chance

651
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,067
to come back here and...

652
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,640
Tell you that I'm okay.

653
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:20,577
Dad and I are
both okay.

654
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,314
And we love you, Mom.

655
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,917
I love you.

656
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,419
I love you.

657
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,856
Oh, my sweet boy.

658
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:36,126
Bye. Good-bye.

659
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:39,462
Good-bye, Barry.

660
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,632
Mom.

661
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,569
Mom.

662
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,794
I believe it's time to
say good-bye to Harrison Wells.

663
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,768
It's beautiful.

664
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,705
Rip Hunter would
be impressed.

665
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,907
He built
the first one of these.

666
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,542
Interesting man.

667
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,715
Now what the hell
is that?

668
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,917
That's my cue to leave.

669
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,456
Thank you, Cisco.

670
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,491
Don't ever come back.

671
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,083
30 seconds.

672
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,726
Home.

673
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,874
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

674
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,176
We have to shut down
the wormhole quickly!

675
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,046
Caitlin!

676
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,055
You didn't save her.

677
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,690
Why?

678
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:47,991
Why?

679
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,627
You could have had
the life you wanted.

680
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,863
You could have had
everything you ever wanted!

681
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,900
I already do.

682
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,639
Not for long.

683
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,777
Cut the internal generators.

684
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,048
Ten seconds, hurry.

685
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,065
Three, two, one.

686
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,369
Ronnie, are you okay?

687
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,703
Did you do it?

688
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,205
Yes, I turned them
all off.

689
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,210
They did it.
They cut the generator.

690
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,683
Just so we're clear,

691
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,118
after I kill you,

692
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,786
I'm going to kill them.

693
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,055
And then I'm going
to kill your father.

694
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,225
I always win, Flash.

695
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,300
Eddie! Oh, my...

696
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,003
Eddie!

697
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,638
What did you do?

698
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,878
What did you do?
What did you do?

699
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,747
No such thing
as a coincidence.

700
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,085
What's happening?

701
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,720
Cisco, help me.

702
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:26,289
Eddie's his ancestor.

703
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,958
If Eddie dies,
he'll never be born, and...

704
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,263
He's being erased
from existence.

705
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,635
No! No!
Eddie.

706
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,236
Eddie, no, no.

707
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,306
Stay with me, okay?
Stay.

708
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,976
He was wrong,
it turns out.

709
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,678
I'm a hero after all.

710
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,748
You are, Eddie.
You are my hero.

711
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,151
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

712
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,719
Your hero.

713
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,561
No!

714
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:13,903
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

715
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,973
How will you get along
without me?

716
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,535
Guys, that's not good.

717
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,036
Professor, I shut down
the wormhole.

718
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,172
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

719
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,741
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

720
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,309
We got to go.

721
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,712
You okay?

722
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,146
Iris, we have to go.

723
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,816
I'm not leaving him.

724
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,385
We have to go now, honey.
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,637
So that's what
we didn't want to happen.

726
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,372
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

727
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:26,743
A singularity won't stop, not
even after the earth is gone.

728
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,465
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

729
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,467
What?

730
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,901
The diffuse material

731
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,670
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

732
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,704
What does that mean?

733
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,539
We have to disrupt the motion.

734
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,809
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

735
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,411
And bigger.

736
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,046
And scarier.

737
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:04,881
Barry, that event
has an energy level

738
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,417
of at least
6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

739
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,885
It cannot be stopped.

740
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,891
I have to try.

741
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,515
Oh, God.

742
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,618
Barry.

743
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,296
Move your head.
