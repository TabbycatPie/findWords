00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:17,025
When you're single, and your friends start to get married,

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,967
every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation:

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,163
"Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"

4
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,133
What it's really asking is,

5
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,155
"Where do you see yourself in three months?

6
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:31,473
Sitting next to your girlfriend, or hitting on a bridesmaid?"

7
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,408
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.

8
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:35,887
I was an optimist.

9
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:40,326
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?

10
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,926
Ted, have you ignored all my teachings?

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,282
For the most part, yeah.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,743
No, you don't bring a date to a wedding.

13
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,287
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.

14
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,129
Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted. No-- no date.

15
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:53,841
Deer carcass? Really? That's the metaphor you're going with here?

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,458
Ted, it's a simile.

17
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:57,780
Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date,

18
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,930
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.

19
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,591
I got to bring someone, but who?

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,516
Of course, I knew who I wanted to bring.

21
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:08,194
Robin-- the big unanswered question in my life.

22
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,834
Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.

23
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:13,658
Derek.

24
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:17,392
Well, Derek and I just broke up.

25
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,917
Oh, no, that's terrible! Are you okay?

26
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:21,442
Yeah, do you need a drink or something?

27
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,266
Nah... We never really clicked.

28
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,268
I felt bad, though. He was pretty bummed.

29
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,743
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

30
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,292
He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.

31
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:33,108
He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.

32
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:35,526
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

33
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,415
I think I'll get that drink now.

34
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,589
Okay, guys, I got to say something.

35
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:45,194
I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.

36
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:49,945
Oh, please-- they were buried in a shallow grave.

37
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,096
Not again. Come on. Dude?

38
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,715
We all know how this movie ends.

39
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:58,142
Ted falls in love, love kicks Ted in the sprouts, roll credits.

40
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,840
No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture.

41
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:01,915
Fact:

42
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:04,283
Robin was into me when we first met.

43
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:05,679
Fact:

44
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:09,020
Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof.

45
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:10,464
Fact:

46
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:13,118
On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.

47
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:14,239
Fact:

48
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:16,025
I need a date to this wedding.

49
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,177
Wish me luck.

50
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,829
What I don't get is why is Claudia marrying Stuart?

51
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,614
She's way hotter than him.

52
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:24,792
How way?

53
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,505
Way way.

54
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:30,412
This wedding does sound pretty amazing, though.

55
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,613
Fancy hotel ballroom,

56
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,308
everybody all dressed up...

57
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,091
Oh, here we go.

58
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:36,689
What?

59
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,645
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans

60
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:41,804
because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.

61
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,291
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.

62
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,184
I thought so.

63
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:48,452
You know what? Excuse me if I don't want to get married

64
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:52,402
barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-One's-Going-To-Drive-That-Far.

65
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,621
Yes. I want a ballroom,

66
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,338
and I want a band, and I want shoes.

67
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,333
I've been dreaming about this day since I was, like...

68
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,998
A little girl?

69
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,513
What up!

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,466
Okay. I'm just saying that it's my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.

71
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,544
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.

72
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:12,902
Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.

73
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:14,989
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.

74
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,728
I mean, seriously-- Claudia and Stuart?

75
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:22,440
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness,

76
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,085
but, you know, I was drunk.

77
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,904
There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.

78
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:31,516
You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship

79
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,908
is to celebrate someone else's successful one.

80
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,551
Oh, it makes sense.

81
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,791
So, with that in mind, uh, our friends Claudia and Stuart

82
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,224
are having this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.

83
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,988
You want to be my plus one?

84
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,413
Ooh... "Plus one." You make it sound so romantic.

85
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:47,518
Fine.

86
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,633
You want to be my date?

87
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,313
Your date?

88
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:54,423
I'd love to.

89
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,825
How fancy are we talking about here?

90
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,577
Oh, you're going to want to bring your "A" game.

91
00:03:58,663 --> 00:03:59,773
Oh, I'll bring it.

92
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,185
I'll bring it so hard, the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.

93
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,902
Lily? I need a dress.

94
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,738
You're going? That's awesome!

95
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:10,631
Oh, my God-- four days to find a dress?

96
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,304
I know, it's a suicide mission.

97
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:16,297
Well, if we leave now... we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it!

98
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,416
Bye, babe.

99
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:21,242
Whoa! Did you see how fired up she was?

100
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:22,836
I don't know, there's something there.

101
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:26,347
And, come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne...

102
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,104
Who  knows?

103
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:29,745
Wow. Ted, you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,

104
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:32,227
'cause I'm revoking your "dude" membership.

105
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,795
Yeah... how was that manicure yesterday?

106
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,027
Invigorating, thanks.

107
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,111
Okay, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,

108
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,805
but  back then I really thought that's how it worked.

109
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,934
You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting...

110
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,090
the stars line up...

111
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,561
and shazam.

112
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,551
I know now that life is never that simple.

113
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:04,690
Hey, Claudia!

114
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,353
Yes, I want Tahitian Vanilla! You wrote it down wrong?

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,896
No, no, no, no, listen to me--

116
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,536
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian Vanilla,

117
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,959
I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground!

118
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,858
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?

119
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:18,771
Yeah, good-bye.

120
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,346
Hey!

121
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:23,887
How's it going?

122
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,464
My wedding is in two days, that's how it's going.

123
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,018
Oh, don't worry, it's going to be great. I'm so excited.

124
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:30,911
Well, you should be-- lots of single girls.

125
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:35,698
Oh, well, yeah, I'm... bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.

126
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,541
What?

127
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm bringing a date.

128
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,300
You're not bringing a date.

129
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:41,020
Uh... yes, I am.

130
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,248
Uh, no, you're not.

131
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,235
I checked "plus one."

132
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:45,398
No, you didn't.

133
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,616
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...

134
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,363
Ted, you did not check "plus one"!

135
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,256
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

136
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,759
Wait, I've already invited someone.

137
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,483
You are not bringing a guest, Ted!

138
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,774
The guest list has been closed for months-- months!

139
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,477
But I checked "plus one"! I always check "plus one"!

140
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,739
You absolutely did not check "plus one"!

141
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,031
If you had checked "plus one," I would have called you to get the name of your guest,

142
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,629
so I could have the place cards printed up.

143
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,972
Did I call you to get the name of your guest?

144
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,892
Is there a place card with her name printed on it?

145
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,363
She doesn't need a place card. She knows her name.

146
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,907
What's she eating?! Huh?! You ordered the chicken. What did she order?

147
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,396
Do you see how your story is full of holes?

148
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,006
Come on, Claudia, we go way back.

149
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,992
Isn't there room for just one more person?

150
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,986
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.

151
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,881
I don't believe this! Claudia's crazy!

152
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,843
But, to be fair, she's also hot.

153
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,159
I totally checked "plus one." I'm sure I did.

154
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:36,445
- Yeah, right.
- I did!

155
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:38,859
Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why?

156
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,561
Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

157
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:46,383
See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down, you're single.

158
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,153
It's your default setting.

159
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,002
Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?

160
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,292
Oh, great, here comes the little Barney speech.

161
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:58,000
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?

162
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,224
- A little Barney...
- A little Barney.

163
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:02,256
A little Barney.

164
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,790
And you know what he said?

165
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:08,918
"Ted... you will bring no dates to this wedding.

166
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:13,799
You... will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."

167
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,599
Wow. Please stop.

168
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,047
I got to call Claudia. If I just explain to her...

169
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,932
Ted, no! Let it go.

170
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,392
She's about to get married, she's got enough to worry about.

171
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:23,743
Then what am I going to do?

172
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,286
The only thing you can do-- tell Robin she can't come.

173
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,582
Just a second!

174
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,553
- Hey!
- Hey. Listen...

175
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,419
Wait, two things. First of all... I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.

176
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,708
Totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging, just:

177
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,068
the theme of today is, "Ted rocks."

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,914
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

179
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,165
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no.

180
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,241
Thing number two: the dress.

181
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:52,805
We got a dress.

182
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,293
Go.

183
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,766
Well?

184
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:03,581
Did I bring it, or... did I bring it?

185
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,084
I think I brought it.

186
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,616
Wow.

187
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:09,817
That's what I was going for.

188
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:13,182
I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun.

189
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,007
Yeah, about that...

190
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:19,023
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

191
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,428
So? The dress?

192
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,443
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.

193
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:28,239
What?

194
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,529
I ran into Claudia, and she told me I didn't check "plus one" on the reply card.

195
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:34,275
- Why didn't you check "plus..."?
- I did check "plus one."

196
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:36,760
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.

197
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,131
-  And the dress!
- I know.

198
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,871
Okay, okay. Well, we'll sneak her in.

199
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,390
We can't sneak her in, we're not Ninjas.

200
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,871
- Oh, I wish we were Ninjas.
- I know.

201
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,121
You could always ask Stuart.

202
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:51,143
Can I do that?

203
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,115
Well,  sure.

204
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,450
You guys have been friends for a long time.

205
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:56,947
And it's 40% his wedding, too.

206
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:00,298
I don't know... it's going to be a tough sell.

207
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:02,296
Dude, no problem whatsoever.

208
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:03,014
Really?

209
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,747
Sure, the more, the merrier.

210
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,316
Wow! Wow, thanks for being so cool about this,

211
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,735
'cause you know, Claudia said...

212
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,348
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This morning at the rehearsal,

213
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:13,614
Claudia called our seven-year-old flower girl a whore.

214
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,595
So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.

215
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,350
Yeah, she's not usually like that.

216
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,409
No.

217
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,496
Well, thanks, Stu!

218
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,660
It's going to be a great wedding.

219
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:30,950
Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting

220
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,581
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.

221
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:36,459
Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods,

222
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,282
like a couple of squirrels.

223
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,021
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.

224
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,782
Like you could possibly know that.

225
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,742
I did it. I did it-- I'm taking her to the wedding.

226
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,634
Nice!

227
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:49,511
What? How?

228
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,738
I talked to Stuart.

229
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,233
You went around the bride.

230
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,858
"Oh, this hornets' nest looks harmless.

231
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,079
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.

232
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,132
Oh, look, some Gremlins. Let me go feed them after midnight!"

233
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,625
Did you know about this?

234
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,394
It may have been my idea.

235
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:06,872
What?

236
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,881
Stuart doesn't get a say?

237
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,114
Ah! So you admit it-- the groom should have an equal say.

238
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:15,633
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.

239
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,812
So I can invite whoever I want?

240
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,204
Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.

241
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,509
It's Claudia.

242
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,278
So it begins.

243
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,918
Come on, it can't be that bad.

244
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:31,184
Here, Lily, you answer it.

245
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,302
What? Why?

246
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:33,943
Because this whole thing was your idea.

247
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,156
And... Claudia scares me.

248
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,332
But... but you're the... But I just want to...

249
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,014
Ted's phone.

250
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:41,973
Oh, hi, Claudia.

251
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,786
What?

252
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:48,163
Now I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it went something like this...

253
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:50,265
Oh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him

254
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,007
he could bring his date to the wedding.

255
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:53,601
You what?

256
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,369
...always undermining me at every turn...

257
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:04,606
...try to show a little flexibility, but no!

258
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,089
It's all about you!

259
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,913
...and your mother...

260
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,339
You know what?

261
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,790
The wedding's off!

262
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,403
They broke up!

263
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:22,481
O w!

264
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,086
It's not because of me, is it?

265
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,974
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!

266
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,909
Oh, he's going to kill me!

267
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,788
And then he's gonna kill Ted!

268
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,842
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

269
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,007
It's Robin.

270
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,160
Answer it!

271
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:39,603
Uh, Lily's phone.

272
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:43,598
Ted, where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.

273
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,600
Uh, Lily's busy.

274
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:49,787
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's going to love them.

275
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:52,068
That's great, I'll tell Lily to tell me.

276
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,292
Uh, listen, I really want to keep talking, um, but now's not a good time,

277
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,704
so I'm really excited about tomorrow, okay, bye.

278
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:58,333
Okay, bye.

279
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,397
Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this.

280
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,453
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus!

281
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,860
Okay, okay, sweetie, just calm down.

282
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,523
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

283
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,719
I want to go somewhere and drink!

284
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,673
Okay, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.

285
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:16,789
Oh, I feel terrible.

286
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:19,265
Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this.

287
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:21,060
Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia.

288
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:23,730
Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.

289
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:25,504
Um, tell Claudia I'm sorry.

290
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:26,720
Did she seem pissed at me?

291
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:31,381
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.

292
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,712
What say we get these crazy kids back together?

293
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:41,485
Hi, sad eyes.

294
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,407
What's got you down?

295
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,911
Stuart and I just broke up.

296
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:52,457
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's...

297
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,258
Two vodka cranberries, please.

298
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,854
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.

299
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,186
Remember?

300
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,883
When it comes to you, how can I forget?

301
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,380
They all drink vodka cranberries.

302
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:12,146
So... is there anything else you need... sweetie?

303
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,348
You got $400,000?

304
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:16,500
No.

305
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,652
But I do have a hug.

306
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,362
Thank you.

307
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,443
Stuart, I-I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...

308
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,232
Ted, for all I know, you did me the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.

309
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,057
Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.

310
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:39,476
No, I do-- this whole thing has made me realize I miss being single.

311
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:42,755
I miss staying out late, and making messes and not cleaning them up.

312
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,235
I miss owning porn.

313
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:45,909
Dude, who doesn't?

314
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,184
And you know, I'll see some super-hot model chick, and I'll think,

315
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,000
"Why am I with Claudia? I could be with her."

316
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,518
That's just crazy!

317
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,449
I mean... you're the luckiest... You and Claudia both...

318
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,050
The point is I want to get married. I want to settle down,

319
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,851
but right now, that's just not who I am.

320
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,936
I'm not a commitment guy; I'm a single guy.

321
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,623
Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other.

322
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,194
Everybody feels this way sometimes.

323
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,548
Relationships aren't easy; they're hard work.

324
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:15,124
It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap.

325
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:16,753
How would you know? You're not even married.

326
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,998
Okay, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily.

327
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,741
He's the pro-- this guy knows relationships.

328
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:22,830
Tell him, Marshall.

329
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:25,846
Stuart, don't get married.

330
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:26,965
- Dude...
- What?

331
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:28,121
Look, I'm sorry.

332
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:33,438
Being in a couple is hard. And committing, making sacrifices, it's hard.

333
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,233
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

334
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,862
Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life,

335
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:42,192
that should be the easiest thing in the world, and if it's not like that,

336
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:45,763
then she's not the one. I'm sorry.

337
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,679
You  know I don't have $400,000, right?

338
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:57,088
Maybe we got together too young.

339
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,621
Maybe that's what the problem was.

340
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:03,409
I mean, I'm 28 years old,

341
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,072
and I've really only ever been with one man.

342
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:11,148
That's just, that's...

343
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:14,162
Two more vodka cranberries, please!

344
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:19,599
Claudia... it's all gonna be okay.

345
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:23,638
Oh, thanks for listening, Barney.

346
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,084
It really means a lot to me.

347
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:30,889
Isn't it weird that we should... run into each other like this?

348
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:36,180
Two souls, of equal levels of attractiveness,

349
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:42,549
both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

350
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,574
- Oh, hell, no!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

351
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,591
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

352
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:54,022
and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her,

353
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,935
I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles,

354
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,556
and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out,

355
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:02,157
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes!

356
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,674
Wait, my eyes or my testicles?

357
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,048
One of each.

358
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,306
All right! All right!

359
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:09,600
Claudia?

360
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,714
Stuart.

361
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:12,924
I'm so sorry.

362
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:14,342
I'm so sorry, too.

363
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,428
I love you.

364
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:16,967
I love you too, babe.

365
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,809
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

366
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,859
And when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize I...

367
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:22,741
Marshall said what?!

368
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,715
It's more complicated than that!

369
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,269
He made me realize how much I love you.

370
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,027
These guys got us back together.

371
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,617
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

372
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:47,024
So where did we land on the whole plus one thing?

373
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,303
No, no, no, no!

374
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:53,531
It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia,

375
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:57,392
but, eventually, she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.

376
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,809
Still wow.

377
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,779
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.

378
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,942
Oh, yeah. I thought about leaving it at home,

379
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,405
but I figured I don't want to get there and realize I need it

380
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,359
and have to go all the way back to get it. So, yeah, I brought it.

381
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:16,546
Oh, sorry.

382
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,848
Hello?

383
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,107
Oh, my God. Tonight?

384
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:25,313
You're kidding.

385
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,348
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

386
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:28,991
Really?

387
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:31,502
Like anchor anchor?

388
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,909
What happened to Sandy?

389
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,307
Okay.

390
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:39,148
Okay. Sure. What time do you need me to...

391
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,451
Right now?! Oh.

392
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,591
Do it.

393
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,781
Do it.

394
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:53,806
Okay, I need like five minutes to change, and, um, I'll call you from the cab...

395
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:04,767
So admit it.

396
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:08,559
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

397
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:11,599
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.

398
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:12,809
The crab puffs were incredible.

399
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,599
We should totally have them at our wedding.

400
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,646
Definitely...

401
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,024
Hey. We just agreed on something.

402
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,834
Did we just start planning our wedding?

403
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,156
I think that we did.

404
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,166
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.

405
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,858
Ooh, I thought the red sauce was, like, awesome.

406
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,001
My God, were you born without taste buds?

407
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,193
What?

408
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,176
I love you.

409
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:47,737
Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls?

410
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,892
The answer may surprise you... after the break.

411
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,119
Man, you know something? Stuart's my new hero.

412
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,190
If that dude can bag a nine,

413
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,032
I got to be able to bag, like, a 16.

414
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,359
What's a 16?

415
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,366
Those two eights right over there.

416
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,293
Yeah.

417
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,504
Hi, Ted.

418
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,549
Claudia.

419
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:18,912
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.

420
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,203
Yeah, where is she?

421
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,079
Um... she couldn't make it.

422
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,162
What's so funny?

423
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:30,749
Oh, plan a wedding. You'll see.

424
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,485
Look at that.

425
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,397
That's how it's supposed to be. That right there.

426
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,543
Easy, simple.

427
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,201
It's just not like that with Robin.

428
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:50,332
It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.

429
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,841
Speaking of easy... bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.

430
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:58,096
By the way, I almost forgot.

431
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,773
We found this.

432
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,900
I didn't check "plus one."

433
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,427
You were right.

434
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:09,994
Of course, I was right.

435
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,915
I'm single.

436
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:15,535
Maybe that's just who I am.

437
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,854
And you know what? I like being single.

438
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:18,730
Being single's the best.

439
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,623
Yeah, stay out as late as you want.

440
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:21,546
Answer to no one.

441
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:24,150
The whole world full of endless possibilities.

442
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:26,463
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

443
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:33,687
Okay. Ah... doing some math here.

444
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:37,716
Table six has got three bridesmaids: an eight, an eight, and a seven.

445
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:42,907
I am willing to give you one of the eights, lowering myself to a 15,

446
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,156
which means you owe me...

447
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:50,365
So there we were, two single guys, doing our usual single-guy thing.

448
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:55,008
For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point,

449
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:59,469
that this was the night my life-- my real life-- would finally begin.

450
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,385
The funny thing is...

451
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:03,360
I wasn't totally wrong.

452
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:13,561
Because that night was just beginning.

453
