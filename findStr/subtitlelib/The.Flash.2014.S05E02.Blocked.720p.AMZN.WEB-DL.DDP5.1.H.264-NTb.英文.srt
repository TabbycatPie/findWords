17
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,370
Previously on The Flash

19
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,820
You never come back.

20
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,310
You are not stuck here, are you?

21
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,450
- Bye, Cisco. - Bye, Sandy.

22
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,890
My father's death certificate.

23
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,020
The ME who signed off on it, he doesn't exist.

24
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,560
- So this death certificate... - Is a fake.

25
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,610
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

26
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,260
For all of you

27
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,080
to die.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,580
What the...

29
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,530
Damn, man.

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,130
Another fight?

31
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,880
Yeah.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,560
I'd hate to see the other guy.

33
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,550
See you on the floor.

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,440
So you're not stuck here.

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,240
No, I'm not.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,370
So they will reverse tachyons in your system?

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,650
Were put there because of me.

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,420
Are you kidding?

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,480
You know how many credit card points I just blew just

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,460
trying to get rid of your negative tachyons?

43
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,630
I just bought a brand new spectral tachyeometer

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,870
when I could have my Fiji get away.

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,130
Not that I have anyone to go with, anymore.

46
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm not taking you to Fiji, Ralph.

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,090
Why didn't you guys tell us about this before?

49
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,530
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,330
Barry never returns?

51
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,170
That's why you came here.

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,100
To see you father,

53
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,170
because you were raised without him.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,920
So what?

55
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,010
Iris.

56
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,910
So what that article says that you never come back.

57
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,190
So what if the other one says that you vanished.

58
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,040
I mean, it's said other things before, right?

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,470
We made it say other things before.

60
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,980
So whatever the future brings

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,340
we are gonna deal with it when it gets here.

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,170
And change it if we need to.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,260
She has a point.

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,760
If there's anything Team Flash is good at,

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,440
it's handing the future its own ass and then some.

66
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,910
What he said.

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,160
Well, looks like Nora's

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,010
gonna need more training after all.

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,780
Oh, okay. She's hungry.

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, why don't we,

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,860
all meet back at S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?

72
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,300
Wow, first you meet your adult daughter from the future

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,480
and now this.

74
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,120
I mean, it's a lot.

75
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,620
Yeah.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,520
Well, I guess now I know why

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,160
she never wants to leave her dad's side

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,530
and why she...

79
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,870
never wants to be by mine.

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,250
Nora will reach out at some point.

81
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,000
The trick is you gotta keep yourself busy.

82
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,940
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,660
Joe!

84
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,790
Cecile? Cecile, what's wrong?

85
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,090
I can't hear what she wants.

86
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,300
I can't hear anything.

87
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,010
I think I'm losing my powers.

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,970
Hey babe, it's me,

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,700
just checking in, for my dad.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,800
He...

91
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,550
- Hello there. - Hey.

92
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,720
- What are you doing? - I was just trying to get

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,540
Barry's new suit into this ring.

94
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,980
Oh, it's--it's tiny.

95
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,780
Yeah, you weren't watching old holograms of Gipsy.

96
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,240
- Why would I be doing that? - Because you miss her.

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,300
We just had something so special.

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,650
Shouldn't it have work?

99
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,410
Of course now it's not so special anymore

100
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,180
now she's just rattlin' around inside my head.

101
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,310
I'm sorry this is so hard for you.

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,200
But it's okay that you are still thinking about her.

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,960
I don't think you understand, Caitlin.

104
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,510
I mean, she's literally...

105
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,830
inside my head.

106
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,800
I can't vibe.

107
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,530
Everything I vibe connects to her.

108
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,960
I put some music on, I hear her voice singing along.

109
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,390
I'm painting my figurines, I see her face

110
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,360
on Captains Kirk's body. Shh...

111
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,780
Do you smell that?

112
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,240
Of course you don't.

113
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,370
'Cause that's her perfume and I'm only one smelling it.

114
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,890
Of course. Your powers linked you guys

115
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,370
over pan-dimensional spacetime, so it makes complete sense

116
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,570
that your vibes echoes would still be...

117
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,020
Connecting us to each other.

118
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,030
Yes, I know. Thank you for the diagnosis.

119
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,610
I'm sorry. You don't need a doctor.

120
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,850
You need a friend.

121
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,860
I'm sorry. I'm just...

122
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,870
I'm a mess.

123
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,880
Oh, perfect. Been looking for you two.

124
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,870
We need to talk.

125
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,260
I've hit a real wall trying to figure out

126
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,610
who forged this death certificate,

127
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,660
so I was thinking maybe Cisco could give this

128
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,900
a little bit of a...

129
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,940
Cisco is not available right now.

130
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,480
Please leave a message.

131
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,180
Oh, hey, Cisco, it's Ralph.

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,930
Hope you are doing well. Just get back to me.

133
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,620
I need to vibe this as soon as possible.

134
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,780
Bye, bye.

135
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,510
Ralph, Cisco can't vibe right now,

136
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,960
so we're just gonna have to deal with this a little later.

137
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,800
Why can't he vibe right now? What's going on?

138
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,160
Because we need to help him get over Gipsy.

139
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,380
I mean, like you said, Cisco get his vibe back,

140
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,890
- we can crack this case. - Please, stop caring about me.

141
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,080
Ralph, I mean, you don't have any ideas about

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,830
how to help a man get over a heartbreak, do you?

143
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,880
Oh, my God, you stop it, girl.

144
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,610
You know I have plenty.

145
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,820
Cisco, you wanna know why I'm perfect guy

146
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,850
to help you get over this and get back into the game of love?

147
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,560
Because trust me, buddy, nobody, I mean nobody,

148
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,020
has been kicked out of that more than me.

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,570
- Hello, Bobby. - Vanessa Jansen.

150
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,230
You got out of the slammer.

151
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,250
Now I'm gonna loosen up that chokehold

152
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,040
you and that punk-ass brother of yours

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,430
have on all the big arms deals in this city.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,650
I don't think so.

155
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,190
What the hell?

156
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you know what four years in Iron Heights

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,420
will do to you, Bobby?

158
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,230
It makes you very, very, angry.

159
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,540
Vanessa, you ain't gonna do this.

160
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,220
Vanessa, please.

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,150
So this is where the Moretti brothers have been running guns.

162
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,060
Yeah.

163
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,740
Stealing from these guys takes some cojones.

164
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,020
Any idea who our bold thieve might be?

165
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,890
Not yet. Made my rounds too.

166
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,020
So far the only prints belong to Bobby and Bruno Moretti.

167
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,690
Well, whoever did this,

168
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,130
they're running fast and loose.

169
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,570
If we don't stop this,

170
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,050
a lot of high powered weapons are gonna flood the streets.

171
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,010
Central City is gonna be a war zone.

172
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,440
Don't worry about the city, friend.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,810
CCPD's finest are on the case.

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,860
- And you are... - Nora, CSI intern.

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,990
- Who are you? - The captain of CCPD.

176
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,230
Captain David Singh. Oh I've read so much about you.

177
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,770
It's really nice to meet you.

178
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,950
You hired an intern, Allen?

179
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,710
I am very sorry, sir,

180
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,910
but I needed help with,

181
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,390
the cases that accumulated while I was suspended

182
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,580
and you said the Mayor wasn't going

183
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
to give us any money to help solve them,

184
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,420
so I hired an intern to help for free.

185
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,530
Well, make her official when you get back.

186
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,590
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,120
I know you're surprised to see me

188
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,500
but I found this badge and this jacket and thought,

189
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,960
"I'm a CSI too" so I should help my dad.

190
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,840
Right, okay.

191
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,460
You said you were still a rookie, right?

192
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,510
Well, yeah, but forensic sciences in the future

193
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,870
is like way advance,

194
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,620
so I can totally handle a robbery scene.

195
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,660
- Like, not a prob. - Ah, got you.

196
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,590
- That's great. - What is that?

197
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,300
That I haven't gotten to yet.

198
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,660
But it looks like somebody wanted their pound of flesh.

199
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,210
- Nora, wait. - Wha--

200
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,730
What are you doing? You can't touch that.

201
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,310
You'll contaminate the evidence.

202
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,610
Sorry, you mean you don't have

203
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,070
a scene-wide modified bosonic frequency field

204
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,170
to avoid cross-contamination?

205
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,660
I don't even think we have some of those words yet.

206
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,730
Oops. Well.

207
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,240
It's just this seems way denser than human tissue.

208
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,240
Yeah, you're right, actually.

209
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,880
I can't even move this thing.

210
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,440
This isn't a pound of flesh. This is a whole human body.

211
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,280
That is so schway.

212
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,410
Let's hold off in telling the Mayor about this

213
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,590
until we have some more info.

214
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,730
She's still be upset about the Lang homicide.

215
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,000
Hey, Captain, did you mean Gridlock?

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,530
I thought he was locked up in Iron Heights.

217
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,440
Iris, it's a pleasure to see you.

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,490
Can we secure the crime scene, please?

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,280
You know I can't make a comment on the record.

220
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,780
Okay, well, how about off the record?

221
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,090
Just once and that's it, and only because it's you.

222
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,170
Okay.

223
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,090
While in transport to Iron Heights

224
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,570
the convoy was attacked.

225
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,060
Lang was killed by something strong.

226
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,090
- We think maybe a meta. - Were there any survivors?

227
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,990
Four guards, they are still in the hospital.

228
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,360
- So if you hear anything... - Yeah, I got you.

229
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Thanks.

230
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Put this away, and, hey.

231
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,700
- Here, put these on. - Okay.

232
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,640
You do have...

234
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,560
The Book of Ralph.

235
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,160
Yep, and we are gonna start with a page of Ralph

236
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,630
'cause he's nowhere near ready for this whole book.

238
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,440
"Ralph Dibny's 27 steps

239
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,590
to getting over the love of your life."

240
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,560
Are you kidding me with this?

241
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,300
We just want to help you get past Gipsy.

242
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,210
And if this has worked for Ralph--

243
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,480
Multiple times I will add.

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
Then I think it's worth trying.

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,010
Come on, what's step one?

246
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,470
Shark cage diving.

247
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,870
- What's step two? - Affirmations.

248
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,860
Okay.

249
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,250
Ralphy is kind. Ralphy is great.

251
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,510
Ralphy is a brilliant detective.

252
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,220
Yeah, buddy, I mean, I know all that.

253
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,300
But it works a lot better if you use your name instead.

254
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,260
Cisco is creative. Cisco is good.

255
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,790
Cisco is smarter than your average bear.

256
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,220
That's Yogi's. You stole Yogi's affirmation.

257
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,770
Yeah, I did, 'cause it's a winner.

258
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,890
You don't see him moping over any lady bears.

259
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,080
Okay, you know what, Caitlin? I changed my mind, all right?

260
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,100
I--I don't care about the Gipsy vibes.

261
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,420
I'll just muscle through them,

262
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,740
let's just help you with your thing

263
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,490
and just get me the hell out of here, please?

264
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,080
No, Cisco, after Ronnie and Jay

265
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,810
you helped me get back past it. Now it's my turn to help you.

266
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,090
Okay? So...

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,660
We don't have time to find ourselves in Thailand.

268
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,180
And we are certainly not watching "Beaches"

269
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,660
while painting each others toes.

270
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,950
That's a really important one, though.

271
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,030
But step twelve isn't so bad.

272
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,470
Holy Kafka.

273
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,230
Come on, Cisco, change is good.

274
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,680
No, no, no.

275
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,070
Change is pain.

276
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,290
It's not as painful as seeing you like this, buddy.

277
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,760
Fine.

278
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,080
Whatever you say, doc.

279
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,770
Officer Matthews?

280
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,210
Yes.

281
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,980
Hi, I'm Iris West-Allen.

282
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,040
I'm reporter, and I'm doing a story about William Lang.

283
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,770
- Gridlock. - Pardon?

284
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,920
You call him Gridlock.

285
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,210
In your blog I've read it. It's good.

286
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,540
Thanks.

287
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,560
I understand that you were part of the convoy

288
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,360
that was escorting him to Iron Heights when you were attacked.

289
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,040
- Something like that. - What do you mean?

290
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,540
I mean I really don't remember what happened.

291
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,940
One minute I was in my vehicle there was a pile up,

292
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,710
I got out to see what's going on.

293
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,440
Everything went black.

294
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,700
Finally came to and Lang's laying there on the ground,

295
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,030
beaten to a pulp.

296
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,710
He was beaten to death?

297
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,670
Beaten, then stabbed.

298
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,620
- Was anyone else hurt? - No.

299
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,480
Everyone else on SWAT was concussed like me.

300
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,910
So, Lang was the only target?

301
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,280
Looks like it.

302
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,800
Thanks for your time.

303
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,980
Oh, hi, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey.

304
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,650
I just-I got a little too excited.

305
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,470
Okay, guess what?

306
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,580
You know my powers have been fading in and out.

307
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,140
Mostly out.

308
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,510
Well, I am definitely losing them.

309
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,800
You weren't that excited about that this morning.

310
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
No. No, I was not.

311
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,600
But I'm excited now because I have a fix.

312
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,940
I have a fix!

313
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,230
Mental activity dampener 2.0.

314
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,500
2.0
2.0.

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,540
Harry altered it so that you can hear the thoughts

316
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,190
of whoever is wearing it.

317
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,890
And why would we wanna do that?

318
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,430
So we can make sure it works before we put it on Jenna.

319
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,610
Oh, honey, it's completely safe,

320
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,820
Harry used it on his own daughter,

321
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,780
It doesn't mean we have to use it on ours.

322
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
Oh, ok--okay. Honey, listen.

323
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,270
I have had a constant

324
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,210
telepathic connection to our child

325
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,000
since before she was born.

326
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,110
It's been constant.

327
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,400
Babe, now when she cries half the time I don't know why.

328
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,450
Look, she's an infant.

329
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,910
They cry and you always get to know why.

330
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,810
No, not... me.

331
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,410
You don't understand.

332
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,890
I haven't been the mother to a newborn in a long time.

333
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,130
When I got pregnant, baby, I was so scared.

334
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,360
But then I got powers.

335
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,050
These powers that...

336
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,020
gave me a chance to be a perfect parent.

337
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,330
The parent that our child deserves.

338
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,620
And now they're going away?

339
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,170
I'm scared I can't live up to that.

340
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,830
I know you're struggling, babe.

341
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,460
But that device...

342
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,460
isn't the solution.

343
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,470
We'll figure out, okay? -

344
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,720
But...

345
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,390
I got it.

346
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,620
These old-timey computers

347
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,180
are even slower than the ones in storage at the Flash Museum.

348
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,730
DNA analysis used to take a lot longer

349
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,350
even just ten years ago.

350
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,520
So, Mom took the news about you being gone

351
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,140
better than I thought she would.

352
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,860
Iris is as tough as they come.

353
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,330
I'm sure you know that.

354
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,350
Got a match. Vanessa Jansen.

356
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,010
Low level weapon dealer

357
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,550
affiliated with the East Street Skulls gang.

358
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,060
I ran into a couple of them when I was in prison.

359
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,520
You were in prison?

360
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,690
That wasn't in the museum.

361
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,210
The Skulls make the Hell's Angels

362
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,100
look like a knitting club, drug trafficking,

363
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,940
armed robbery.

364
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,000
Any places Jansen's known to frequent?

365
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,360
East Street Auto Haven.

366
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,270
Looks like it's probably a front for Skull's activities.

367
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,030
Yes, time to take down my first baddie!

368
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,250
With your permission, of course.

369
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,880
Let's do it.

370
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,410
What is the hold up? These you are gonna move fast.

371
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,410
Well, I guess, I heard right.

372
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,550
You got something you're selling.

373
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,580
Too late, another interested customer just showed up.

374
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,110
You're looking to buy, Bruno?

375
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,900
From the broad who killed my brother and stole our stash?

376
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,960
This is way out of your league, Vanessa.

377
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,510
See, I would've agree with you...

378
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,980
before prison.

379
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,610
But then I got out and it hit me...

380
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,630
I'm tougher now, Bruno.

381
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,440
I got connections with people

382
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,270
that would pay big money for my weapons.

383
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,640
Except, they're not your weapons.

384
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,680
Like I said...

385
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,030
I'm tougher now.

386
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,970
All right, I'm gonna take Vanessa and the gangster.

387
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,340
Why don't you just scan the perimeter

388
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,210
for any back up she might have.

389
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,490
- I can do better than that. - What?

390
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,720
Whoa, what're you--

391
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,530
Crap.

392
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,550
Sorry, I can't let you hurt him.

393
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,810
Or take this.

394
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,000
Didn't know I was a meta.

395
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,930
Don't feel bad, it's my new look.

396
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,540
- Vanessa! - The Flash!

397
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,240
I guess I better put my hands up.

398
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,760
How long do you think it will--

399
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,670
I think Nora is good to go.

400
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,600
She didn't even need an Ibuprofen.

401
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,950
- You sure you feel okay? - I'm totally okay.

402
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,790
Come on, let's get back to work, Flash.

403
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,560
Okay.

404
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,470
All right, well let's figure out where Vanessa went.

405
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,280
If she sells those stolen weapons to the wrong people I--

406
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,830
Um, Cisco, were you able to get the satellite

407
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,950
up and running? Cisco?

408
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,530
We weren't able to track Vanessa,

409
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,410
but we did find a scientific anomaly

410
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,440
that we've never seen before, right, Cisco?

411
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,900
- Han shot second. - That doesn't even make sense.

412
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,970
Ralph, it's you.

413
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,470
Sorry to lie like that, man.

414
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,450
We just-- we need the CCTV... - CCTV, yes.

415
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,940
Vanessa Jansen's concentrated air squares are dense

416
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,640
very dense, stupid dense.

417
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,790
The kind of dense reserved for

418
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,020
people who still believe--

419
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,750
in love.

420
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,480
I think what Cisco is trying to say

421
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,840
is that Vanessa can manipulate the movement of atoms

422
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,910
to created concentrated air molecules in cube form.

423
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,310
The space between the molecules is so compact that...

424
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,300
That there isn't enough room for a speedster

425
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,830
to vibrate through them.

426
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,080
What do you call someone who can compress air molecules

427
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,310
into solid blocks?

428
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,530
I don't know, Block.

429
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,460
So, I guess Cisco is still taking the Gipsy thing pretty hard?

430
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,350
Well, we're working on it.

431
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,440
But you can't expect real progress till you hit step 17.

432
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,400
It's this thing we're working on with Cisco.

433
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,550
You can do without us for a little while, right?

434
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,310
I mean, we are blind without our satellite

435
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,470
so we're just gonna have to wait

436
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,630
until Vanessa makes her next move anyway.

437
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,020
What about you? Gonna hang out here for a bit?

438
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,000
Actually, I am working on a lead.

439
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,230
Can I use your lab?

440
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,190
There's something I wanna follow up on.

441
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,730
- Yeah, of course. - Okay.

442
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,810
Okay.

443
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,160
Uh, what kind of training is this?

444
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,780
Well, speedsters need to know about physics,

445
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,500
aerodynamics, trajectory formulas.

446
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,190
And after your last encounter with Jansen,

447
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,810
I think is time for you to get back to basics.

448
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,820
- My training is math? - Yeah.

449
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,090
I think chapter one is probably a good place to start.

450
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,260
All right, you're in for a real treat.

451
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,960
He initially said no, but after I told him

452
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,690
that your cousin was John Stamos.

453
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,510
My cousin is not John Stamos.

454
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,980
He agreed to you on.

455
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,110
I proudly present my personal stylist, Bruce.

456
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,150
This guy does it all, hair, makeup.

457
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,550
He picks everything I wear.

458
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,670
- That explains that. - Come on.

459
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,290
Bruce is gonna help us accomplish step twelve.

460
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,770
Metamorphosis.

461
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,880
Does that mean you think there's something wrong with me?

462
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,840
Even a Ferrari needs a tune-up every once in a while.

463
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
This feels like purgatory.

464
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,710
You cut my hair, I cut you.

465
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,910
My work here is done.

466
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,130
So...

467
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,290
I hate it.

468
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,340
I hate it all.

469
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,660
Great, now that that's over and done with.

470
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,540
Why don't we focus on the death certificate?

471
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,190
Well, I mean, we need to vibe it.

472
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,590
Or we can ask Joe to do some good old fashion police work.

473
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,690
Did you ever think of that?

474
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,300
Let's not worry about it, okay?

475
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,490
No, I mean, it's a good idea. We'll just ah...

476
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,230
Let's give him a call.

477
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,040
Guys, stop. Seriously, cut it out!

478
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,950
Okay?

479
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,190
Forget about the death certificate

480
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,240
and let's just focus on helping our friend, okay?

481
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,940
I need a break.

482
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,680
Okay, so the key with Higgs particles isn't the math per se

483
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,470
but the effect they have on the mass of other particles.

484
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,140
- Yeah. - Question.

485
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,690
How would one go about performing a supersonic punch

486
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,510
on one of those particles?

487
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,160
- Nora. - Dad, I'm sorry,

488
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,110
but I already know all of this.

489
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,560
My high school textbooks had laws of physics

490
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,180
that this time hasn't even discover yet.

491
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,430
I don't need this kind of training.

492
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,690
I need to learn how to be like you.

493
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,300
What do you think it means to be like me?

494
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,750
You know, running so fast you can stop a tsunami.

495
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,490
Or vibrating something bigger than a plane.

496
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,010
Or how about defeating a Sand Demon

497
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,830
by throwing lighting at him.

498
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,400
Nora, look, all those things

499
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,180
are way behind your current skill level.

500
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,620
You gotta stick to what you can handle right now.

501
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,310
Uh, just because I'm your daughter

502
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,590
doesn't mean you have to baby me.

503
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,590
I can handle way more than you think.

504
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,730
Watch.

505
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,020
Dad!

506
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,180
- Dad, are you okay? - I'm okay.

507
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,210
I've been hit with lighting before.

508
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,250
- It's okay. - It's not okay.

509
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,650
I guess greatness isn't hereditary.

512
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,640
Body cam footage.

513
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,210
Officer Matthews.

514
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,860
Bingo!

515
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,850
What the hell was that?

516
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,070
Stay where you are. Freeze don't move.

517
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,280
What was that?

518
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,910
Hey, I need your help.

519
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,940
That's blunt.

520
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,930
Yeah, so Nora, isn't really spending any time with Iris.

521
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,840
So she's kind of with me all the time, you know?

522
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,540
And I've been training her a lot by myself

523
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,110
and I just don't get it.

524
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,260
I mean, it's like--

525
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,540
she keeps taking things on that she can't handle yet.

526
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,530
It's like she wants to go big for big sake

527
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,620
and I try to walk her back, but it's like she's not listening

528
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,780
to what I'm teaching her, you know?

529
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,180
It's actually that she hears the opposite

530
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,540
of what I'm saying. Why are you nodding?

531
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,020
Are you agreeing with me?

532
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,360
Do you remember your 4th grade science fair?

533
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,780
Yeah, but what does that have to do with this?

534
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,990
All you had to do is make a baking soda volcano.

535
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,570
- And what did you do? - I...

536
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,300
You built a robot with wheels,

537
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,790
pretty much set the gym on fire.

538
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,130
Almost got Mrs. Dumas too.

539
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,140
- But that was different. - How so?

540
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,810
That was the first year you took me in.

541
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,480
I mean, you took me when I had no one.

542
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,160
I looked up to you. I mean, you were my hero. I--

543
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,120
I really wanted to impress you.

544
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,850
Bar, all the information

545
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
this girl has on you comes from that museum.

546
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,980
There're literally statues

547
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,460
of you on pedestals.

548
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,160
How do you think she wants to impress her hero?

549
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,930
So what do I do?

550
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,850
Well, show her it's okay not to be perfect

551
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,140
coming out of the gate.

552
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,070
There's no shortcuts.

553
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,470
Takes time to get things right and that's not a failure.

554
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,640
That's life.

555
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,270
And also show her that no matter what

556
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,170
you're always gonna love her.

557
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,730
That's what parents do.

558
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,460
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Joe.

559
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,700
See you later.

560
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,050
What was that for?

561
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
Just 'cause.

562
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,830
I got her.

563
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,520
Yeah, you do.

564
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Ah, yes, the sugary pastry.

565
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,130
I think as far as avoiding your feelings goes,

566
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,390
cinnamon bun was a solid choice.

567
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,740
You look nice.

568
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,420
Yeah, well, I think Bruce burned all my clothes, so...

569
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,530
Why don't you want to investigate

570
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,580
your dad's death certificate?

571
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,550
Because...

572
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,210
if it's true...

573
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,030
if he has been alive this whole time...

574
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,850
It just means he didn't want to see me.

575
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,660
Sept. 2017,

576
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,870
accept that she isn't the love of your life

577
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,780
because if she were, she'd still be in it.

578
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,290
- Pretty deep for Ralph Dibny. - Yeah.

579
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,540
Granted it took him 26 swings before he could hit the ball.

580
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,260
I don't know...

581
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
I think he might of knocked out of the park with that one.

582
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,160
Gypsy isn't the one.

583
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,300
I know that.

584
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,340
And there's no amount of new clothes or...

585
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,850
crazy makeover distraction that can change that fact.

586
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,660
Because some truths you can only hide for so long.

587
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,660
The truth is, it's too late for me to change things with her.

588
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,550
But it's not too late for you.

589
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,480
It's not too late for you to change things with your dad.

590
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,690
But what if he doesn't want anything to do with me.

591
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,740
Maybe he doesn't.

592
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,620
but wouldn't you rather face that truth

593
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,110
instead of spending the rest of your life wondering?

594
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,010
- Is this part of my training? - Just watch.

595
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,980
- Schway, is that you? - Yeah.

596
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,870
A few weeks after I got my powers.

597
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,150
OG Flash. God, look at you move.

598
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,650
Yeah, just wait for it.

599
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,920
And this.

600
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,880
And this. Yeah.

601
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,780
It takes time to hone your skills, Nora.

602
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,670
You can't just can't just skip rungs on a ladder

603
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,510
or jump right to the big stuff. It's not how it works.

604
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,710
All right, that's enough of that.

605
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,920
Look, when you first got here

606
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,130
you said that you weren't a great speedster.

607
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,860
But obviously neither was I when I first started.

608
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,960
Um, do you think one day I will be great like you?

609
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,830
You punched out a satellite

610
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,610
while I was falling to the earth and on fire.

611
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,720
And you were moving so fast

612
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,730
even I couldn't see who you were.

613
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,520
- Yeah, that was pretty epic. - Yeah.

614
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,850
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you today.

615
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,880
I just wanted to make you proud.

616
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,510
Sometimes for people with our abilities

617
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,520
the most impressive feat is restraint.

618
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,440
I want what's mine, Vanessa.

619
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,170
Now step aside.

620
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,370
Because you brought a bigger gun this time?

621
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,110
Not happening.

622
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,120
You sure about that?

623
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,780
Yeah.I'm sure.

624
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,020
Hey, guys. Any luck with Block?

625
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,930
Nothing. No. Anything at the lab?

626
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,090
Uh, maybe. It's still a little too early to tell.

627
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,520
Unit 7-5-2 requesting a 10-61.

628
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,490
- What is that? - Nothing.

629
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,830
An officer requesting to go on a coffee break.

630
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,410
Not having our satellites is killing us.

631
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,620
I mean, we can't scan the city for dark matter

632
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,200
we don't have facial recognition.

633
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,570
All we'd need to do is see if there any pockets

634
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,580
of compressed air around the city and we'd have her.

635
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,640
You mean gauging atmospheric pressure like a barometer?

636
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,440
Yeah, but it would have to be a big barometer.

637
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,040
You mean like channel 52 Doppler radar relay?

638
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,420
Yeah, I mean, Vanessa's blocks

639
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,890
are constructed of highly dense air,

640
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,320
so they'd have the same composition

641
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,730
as an extreme atmospheric system.

642
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,850
So, we track the weather and we find her.

643
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,930
- That's so schway. - Okay, yeah.

644
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,080
Let's do it, yeah.

645
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,910
Go Team West-Allen. Yeah!

646
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,620
Okay, look, there's a high-density low-pressure zone

647
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,480
in a six block radius around Pacific and Davies.

648
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,060
Okay, cool. All right, let's go.

649
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,280
Hey, maybe I should just stay here.

650
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,760
Or you could put some of that training to use.

651
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,610
Last chance, Vanessa.

652
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,900
To do what?

653
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,410
Just give me the keys

654
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,310
so I can drive my weapons out of here.

655
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,270
Come on.

656
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,230
Just hand them over nice and easy.

657
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,100
Yeah, right.

658
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,040
Light her up!

659
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,470
You two. I swear...

660
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,050
She's getting tired.

661
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,940
We got her.

662
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,630
Yeah, we did.

663
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,230
Gotcha.

664
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,020
Flash is trapped!

665
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,790
What's wrong? What's happening?

666
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,020
Barry's in trouble.

667
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,170
She gets tired.

668
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,580
Hey, blockhead! Try that on me!

669
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,930
Bit off more than you could chew, huh?

670
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,170
Well, my work here is done.

671
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,750
Looks like she's a regular chip off the ol' block.

672
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,900
- Am I-- - Don't.

673
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,010
Okay, yeah, I know.

674
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,240
Get her to a hospital.

675
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,250
XS! Now!

676
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,250
Barry? What is it? Who's there?

677
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,400
I don't know yet.

678
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,360
I just lost my speed.

679
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,610
- I got nothing. - Negative, Ghost Rider.

680
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,470
Guys, I know we're three against one,

681
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,900
but something tells me this guy's got the advantage.

682
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,440
Barry!

683
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,080
What is that sound?

684
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,330
Oh, my God. Barry!

685
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,270
Barry, you got get out of there right now!

686
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,310
Dad!

687
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,300
Dad.

688
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,600
- Dad, are you okay? - I'm okay.

689
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,360
I mean, this is definitely dark matter,

690
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,510
but these levels of concentration are unlike

691
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,040
any dark matter levels I've ever seen before.

692
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,300
Yeah, well, that wasn't quite like any ass kicking

693
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,240
I've ever gotten before either.

694
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,070
That dagger he had,

695
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,910
I think that negated our powers.

696
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,480
And he control it too, like Mjolnir.

697
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,320
That's Thor's hammer.

698
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,860
I'm just glad you guys are okay.

699
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,430
This could've been a lot worst.

700
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,490
Yeah.

701
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,450
Careful. Those cuts are pretty deep.

702
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,100
It could take a while for them to heal.

703
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,880
Cisco, that's not important right now.

704
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,450
Look, if you wanna know, this is your chance.

705
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,860
I support you either way, Caitlin.

706
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

707
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,420
Caitlin, did you see something?

708
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,510
Yeah, I did.

709
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,360
My mother.

710
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,420
Hey, guys.

711
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,320
Let's go.

712
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,390
Hey, we got a big problem.

713
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,890
So I talked to Captain Singh and he said that Gridlock

714
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,210
was killed during his transport to Iron Heights.

715
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,550
- Gridlock's dead? - How?

716
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,100
I'm not sure.

717
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,730
I interviewed everyone that was there

718
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,630
and no one knows.

719
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,030
But I did some digging...

720
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,570
What the hell is that?

721
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,820
Stay where you are! Freeze! Don't move!

722
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,350
Okay, so what are we looking for here?

723
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,220
Not looking. Listening.

724
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,930
It sounds like the guy who just attacked us.

725
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,080
Sounds like an insect.

726
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,190
Yeah, it does.

727
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,380
- Like a... - Like a cicada.

728
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,060
Who's Cicada?
