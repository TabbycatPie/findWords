老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第二十一集

10
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,020
一个人住  感觉如何
So, how's living alone?

11
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,860
说来有意思
You know, it's interesting.

12
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,640
我刚搬进新公寓时
When I first moved into my new apartment,

13
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,510
我觉得不安
I was nervous.

14
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,230
这是我成年后的头一次
For the first time in my adult life,

15
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,250
没有室友同住
I didn't have a roommate.

16
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,640
但后来我突然发现
But then it hit me:

17
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,170
这是我成年后的头一次
for the first time in my adult life,

18
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,370
没有室友与我同住
I didn't have a roommate!

19
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,270
即使我一丝不挂地走来走去
If I want to walk around naked,

20
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,730
也没人会在意
nobody cares.

21
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,480
即使我把洗衣篮扔到
If I want to leave the laundry basket

22
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,020
客厅正中间
in the middle of the living room,

23
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,840
也没人会管我
nobody stops me.

24
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,550
即使我把打包回来的汤
If I bring home soup from the deli

25
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,970
在冰箱里放上两天
and leave it in the fridge for two days,

26
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,470
也没人会偷喝它
nobody eats it.

27
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,200
即使我做了愚蠢无比的事
And if I do something colossally stupid,

28
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,130
也没人会知道
nobody ever has to know.

29
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,900
人人都嘲笑
People make fun of the guy

30
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,060
每晚待在家里无所事事的人
who stays home every night doing nothing.

31
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,610
可事实上  这种人才是天才
But the truth is... that guy's a genius.

32
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,790
因为老实说  一个人没事看看电视
Because let's be honest, sitting around watching TV,

33
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,830
喝喝啤酒  啃啃排骨
drinking beer and eating ribs alone

34
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,140
是每个热血美国人求之不得的事啊
is what every red-blooded American would rather be doing at all times.

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,870
话是没错  可如果有人可以分享...
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better to have someone to share the...

36
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,250
我是说  难道你不觉得寂寞...
I mean, don't you get lonely without...

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
好吧  听起来的确很棒
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

38
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,090
你是问  跟脱衣舞女约会最大的好处吗
What's the best thing about dating a stripper, you ask?

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,920
没有
Nope.

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,470
她只是问你要点什么
Just asked for your drink order.

41
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,260
告诉你跟脱衣舞女约会的最大好处吧
I'll tell you the best thing about dating a stripper.

42
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,130
给他一杯苏格兰威士忌就好
He'll just have a scotch.

43
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,190
可以逢人就说
Getting to say,

44
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,330
"嘿  我在跟脱衣舞女约会呢"
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."

45
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,870
我要走了
And I should go.

46
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,410
该去上班挣钱了
Time to make the doughnuts.

47
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,410
make doughnuts 做甜甜圈/赚钱

48
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,530
更像是坐在蛋蛋上上班  挣着男人的钱吧
More like time to make some dough sitting on some nuts.

49
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,530
dough 面团/钱  nuts 坚果/蛋蛋

50
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,520
她是个脱衣舞女  而我在跟她约会
She's a stripper. I'm dating her.

51
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,690
我在跟脱衣舞女约会  巴尼赢了
I'm dating a stripper. Barney wins.

52
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,840
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

53
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,990
你们要去哪里
Hey, where are you going?

54
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,390
昆茵要上班了  她是个...
Quinn needs to get to work. She's a...

55
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,490
我知道  脱衣舞女  我懂的
I know, a stripper, got it.

56
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,880
出租车
Hey, taxi!

57
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,320
我的女朋友是脱衣舞女
My girlfriend's a stripper!

58
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,460
泰德  猜猜我们周五晚要去哪儿吃饭
So, Ted, guess where we're having dinner Friday night.

59
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,290
金钱餐厅[法语]
Chez L'Argent.

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,370
我太激动了
I am so excited.

61
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,780
这家餐厅的位子我们订了好久
We've been trying forever to get this reservation.

62
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,600
稍等一下
Can you hold on for just one second?

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,900
你干嘛啊
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
没什么
Nothing.

65
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,930
你刚是说要尿尿吗
Did you say you had to pee?

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,720
没有
No.

67
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,170
不过还真有点想尿  我去了
But yeah, I do have to pee.

68
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,460
靠  这孩子最好长得超级可爱
Man, this kid better be real freakin' cute!

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
刚才这是怎么回事
What was that all about?

70
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,770
莉莉昨晚做了个春梦
Lily had a sex dream last night.

71
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,480
春梦  快说说
Sex dream? Do tell.

72
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,150
我当时在漆宝宝的家具
I was painting the baby furniture...

73
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,060
爽呀
Oh, yeah.

74
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,580
真爽呀
Oh, yeah.

75
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,760
抓紧时间  马修快回来了
Hurry up, before Marshall gets home.

76
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
对不起  宝贝
I'm sorry, baby.

77
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,660
你刚在睡觉吗
Were you asleep?

78
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,540
所有怀孕的女人都会做离谱的春梦
All pregnant ladies have crazy sex dreams.

79
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,890
因为她体内荷尔蒙作乱
It's just her hormones going berserk.

80
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,060
她梦中在她双腿间"翻江倒海"的人是谁啊
So who's responsible for her rapid thigh movement this time?

81
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,340
我最爱的那次是她跟乔治・华盛顿开搞
Oh, my favorite was when she banged George Washington.

82
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,340
乔治・华盛顿  美国首任总统

83
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,740
我喜欢她跟比尔・考斯比
I liked the three-way

84
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,690
还有蓝精灵爸爸玩三人行
with Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

85
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,690
比尔・考斯比  黑人演员

86
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,810
smurf可代表任何字  这句话可理解为
he fucked the brains out of her

87
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,810
蓝精灵爸爸把她搞得死去活来
Oh, he smurfed the smurf out of her.

88
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,510
此处smurf off相当于jerk off

89
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,510
而且考斯还在一旁看着她打飞机
Yes, while The Cos smurfed off in the corner.

90
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,400
我们都记得  但问题是
We all remember. But here's the thing.

91
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,860
每当莉莉梦见和别人乱搞
When Lily has dirty dreams about other people,

92
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,290
她都会告诉我
she always tells me.

93
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,850
但是这次...
But this time...

94
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,950
听起来你做了个狂野的梦哦
Sounds like you had a crazy dream.

95
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,260
梦见什么了
What was it about?

96
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,060
接着她的脸变成了...
And then her face turned...

97
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,420
朱砂红的颜色
vermilion.

98
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,810
只是  你和我
Just... you and me...

99
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,960
打得火热  一男一女
gettin' it on, monogamously.

100
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,550
一"杆"一"洞"
Monoga-me-oh-my.

101
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
不是稍显尴尬的玫瑰粉
Not the rose quartz of the slightly embarrassed,

102
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,600
也不是略微惭愧的番茄红
or the tomato red of the mildly abashed,

103
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,530
而是朱砂红  为肉欲而感到羞耻的颜色
vermilion, the color of carnal shame.

104
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,490
这只能说明一件事
Can only mean one thing:

105
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,820
莉莉的春梦对象  是我们都认识的人
Lily dream-banged someone we know.

106
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,540
好吧  我被你逮了个正着
Okay, you caught me vermilion-handed.

107
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,100
其实  我在过去的五年里
The truth is, I've spent the last five years

108
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,750
一直试图侵入你老婆的梦境
trying to inception your wife.

109
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,970
《盗梦空间》是两年前才出的吧
That movie only came out two years ago.

110
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,900
什么空间
What movie?

111
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,010
你知道我会猜是谁吗
You know who I bet it is?

112
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,070
罗宾
Robin.

113
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,060
已经确认过了
Already checked.

114
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,580
我和莉莉去
Lily and I paid her a visit

115
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,540
世界新闻的新总部拜访她
at the new World Wide News headquarters.

116
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,700
我太激动了
And I'm so excited,

117
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,860
因为这家餐厅的位子我们订了好久
because I've been trying months to get this reservation.

118
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,270
稍等一下
Can you hold on just one second?

119
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,430
你想干嘛呀
What the hell are you doing?!

120
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,670
没什么
Nothing.

121
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,380
照片不错
Nice photo.

122
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,580
你的通行证也超大的吧
Your passport must be enormous.

123
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,030
先声明一下  这照片不是我的本意
You know, for the record, I didn't want this.

124
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,420
我不想这样  也不同意这样
Didn't want it, did not approve it.

125
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,060
真是超级尴尬呀
It's super embarrassing.

126
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,640
你好  默尔
Hey, Merle.

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,470
你们想上去看看我的办公桌吗
So, uh, do you guys want to come up and see my desk?

128
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,320
-好啊  看就看  -走吧
- Yeah, why not? - Come on.

129
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,410
证件
I.D.?

130
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,150
那人就是我
Oh. Um, that is me.

131
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,330
女士  恕我直言
Ma'am, with all due respect,

132
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,710
你比那辣妹看来老了那么一丁点
you're a wee bit older than that hottie.

133
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,490
看在上帝的份上
For God sakes.

134
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,530
我现在每天都在全国电视节目上露脸
You know, here I am, on national TV every day,

135
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,080
仍有人在我的巨幅照片旁
and still a guy who spends his whole life

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,670
守了一辈子的门口
sitting next to a giant picture of me

137
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,900
却认不出我是谁
has no idea who I am.

138
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,210
我的人生不止守门口  我还玩乐队呢
This isn't my whole life; I'm in a band.

139
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,640
我们会红的
And we're gonna make it.

140
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
<i>孩子们  他们确实红了</i>
<i>And, kids, they did make it.</i>

141
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,800
<i>但这事之后再说</i>
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,300
<i>算了  我大概之后也不会提到了</i>
<i>You know what, I'm probably not going to get to that later.</i>

143
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,010
<i>他们只出了一首歌  还不赖  完毕</i>
<i>They had one song, it didn't suck, the end.</i>

144
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,300
你总是说做记者不是为了出名
You always said it wasn't about being famous.

145
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,820
你只是想做靠谱的新闻  对吧
You just want to do solid journalism, right?

146
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,130
这个嘛
Yeah, well...

147
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,600
老娘当然想出名
Of course I want to be famous!

148
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,830
在加拿大  我是亮晶晶罗宾
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

149
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,950
那可是个家喻户晓的名字
I was a cabinhold name.

150
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,930
可在这里呢
But here?

151
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,590
无需出示证件  默尔
Don't need to see your I.D., Merle.

152
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,140
所有人都认识你
Everyone knows who you are.

153
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,410
你是默尔
You're Merle.

154
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,550
他只在圣诞派对上演了个小品而已

他很好
He's pretty good.

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,850
很好
Pretty good?

163
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,120
昨晚  你还穿着紧身三角裤
Last night, you ate a box of Froot Loops

消灭了一盒果脆圈

伙计们  我昨晚坐在家中
Guys, I was sitting at home last night,

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,810
突然间  我接到了圣的旨意
and all of a sudden, I had a piphany.

177
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,020
圣的旨意是...
And my piphany was this...

178
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,110
实际上  应该是"神的旨意"
Actually, it's, uh, it's "Epiphany."

179
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,530
泰德纠正巴尼的发音  但巴尼以为纠正的是冠词

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,530
不  泰德  我是特指
No, Ted, this is the piphany.

181

让  每晚  都成为传奇

从现在起  我们生命中的每个夜晚

Marshall, it was a dream.

306
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,730
梦反应的是
Yeah, well, dreams are just stuff

307
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,930
你潜意识想要发生的事情
that you subconsciously want to happen.

308
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,430
不然我为什么总是梦见
Why do you think I'm constantly dreaming

309
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,600
大脚野人担任维京橄榄球队的四分卫呢
about Bigfoot playing quarterback for the Vikings?

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,850
因为你看着那样的画入睡
Because you fall asleep looking at a painting of it.

311
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,310
那画能让我安详入睡
It soothes me.

312
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,290
别转移话题
Don't try to change the subject.

313
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
你"梦叛"了我
You sleep-cheated.

314
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,340
你梦叛我数次  跟无数人睡过了
You've been sleep-sleeping around,

315
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,160
我受够了
and I'm sick of it.

316
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,190
老娘真想一走了之
You know, I have half a mind to get out

317
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,020
大餐留给你一个人吃好了
and let you eat all by yourself.

318
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,600
我应该停车吗
Should I pull over?

319
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
我靠   兰吉特
Damn it, Ranjit!

320
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,130
行  兰吉特  停车
Yes, Ranjit. Pull over.

321
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,220
停车
Pulling over.

322
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,380
等着瞧吧  泰德
You watch, Ted.

323
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,190
今晚如果我们去偷骆驼
Tonight is going to be legen--

324
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,370
必将极富戏剧性
it's the night we stole a camel...

325
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,100
偷骆驼之夜

326
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,820
然后造就传奇的偷骆驼之夜
...which means it'll be full of drama-- dary.

327
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,570
"戏剧惊夜"[单峰骆驼]
Dromedary!

328
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,250
我折服于你的妙语如珠
I applaud your wordplay,

329
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,570
但你的中心思想漏洞百出
but your core premise is flawed.

330
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,400
不可能每个夜晚都是传奇之夜
Every night can't be legendary.

331
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,100
如果夜夜都是传奇
If all nights are legendary,

332
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,080
那传奇将不再传奇
no nights are legendary.

333
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,410
泰德  明白没  你这种态度
See, Ted, that attitude right there,

334
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,130
就是我领先的原因
that's why I'm in the lead.

335
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,370
你领先是什么意思
What do you mean, in the lead?

336
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,050
我说的是人生的游戏  泰德
I'm talking about the game of life, Ted.

337
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,130
计分板
Scoreboard.

338
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,500
服装比你强  75分
Better wardrobe: 75 points.

339
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,380
公寓所在楼层比你高  90分
Apartment on a higher floor: 90 points.

340
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,790
名字比你长  110分
Longer name: 110 points.

341
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,750
等等  这打分制度是你现拟的吧
Sorry. Did you just make up this point system?

342
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,320
拟制打分制度  114分
Made up the point system: 114 points.

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
被你发现了  奖你10分
And ten points to you for pointing that out.

344
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,660
干得漂亮  泰德
Nice job, Ted.

345
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,440
为我无私给你10分的举动
15 points to me for being gracious enough

346
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800
我自己再加15分
to give you those ten points.

347
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,060
泰德  重点在这
But here's the point, Ted.

348
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,230
我每次出去欢度春宵时
Every time I go out and have an awesome night

349
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,040
你都没参与到
and you're not there,

350
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,020
这又给我带来100分
that's another 100 points in my column.

351
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,260
所以  不好意思  我领先
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

352
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,090
巴尼  我能整晚安心地待在家
Barney, the fact that I can stay home for a night

353
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,470
表示我拥有平静的内心
shows that I have inner peace

354
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,230
也不觉得自己需要记着破分数
and that I don't feel the need to keep score.

355
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,190
这起码值一千分了
That's worth like 1,000 points right there,

356
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,610
我们最多是平局
so at the very least, we're tied.

357
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,760
我们才没有平局[系上]
We're so not tied.

358
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,130
你知道什么是系上的吗
Although you know what is tied--

359
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,160
我女友身上的比基尼系带
the strap of my girlfriend's bikini.

360
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,500
有时候也没系  因为她是个脱衣舞女郎
Except when it's not, 'cause she's a stripper.

361
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,550
1百万分  胜负已定
One million points! Game.

362
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,310
结束了
It's over.

363
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,300
结束了  结束了
It's done. It's done.

364
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,250
你是做什么的
So what do you do?

365
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,270
你不是吧
You're kidding, right?

366
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,120
我  我是空中主播
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,300
五分钟前我刚做完一则报道
I just did a report like five minutes ago.

368
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,060
你听起来很挫败
You sound frustrated.

369
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,610
是的  没错
Yeah, I am.

370
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,230
使尽浑身力气  还是得不到认可
I'm busting my ass, and as usual, no recognition.

371
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,400
罗宾  我干这行好些年了
Robin, I've been doing this a while,

372
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,800
我学到了一件事  一切皆浮浮[浮云]
and if there's one thing I've learned, it's flarm.

373
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,280
-什么  -浮浮
- What? - Flarm.

374
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,070
浮浮  浮浮  浮浮
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

375
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,190
油问提
Blobbum.

376
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,490
你发什么神经啊
What is wrong with you?

377
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,240
你舌头中风吗
Are you having a stroke?

378
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,170
<i>他确实中风了</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

379
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,880
别  别  等等
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

380
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,810
<i>与此同时  莉莉急需一个女性朋友倾诉</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Lily was in desperate need of a female friend.</i>

381
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,140
莉莉  我已经见怪不怪了
Lily, I have seen this a million times.

382
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,940
妻子一怀孕  男人就发疯
Guys go crazy when there's a baby on the way.

383
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,160
你应该看看经理妻子怀孕时他的反应
You should have seen the manager when his wife got pregnant.

384
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,820
才怀孕中期  他就不让她跳艳舞了
After the second trimester, he made her stop stripping.

385
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,070
对  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

386
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,550
现在我好难过
Now I feel bad.

387
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,530
我们的大餐被毁了
Our big dinner's been ruined.

388
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,740
马修现在可能正嚎啕大哭
Marshall's probably crying right now.

389
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,500
我真没想到食物居然能这么好吃
I had no idea that food could be this delicious.

390
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,590
马修  你这是在发疯
Marshall, you are being crazy.

391
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,700
不不  我能处理好的
No, no, I can handle it.

392
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
如果我卖了笔记本
If I sell my laptop,

393
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,200
就能再来一盘南瓜花
we can get seconds on those squash blossoms.

394
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,080
我是说莉莉
I mean about Lily.

395
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,180
她自己也在发疯啊
Well, you know, she's being crazy, too.

396
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,330
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

397
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,800
她有权发疯
She gets to be crazy.

398
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,000
你得做理智的那一方
You have to be the sane one.

399
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,630
所以直到宝宝出生后
So what, I don't get to be crazy again

400
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,970
我才能卖疯吗
until the baby comes?

401
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,170
不  到时候就轮宝宝耍疯了
No. Then it's baby's turn to be crazy.

402
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,820
那什么时候才能轮到我发疯啊
When do I get to be crazy again?

403
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,250
没机会了
Never.

404
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,630
我们完全打平了
We are totally even.

405
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,130
我们绝对没有打平  原因在此
We absolutely are not even, and here's why.

406
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,770
我承认  如果把你
I'll grant you that if you include

407
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,980
设计摩天大楼得的12分
the 12 points for designing the skyscraper,

408
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,580
给汤米・李来个击"脸"得的83分
the 83 points for slapping five with Tommy Lee

409
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,420
在我之前推倒罗宾得的9000分加起来
and the 9,000 points for banging Robin before me,

410
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,180
我们的分数或许才有可能不相上下
our point totals would be about neck and neck,

411
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,030
但是你忘了一件事情
but there's one thing you're forgetting.

412
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,600
老子懒得鸟你吗
The fact that I don't care?

413
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,880
不是
No.

414
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,410
而且你刚刚顶嘴  扣掉5分
And you just lost five points for sass.

415
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,000
还记得三年前我们的一次谈话吗
Do you remember a conversation we had about three years ago?

416
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,250
巴尼  王中之王
Barney, you're the king.

417
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,470
手到妞来  无人可及
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

418
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,750
你英俊潇洒
You're handsome,

419
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,010
玉树临风
debonair,

420
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,010
是我梦寐以求的目标
everything I wish I could be.

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,930
我开始觉得是你在瞎吹了
I'm starting to think this never happened.

422
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,770
听你自己慢慢道来
Let you finish.

423
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,520
你处事圆滑  魅力超群
You're smooth, charismatic,

424
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,550
嗡嗡而痒
"Sauve."

425
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,070
你是想说"温文尔雅"吧
I think you mean "suave."

426
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,160
你果然记得那一晚
So you do remember.

427
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,830
但有一件事
But there's one thing

428
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,350
是连你这样的大情圣也无法完成的
even a master ladies' man like you could never do,

429
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,680
如果你做到了的话
and if you could ever do it,

430
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,330
就可获得500分
it would be worth 500 points.

431
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,970
愿闻其详  我那身高略矮的朋友
You have my attention, my slightly shorter friend.

432
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,180
这个挑战就是
Here's the challenge.

433
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,470
穿着裙子要到女生的电话
Get a girl's phone number while you're wearing a dress.

434
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,240
挑战
Challenge...

435
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,860
完成了
accomplished.

436
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,910
没有错
That's right.

437
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,800
去年  我随便套上一条裙子
Last year, I slapped on a dress,

438
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,650
在这酒吧里晃荡了几步
took a few laps around this very bar,

439
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,890
就拿到了
and I got this:

440
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,930
某个叫丝黛芬妮・麦考根的女人的电话
the phone number of one Stephanie McColgan.

441
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,660
那天晚上  我脱下了我的连裤袜
Later that night, I took off my pantyhose,

442
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,630
和她的"裤"里乾坤  "连"成一体
and gave her panties... my hose.

443
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,800
是的  泰德
That's right, Ted.

444
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
我领先了500分
I am 500 points ahead.

445
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,320
除非你也能穿着裙子要到女生的电话
Until you can get a girl's digits while wearing a dress,

446
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
否则你永远都赶不上我
you and I will never be even.

447
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,820
算了  管理员估计在等我了
You know what? The super's probably waiting for me,

448
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,510
而且我刚想起来  备用钥匙在门垫下
and I just remembered there's a spare key under the doormat,

449
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,060
-晚安了  -等等  泰德  先别走
- so good night. - Wait, wait. Ted, don't go.

450
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,420
巴尼  我要走了
Barney, I am leaving.

451
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,010
恐怕今晚也会成为众多被我们
I'm afraid this is just one of those nights

452
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,120
淡忘的夜晚之一了
we're probably going to forget.

453
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,670
我可不这么觉得  老弟  你看
