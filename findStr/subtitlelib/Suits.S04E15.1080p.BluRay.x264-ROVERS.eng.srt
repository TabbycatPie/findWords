00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,059
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,431
I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate
you patching things up with him.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,472
I would do anything
for the woman that I love.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,808
They are gonna come at us

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,935
any way they can,
and when they do,

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,843
it's not gonna
be about heat sensors.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:14,913
It's gonna be about you.

8
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,481
I know I'm not the only
guy in that company

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,313
that knows
those sensors are faulty.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,713
I'm sorry.
What is it you need again?

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,448
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,717
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,361
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,660
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

15
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:36,498
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

16
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,436
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

17
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,900
Your whole story

18
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,000
about how Louis got his name
on the door is bullshit!

19
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,203
No, Jeff...

20
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,768
It's over, Jessica.

21
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,715
We're done.

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,689
I can't believe
you actually got them

23
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,020
to admit what they did.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,787
You better believe it
because it's happening,

25
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,227
and it wouldn't be
happening without you.

26
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,461
You mean without
me being greedy.

27
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,064
Joe, that's not what
I was going to say.

28
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,966
No, no. (STAMMERING)
I know you don't think

29
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,232
I care about these
people, but I do.

30
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,531
But I'm also a working stiff.

31
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,270
I go paycheck to paycheck
for my whole life,

32
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,538
and then a thing like this...

33
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,637
Could turn your
whole life around.

34
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,651
Guy like you might not be
able to understand that.

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,187
I understand.

36
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,219
So, it's a done deal.

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,191
Might take a few days
to finalize, but yeah.

38
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,726
It's happening.
You have my word.

39
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,629
You're all right,
Mr. Ross.

40
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,136
Harvey, you know, the only times
you've been here at night

41
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,073
were the God-awful dinner party...
And the other time.

42
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,701
Well, this isn't that.

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,473
I want to know why Liberty Rail

44
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,138
has a video of you
in their file room.

45
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,361
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,283
I'm talking about the fact that our
smoking gun just became inadmissible.

47
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,312
Harvey. How did you
get those documents?

48
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,321
Are you asking if I did something illegal?
Because I didn't.

49
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,290
Well, they went to
the DA, which means

50
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,679
they think you did. So, I'm
going to ask you one more time.

51
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,953
How did you get
in their file room?

52
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,089
By walking through the
door they buzzed open.

53
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,031
And why would they do that?
Because I'm me.

54
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,160
What the hell does that mean?

55
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,898
It means that I led the woman

56
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,031
to believe that I was an
official from Washington.

57
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,632
Led them to believe it
or flat out told them?

58
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,573
Because one kills our case

59
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,044
and the other puts
you in a world of shit!

60
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,877
Harvey, I'm not an idiot and I don't
appreciate being treated like one.

61
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,966
I told you I didn't do
anything illegal and I didn't.

62
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,214
Not an idiot?

63
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,409
What the hell were you doing
there in the first place?

64
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,618
Harvey... It was Mike's
idea, wasn't it?

65
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,525
No, he didn't even
know about it.

66
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
Where are you going?

67
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,032
To see Mike. I told you,
he didn't even know

68
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,420
I was going to do it.
I don't care

69
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,834
because he sure
as hell knew after.

70
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,166
Let's go.

71
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,581
I am so proud of you.

72
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,385
I've done that before.

73
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,048
I'm not talking about that.

74
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,288
I'm talking about your case. Ah.

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,123
You believed in it
and you fought for it.

76
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,131
And I... I love
that about you.

77
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,463
And I love that you
love that about me.

78
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,203
When a person gives you a
compliment like that... Oh?

79
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,137
You're supposed
to give one back.

80
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,075
Uh, I just did. I said that I
love that you love that about me.

81
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,545
And what if I said I love that you
love that I love that about you?

82
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,208
How would that make you feel?
So tired.

83
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,553
(CHUCKLES) Well, we both
know why you're so tired.

84
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,111
Yeah. Because
I'm so good.

85
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,657
Don't you love that about me?
Mmm.

86
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,451
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

87
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,164
You knew Donna bullshitted
her way into that company

88
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,170
and you let us use those work orders?
How did you find out?

89
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,424
It doesn't matter how I found out.
Answer my question.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,271
Yes, I knew. But what
difference does it make?

91
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,536
We won.
We didn't win

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,038
because Evan Smith has video
of Donna in their offices.

93
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,680
What? She know about this, too?

94
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,908
Harvey, she's just trying
to strong-arm us...

95
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,382
Are you listening to me?

96
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,349
They have the opposing
counsel's secretary

97
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,454
poking around in their
goddamn file room.

98
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,546
If I were the DA, I'd sure
as hell look into it.

99
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,451
The DA?
Yeah, the DA.

100
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,787
Harvey, they let her in.

101
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,656
According to you, but they're
going to claim fraud

102
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,458
or theft or any
number of things.

103
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,330
What are you going to do?
I'm making a deal

104
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,889
to drop this case, that's
what I'm going to do.

105
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,832
And you're going to file the
paperwork as soon as I do.

106
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,700
So, you're just going to let this
woman blackmail you without a fight?

107
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,928
You're damn right I am. Harvey,

108
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,953
we can still win this case
and clear her name...

109
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,876
There is no case. And I wouldn't
give a shit about it if there was.

110
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,674
I care about Donna.
And you think I don't?

111
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,044
If you care so much for her,

112
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,107
then draw up those papers. Because
I'm letting Evan know it's over.

113
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,354
<i>See the money, wanna stay
for your meal</i>

114
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,825
<i>Get another piece of pie
for your wife</i>

115
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,125
<i>Everybody wanna know how it feel</i>

116
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,428
<i>Everybody wanna see
what it's like</i>

117
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,766
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind</i>

118
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,498
<i>Me and missy is so early</i>

119
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,699
<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

120
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,799
<i>All right!</i>

121
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:14,074
<i>All step back I'm 'bout to dance</i>

122
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,509
<i>The greenback boogie</i>

<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

124
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,192
What are you doing here?
We have a situation.

125
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,358
Is the fate of the firm
hanging in the balance?

126
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,126
No, it's... Then, I
don't give a shit.

127
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,201
You told Malone, didn't you?

128
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,709
I didn't get a chance
to tell him.

129
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,108
Because he had
already figured out

130
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,114
that I'd been to lying
to him this whole time.

131
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,475
I'm sorry.
Oh. You're sorry.

132
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,878
This morning, I thought
I was going away with him

133
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,216
for two weeks. Now,
I don't know if I'm

134
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,409
ever going to see him again.

135
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,515
He quit?

136
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,253
He didn't get around to
giving me his career plans.

137
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,341
Do you want me to
talk to him for you?

138
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,660
No. This is my mess.

139
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,067
And I will take
care of it myself.

140
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,462
You can take care of it tomorrow.
Right now, I'm making you a drink.

141
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,105
"Zip-a-dee-doo-dah"
or "Grab My Sack"?

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,675
What? Messenger service.
Which one do we use?

143
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,806
Uh...
You know what?

144
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,596
Use whoever you want,
just take care of it.

145
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,084
Louis, don't you have
your own secretary?

146
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,313
Oh. You mean Norma,
who I can't find anywhere?

147
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,115
Who's probably taking
the day off again?

148
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,754
I mean, last year, she tried
to get Arbor Day off

149
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,691
and I told her to blow a goddamn
tree and get her ass in here.

150
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,762
You know what, Louis?

151
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,457
Norma's taken four days
off in the last 36 years.

152
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,193
Why don't you back
the hell off of her?

153
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,926
What the hell is the
matter with you?

154
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,197
You usually jump on
the Norma-bashing train

155
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,034
like a hobo in a
1940s action movie.

156
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,732
I'm sorry. I just...
What?

157
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,314
I bullshitted my way into Liberty
Rail to get some documents.

158
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,101
They caught me on video and now
they're threatening to press charges.

159
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,888
You're not saying anything.

160
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,321
It's nothing.
It's fine.

161
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,992
Then, why did you
look so concerned?

162
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,426
Well, I was concerned,

163
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,928
but they're threatening charges,

164
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,487
which means they want
something. And I know Harvey,

165
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,554
and whatever it is they want,

166
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,033
he'll find a way
to give it to them.

167
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,999
Okay. Thanks, Louis.

168
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,001
I'll take care of your stuff.
No, no.

169
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,097
You have enough on your mind.

170
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,268
I'll take care of it myself.

171
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,539
Mr. Specter.

172
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,949
Don't tell me, you're here
to talk about Ms. Paulsen.

173
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,513
I'm here to tell you
you've made your point.

174
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,918
And what point is that?

175
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,685
If you drop any charges
against Donna,

176
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,317
we'll drop the
lawsuit against you.

177
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,385
Well, that's not
a very even trade.

178
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,526
I'm giving your client a chance
to get away with murder.

179
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,601
Last I checked, my client wasn't
being charged with murder.

180
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,034
And I don't need
you to drop your suit

181
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,103
because you have no case.

182
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,036
No case? Your client put a
faulty train on those tracks,

183
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,440
people died, and they knew it
could happen the whole time.

184
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,603
And you have no proof.
And where I come from,

185
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
you cut a deal with me to
make sure I stop looking.

186
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,780
Then, I guess we come
from different places

187
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,116
because I didn't give that
video to the district attorney

188
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,916
to leverage you into a deal.

189
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,753
I did it to blow you
out of the water.

190
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,216
This is a person's life.

191
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,262
Maybe you should
have thought of that

192
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,730
before you sent her
to rob my client.

193
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,996
Evan, I care about this woman.

194
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,033
Look, I understand.

195
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,736
She's probably worked
for you for a long time.

196
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,407
Maybe you sleep
together once in a while.

197
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,009
But my job is to
defend my client

198
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,205
to the best of my abilities.

199
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,009
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

200
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,349
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

201
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,792
Holy shit.

202
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,060
You can't possibly
have a check already.

203
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,329
I don't have a check, Joe.

204
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,434
We have to drop the case.

205
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,934
What the hell are you talking about?
We had drinks last night.

206
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,408
Yeah. We also had proof last
night and now we don't.

207
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,646
Why not?
It's complicated.

208
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,341
You know, it's a lot
of legal rigmarole.

209
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,940
Hey, don't talk down to me.
I'm not talking down to you,

210
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,316
but I'm also not going to stand
here and explain civil procedure.

211
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,321
Maybe I don't understand
civil procedure,

212
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,449
but I know enough to understand
when something doesn't add up.

213
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,557
We got the evidence
the wrong way.

214
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,774
Well, get it the right way.

215
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,658
Subpoena it or something.
I... I can't.

216
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,058
What do you mean, you can't?

217
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,498
That money was going
to change my life.

218
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,162
And if you want to go to a
different law firm, I understand.

219
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,506
You know as well as I do, nobody
else is going to take this case.

220
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,768
You told me you cared
about these people.

221
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,366
You gave me your word.

222
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,412
Yeah, and I wish
I could keep it!

223
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,253
I want those bastards as
much as you want this money,

224
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,580
but I've got no proof and
you're not a credible witness.

225
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,411
Oh, that bullshit again?
That's not bullshit.

226
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,284
If you had been straight
with me from day one,

227
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,289
we wouldn't even
be in this mess.

228
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,557
How much did they give
you to dump the case?

229
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,462
It had to be something.

230
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,662
Otherwise, you
wouldn't sell me out.

231
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,529
I'm sorry, Joe.
It's over.

232
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,572
You're sorry?

233
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,510
Jessica.

234
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,019
Do you need something?

235
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,218
I came by earlier,
and you weren't in.

236
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,482
I had a meeting.

237
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,718
And I really didn't think you wanted
to be looped in on my schedule.

238
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,788
I don't. And I'm not
checking up on you,

239
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,056
I just didn't know
if you were coming in.

240
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,697
You mean you weren't sure if
I was ever coming in again.

241
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,565
You wouldn't be the first person to
leave a job for personal reasons.

242
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,597
It sounds to me like
you have an agenda.

243
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,134
I don't.
Well, that's a first.

244
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,237
Are you saying that I came
here to push you out?

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,005
I'm saying that I've never known
you not to know what you want.

246
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,947
What I want is to talk about us,

247
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,378
but you don't seem
to want do that.

248
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,479
So, I'm focusing on this.

249
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,914
I'm not resigning
my senior partnership

250
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,050
the day after what
happened, happened,

251
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,992
if that's what you're asking.

252
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,792
I'm asking if you plan
to resign it at all.

253
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,229
And I can't tell you that right
now because I don't know.

254
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,458
Well, when will you know?

255
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,727
Look, Jessica, you're
the Managing Partner.

256
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,272
So, if you want to push
me out, push me out.

257
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,274
But if you're asking me
what I want to do,

258
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,572
I'm telling you that
I haven't decided.

259
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,889
How did it go?

260
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,448
Never mind how it went.
Where's Mike?

261
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,526
Did he file those papers?

262
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,890
(STUTTERING) I don't know.
He's not even in yet.

263
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,622
Well, you tell him
not to file anything.

264
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,492
And you tell him to
do whatever he has to,

265
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,793
to stick it to that woman.

266
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,890
Why?

267
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,666
Because it didn't work.

268
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,970
What didn't work?

269
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,699
I tried to make a deal with
Evan to trade the case.

270
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,809
You mean you offered to drop
the case in exchange for me.

271
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,044
Yes.

272
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,003
And now, what are
we going to do?

273
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,137
You're not going to do anything.

274
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,648
I'm going to do
whatever I have to,

275
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,050
to get Terrence Wolf to back off.
Harvey,

276
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,074
there's no way the DA handles
a case like this himself

277
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,243
just because I work for you.

278
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,257
Whether he handles it himself
or not doesn't matter

279
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,488
because this case won't
even exist in another hour.

280
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,165
How did it go?

281
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,672
I just told a man everything
I promised him was bullshit.

282
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,765
How do you think it went?

283
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,842
Mike, I'm sorry.

284
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,934
(SIGHS) You should
have seen his face.

285
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,411
(SCOFFS) That money was
going to change his life.

286
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,540
And I dangled it in front
of him and ripped it away.

287
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,674
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

288
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,616
You did everything you could.

289
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,119
He accused me of selling out.

290
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,374
You know you didn't do that.

291
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,717
Didn't I?

292
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,090
We gave up because...

293
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,318
Of me?

294
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,453
That's not what I was
going to say.

295
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,530
Yeah, it was.

296
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,198
No, I was going to say
because of Harvey.

297
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,346
What are you talking about?

298
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,732
Harvey never wanted
to take this case,

299
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,463
so he put a clock on it
to get me to drop it.

300
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,097
That's why we're
where we are right now.

301
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,067
Listen to me. Harvey
is out there right now

302
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,371
busting his ass to fix everything.
No, Donna.

303
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,468
He doesn't give a shit about
this case and he never did.

304
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,035
Then, why did he
send me here to tell you

305
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,377
to do everything you can
to stick it to Evan Smith?

306
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,439
She didn't take
the deal, did she?

307
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,710
No, she didn't.

308
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,287
Donna, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize that you were still...

309
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,688
On the hot seat?

310
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,184
Like I said,

311
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,749
Harvey's busting
his ass to fix it.

312
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,559
Which means he's
going to fix it.

313
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:22,566
Now, finish what we started, and
figure out a way to win this case.

314
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,635
(SIGHS)

315
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,138
Harvey Specter.

316
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,602
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

317
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,772
Funny, I was wondering why you
never sent me a Christmas card.

318
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,778
(LAUGHS)

319
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,147
You don't seem
the least bit worried

320
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,652
about the pending charges
against your secretary.

321
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,915
I'm not because
she did nothing wrong.

322
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,169
Well, you know what I think?

323
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,317
I think you wouldn't be here

324
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,620
if she did nothing wrong.

325
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,888
Listen to me. She
didn't steal anything.

326
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,522
She got those documents by
convincing them to let her in

327
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,622
and that is not a crime.

328
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,097
And the last time you were
in my office, you told me

329
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,295
you hadn't committed a
crime to get the job done.

330
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,565
After I told you, you
had an innocent man

331
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,119
and all you cared
about was procedure.

332
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,642
All I cared about was the law.

333
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,110
Well, if you're so concerned
with people breaking the law,

334
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,940
why don't you take a
look at those documents?

335
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,984
Because they prove Liberty Rail
actually committed a crime.

336
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,247
Unlike Donna, whose only
crime is working for me.

337
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,121
I'm not investigating her
for working for you,

338
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,248
I'm investigating her
for felony fraud.

339
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,492
What the hell are
you talking about?

340
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,858
The woman that let her in

341
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,831
swears your secretary told her

342
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,391
she was with the National
Transportation Safety Board.

343
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,794
That's a federal agency.

344
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,597
Which makes what
she did not a trick.

345
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,243
It makes it felony fraud.

346
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,106
My office now.

347
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,078
Close the door.

348
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,420
Harvey, what happened? What
happened is you lied to me.

349
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,459
What are you talking about?
You told their secretary

350
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,960
you were with the NTSB?

351
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,360
That's not what I said.
Bullshit!

352
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,621
I know when I've been lied to.

353
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,699
Come clean right now.

354
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,834
Uh...

355
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,902
Right the hell now!

356
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,199
I never said I was with them.

357
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,294
I said, "Have you ever heard of

358
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,432
"the National Transportation
Safety Board?"

359
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,736
How is that any different?

360
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,710
I'm sorry. I...
You're sorry?

361
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,769
Harvey, I swear, I didn't know
that, that made it a crime.

362
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,743
You knew when I point
blank asked you,

363
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,715
and you lied to me about it.

364
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,824
Well, I thought that you
would take care of it. I...

365
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,347
How can I take care of it if you
don't tell me the goddamn truth?

366
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,889
Do you think that I didn't
want to tell you the truth?

367
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,049
Then, why didn't you?

368
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,093
Because I was ashamed!

369
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,789
I know that it sounds stupid.

370
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,795
But you and Mike and everyone

371
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,458
pull these rabbits out
of your hats all the time.

372
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,526
And I just sit outside
and I answer the phones.

373
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,232
And then, I got those documents
and people said I saved the day.

374
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,703
And the next thing I knew,
you were on my doorstep

375
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,768
coming at me like I was
some sort of criminal.

376
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,746
And I panicked, and I lied.

377
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,412
Donna.
I'm sorry, Harvey.

378
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,115
I know you are,
but this just got

379
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,213
1000 times harder
for me to get out of.

380
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,550
You mean for you
to get me out of.

381
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,655
Donna, you of all people should
understand by now that to me,

382
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,730
they're the same thing.

383
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,906
What are you doing here?

384
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,016
I went to see you at work.

385
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,203
They said you called in sick.

386
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,340
I said what are you doing here?

387
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,205
I wanted to tell you
the good news.

388
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,806
We're not dropping
your case after all.

389
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,547
Good for you.

390
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,084
Hey, Joe, I know you've
been jerked around,

391
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,646
but things are going to change.

392
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,224
Going to
change? Really?

393
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,761
I thought you said you got the
evidence in the wrong way.

394
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,320
Well... And you said we should
get it in the right way,

395
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,059
so that's exactly what
we're going to do.

396
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,191
Like I said, good for you.

397
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,895
But you're not going
to do it with me.

398
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,540
Joe, I can't subpoena those records
without a legitimate client.

399
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,768
I have no basis and no standing
to move forward if I did.

400
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,778
But now you have time to explain
"procedure" to me, right?

401
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,474
(SIGHS) Okay. Fine.
I deserved that.

402
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,975
But, Joe, this case cannot
move forward without you.

403
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,012
You should have thought of
that before you cut me loose.

404
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,990
They got to you, didn't they?

405
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,074
They gave you a few
dollars to shut you up.

406
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,575
And then, they sealed the agreement
with no admission of guilt.

407
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,722
You know what?

408
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,900
I can't comment on
that and you know why.

409
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,163
But let's get one
thing straight.

410
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,364
They didn't shut me up, you did.

411
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,633
And if I took anything,

412
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,568
it was because
I had no other choice.

413
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,234
Joe, listen to me. If the
check hasn't cleared,

414
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,777
we can still get out of it.

415
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,577
Don't come by here anymore.

416
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,106
So much for really caring
about those people.

417
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,113
Go to hell.

418
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,265
I thought nobody puts
Baby in the corner.

419
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,629
Since when am I Baby?

420
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,061
Since you're sitting
in the corner.

421
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,560
You're usually a
power table kind of girl.

422
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,571
Well, I'm not tonight.

423
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,237
Jessica, what's going on?

424
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,076
It's over between me and Jeff.

425
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,672
What? What happened?

426
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,550
It's not important.

427
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,277
One day, the man's calling me
about taking you to Paris,

428
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,753
and the next it's over, and the
reason for all that isn't important?

429
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:11,823
No, it isn't.

430
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,256
Because right now, I have to decide
whether he should stay at the firm.

431
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,360
Well, then, I'd say the reason
that you broke up is important.

432
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,089
And I don't want to
get into it right now

433
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,665
because it's not going to change.
Wow.

434
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,562
Heard that before.

435
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,827
Leah, I'm not like Dad

436
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,692
and I'm tired of hearing it.

437
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,706
I know you always say
you're not like him.

438
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,833
But here you are,

439
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,273
scrubbing up for
the next surgery

440
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,005
instead of fighting for
the man that you love.

441
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,079
You know what?

442
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,715
Most sisters would say
"I'm sorry, Jessica,"

443
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,979
then give me a hug.

444
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,383
Jessica, I am sorry
that you're hurting.

445
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,853
And if you want something
sugar-coated, I'll order you dessert.

446
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,983
But that is not how
we show support.

447
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,094
You're right.

448
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,096
We show it by telling
each other what we think.

449
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,225
So...
And what I think is,

450
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,799
two days ago,
this man loved you.

451
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,004
So, unless you cheated on him, stole
from him, or killed somebody,

452
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,012
it seems to me the two of you
should be able to get past

453
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,139
whatever it is you did do.

454
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,846
Joe Henderson backed out.

455
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,124
Harvey.
Did you hear me?

456
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,343
They paid him off.
We have no case anymore.

457
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,465
And right now, I have a bigger problem.
Donna lied.

458
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,165
What do you mean, she lied?

459
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,567
I mean, she didn't just bullshit
her way into that file room,

460
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,301
she used the words "National
Transportation Safety Board."

461
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
In what context?

462
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,434
In the context of committing
a crime to help you.

463
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,280
Are you accusing me of
knowing that she did that?

464
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,278
If you didn't know, it's because
you didn't want to know.

465
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,009
Harvey, she told me she
didn't steal those things.

466
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,609
I believed her the
same way you did.

467
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,245
And you lied
just like she did...

468
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,322
I did not lie.

469
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,220
Then how come when I asked you
where those documents came from,

470
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,988
you didn't say one
word about Donna?

471
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,722
Because you wouldn't have
listened to another word I said

472
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,821
after that, and I was
trying to get the job done.

473
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,832
Well, you got the job
done by risking her.

474
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,181
And how is that different than
all the times you risked me?

475
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,034
Because she's different.

476
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,044
Harvey. I swear
I didn't know.

477
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,884
Well, like I said, right now,
I've got a bigger problem.

478
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,320
Donna's going to be charged with
felony fraud and she's guilty.

479
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,621
Five elements.
What?

480
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,759
Proving fraud consists
of five elements.

481
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,766
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
And they have all of them.

482
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,835
What about injury?

483
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,695
How did Donna
injure Liberty Rail?

484
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,240
You know how. I know.
And you know.

485
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,139
But Evan Smith isn't going
to sit in front of a jury

486
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,075
and explain why those
documents have value

487
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,773
without exposing her
client to criminal charges.

488
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,416
And without damages, what
Donna did is trespassing

489
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,576
at the worst.

490
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,192
What do you want me to do?

491
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,812
I want you to stay
on the civil case.

492
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,856
Harvey, the lawsuit's dead.
We don't have a plaintiff.

493
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,221
Then get another one. Because
I'm not letting this woman

494
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,555
get away with a goddamn thing.

495
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,858
All right. I'm paying you
the courtesy of a meeting.

496
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,936
What's on your mind?

497
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,970
Well, based on his
reputation, I would say that

498
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,530
he's going to try to weasel
his way out of this.

499
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,071
What I'm going to do
is save Mr. Wolf

500
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,838
from being embarrassed
in open court.

501
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,277
And I'm sure there's no side
benefit to you in the process.

502
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,072
You do know you're going to have to put Ms.
Smith on the stand, right?

503
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,103
So do you. That's why you
had her come down here.

504
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,345
And did she tell you what
Donna actually took?

505
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,621
You told me what Donna took.

506
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,118
And I also told you

507
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,182
that it proves they
committed a crime.

508
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,486
But she can't say
that, which means

509
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,622
all Donna stole was a
meaningless stack of papers.

510
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,189
And without actual damages...

511
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,827
I know the law. Then, you know
you've got a shitty witness.

512
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,802
Well?

513
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,637
I can't get into the details
of those documents,

514
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,179
but that doesn't mean
that they don't have value.

515
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,287
Of course they have value,

516
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,179
they save your ass.
They're confidential.

517
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,544
They have trade secrets.

518
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,279
The only secret that is in there

519
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,786
is that your trains kill people.

520
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,321
All right, enough.

521
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,281
Ms. Smith,

522
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,720
if you can't show
damages, I have no case.

523
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,955
You don't need damages.
You have intent.

524
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,897
And if you really
knew my reputation,

525
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,729
you'd also know
that I used to work here.

526
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:17,860
And I can tell you

527
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,699
they've never gone
after anyone for intent

528
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,600
in the history
of the DA's office.

529
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,332
And they're not
going to start now.

530
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,968
It was good doing
business with you, Evan.

531
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,316
Hey.
Hey.

532
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,654
How are things?

533
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,886
You mean the things that you said
that Harvey would take care of?

534
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,660
Yes, those are exactly
the things I mean.

535
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,526
Well, those are
exactly the things

536
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,394
that Harvey just took care of.

537
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,726
He did?

538
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,394
He did.

539
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,408
Louis? What's wrong?

540
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,578
Nothing is wrong.

541
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,978
It's just, I know it
wasn't going to happen.

542
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,347
But when you first told me
they might press charges,

543
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,811
the thought of you
behind bars...

544
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,083
Oh, come on.

545
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,185
It just would have been some
cushy white-collar resort.

546
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,092
I could have finally gotten
my yoga certification...

547
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,155
It wouldn't have been.

548
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,225
But it doesn't matter
because I was right.

549
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,133
Harvey did whatever it took.

550
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,402
Thanks, Louis.

551
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,296
God, he doesn't even know how
lucky he is to have you.

552
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,411
Norma's still out, isn't she?

553
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,715
Her goddamn sister tripped
and fell in the tub

554
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,478
and she went to help. It's like she
doesn't even care about me at all.

555
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,554
(BOTH LAUGHING)

556
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,798
I know you don't
work in maintenance,

557
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,548
but you do have access
to accounts payable.

558
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,764
So, if you could...
Look... Nope.

559
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,864
Hey, please, just hear me.

560
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,471
Goddamn it.

561
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,945
Another one wouldn't
take your call?

562
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,841
No. None of them will. I've been
through this entire directory.

563
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,077
As soon as I use the words "crash," "heat,"
or "sensors," they all stop talking.

564
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,486
Mike, people died. Somebody's got
to want to do the right thing.

565
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,547
Well, if somebody does,
I can't find them.

566
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,250
Okay. What about
the victims' families?

567
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,018
Oh, you mean the original plaintiffs?
Mmm-hmm.

568
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,961
Yeah. The problem is, they
already have a settlement.

569
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,090
Go on. Look at it.
They weren't stupid.

570
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,827
It prevents them from ever
going after them again.

571
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,631
Mike, I'm just
trying to help you.

572
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,234
I know you are. I'm sorry.
I'm just frustrated.

573
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,868
If I can't find a new plaintiff,
I can't keep this case alive.

574
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,443
Wait a second.

575
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,445
You said no one at
the company will talk to you.

576
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,609
They won't because they're all
afraid they'll lose their job.

577
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,379
Right. So, what about someone
who has nothing left to lose?

578
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,381
What are you talking about?

579
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,827
I'm talking about him.

580
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,558
So, I rescheduled the meeting
that you missed with Latham

581
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,159
for three o'clock tomorrow.
Here are the newest contracts.

582
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,598
Also, Kathy Finn called
about the takeover,

583
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,470
so I sent her the latest specs
and I told her to sit tight.

584
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,100
And I noticed the left
pen on your desk set

585
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,017
was out of ink, so I had
the cartridge replaced.

586
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,070
You could have done all of this
while I was out of the office.

587
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,574
I know. But then, I wouldn't
have had a chance to thank you.

588
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,777
Donna.

589
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,511
(SIGHS) Thank you, Harvey.

590
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,749
You're welcome.

591
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,987
TERRENCE: Ms. Paulsen.
Mr. Specter.

592
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,025
Terrence, you better be here
to give Donna a formal apology

593
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,126
from the DA's Office.
(SCOFFS)

594
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,722
No. I'm here to
give her lawyer this.

595
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,167
Harvey, what is that?
Donna, leave the room.

596
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,531
TERRENCE: You can
tell her to leave.

597
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,073
Don't forget to tell
her, her arraignment's

598
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,302
at 9:00 a.m.
Tomorrow morning.

599
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,435
Arraignment for what?

600
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,275
You son of a bitch. You amended
the charges to intent?

601
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,277
You said it's never been done in
the history of the DA's office.

602
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,874
I decided to make history.

603
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,443
By going after someone
for stealing nothing.

604
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,421
She went in there to
find the Hope Diamond.

605
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,481
Just because she came
out with a piece of glass

606
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,890
doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.

607
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,427
That's exactly what it means.

608
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,256
Every time I run into you,

609
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,128
you tell me whatever shady
thing just went down

610
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,233
was about the greater good
or that it didn't happen,

611
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,867
or this, that, or the other.
But a crime was committed here

612
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,180
and I'm going after her for it.

613
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,037
Bullshit, you're going after me.

614
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,573
Oh, you're telling me you
didn't order her to do it?

615
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,645
No, I didn't.

616
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,811
Well, we'll find out.

617
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,714
When she's about to be convicted

618
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,978
and I offer her a deal.

619
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,925
What happens now?

620
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,559
What happens now is we
go in there tomorrow

621
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,331
and enter a plea of not guilty.

622
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,671
But I am guilty.

623
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,400
Donna, intent to commit
fraud is a bullshit charge

624
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,389
and he's just using it
to try to scare you.

625
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,071
Well, it's working.
I'm scared.

626
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,338
Donna.
What's the punishment?

627
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,006
It doesn't matter, because I'm
going to get you out of it.

628
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,278
Harvey, what's the punishment?

629
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,744
Three-to-five years.

630
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,922
Oh, my God.

631
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,049
LOUIS: Three-to-five years for what?
Not now, Louis.

632
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,992
I just saw Terrence Wolf
at the elevator.

633
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,755
Three-to-five years
for what?

634
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,528
He's charging her with
intent to commit fraud.

635
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,698
Holy shit.

636
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,232
Louis, I don't want to hear it.

637
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,701
Well, you're going to because you
were supposed to get her out of this.

638
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,670
This isn't helping. What the hell
do you think I've been doing?

639
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,604
I don't know. But whatever
it is, it didn't do a thing.

640
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,039
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

641
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,403
I told her that you were never
going to let her get in trouble.

642
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,438
It's not so simple. What
the hell isn't so simple?

643
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,674
She's guilty!

644
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,678
Wolf's trying to
use her to turn on me

645
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,241
because he thinks
I put her up to it.

646
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,614
Did you?

647
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,017
Harvey didn't
even know I did it.

648
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,988
You know what? It doesn't even matter.
Because I'm taking over.

649
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,651
No, you're not. He's trying
to get her to turn on you.

650
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,057
You cannot be her lawyer.

651
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,857
She's not going to, so what
difference does it make?

652
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,228
The difference is, if you're out
of the picture, Wolf backs down.

653
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,767
From where he's standing,
I'm in the picture

654
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,995
and he's never
going to back down.

655
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,627
You don't know that and
this is Donna's life.

656
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,332
And I'm not putting
it in your hands.

657
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,431
And it's not your
decision to make.

658
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,975
No, it's not.
It's Donna's.

659
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,244
And she's sticking with me.

660
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,110
Louis, please. I, I know that
you want to help, but just go.

661
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,050
(CHUCKLES)

662
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,730
Mr. Jaworski.
Yeah?

663
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,367
My name's Mike Ross. I'm
with Pearson Specter Litt.

664
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,443
This is Rachel Zane.

665
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,477
She's one of our associates.

666
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,173
Sir, we'd like to speak with
you about the accident.

667
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,282
Look, I was already
deposed for that lawsuit.

668
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,148
The victims got paid. I said
everything I had to say. Okay?

669
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,154
We're not here to
come after you.

670
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,951
We want you to sue Liberty Rail.

671
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,116
Oh, yeah? And why
would I sue them?

672
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,319
Because while you might have
been driving the train,

673
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,453
that accident wasn't your fault.

674
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,857
Is this some kind of a joke?
No, sir, it isn't.

675
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,158
They made you the fall guy.

676
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,797
Bullshit. Why would
they do that?

677
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,343
Because they needed
to blame someone,

678
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,270
and not only were
you at the wheel,

679
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,807
you had no memory
of what happened.

680
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,671
No, I...
I don't believe it.

681
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,045
They're a good company.

682
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,773
(STAMMERING) They... They wouldn't do this.
Mr. Jaworski.

683
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,034
Look, I killed those people.

684
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,950
And they still gave me early
retirement and let me keep my pension.

685
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,216
The reason they did that
was to keep you quiet.

686
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,090
I need you to get off
my property. Both of you.

687
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,699
Sir, you know that
we're telling the truth.

688
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,894
Yeah, well, is the truth going
to support the family of a guy

689
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,596
who can't get another job
for the rest of his life?

690
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,535
If we win, you'll
be set up for life.

691
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,766
Oh, take a look at me.

692
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,640
I ain't the guy who wins.
I'm the guy who loses.

693
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,510
And what if I could guarantee
to take care of all of that

694
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,877
no matter what happens?

695
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,148
What would you need me to do?

696
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,346
BAILIFF: All rise.

697
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,259
You okay?
Mmm-hmm.

698
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:01,994
Am I going to have to talk?

699
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,658
Just be polite and
say "Your Honor."

700
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,430
It will be over
before you know it.

701
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,562
JUDGE:
<i>State v. Donna Paulsen.</i>

702
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,226
Is the defense counsel prepared
to proceed with the arraignment?

703
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,733
We are, Your Honor. Ms.
Paulsen, you have been charged

704
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,803
with felony intent
to commit fraud.

705
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,176
This carries a maximum sentence

706
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,880
of up to five years in prison.

707
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,043
Do you understand the
charges against you today?

708
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,586
Yes, Your Honor.

709
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,654
How do you plead?

710
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,524
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Very well. Mr. Wolf,

711
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,184
is the state ready
to go to the trial?

712
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,261
We are, Your Honor.

713
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,921
Trial is set to begin Monday.

714
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,658
(GAVEL POUNDS)
JUDGE: Next case.

715
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,695
All right, you've
made your point.

716
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,464
Let's plead this down to a misdemeanor
and both go back to our real jobs.

717
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,198
This is my real job.

718
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,003
(VOICES ECHOING) Maybe if you had
more respect for what it stands for,

719
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,599
you wouldn't be standing here.

720
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,208
Listen. I'm going to wipe
that look off your smug face.

721
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,041
Go ahead and try, Harvey.

722
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,844
But I've got all
the evidence I need.

723
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,657
You're going to have to go
find yourself a new secretary.

724
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,738
I see you're back
to not knocking.

725
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,775
I take it that means
you've made up your mind.

726
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,347
I have.

727
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,651
And what I've decided

728
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,385
is that you shut the door
on me the other night.

729
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,030
And it's not fair for you to dictate
what I do and don't get to say.

730
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,164
I told you.

731
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,947
It doesn't matter
what you have to say

732
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,061
because whatever it is,
I won't believe it.

733
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,934
Well, what if I was
here to tell you

734
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,601
that I love you?

735
00:31:55,647 --> 00:32:00,016
Jessica, you lied
to me for months.

736
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,780
Jeff, please, just listen.

737
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,655
I know I hurt you.

738
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,921
But you were the one

739
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,991
who wanted us to work together
and be in a relationship.

740
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,295
And you were the one who
thought it was a mistake.

741
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,426
Because I was scared.

742
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,128
But I changed my mind

743
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,805
because you refused to give up.

744
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,976
And now, I'm
refusing to give up.

745
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,346
I want you to stay here.

746
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,716
I want us to have both.

747
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,491
Jessica... You wanted me
to let my walls down.

748
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,692
Well, they're down.

749
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,862
<i>I don't dare to make a move</i>

750
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,471
<i>Too much at risk,
too much to lose</i>

751
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,975
<i>This love is overtaking me</i>

752
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,220
Donna, why don't you go home?

753
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,417
You know I like to be alone when
I'm getting ready for a trial.

754
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,892
I need to talk to you.

755
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,157
What is it?

756
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,890
I think maybe Louis was right.

757
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,973
You think Louis was
right about what?

758
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,663
Maybe he should be
handling my case.

759
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,936
Okay. Well, if that's
how you feel...

760
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,011
I knew it. I knew you would
take this as an insult.

761
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,679
How exactly would you
like me to take it?

762
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,148
I would like you take it seriously
and talk about it with me.

763
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,183
Okay, Donna.

764
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,319
Why exactly would you prefer
Louis to handle this?

765
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,283
Because I sat in that
arraignment today

766
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,256
and it hit me for the first time

767
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,759
that I might actually
go to prison.

768
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,726
And you were more
concerned with attacking

769
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,197
Terrence Wolf than
you were with me.

770
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,832
So, you think Louis is right.

771
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,128
I piss off the DA too much.

772
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,362
Well, you sure did today.
Because he's coming at us.

773
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,961
And you're pouring
gas on the fire.

774
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,232
Because that's what I do.

775
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
And I don't need you coming
in here second guessing

776
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,807
how I do my job.
Harvey,

777
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,175
why are you attacking me?
I'm not the enemy.

778
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,643
You sure as hell are right now.

779
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,078
What? Why am I the...

780
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,589
Because I'm getting
ready for a fight

781
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,015
and you're telling me you
don't think I can win.

782
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,485
I'm not telling you that. I'm
telling you that I'm petrified.

783
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,819
And I understand. But I don't
have time to comfort you.

784
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,790
Well, I need you to make time.
And I can't because...

785
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
Harvey, this is my life!

786
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,858
When I told Louis

787
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,490
how you got me
out of this thing,

788
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,831
he told me how scared
he was at the thought

789
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,961
of me going to prison.

790
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:38,475
And I just need you to...

791
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,710
Donna,

792
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,504
the thought of you
going to prison

793
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,980
makes me want to
drop to my knees.

794
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,181
You want to hear
me say it? There it is.

795
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,819
But that's not going to happen because
I'm not going to let it happen.

796
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,355
But in order to do that,

797
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,653
you need to let me do what I do.

798
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,051
Harvey.
That's enough...

799
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,956
If you want someone to give
you a hug, go to Louis.

800
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,830
You want someone to
get you out of this thing,

801
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,992
you need to leave me alone.

802
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,075
I need to know everything you have
and I need to know right now.

803
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,429
We got the conductor to sign on,

804
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,418
but we have to give him... I don't
care what I have to give him.

805
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,511
What does that give us?
What do you mean?

806
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,180
It gives us standing. Now we
can subpoena those records.

807
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,256
Well, that's not enough.

808
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,915
It's a start.
I don't need a start.

809
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,458
I need a finish,
and I need it now.

810
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,526
They're charging
Donna, aren't they?

811
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,760
She was arraigned this morning.
(SIGHS)

812
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,893
If this thing goes to trial,

813
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,062
I can't guarantee a win.

814
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,637
So, we're back to trading
the case for Donna.

815
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,865
Yeah, and I don't want to
hear your moral objections

816
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,203
about those people
getting away with murder.

817
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,436
I'm not talking
about that, Harvey.

818
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,071
But if Donna was arraigned, it's not
up to them to drop the charges.

819
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,910
It's up to Wolf, and you know
he's never going to do that.

820
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,779
I'm not talking about
dropping the charges.

821
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,318
I'm talking about making this
whole damn thing go away.

822
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,351
Harvey, if you're saying
what I think you're saying,

823
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,581
that's obstruction ofjustice.

824
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,255
The way I see it, it's justice.

825
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,383
You know what I mean. I do
and I don't give a shit.

826
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,460
This is Donna.

827
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,028
All right, I get it. But what
if what I have isn't enough?

828
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,291
Like you said, it's a start.

829
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,725
Have an official complaint
on my desk by the morning.

830
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,834
What are you going to do?

831
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,028
I'm going to get us enough.

832
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,140
JOE: All right. I hear you,
I hear you.

833
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,251
Do you know who I am? No.

834
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,652
Mike Ross works for me.

835
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,248
Hey, I don't give a shit.

836
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,020
I told him not to take your
case in the first place

837
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,722
because I knew you were a
goddamn shakedown artist.

838
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,510
But now, someone I care
about is in trouble

839
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,726
because you took a payout.

840
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,398
Get out of my face.
Listen to me.

841
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,266
If you don't do what
we need you to do,

842
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,639
I will hurt you.

843
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,197
You'd better be
prepared to kill me

844
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,108
because I'm not going
to give that money back.

845
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,244
Well, if this is just
about money, then...

846
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,409
We don't need to fight at all.

847
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,253
Harvey. This is
becoming a habit.

848
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,242
I've seen you more than
my last three boyfriends.

849
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,724
Somehow, that
doesn't surprise me.

850
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,259
(CHUCKLES) You're
funny. I like you.

851
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,661
But I know you're not here
to mock my relationships,

852
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,028
so what's on your mind?

853
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,533
We wanted to give you this.
What's this?

854
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,159
It's the lawsuit we filed on
behalf of Michael Jaworski.

855
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,945
You know, the man you let take
the fall for the accident.

856
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,004
Michael Jaworski can't sue...
HARVEY: What?

857
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,149
Sue you because you were smart
enough to take care of his expenses?

858
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,605
Well, now I'm taking
care of his expenses.

859
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,013
And now, we have standing
and we are going to

860
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,108
subpoena those documents.

861
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,548
Am I supposed to start
quaking in my boots?

862
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,215
HARVEY: Nope. We know
if you can doctor a report,

863
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,950
you can alter those
maintenance records.

864
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,625
I didn't alter anything. Well,
that's not what Joe Henderson said.

865
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,887
He said you came to him,
admitted everything,

866
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,726
and offered him a
settlement to keep quiet.

867
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,798
We didn't admit anything and
that settlement is sealed.

868
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,892
Oh, you mean this settlement?

869
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,397
We had an agreement.

870
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,304
Well, here's the thing about
paying people off, Evan.

871
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,436
Someone can always
pay them more.

872
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,911
(SIGHS)

873
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,676
His word won't hold up
against Richard Mclntyre's.

874
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,616
Oh, he's not saying that Richard
Mclntyre put him up to it.

875
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,847
He's saying you did.
That's bullshit.

876
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,655
And does that really matter?

877
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,153
What do you want?

878
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,320
You made the author
of that report disappear.

879
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,921
You made
Joe Henderson disappear.

880
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,465
Figure out a way
to make the witness

881
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,194
against Donna change her tune.

882
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,098
That's obstruction of justice.

883
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,364
That's not my problem.

884
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,498
You son of a bitch.

885
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,607
It's your call.

886
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,839
Maybe people will believe
Joe, maybe they won't.

887
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,172
But instead of making money,

888
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:39,182
you're going to be defending yourself
in court for the next five years.

889
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,614
You're so sure we did this,

890
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,348
you're really going to let us get away
with "murder" for your secretary?

891
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,548
You're damn right I am.

892
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,854
And if I had to do it
again, I'd do it 100 times.

893
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,171
What's that?

894
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,141
You know what it is.

895
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,777
Jeff... Jessica, you were right.

896
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,647
We either need to have both
or it's not going to work.

897
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,311
And you don't want both.

898
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,253
Effectively immediately, I'm
tendering my resignation.

899
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,392
Then, I wish you luck.

900
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,865
Good luck, Jessica.

901
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,219
Do you remember? (CHUCKLES) Yes.
Of course I remember,

902
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,194
it happened right there.

903
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,292
Well, it was your fault
because you made me

904
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,063
burst out laughing.
You didn't just burst,

905
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,601
you spat a piece of
shrimp across the room

906
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,969
and into the back
of my mother's hair.

907
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,769
(BOTH LAUGHING)

908
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,407
And she didn't even feel it
because of all the hairspray.

909
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,207
It was stuck in there
like a tick.

910
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,111
Oh, my God. I could
hardly look at her

911
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,116
or that boyfriend for
the next two hours.

912
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,583
What was his name again?
Who cares?

913
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,415
He was such a loser.
Come on.

914
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,287
He was the reason you had
that God-awful party

915
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,881
in the first place.
(CHUCKLES)

916
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,588
(SIGHS)

917
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,632
Thank you, Harvey.

918
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,699
You don't need to thank me.
You already thanked me.

919
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,430
No. I thanked
you for fixing it.

920
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,196
Now, I'm thanking you for not
bringing it up all night.

921
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,734
I just figured if you wanted it
brought up, you'd bring it up.

922
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,542
And now you have, so, um...

923
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,379
I told you I'd never let
anything happen to you,

924
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,552
and I won't ever.

925
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,694
So, you don't ever have to
feel scared like that again.

926
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,163
I thought you said you
didn't do the comfort thing.

927
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,768
I didn't say I didn't do it.
I said I didn't have time

928
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,139
because I was so busy
saving your ass.

929
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,408
I'm sorry I doubted you.

930
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,348
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

931
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,895
If anyone else ever
loses faith in me,

932
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,933
it doesn't matter.

933
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,364
But with you, it's different.

934
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,167
<i>I see nothing</i>

935
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,448
I should go.

936
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,115
Why?

937
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,159
You know why.

938
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,459
You know I love you, Donna.

939
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,439
<i>Fade into you</i>

940
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:41,681
<i>Strange you never knew</i>

941
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:52,028
<i>I think it's strange
you never knew</i>
