<i>To the outside world, I'm

other meta-humans like me.</i>

<i>I hunted down the man

7

When you created the Singularity

15
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,622
above Central City, you
also created a breach

16
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:42,258
<i>between my world and yours,
connecting our two earths.</i>

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,978
<i>52 breaches in Central City

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>just happens to be in our basement.</i>

19
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,681
<i>The person who broke
into my facility last night</i>

20
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,300
was Harrison Wells.

21
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,653

Hello.

00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,033
my name is Harrison Wells.

- We know you.
- [applause]

27
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,789
Today, the future has arrived.

28
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,792
Our city has seen incredible...

29
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:19,529
impossible things:
meta-humans... men and women...

30
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,331
with extraordinary abilities:

31
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,633
the ability to soar above buildings,

32
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:27,537
to run faster than the speed of light.

33
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,973
Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans

34
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:33,393
have chosen the wrong path
with these powers, a dark path.

35
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:36,479
My team and I at S.T.A.R.
Labs are committed

36
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,316
to keeping up with these perilous times,

37
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,551
and so may I present to you our new line

38
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,386

[applause]

40
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:54,998
This technology will allow you
to instantly detect

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
the presence of a meta-human.

42
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,868
You'll be instantly alerted
to an approaching speedster,

43
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,170
like Zoom or like...

Welcome, Flash.

48
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,686
Tell them the truth, Dr. Wells.

49
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,972
Everything that has happened
to this city the past two years

50
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,390
is because of you.

51
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:22,025
You created all of us metas.

52
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:24,394
- You created Zoom.
- [crowd gasps]

53
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,862
I created Zoom?

54
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,697
11 hours before the first meta sighting,

55
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:29,816
enormous blasts of dark matter radiation

56
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,818
were silently expelled beneath this lab.

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,270
I'm sorry, Flash,
I believe all this fast running

58
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,705
may have scrambled your brain.

59
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:38,158
You take no responsibility for the wreckage

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,743
your mistakes have caused.

61
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:42,579
Admit it, Wells, and then
maybe you can truly

62
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,781
help me do something about it.

63
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:46,616
Help you, because I'm
the greatest tech entrepreneur

64
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,967
of all time?

65
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,753
You're the superhero,

66
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:51,671
and we would all be safe

67
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:55,425

your job and stop Zoom.

your autobiography,

So let me get this straight.

You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,531
and is responsible for both Ronnie

86
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,015
and Eddie's deaths?

87
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,183
Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger

88
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,952
of the Dr. Wells that we knew

89
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,487
because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over

90
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,873
by the Reverse Flash,
who was really Eobard Thawne

91
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:04,577
and Eddie's distant
relative from the future.

92
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,579
Yeah, I didn't follow
any of that. I'm my own man.

93
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,864
I had nothing to do with the murder

94
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,198
of your mother or your friend Ricky.

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,050
- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

96
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,636
You told me you have
proof of your identity?

97
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,923
This almost hit me
when I went through the portal.

98
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,875
Your stabilized breach
downstairs connects directly

99
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:20,894
to the S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

100
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,262
Technically, this could be mine,

101
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,397
but I want to run some tests on you.

102
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,849
I'll be genetically indistinguishable

103
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:26,983
from my Earth-1 counterpart.

104
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,401
Your tests will reveal nothing.

105
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:29,652
Great! Still gonna run 'em.

106
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:30,904
Be my guest.

107
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,605
Why are we even listening to him?

108
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,390
How do we know he's not evil
like the other guy?

109
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:35,909
He saved my life last night.

110
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,694
The question is why.

111
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,395
I'm guessing you didn't
travel between dimensions

112
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,613
just to meet The Flash.

113
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,282
That's exactly what I did.

114
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:45,368
I came here to help you, Barry,
to stop your greatest enemy.

115
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,736
He already did that.

116
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,371
I'm not talking about Reverse Flash.

117
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,874
I'm talking about Zoom.

118
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,258
I see you've already heard of him.

119
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,761
Yeah, Zoom has been sending meta-humans

120
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:57,347
from your world through
the breaches to fight me.

121
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,799
Well, they're the symptoms.

122
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,534
Zoom's the plague,

123
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,154
one that's infected my world,
and now he's coming for yours.

124
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:07,524
- What do you know about Zoom?
- Everything.

125
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,828
I created Zoom.

126
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,380
I'm responsible for all
the Earth-2 meta-humans,

127
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,832
a fact I've ignored for far too long,

128
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:18,836
but now I'm doing something about it.

129
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,054
Yeah, well, we're batting a thousand

130
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,006

134
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:32,816
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

135
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:35,152
He will never allow there
to be another speedster

136
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:36,737
in the multiverse,
and he's gonna keep sending

137
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,439
these metas here, one after the next,

138
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,908
all with the same goal:

139
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,827
to kill The Flash
unless we stop him together.

140
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,363

00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,451
We lost people we cared about.

143

Everyone loses someone
they care about, Snow.

He broke into Mercury Labs.

What? Why didn't you tell me this?

163
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,794
Because I didn't believe her.

164
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:52,128
I didn't even want
to consider Wells was alive.

165

Eddie erased that Wells from existence.

00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:01,688
How can you even look at him?

169
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,473
You think this is easy for me?

170
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,777

You shooting him... that's not helping.

we were free of Wells.

178
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,261
by somebody from our past.

179
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:27,097
I better go fill in Iris.

180
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,999
Good luck.

181
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,138
I hope you're happy, Linda.

182
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,723
Tanner's lawyers are threatening to sue us.

183
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,174
I'm sorry, Chief.

184
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:39,977
I don't care how many
touchdowns Tanner throws.

185
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,313
I'm not interviewing some
roided out jerk who hit his wife

186
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,347
unless it's to hold him accountable

187
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,783
for domestic violence.

188
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:48,568
All right, run your story, Park.

189
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,738
The sports page used to be
a lot less complicated.

190
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,624
She shoots.

191
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:57,911
- [imitates swish] She scores.
- Larkin, the best editor I've ever worked for.

192
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,329
It's just, every once in a while,

193
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:00,861
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

194
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:03,062
[both laugh]

195
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:11,404
But that's not really him,

196
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,740
the Wells who Eddie gave his life to stop?

197
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,126
Apparently not.

198
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,945
[sighs]

199
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,247
That's life in Central City
these days, right?

200
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,217
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine, really.

201
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:26,686
Good.

202
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:27,854
I want to keep you that way.

203
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:30,056
- Dad.
- Take it.

204
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,775
I taught you how to use it for a reason.

205
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,643
And I'm praying that Barry's right

206
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,061
and this Wells means us no harm.

207
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,596
Last year, you had Eddie
to look out for you,

208
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:41,100
but now, you can't murder somebody

209
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:45,205
that everybody thinks is dead, right?

210
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:47,374
Put it away.

211
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,546
You do realize that when I said

212
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,714
I wanted a drink, I didn't
mean a latte, right?

213
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,115
I was talking about alcohol.

214
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,834
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

215
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,303
All right, look, you got give
him a chance, okay?

216
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,055
He's not a speedster.

217
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:06,459
He's just a regular, normal guy
from another universe.

218
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:09,179
I never thought I'd miss time travel.

219
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,397
Time travel, huh?

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,349
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi!

221
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,268
[laughs] Is there a meta-human
who can time travel?

222
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,404
Time... no. Time travel's not real.

223
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,688
'Cause that would be pretty cool!

224
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,024
Not so sure about that.

225
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:23,326
Patty, you know Cisco Ramon, right?

226
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,478
Yeah, you're the scientific
advisor on meta-humans

227
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,746
to the CCPD, right?

228
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,448
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

229
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,450
Hey, Barr, did you hear
I was right about King Shark?

230
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,869
King Shark? Nice name. I like her.

231
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,504
Yeah, yeah, King Shark
almost ate The Flash.

232
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,373
Oh, nah, I'm sure The Flash had it handled.

233
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,324
Oh, no, I was there. I saw it all.

234
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,093
Some hooded guy saved his life.

235
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,212
Wait, and you're not,
like, traumatized or anything?

236
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,547
I just watched a half man-half shark

237
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,349
take on the fastest man alive.

238
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,885
[laughs] I love this city.

239
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,671
- [phone vibrates]
- See... sorry.

240
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,390
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

241
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,776
He wants me to write my police report.

242
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,728
Uh, you maybe want to write it with me?

243
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,848
Uh, I can't tonight.
I'm busy. Um, yeah, sorry.

244
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,149
Oh, yeah, okay.

245
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,951
I've just got science stuff.

246
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:07,854
Stuff I gotta science the stuff out of.

247
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,456
Maybe next time.

248
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,826
- Yeah! Coolio.
- Yeah.

249
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,794
But I'm gonna actually skip the coffee

250
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,379
and go get a head start, so...

251
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,998
- Oh.
- Good to see you guys.

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

253
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,002
- For real?
- Stop, all right?

254
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,304
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark

255
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,039
tried to eat me, and then
Dr. Wells the sequel showed up.

256
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,724
Okay, can we not use the name "Dr. Wells"?

257
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,342
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

258
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:30,894
Okay. Harry, yeah.

259
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,712
Listen, there's always
gonna be Harrys out there,

260
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:34,264
but you can't let the Harrys of the world

261
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,149
get in the way of you living your life.

262
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,600
Ask Patty out.

263
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,436
You gotta... you gotta be bold.

264
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,987
That's tough talk.

265
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:45,358
When was the last time
you asked a girl for her number?

266
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,993
Watch and learn.

267
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:49,228
I'm watching.

268
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,948
Hi. What can I get you?

269
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,368
- Hi, there.
- Hi... again.

270
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,570
Uh...

271
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,407
Do you want some coffee?

272
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,625
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.

273
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,711
No, uh, no, I don't want coffee.

274
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,179
You know what I do want though?

275
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,681
I want to ask you this.

276
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,583
Do you want to go out with me?

277
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,437
Oh.

278
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,924
To... we... I mean, we could
go get coffee or we...

279
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:21,561
No.

280
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:23,596
That's a no.

281
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:26,533
That's totally cool. It's cool.

282
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,901
Respect.

283
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,820
[rock music playing]

284
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:41,131
[woman whimpering]

285
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,084
<i>[tense music]</i>

286
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,230
Yo, dude, you good? It's her loss.

287
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:58,932
[breathes deeply]

288
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,350
Hey, what's up?

289
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,735
We have another breacher.

290
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:03,069
What? How do you know?

291
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,771
Central City Bank. You gotta go now!

292
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:05,772
All right.

293
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:07,991
[breathes heavily]

294
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,448
You got my attention.

295
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,250
Flash.

296
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,455
[grunting]

297
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:37,017
Her name is Doctor Light. [exhales]

298
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,269
Small-time thief on my Earth until exposure

299
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:41,355
to the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator

300
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,306
and became a meta-human with the ability

301
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,492
to derive power from starlight.

302
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:47,027
Oh, very cool.

303
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,813
Stars having a temperature
of 5,300 degree kelvin

304
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,148
and a blinding luminosity, I would say,

305
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,723
"Not very cool at all."

306
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,524
You know, our Dr. Wells may have been evil,

307
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,076
but you're just a dick.

308
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,029
Okay, so obviously, Zoom brought her here

309
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,664
from your Earth like the others.

310
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,716
Mm-hmm. Now that we know that,

311
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,301
we can use that to gain advantage.

312
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:05,919
What do you mean?

313
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:10,641
We capture Doctor Light
and use her to lure Zoom here.

314
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,209
You are insane!

315
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,377
Okay, we are not luring Zoom anywhere!

316
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,646
Apparently, they know each other,

317
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,097
and Jay is not a fan.

318
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,148
Huh.

319
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,650
Well, well, well.

320
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:22,553
Like everyone else, I assumed
Earth-2 Flash was dead.

321
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,554
Why am I not surprised
to find Jay Garrick here,

322
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:28,692
still alive and in hiding
a full universe away from Zoom?

323
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm not in hiding.

324
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:33,080
Zoom nearly killed me and stole my speed

325
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,781
before the Singularity pulled me here.

326
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,283
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

327
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,702
Well, whatever the case, in your absence,

328
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:42,289
Zoom has only gotten more powerful, faster.

329
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,259
Barry, you have to defeat Zoom
now while you still can.

330
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:47,077
No, this isn't the time to be reckless.

331
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,929
We don't even know
why Zoom sent Doctor Light here.

332
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:50,681
She's a thief, not a killer.

333
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:52,432
Zoom can make people
do things out of character.

334
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,218
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

335
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,636
All right, look, hey,

336
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,771
we can decide what to do with Light later.

337
00:13:57,773 --> 00:14:00,357
First, we have to find her, okay?

338
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,528
- [slurps]
- [sighs]

339
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,763
Hey, how did you know

340
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,649
that she was breaking into the bank?

341
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,601
I got an alert on my phone.

342
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,603
There is a little ring-a-ding
[imitates ring]

343
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:14,905
every time, like, there's
a robbery at a bank.

344
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,456
- What?
- But you know what?

345
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,375
I think I can get the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

346
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,744
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

347
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:24,081
and we can find Doctor Light's light.

348
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:28,418
Okay, I'm gonna also call Joe,
see if CCPD has any leads.

349
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,255
Why don't we keep them apart
until I get back?

350
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:33,890
I am sure that won't be a problem.

351
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,761
[sighs]

352
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,182
[elevator bell dings]

353
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,685
[sighs]

354
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,103
- Hey!
- Hey.

355
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:47,771
How's your science stuff?

356
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:48,972
I finished it.

357
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,574
Um, did you get your report done?

358
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:55,579
It wasn't as much fun
writing it by myself, but...

360
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,813
[laughs] I'll see ya.

361
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,648
Yeah.

362
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,036
Hey, do you ever feel
completely overwhelmed

363
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,321
by everything that you have to do in a day

364
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:05,956
and it feels like the one thing

365
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,959
that you actually want to do
is the thing that gets lost?

366
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,627
I'm confused. What?

367
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,264
I've been thinking, for
a while now actually,

368
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,049
would you want to get dinner
with me sometime?

369
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,518
Yeah, this isn't gonna be one those things

370
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,188
where I get really excited
and then, you know,

371
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,689
more science stuff comes up, right?

372
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,809
No, no, that's not... um, tomorrow?

373
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,311
We can grab an early dinner.

374
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,896
I don't want to wait anymore.

375
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:34,351
Okay. Looking forward to it.

Hey, Harry.

381
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,803
Hey, over here.

382
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,172
- Hey!
- [volume lowers]

383
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:58,392
Come inside. Use my workroom.
Use my computer!

384
00:15:58,394 --> 00:16:00,310
- I don't care!
- Thanks.

385
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:02,212
You and Wells prime have
very different musical tastes.

386
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:03,647
His were better.

387
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:06,817
This Harrison Wells and
I are very different

388
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,235
but similar in some respects.

389
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,320
I see he made almost the same mistake I did

390
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,721
with the Particle Accelerator.

391
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,323
He did a lot of terrible things,

392
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,659
and none of them were by mistake.

393
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:18,695
What did he do to you?

394
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:20,280
I know he caused the Singularity,

395
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:22,366
murdered Barry's mother,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

396
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:23,834
What did he do to you?

397
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,836
You can barely look me in the eye.

398
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,621
Why is that? What did he do to you?

399
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:30,874
He shoved his hand through my chest.

400
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,042
He stopped my heart.

401
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,094
[chuckles]

402
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:36,847
Ouch, okay, that would do it,

403
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:39,349
but you survived that.

404
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,919
Only because Barry erased that timeline.

405
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,255
I see. Barry traveled in time.

406
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:49,693
- Twice.
- Hmm.

407
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,945
- Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

408
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,563
You don't have to like me.

409
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:55,232
I don't like you,

410
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:58,568
but you have to work with me
to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.

411
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,288
Can you do that?

412
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,605
I guess we'll see, won't we?

413
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,541
I guess we will.

414
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:06,543
One more thing...

415
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:07,944
you said you were going to re-task

416
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:09,746
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

417
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,048
To scan for solar emissions,
yeah, we're up and running.

418
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,250
I'd like to examine your program.

419
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,584
I want to see if it works.

420
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:16,786
Don't worry. It'll work.

421
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,795
Harry's starting to get on my nerves.

422
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:28,231
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

423
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,600
- That's gotta be Doctor Light.
- Could be a trap.

424
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:32,569
Barry, trust me, Doctor
Light is not a killer.

425
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,405
- You can talk to her.
- Okay.

426
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,996
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

427
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,419
Looking for this?

428
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,421
I know Zoom sent you here to kill me.

429
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,206
Good news, you don't have to do that.

430
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,824
Not if I can get out of
town with that cash.

431
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,426
And then what?

432
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,295
Zoom's not gonna like
that you ditched him, right?

433
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,046
My friends and I can help you.

434
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,166
Nobody can protect me from Zoom!

435
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,384
All right, why don't we take it down

436
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,003
a lumen, have a normal conversation,

437
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,339
all right?

438
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:11,107
Thank you.

439
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,011
Linda?

440
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:17,781
- Linda Park?
- How do you know my name?

441
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:19,783
I don't understand.

442
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:22,786
This was a mistake.

443
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,622
[grunts]

444
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,290
[panting]

445
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,742
<i>Barry, what's happening?</i>

446
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:32,045
I can't see. Guys, I can't see.

447
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:38,110
I still can't see.

448
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,629
How long is this gonna last?

449
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:41,547
You're suffering from solar retinopathy.

450
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,616
Your retinas are severely damaged.

451
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,168
You're lucky you're not permanently blind.

452
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,170
But with your rapid regeneration abilities,

453
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:48,421
your sight should return soon.

454
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,649
6.25 hours by my estimation.

455
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,568
All this could have been avoided
if you just stopped Light

456
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,136
instead of chitchatting with her.

457
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,637
She caught Barry off guard.

458
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,573
Always an excuse with you, right?

459
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:59,608
He's the fastest man alive.
How could she possibly do that?

460
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,944
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend,

461
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:03,946
Linda Park.

462
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,582
That's why Zoom sent her...
because he knew you'd hesitate.

463
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,417
That means Zoom had to have known somehow

464
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,035
that Linda was your ex.

465
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,004
Which is why Barry has to act now,

466
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:14,340
before Zoom sends another double
from Barry's life.

467
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,125
All right, right now,
I'm more worried about Linda.

468
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:19,428
When I saw who was
under the mask, I said her name.

469
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,163
What if Light didn't even
realize that she had

470
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,015
a doppelganger here
until I accidentally told her?

471
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,833
The first thing that Atom Smasher did

472
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:27,136
when he crossed the breach
was to kill his doppelganger.

473
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,971
Yeah, but Light's not like Atom Smasher.

474
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,673
We should keep an eye on your Linda.

475
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,558
All right, I'll go.

476
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,726
- Oh!
- Sorry.

477
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:34,944
- Bro.
- Barry!

478
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,812
- What? Ooh!
- Okay, okay.

479
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,272
You can't do anything
until your sight returns.

480
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:42,025
No, no, no, come on,
here's the little rail here.

481
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,695
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you!

482
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,196
- Hey, Barry!
- Hey.

483
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,915
I came as soon as I heard...

484
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,784
You look just like him.

485
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,419
I'm guessing my counterpart
did something to offend her

486
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,587
as well?

487
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,622
Her fiancé died because of him.

488
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,624
Oh.

489
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,381
Iris, I know it's weird seeing him.

490
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,433
Yeah, it's just a lot to process lately.

491
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,769
Wells, my mother.

492
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:11,337
How are you doing with that, by the way?

493
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:14,674
I mean, now that she's gone,

494
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:16,693
okay.

495
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,562
Yeah, Iris, um, look...

496
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:19,730
Yeah. [giggles]

497
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,031
Thanks.

498
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,016
You know you can talk to me about it.

499
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:26,036
Yeah, I know, but really, I'm fine, okay?

500
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,788
I should be asking how you're doing.

501
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,374
- [phone vibrating]
- That's me. I got it.

502
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,209
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it.

503
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:34,378
- All right.
- [laughs]

504
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,197
Uh, "Running a little late. P."

505
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,131
Who's P?

506
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,366
[sighs] P.

507
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:42,302
- That's Patty.
- My dad's partner Patty?

508
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,536
Mm-hmm.

509
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:44,805
What is she running late for?

510
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,924
Um, our first date.

511
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,811
That's so great! She's great.

512
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,013
Yeah, no, Patty's great.
I just, you know...

513
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,681
I doubt she's gonna give me another shot

514
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:55,882
when I have to cancel on her.

515
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:57,401
Don't cancel.

516
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,986
I'm blind, Iris. A literal blind date.

517
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,054
It's not gonna work.

518
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,555
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs.

519
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:03,940
Come on, there's gotta be something here

520
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,575
that can help you get through the night.

521
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,727
Yeah.

522
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,497
Or someone.

523
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,368
Cisco, hey!

524
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,571
- To your left. Other left.
- Cisco.

525
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,177
[jazz music playing]

526
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,846
Sorry.

527
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:30,416
Ooh, sorry.

528
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:34,304
Okay. She's two steps in front of you.

529
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,090
- Nice glasses.
- Hey, hey!

530
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,092
- Touchdown.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

531
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:40,644
No, don't be.

532
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:42,229
You know, I actually judge
my dates on whether or not

533
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,648
they stand me up,
so you are off to a great start.

534
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,366
What do you mean? Who would stand you up?

535
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,118
Oh, I have a reputation.

536
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,205
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

537
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,207
[laughs] That's embarrassing.

538
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,543
You know, I actually...
I arrested a boyfriend once.

539
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:57,911
Oh.

540
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,913
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

541
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:02,916
He got really wasted and decided
to insult the waitress,

542
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:05,051
so I cited him for public intoxication.

543
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,254
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah.

544
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:10,257
[both laugh] Special.

545
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,476
So...

546
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,977
<i>Dude, she looks amazing.</i>

547
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,812
<i>You have to tell her how amazing she looks.</i>

548
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,931
You look amazing, Patty.

549
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,901
Uh, thanks, I actually
had a really hard time

550
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,686
trying to figure out what to wear, like,

551
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,572
if I should wear a dress or if
this color was a little weird.

552
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,140
No, you look great.

553
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:31,244
Um, yeah, no, that...
what would you call that color?

554
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,446
<i>- Um, uh...</i>
- I can't tell.

555
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,031
The feed's black and white. <i>I don't know.</i>

556
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,334
Yeah, whatever it is,
that color should thank you

557
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:38,702
for wearing it.

558
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,504

- Not smooth.

Oh, wine list. Here we go.

562
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,598
Uh, yes, uh, got it. Thank you.

563
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,933
Um...

564
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,352
Um, you know, why don't you... Oop!

565
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,937
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

566
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,772
The guy always picks. Why don't you choose?

567
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:02,842
Yeah, what do you want, red or white?

568
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:04,945
Whatever you'd like. Uh, yeah.

569
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,347
You got this. Why do you even need me?

570
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,856
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

571
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:17,958
Classic stakeout fuel.

572
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,292
Yeah.

573
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:21,194
You have coffee on your Earth, right?

574
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:23,580
I think coffee's the one
constant in the multiverse.

575

[both laugh]

576
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,586
So I don't mean to pry,
but when Wells keeps referring

577
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,372
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

578
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:34,207
I fought Zoom many times,

579
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,476
each time barely escaping with my life.

580
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:40,263
[sighs] So yeah.

581
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,315
Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

582
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,850
Truth is, Zoom scared me.

583
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:48,021
He stole the most precious thing
from me: my speed.

584
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:50,056
I didn't want Barry to
suffer the same fate.

585
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,492
Well, maybe if you just
sat down with Wells,

586
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:53,994
talked to him about it...

587
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:55,996
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells, Caitlin.

588
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:57,563
The guy was more than happy to make money

589
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:59,416
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps,

590
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:01,334
and now he's obsessed with Zoom.

591
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:04,671
Something has changed and not
just because I disappeared.

592
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:10,260
Well, I don't trust Wells. I trust you.

595
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:16,516
So I've actually been dying to ask you,

596
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:17,851
what was it like to be struck by lightning?

597
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:21,421
Mm. Life-changing, to be honest.

598
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:23,023
Did it hurt?

599
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:25,609
I mean, all I really remember
is feeling electricity

600
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:27,027
surging through my body.

601
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,095
<i>It was an intensity I had never felt,</i>

602
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:33,700
<i>like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.</i>

603
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,869
<i>Then I woke up from a coma
nine months later.</i>

604
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:37,603
<i>Waking up in the future like that,</i>

605
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:40,440
<i>it's like time travel.</i>

606
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:41,741
[all chuckle]

607
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,326
<i>- Sort of, yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

608
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,963
When I was nine, I actually drowned.

609
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,581
I hit my head on the diving board

610
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,250
and fell into the swimming pool.

611
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:53,286
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

612
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:56,056
until my dad rescued me and saved my life.

613
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:57,424
Yeah.

614
00:24:57,426 --> 00:25:00,427
So I guess we've both cheated death.

615
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:01,978
[both laugh]

616
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,813
I've been through a few things in my life

617
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,982
that taught me not to
be afraid of anything.

618
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,633
I think fear is what holds people back

619
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:09,686
from being who they should be.

620
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,988
Ugh, preach!

621

You okay?

624
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:20,196
Sorry, I just...
Yeah, I really agree with that.

00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:22,082
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:27,537
I think another thing, too,
I think you can't see me.

627
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,256
- Abort!
- What? What do you mean?

628
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:32,092
I think you can't see me.

629
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:33,677
Come on, I would not be a good detective

630
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,178
if I couldn't have figured this one out.

631
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,131

- Barry.

Oh, my God! Barry!

637
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,146
And I really didn't want to cancel.

No, you have a great smile.

640
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:03,156
Really, how do you know I'm smiling?

641
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,290
Just a hunch.

is different about our worlds?

Do you have Tahiti?

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,534
Never been, but I do love Atlantis.

646
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,469
As in the lost city submerged
in the ocean somewhere?

647
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:19,038
Well, it's actually above
water on my Earth.

648
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,473
One of my best friends is from there.

649
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:21,874

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,258
I'm alive, thanks to Iris.

708
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,144
Turns out she's as badass
with a gun as she is with a pen.

709
00:29:44,146 --> 00:29:45,629
Yeah, she is.

710
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:46,964
I'm just happy that you're safe.

711
00:29:46,966 --> 00:29:48,515
I've arranged a security detail

712
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:49,984
around the clock, just to be sure.

713
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:51,852
I can take you to them if you're ready.

714
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:54,137
Yeah.

715
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:58,275
[indistinct radio chatter]

716
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:00,110
This is because of me.
I should've been here.

717
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:01,495
Barry, you were blind.

718
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:03,280
There's nothing that you could have done.

719
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,449
You think this mask
can help us find that woman?

720
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,952
Any evidence on this
is just gonna match Linda.

721
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:09,837
I'll think of something else.

722
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,006
Light's not gonna kill again.

723
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,710
Caitlin, are you guys okay?

724
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:19,329
- Yeah.
- Barry, I'm sorry.

725
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,664
Doctor Light's never killed before.

726
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,466
I thought we could reason with her.

727
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:26,136
You cannot reason with someone
under Zoom's influence,

728
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,605
and now a man is dead
because of you, Garrick.

729
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,441
This whole thing is because of you.

730
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,109
He doubts himself because of you,

731
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:34,778
but believe me,
Barry can do what you could not.

732
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,280
Barry can stop Zoom.

733
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:38,065
I spent two years hunting Zoom.

734
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:41,485
Wrong! Zoom hunted you!

735
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,454
You spent the last two years of your life

736
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,956
running, running, running from Zoom.

737
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,292
Zoom would have killed me
just like he will kill Barry

738
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:49,860
if you lead him down this path!

739
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:51,712
No, because he is not like you.

740
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:54,214
Barry runs towards danger, not from it,

741
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:56,383
because Barry's not a coward.

742
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:59,386
[both grunting]

743
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,014
Enough!

<i>You were pretty hard on Jay in there.</i>

746
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:19,773
Maybe you should be hard on Jay too.

747
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,408
I've seen what you can do, Barry.

748
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,827
I've calculated how fast you can run,

749
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:27,081
and you should be teaching Jay,
not the other way around.

750
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:34,121
You know, before I learned
that the other Wells

751
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:38,042
was the man who murdered my mom,
I looked up to him.

752
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:40,210
He was my mentor, actually.

753
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:47,518
So my doppelganger,

754
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,920
a man who looks exactly like me,

755
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,889
betrayed you.

756
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:53,223
Mm.

757
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:55,476
I'm sorry, I'm not him,

758
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:58,362
so you need to listen to me
when I say you can

759
00:31:58,364 --> 00:32:02,483
take care of Zoom, and all we have to do

760
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,284
[snaps fingers] is capture Doctor Light.

761
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:08,105
I thought about testing
the mask for Light's DNA,

762
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:09,606
but it would only have Linda's.

763
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,709
The mask, what mask?

764
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,244
Light's mask.

765
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:18,332
How did you get this?

766
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,384
Iris shot it off Doctor Light
when she attacked Linda.

767
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:22,336
You know how to use the mask to find Light?

768
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:23,620
Yes, I do.

769
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,289
All we have to do is give it to him.

770
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,457
Why me?

771
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,561
Because you have powers.

772

773
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:36,066
What are you talking about?

774
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:39,269
I developed this watch
to detect meta-humans.

[alarm beeps]

776
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:49,863
You never got an alert on your phone.

777
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:55,502
You never reprogrammed
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite,

778
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,087
and this is why.

779

[alarm beeps]

780
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,291
He's a meta-human.

781
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:08,932
Cisco, have you known about this,

782
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:10,200
and you didn't say anything to us?

783
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:12,168
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

784
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,336
Thanks a lot, Harry.

785
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:18,174
I swear I was, but I didn't.

786
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,678
- I was just... I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

787
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,849
Dr. Wells said the dark matter
gave me this, this gift.

788
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:30,854
He said that one day I'd thank him for it.

789
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,639
What if I become like him?

790
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:36,226
Cisco, I don't think
any of us would become evil

791
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:37,560
if we all of sudden got powers,

792
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,112
even if they were from Dr. Wells.

793
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:43,399
Yeah, maybe you're right.

794
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,451
I should have said something.

795
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:47,287
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

796
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:48,705
Well, you can be sorry later,

797
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,290
because right now, we
have to use your powers

798
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,741
to find Doctor Light.

799
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:55,111
Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?

800
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,630
Uh, I get these feelings sometimes,

I just... I'm not sure what triggers it.

804

Sometimes it just happens.

805

Sometimes it's when I'm touching
something of theirs.

806
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:10,560
Touch the mask.

807

You need to confuse her.

850
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:20,523
Give her more than one target,

851
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,941

00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:26,479
By running so fast,
you create multiple afterimages

00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:06,314
I've already had my worst nightmare.

886
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:07,766
His name was Reverse Flash,

887
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:10,685
and I spent a long time
being afraid of him.

888
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,021
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

889
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:15,357
Okay, Barry.

890
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,075
You may be faster than me,

891
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,444
but you're not ready
to fight Zoom by yourself.

892
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:21,413
That's just it, Jay.

893
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,064
I'm not gonna fight him by myself.

894
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,732
I've got all of them to help me.

895
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:27,735
I've got Dr. Wells.

896
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:29,838
I've got you.

897
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:34,259
No, I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

898
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,911
it'll only lead to you losing your speed,

899
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,746
or even worse,

900
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,748
your death.

901
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,685
Optimism must be an Earth-1 thing.

902
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:47,422
You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

903
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:49,391
wouldn't admit that he was responsible

904
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,943
for the Particle Accelerator
exploding underground.

905
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:55,363
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth,

906
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,566
but he has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

907
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:03,604
Jay, please don't go.

908
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,792
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

909
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:17,752
Have a nice day.

910
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,554
What can I get... you?

911
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,673
Yeah, I know, this is supes awkward,

912
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,224
probably more for me than for you,

913
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,260
but I just want coffee, okay?

914
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,012
Just three flashes, one of them decaf.

915
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:29,647
That's it.

916
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:36,354
Are you sure that's all you want?

917
00:39:36,356 --> 00:39:37,605
Oh, that's funny.

918
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:38,973
You just want to shoot me down again, huh?

919
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:41,409
No, no, no, no.

920
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:45,830
What I mean is, I just
moved to Central City,

921
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:49,150
and it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

922
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,952
Everything here is so big and new

923
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:53,288
and filled with meta-humans.

924
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,458
Yeah, well, when you factor in
the size of the city,

925
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,993
the chances of running
into a meta-human are

926
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:00,211
actually pretty low.

927
00:40:00,213 --> 00:40:01,629
[giggles]

928
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:03,214
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

929
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:06,768
you kinda caught me off
guard the other day,

930
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,803
but now I'm a little more prepared,

931
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:13,525
so I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

932
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,647
Hi, I'm Cisco Ramon.

933
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:21,682
Kendra Saunders.

934
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,451
It's nice to meet you.

935
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:24,819
Are you okay?

936
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,571
Yeah, I just...

937
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:29,240
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

938
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:31,793
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

939
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:35,380
They always seem to show up
just when you need 'em.

940
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:38,133
Yo, peep that.

941
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,634
Wow!

942
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:40,885
That's how it's done, young Padawan.

943
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:42,253
- Nice.
- Going on a date next week.

944
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:44,055
Things are looking up for Cisco Ramon.

945
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:45,256
I guess so.

946
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:46,874
Still stuck with these powers, though.

947
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:48,476
Just don't know how to feel about 'em.

948
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,178
Hey, look,

949
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
you don't gotta go through it alone.

950
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:54,849
And now you need a cool name.

951
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:58,319
Oh, snap! You're totally right.

952
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,238
[sighs] I gotta think about this one.

953
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,573
Well, you know me. It's gotta be perfect.

954
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:03,024
- Mm-hmm.
- Something that really sings,

955
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,409
you know?

956
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,444
Something like...

957
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:08,396
Vibe?

958
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,193
Vibe.

959
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:12,827
Vibe.

960
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,958
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

961
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,078
_

962
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:36,258
Your father has abandoned you.

963
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,676
You're lying!

964
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:40,312
My father's the smartest man alive.

965
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:44,432
He'll find me, he'll save me,
and then he'll kill you.

966
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:48,469
I will not die.

967
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,439
What happens to you and your father

968
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,743
is still to be decided.
