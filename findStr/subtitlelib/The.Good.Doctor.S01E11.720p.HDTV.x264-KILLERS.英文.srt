32
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,810
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

33
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,170
Dr. Coyle -- He's a little too friendly.

34
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,670
I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.

35
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,020
I give great massages.

36
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,460
And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.

37
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,190
That's really inappropriate.

38
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,130
I said no.

39
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,460
You're approaching insubordination.

40
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,110
You have to file a complaint with HR.

41
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,820
They will shift the blame onto me. Like you did.

42
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,390
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

43
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,180
So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?

44
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,410
Agreed. She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.

45
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,830
I don't want to have kids.

46
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,460
I don't need a therapist.

47
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,050
I want to make my own decisions.

48
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,590
I am done talking.

49
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,910
- Now let's go. - ‭No. N-No.

50
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,640
I don't want help!

51
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,370
Where would he go?

52
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,810
Is there a place he likes to hang out?

53
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,050
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

54
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,660
And there used to be a picture here.

55
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,260
It means he's not coming back.

56
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,710
Hi. Good morning.

57
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,750
I'm Aaron Glassman. Dr. Glassman.

58
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,100
I work with Shaun.

59
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,870
Hi. Nice to meet you.

60
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,280
It's nice to meet you, too. May I speak with him, please?

61
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,080
Shaun isn't here.

62
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,100
I know you've been helping Shaun, and I appreciate that,

63
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,030
but I really need to speak with him immediately.

64
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,210
I'll definitely let him know when I see him next.

65
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,530
I'm -- I'm sorry.

66
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,410
What the hell are you doing?

67
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,680
Shaun, I know you're in here.

68
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,000
I just -- I just want to talk, please.

69
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,410
You are way out of line.

70
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,740
Shaun, you have responsibilities.

71
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,190
We've got to sort this out.

72
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,670
You have five seconds to get the hell out of here...

73
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,220
- Shaun. - or I'm calling the police.

74
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,550
- Shaun, I just -- - What are --

75
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,060
I just want to...

76
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,550
- Five... - Shaun.

77
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,530
Shaun, she's calling the police.

78
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,000
- four... - Is that what you want?

79
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,870
three...

80
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,800
- two... - Okay, okay.

81
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,850
- one. - Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

82
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,870
It's just that Shaun has a-a tendency to run away from conflict.

83
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,010
And in Casper and medical school,

84
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,380
people will give you a little bit of slack, but it --

85
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,060
now he's in a very hard-to-get job

86
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,960
in a very competitive environment

87
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,170
where people do not give you a second chance.

88
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,560
Still, not cool.

89
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,510
If you speak with him will you call me, please?

90
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,770
Out.

91
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,010
Yeah.

92
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
So, what's your plan now?

93
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,860
I don't know.

94
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,410
I gotta say, he seems like a nebby, old jerk.

95
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,180
And a bully.

96
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,850
What's "Nebby"?

97
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,210
Nosey. It's a Pittsburgh thing.

98
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,910
I mean, you're a grown man.

99
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,570
If you don't want to talk to him, it's none of his business.

100
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,410
San Jose is too big.

101
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,850
I get not liking San Jose.

102
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,170
I'm not the biggest fan myself, but --

103
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,290
I don't want to see a therapist.

104
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,440
So don't.

105
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,770
I should go back to Casper.

106
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,920
I have a rule.

107
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,420
Never make an important decision while you are angry,

108
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,570
upset, high, or right before or after having sex.

109
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,060
Okay, you are overworked, stressed out,

110
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,350
and pissed off at your boss.

111
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,070
Now is not the time to be making a big decision.

112
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,470
You need to take a break, clear your head.

113
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,760
You need a vacation.

114
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,040
I have to work five more months before I earn a vacation.

115
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,290
So call in sick.

116
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,070
I'm not sick.

117
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,950
You're so adorable.

118
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,170
You don't have to be sick to call in sick.

119
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,420
Ah, I have so much to teach you, Grasshopper.

120
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,550
And I'm gonna start with a good, old-fashioned road trip.

121
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,360
It's the perfect way to get your mojo back.

122
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
And when we return,

123
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,180
you're gonna know exactly what to do about

124
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,480
San Jose, therapy, and Glassy the Grouch.

125
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,520
And all you have to do

126
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,130
to attain this superior wisdom and knowledge

127
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,020
is to call...in...sick.

128
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,340
Okay. Okay. I will.

129
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,330
Dr. Melendez. Got a case for you.

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,820
My schedule's pretty packed today.

131
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,200
It's a patient of mine. She needs a kidney transplant.

132
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,490
You have a donor?

133
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,040
Her identical twin -- a perfect DNA match.

134
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,350
Why is she a patient of yours?

135
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,030
I put balloon tissue expanders under both girls' scalps

136
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,190
to prepare them for the separation surgery.

137
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,790
Separation surgery?

138
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,580
It's in six months, after they recover from the transplant.

139
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
Of course, if you're too busy...

140
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,830
No. I'm in.

141
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,970
- Where's Murphy? - He's not here yet.

142
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,270
Wrong day to be late. We're already shorthanded.

143
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,380
- Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that. - I did not fire Kalu.

144
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,430
And if you have a problem with it, talk to Andrews.

145
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,750
Although, if you want my advice, don't have a problem with it.

146
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,150
Andrews is waiting to brief us on a new case.

147
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,750
It's a kidney transplant on craniopagus twins.

148
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,280
Conjoined?

149
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,670
They're connected at the skull.

150
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,410
Their entire renal-vascular systems are interdependent.

151
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,900
Cool.

152
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,670
Have either of you talked to Shaun?

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,990
- No. - No, which isn't unusual.

154
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,890
Is anything wrong?

155
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,220
No, no, not with Shaun. It's a family emergency.

156
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,760
He's gonna be out for a few days.

157
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,110
He's supposed to get approval

158
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,820
for any personal days from his attending.

159
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,210
Right, which is why I'm checking in.

160
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,770
I think he thought it was enough just to notify me.

162
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,420
You call in sick?

163
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,570
I'm ready to go.

164
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,690
No, you're not.

165
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,070
You're gonna need more than a family photo and a toothbrush.

166
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,840
Go pack.

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,070
Uh, where are we going?

168
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,410
Wherever the car takes us.

169
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,450
I don't like the beach.

170
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,340
Okay, I will let the car know.

171
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,040
Even with your cardiovascular issues,

172
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,780
a kidney transplant is a relatively safe procedure,

173
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,610
especially since, with identical twins,

174
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,240
there's no chance for organ rejection.

175
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,620
Just make sure you keep straight which one's which.

176
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,250
The charming, pretty one has the good kidneys.

177
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,800
Don't worry. We always triple confirm.

178
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,120
And we put everything in writing.

179
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,080
And you're both charming and pretty.

180
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,620
It was a joke, Mom.

181
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,990
And smart.

183
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,800
They're gonna be Ivy Leaguers in the fall.

184
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,250
Yale and Harvard.

185
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,850
Mom, you don't have to tell everyone you meet

186
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,130
- where we're going to college. - Yes, I do.

187
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,790
That's awesome. Congratulations.

189
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,250
So, who's going where?

190
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,280
What do you think? She's totally obnoxious

191
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,140
and thinks she's way funnier than she is.

192
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,290
Definitely Harvard.

193
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,530
Hey, don't make me start mocking your tattoo.

194
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,000
I thought you would have your entire apartment

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,130
strapped to your back.

196
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,020
- It takes me a long time to pack. - ‭That's good.

197
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,660
An anal-retentive packer is the exact type of person

198
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,980
I'd want operating on me.

199
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,240
Lea, this -- this is your car.

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna take my other one.

201
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay. What do you do at work?

202
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,700
Do you really care what I do, or do you just want to know

203
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,960
how someone with such a crappy apartment can afford two cars?

204
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,010
I just want to know how you can afford two cars.

205
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Yeah, I can't.

206
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,250
Uh, my Grandpa Rod died last year,

207
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,640
and he left me his most prized possession.

208
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,350
It's the S-Striped Tomato.

209
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,240
Oh, my God. You like "Starsky & Hutch"?

210
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,410
It's okay.

211
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,860
A meticulous packer and a "Starsky & Hutch" fan.

212
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,610
Grandpa Rod would have loved you.

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,530
Okay. This is it. The road.

214
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,130
You sure you want to do this?

215
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,700
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

216
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm sure.

217
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,960
Let's go, Lea.

218
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,190
Here we go!

219
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,410
I hear Murphy's AWOL.

220
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,020
He's taking a few personal days.

221
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,670
Unapproved personal days.

222
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,700
I approved them.

223
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,390
It's not your job to approve them.

224
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,260
Or to say you approved them to cover up the fact

225
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,670
that Murphy's frequent tardiness has escalated to absences.

226
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,490
What do you want me to do, take a polygraph?

227
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,990
How about we jump into enhanced interrogation?

228
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,890
Here, how about this? Do you want me to turn this on?

229
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,930
When the board was reconsidering your hiring of Murphy,

230
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,340
you assured us that if he was anything less than excellent,

231
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,560
he'd be dismissed and you would resign.

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,990
I trust you remember that.

233
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,270
I wouldn't have your movers pack up your office just yet.

234
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
You can't protect Murphy forever.

235
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,720
At some point, he needs to succeed or fail on his own.

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,990
Okay, that's three hours on the warm ischemia clock

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,850
of the transplanted kidney.

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,570
The ureter is attached to the bladder.

239
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,290
How's the kidney's placement in the iliac fossa?

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
No kinking or twisting of the renal vessel.

241
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,170
Good.

242
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,250
You ready to close?

243
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,450
Yes.

244
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,200
Your best bet is a continuous suture along the fascial layer.

245
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,920
Suture.

246
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,070
Donor's pressure's dropping.

247
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay, up the oxygen.

248
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,990
Jenny must be bleeding internally.

249
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,330
We're gonna have to open her back up.

250
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,490
Staple remover.

251
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,150
I like trees.

252
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,530
Yeah? What else do you like?

253
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,220
Besides reading medical journals

254
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,090
and watching reruns of old cop shows?

255
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,160
I like you.

256
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,930
Well, who wouldn't? I'm very likeable.

257
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,820
Why don't you like San Jose?

258
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,680
Everyone's so competitive here.

259
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,840
You know, if you didn't make a million by 30,

260
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,010
you're a total loser.

261
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,840
I don't need $1 million.

262
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,800
I don't even think I need $90,000, but...

263
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,690
You know what we both need are some tunes.

264
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,030
What's your preferred driving music?

265
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,690
M-Music -- No. N--

266
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,230
I don't like music. No. No.

267
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,170
What? No, no. Not okay.

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,070
Okay, I will give you a pass on not liking the beach

269
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,990
because you're cute

270
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,400
and I might need you to do brain surgery on me someday,

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,790
but not liking music -- unacceptable.

272
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,780
I won't have it.

273
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,310
Are you being sarcastic?

274
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,020
No. I'm being...

275
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,990
I actually don't know the word for it, but my point stands.

276
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,070
Music is amazing.

277
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,030
You know, I remember every important thing

278
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,330
that has ever happened to me

279
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,040
based on what song I was listening to at the time.

280
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,040
I remember smells.

281
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,390
Like our parking garage smells like fabric softener,

282
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,910
and when my brother died, it smelled like burnt food.

283
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,410
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

284
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,170
How did he, um... if you don't mind me asking?

285
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,060
My father was mean.

286
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,160
He killed my pet,

287
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,590
so my brother and I, we ran away.

288
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,530
Then he fell off a train we were playing on,

289
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,030
hit his head, and died.

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,130
I never went back home.

291
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,480
Dr. Glassman has watched out for me ever since.

292
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,690
Okay, so, maybe he's not that much of a nebby jerk.

293
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,590
What are you smelling right now?

294
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,770
Pine trees.

295
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,460
I'm never gonna forget

296
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,430
that when you told me about your brother and your dad,

297
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,700
it smelled like pine trees.

298
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,750
But I don't want you to ever forget

299
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,020
that right after you told me, we were listening to...

300
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,580
Ouch. No. Do not remember that.

301
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,320
Or that.

302
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,220
No, thank you.

303
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,450
Nope. Not feeling it.

304
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,450

Jenny had a post-op renal-vein rupture.

317
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,940
We were able to repair it before she lost too much blood.

318
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,690
Both your vitals are stable now,

319
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,770
and Katie's new kidney is functioning well.

320
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,800
Thank God.

321
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,410
Will her ruptured vein have any effect on our separation surgery?

322
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,610
It better not.

323
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,270
Katie, I love you,

324
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,840
but if I have to spend one minute more than

325
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,970
I have to watching you practicing some Mozart song --

326
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,000
They're not songs. They're concertos.

327
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,140
Don't worry. Six months is still the plan.

328
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,840
Look, what I did was incredibly unprofessional

329
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,900
and just...inexcusable.

330
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,780
But I'm guessing you're gonna give one anyway.

331
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,720
No.

332
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,350
No, just an explanation and a, uh...request.

333
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,700
It could help me to convince Andrews

334
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,340
I deserve a second chance.

335
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,850
Okay. Let's hear the explanation.

336
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,190
Dr. Browne and I are... seeing each other.

337
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,820
Look, if you could just put yourself in my shoes.

338
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,480
A woman I care about tells me a guy harassed her,

339
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,530
and, even worse, she tells me it's my fault

340
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,540
because I was too -- too stupidly insensitive

341
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,340
to understand what she was going through.

342
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,090
I felt like crap.

343
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,230
And like an idiot,

344
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,770
I...tried to make it up to her.

345
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,230
All I'm asking for is just a little understanding.

346
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Wouldn't you have done the same thing?

347
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,380
Not my problem.

348
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,360
Yeah?

349
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,170
Jenny's bradycardic and hypotensive.

350
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,040
- What's happening? -She was fine a minute ago.

351
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,590
We were talking, then she started to have trouble breathing.

352
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,170
Jenny's heart is failing.

353
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,530
No pulse.

354
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,920
She's in V-tach. Grab the cart, page Melendez.

355
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,630
Jenny's stable.

356
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,210
I have her on beta blockers and vasodilators,

357
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,360
but it's not gonna be enough.

358
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,590
Renal-vein rupture must have caused

359
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,680
her already weak heart to deteriorate.

360
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,790
She's in end-stage failure.

361
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,070
I'll get her on the transplant registry.

362
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,840
What are we talking? Months? Weeks?

363
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,930
Days.

364
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,480
We're not gonna find a donor heart in a few days.

365
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,850
We could disconnect her from the other body

366
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,710
her heart is partially oxygenating the blood for.

367
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,440
I was already pushing the envelope

368
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,620
to do the separation surgery

369
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,830
six months after a kidney transplant.

370
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,330
Do you really think

371
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,150
they could handle it one day after?

372
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,440
It may be our only choice.

373
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah.

375
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,770
His calls are an even bigger buzzkill than this rain

376
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,810
and defeating the whole purpose of this trip.

377
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,950
Okay.

378
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,450
Residents are not supposed to turn off their phones.

379
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,560
How about we make a deal?

380
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,310
If you turn off your phone, I'll let you drive.

381
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,200
- I don't have a driver's license. - I know.

382
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,770
- I've always wanted to learn to drive. - I know.

383
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,200
Dr. Glassman -- he never wanted me to.

384
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,990
I know.

385
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,210
Actually, I didn't know that,

386
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,090
but that definitely sounds like Glassy.

387
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,060
Okay.

388
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:28,890
Yeah?

389
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,650
You're doing awesome.

390
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,280
You're a natural.

391
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,080
Thank you.

392
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,920
I think so, too.

393
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,270
Blinker.

394
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,800
All right, now make this left turn.

395
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,610
Okay, don't circle this time.

396
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,210
Just keep going straight.

397
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,860
‭What are you stopping for?

398
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,270
You want me to go out on the street?

399
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,710
It's where the car wants to go.

400
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,030
Come on.

401
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,910
What's the worst thing that could happen?

402
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,560
I could run over someone and kill them.

403
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,940
You have autism. You're not blind.

404
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,780
And I'll be right here with you.

405
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,030
Half Dome, here we come.

406
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,980
Can I turn on the radio?

407
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,910
- No! No, thank you. - Okay, okay.

408
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,560
Nice.

409
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,570
We believe moving up the separation surgery

410
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,600
will lighten the load on Jenny's heart,

411
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,110
maybe allow it to recover a bit

412
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,410
so a transplant won't even be necessary in the future.

413
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,400
It is higher risk for Katie now,

414
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,100
given that her new kidney is still not fully functional.

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,700
What do you think we should do?

416
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,900
It's your bodies. Your decision.

417
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,150
- Mom, stop it. - No, I'm serious.

418
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,340
I raised you both to be strong and independent, and you are.

419
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,410
So whatever you decide, I'll support.

420
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,270
Let's do it.

421
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,230
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

422
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,470
Katie?

423
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,570
We obviously need both your consent.

424
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,790
- Okay. - You sure?

425
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,120
You want to talk more? Have any questions?

426
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,580
No. I'm good. Let's do it.

427
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,700
I want a car.

428
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,890
So get one.

429
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,270
You've been driving a half-hour,

430
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,620
and you're already better than half the people in San Jose.

431
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,850
I get distracted when I'm alone.

432
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,540
That's why I miss my bus sometimes.

433
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,160
Dr. Glassman thinks I'd do the same thing driving.

434
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,920
He's probably right.

435
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,740
Want to have some fun?

436
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,800
- I'm already having fun. - Stop the car.

437
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,520
- Why? - Just do it.

438
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,290
Thank you.

439
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,570
Don't worry. We're the only car on the road right now.

440
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,960
Put your left foot on the brake.

441
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,660
Okay.

442
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
There we go.

443
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,160
Now hold it all the way down. There you go.

444
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,510
Okay, now floor the gas with your right foot.

445
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,050
I-I don't know about this.

446
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,250
No, it's okay. It's okay.

447
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,890
Now slowly ease your left foot off the brake...

448
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,010
until you hear...

449
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,430
this.

450
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,530
I smell smoke.

451
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,610
Yeah, that's the point, Shaun.

452
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,730
It's burning rubber. Do it again.

453
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,460
Okay.

454
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,720
Now, this is fun.

455
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,130
Okay, that's enough.

456
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,950
We need some rubber left to get us home.

457
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,370
I am burning rubber.

458
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,400
- Okay, Shaun, it's time to stop. ‭- Okay.

459
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
Shaun, take your other foot off the gas!

460
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,430
Shaun, look out!

461
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,650
It's the other foot! Other foot!

462
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,860
It's the other foot! It's the other foot!

463
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,840
It's the other foot!

464
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,650
Dr. Ko and I have been working for months

465
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,900
to map the structure of Jenny and Katie's brain.

466
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,890
Don't you mean "Brains"?

467
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,670
Actually, while different regions operate independently for each sister,

468
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,130
there is a single brain mass.

469
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,030
That's why all their previous neurosurgeons

470
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,060
insisted separation was impossible.

471
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,110
The real problem won't be dividing their brains

472
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,250
but dividing their veins.

473
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,900
They share a single sagittal sinus vein.

474
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,690
Which we'll give to Jenny.

475
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,140
Then we'll create a new one for Katie using a grafted vein from her leg.

476
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,570
Nice. You've gotten them up to speed fast.

477
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,800
Well, with 6 months of prep to do in 12 hours,

478
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,900
it was their only choice.

479
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,650
So, let's get started.

480
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,600
- I crashed. - We didn't.

481
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,120
- Yes, I- I crashed. - We just...

482
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,460
- I hit something. - Shaun. Shaun.

483
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,710
I hit something. I did. I hit something.

484
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,570
- Shaun, you... - I know I did.

485
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,960
- I felt it. I crashed. - Shaun, you didn't crash.

486
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,890
- Yes. - You just drove off the road...

487
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,210
- No. -And it was totally my fault.

488
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,280
No, you're wrong. Nuh- unh. I hit something.

489
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,080
- No, you didn't. - I felt it.

490
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,200
- I crashed. I crashed. - No, Shaun, look at me.

491
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,740
Calm down. Calm.

492
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,870
- Okay. Okay. - Look at me. Look at me.

493
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,680
Breathe. Whatever happened,

494
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,970
whatever you felt, you did nothing wrong.

495
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,740
It was all my fault, okay?

496
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,260
Okay. Dr. Glassman... He was right.

497
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,880
I-I should not be allowed to drive.

498
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,080
No, no.

499
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,760
Shaun.

500
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,010
No, I'm not going to drive, thank you.

501
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,790
Yeah, I...I know. No one is.

502
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,890
'Cause you were right. We did hit something.

503
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,310
Everything is still looking good.

504
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,480
If you need anything during the night,

505
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,930
just press your call button.

506
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,390
Is Jenny asleep?

507
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,140
Yeah.

508
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,170
Where's Dr. Andrews?

509
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,680
He is with Dr. Ko and Dr. Melendez.

510
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,700
They're working to finalize the surgical protocol for tomorrow.

511
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,870
I need to talk to him.

512
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,900
Is there anything I can do?

513
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,080
I changed my mind.

514
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,950
I don't want to do the separation surgery.

515
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,140
I'll go find him right away.

516
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,500
I understand she's scared, but without this surgery,

517
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,280
there is a good chance both of them die.

518
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,300
Have you talked to the mother?

519
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,040
She refuses to weigh in, insists it's their decision.

520
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,530
Let me try and talk to her.

521
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,890
I don't think that's a good idea.

522
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,860
You invented the technique you're gonna use to separate them.

523
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,550
- So? - So she's not even close to objective.

524
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,180
Okay, now is not the time to be worrying about lawsuits.

525
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,030
That's my job.

526
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,920
And our job is saving these girls' lives.

527
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,570
Okay, take it easy. We're all on the same team here.

528
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,670
- I'll talk to her. - You've already talked to her.

529
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,020
I will try again.

530
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,330
Browne should do it.

531
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,460
Me?

532
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,710
We need someone that an 18-year-old girl trusts.

533
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,880
She's also the best communicator out of all of us.

534
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,310
Okay.

535
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,110
We'll give Katie the night to think it over.

536
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,670
Browne, you'll talk to her in the morning.

537
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,330
Get her to consent to this surgery.

538
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,950
And if I'm not able to do that?

539
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,330
It's not a big deal. Cars break.

540
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,450
That's why God makes mechanics... and booze.

541
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,890
Two shots of tequila, please.

542
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,210
I'm not thirsty.

543
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,690
You don't drink tequila because you're thirsty.

544
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,030
Have you ever been drunk?

545
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,010
Never?

546
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,220
Eight years of college a-and not one frat party?

547
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,020
Tailgating? Your roommate's 21st birthday?

548
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,360
What is your job?

549
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,200
Now you're interested in my job?

550
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,910
Yes.

551
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm an automotive engineer.

552
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,050
I work for a start-up that's developing new designs for self-driving cars.

553
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,360
Do you like it?

554
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,390
No.

555
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,000
I like to build things,

556
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,820
not to sit in endless meetings talking about building things.

557
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,760
Thank you.

558
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,520
Perfect timing.

559
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,440
We are supposed to be forgetting about work.

560
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,760
For living happy because you're a long time dead.

561
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,140
It's... good.

562
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,850
Oh, my God. You have to be the first person in history

563
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,870
- to actually like their first tequila shot. - It's good.

564
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,550
- Do you want another? - Okay.

565
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,760
- Yes. - Tequila. Stat.

566
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,710
Yes!

567
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,800
What?

568
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,970
Sorry. I'm just zoned out.

569
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,550
We should break this off.

570
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,340
There's only so much studying you can do.

571
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,430
Do you want kids?

572
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,190
Sorry. That's none of my business.

573
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,880
No, it's... it's just not a question I was expecting.

574
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,130
Jessica just told me she doesn't. Ever.

575
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
It doesn't make any sense.

576
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,180
She would be such an amazing mother.

577
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,700
I guess she's lucky she realized before it's too late.

578
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,870
Some women don't.

579
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,600
My mom was definitely one of those.

580
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,920
- Sorry. I didn't mean to... - No, it's okay.

581
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,430
Water under the bridge... that nearly drowned me.

582
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,930
It was a long time ago.

583
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,040
I don't know what to do.

584
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,750
I can't imagine my life without her,

585
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,080
but I also can't imagine a life without...

586
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,430
I'm sorry.

587
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,470
Again, this is not your problem.

588
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,090
- It's okay. - Go. Goodbye.

589
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,650
Finding someone you can't imagine a life without,

590
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,370
it's hard.

591
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,050
I know it's a cliché, but it is true.

592
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,580
Good night.

593
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,420
Good night.

I love you, too.

606
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,370
So, I will volunteer with foster kids,

607
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,140
coach youth sports.

608
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,680
There are other ways that I can be a father figure

609
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,380
without actually being a father.

610
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,310
In one day, I taught you how to play hooky from work,

611
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,570
how to drive, how to drink,

612
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,820
and how to totally rock the house in karaoke.

613
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,580
No, y-you did not teach me to drive very well at all.

614
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
At all.

615
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,200
- How dare you. - I-I-I crashed.

616
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,240
No, you didn't crash.

617
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,970
You hit a rock that should not have been there.

618
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,650
The whole point of a road shoulder is to provide a buffer zone.

619
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,270
Who the hell desi... designs a buffer zone with a huge rock in it, you know?

620
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,540
They should be fired.

621
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,300
O-Okay, hold it right there, partner.

622
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,360
I got one more thing to teach you.

623
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,330
What is it?

624
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,150
The proper way to end a date.

625
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,170
Tell me you hope I had a good time tonight.

626
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,490
Go ahead.

627
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,920
I hope you had a good time tonight.

628
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,860
I did. I had a very nice time tonight.

629
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,460
You're really fun to sing karaoke with.

630
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,630
Now tell me I'm really fun, too,

631
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,830
and that you hope we can do it again soon.

632
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,790
Y-Y-You're really fun, too.

633
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,640
- Thank you. - I hope that we can do it again soon.

634
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,170
Now open the door for me.

635
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,930
Now, if I just walk in,

636
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,530
don't bother trying for a second date.

637
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,610
It's a swing and a miss, not a big deal.

638
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,570
It happens to everyone.

639
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,980
But if I don't walk in,

640
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,510
if I just stand there in front of you

641
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,850
like I don't really want to go inside,

642
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,740
like I'm doing right now, then you have to kiss me.

643
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,850
Kiss me, Shaun.

644
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,990
Have you ever done that before?

645
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,580
No, no, no, no.

646
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,570
Well, you're pretty good at it.

647
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,390
You want to do it again?

648
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,930
Yes, but...

649
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,410
But what?

650
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,680
I know it's frightening.

651
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,010
You've already been through so much.

652
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,950
I'm not scared.

653
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,000
I just think, "What if this is how we're meant to be?"

654
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,960
Maybe we're better as one.

655
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,370
I grew up in a trailer,

656
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,420
with, uh, my mom telling me every day

657
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,120
that I was no better than her

658
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,200
and that I would never do anything,

659
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,780
I'd never be anyone,

660
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,870
and I...

661
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,200
I hated being there.

662
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,460
But when I finally left,

663
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,370
walking out of the dirty,

664
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,910
disgusting double-wide...

665
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,630
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

666
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,540
Wait, so, am I the awful mom

667
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,870
or the disgusting trailer in this story?

668
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,860
It's amazing what you've accomplished so far.

669
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,500
It really is.

670
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,430
But you can be so much more,

671
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,410
and with the freedom

672
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:10,260
to just finally be yourself.

673
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,210
Just yourself.

674
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,530
Katie's back on board.

675
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,320
Told you.

676
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,910
She's very persuasive.

677
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,070
Shaun?

678
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,430
I feel disgusting.

679
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,270
You're just hungover.

680
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,120
You are never gonna want me to kiss you ever again.

681
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,930
If I had brushed my teeth before I rushed out here,

682
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,450
I'd ask you to do it again right now.

683
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,140
Why are you so hard on yourself?

684
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,750
I'm sure you got made fun of a lot when you were a kid,

685
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,740
and that leaves a mark.

686
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,410
I know.

687
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,450
But you gotta shake it off, rub some dirt on it.

688
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,940
You're never gonna be happy

689
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,000
if you constantly live in fear.

690
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,470
- We need to talk. - Look, I have nothing to say to you.

691
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,970
Well, then, you can just listen.

692
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,700
You are not a victim. Not even close.

693
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,830
But you will be unless you convince Andrews

694
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,350
to reinstate Jared.

695
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,590
Are you threatening me?

696
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,470
No, I'm just informing you that there is no way

697
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,880
that I'm the only resident that you tried to intimidate

698
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,110
into having sex with you.

699
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,560
And I will make it my mission in life to find every single one

700
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,460
and get them to file a complaint against you

701
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,370
unless Jared gets his job back.

702
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,870
And what makes you so sure

703
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,380
Andrews cares what I have to say?

704
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,080
‭I'm not.

705
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,140
But either Jared's career gets saved,

706
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,590
or yours gets destroyed.

707
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,410
Either way is a win for me.

708
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,620
15 blade.

709
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,270
Removing the first balloon tissue expander.

710
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,380
One down. Five to go.

712
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,760
Hi, Shaun. It's me again.

713
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,000
You know, do-- Dr. Andrews has never really been in your corner,

714
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,550
and your absence is causing a real problem.

715
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,810
Please call me before it's too late.

716
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,510
Or at least call me and let me know where you are

717
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,160
'cause I'm worried.

718
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,820
The cavitron allows us to use a low-frequency sound wave to separate them

719
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,460
so that we don't damage the healthy tissue in the process.

720
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,570
I still can't tell where Katie starts and Jenny ends.

721
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,010
The imaging is a huge help.

722
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,740
But once the patient is opened,

723
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,650
it's kind of like backcountry skiing.

724
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,470
It's never the same on top.

725
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,150
What you want to focus on

726
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,900
is the terrain you know is underneath.

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,840
{\an9}♪ The most beautiful part of ourselves is the part we hide ♪

743
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,410
Dr. Ko, would you like to do the honors?

744
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,590
Definitely.

745
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,070
{\an9}♪ So get up, get up, get up, and get on ♪

746
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,570
Can we get a little more room?

747
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,690
Coming right up.

748
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,250
{\an9}♪ Just a little belief to shake off the doubt ♪

749
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,370
And then there were two.

750
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,500
{\an9}♪ It's building up ♪

751
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,240
{\an9}♪ It's been building up for so long ♪

752
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,090
Thanks for taking me on a road trip.

753
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,060
I feel a lot better.

754
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,410
I think I'm ready to talk to Dr. Glassman.

755
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,390
Yeah, I feel much better, too,

756
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,490
and ready to talk to my boss.

757
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,800
What do you have to talk to your boss about?

758
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,060
He offered me a promotion.

759
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,350
Will you be making $1 million?

760
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,130
Very funny.

761
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,810
I make $70,000 now, and the new position pays $90,000,

762
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,170
but I'm not gonna take it.

763
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,880
Why not?

764
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,550
It pays $20,000 more.

765
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,610
Yeah, I get the math, Shaun, but just taking this trip and --

766
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,510
and you have inspired me to do something

767
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,410
that I've been thinking about for a really long time,

768
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,040
but I've just been too scared to do it.

769
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,650
I'm gonna quit my job.

770
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,900
You're so silly.

771
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,590
What would you do during the day?

772
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,910
Rebuild old cars.

773
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,800
No more conference calls. No more never-ending meetings.

774
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,580
The only thing I'm not looking forward to is,

775
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,740
is moving.

776
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,320
Why would you move?

777
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,250
Because that's where the shop that I'm gonna work at is.

778
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,580
I got the Striped Tomato.

779
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,160
My brother, Donny, got Grandpa Rod's shop

780
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,270
in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

781
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,870
It's been over a year, but every time I drive his car,

782
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,890
I... keep thinking,

783
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,990
"You know, I don't need a more impressive title

784
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,330
or $1 million."

785
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,770
He would take me fishing in Alaska every summer,

786
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,280
skiing every winter break.

787
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,330
I haven't taken more than one day off in four years

788
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,690
because I always work.

789
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,950
It never stops.

790
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,910
And just taking this trip with you made me realize I, uh --

791
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,760
I want to enjoy my life, you know?

792
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,180
Okay, what? Say something.

793
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,560
You're...

795
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,840
Hello?

796
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,430
Jared, this is Dr. Andrews.

797
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,340
Do you have a moment?

798
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah, of course.

799
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,890
Dr. Coyle approached me today.

800
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,640
He told me that he feels awful

801
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,710
about the way he treated Dr. Browne

802
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,390
and how it came to affect you,

803
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,550
and he asked me to reconsider your termination.

804
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,300
You should also know

805
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,630
that Dr. Melendez spoke in support of you, as well.

806
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,720
Thank you for letting me know.

807
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,570
I was impressed by the integrity you demonstrated

808
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,350
by taking full responsibility for your actions.

809
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,190
And I'm certainly willing to make that clear

810
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,880
to any administrators at another hospital

811
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,010
if you need me as a reference,

812
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,520
but I won't reinstate you.

813
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,770
Physical assault is a line

814
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm just not willing to let anyone cross.

815
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,020
I understand.

816
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:51,990
I'm sorry.

817
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,510
Take care.

818
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,350
When will they wake up?

819
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,760
They should've already.

820
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,830
Shaun?

821
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Shaun.
