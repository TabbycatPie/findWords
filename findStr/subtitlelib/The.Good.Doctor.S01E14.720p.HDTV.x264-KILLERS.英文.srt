42
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,590
Morning, doc!

43
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,580
Good morning, Kenny.

44
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,910
Brosef, your cable's out.

45
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,350
I don't have cable.

46
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,320
I have a digital antenna.

47
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,850
Why?

48
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,910
Digital antennae receive superior picture and sound quality,

49
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,680
and the channels are free.

50
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,260
Yeah, but you get, like, 10 channels that way.

51
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,970
I only watch three.

52
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,950
You mind if I run a line to your tube?

53
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,890
Cable guy can't fit me in till next week.

54
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,410
Come on, 10 channels are better than none.

55
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,800
Yes, they are.

56
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,670
All right.

57
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,330
Gracias, amigo.

58
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,450
No hay na que agradecer.

59
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,130
What?

60
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,080
Dr. Reznick was orphaned once Dr. Coyle was transferred,

61
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,490
so she'll be joining our team.

62
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,120
Hi. I'm Claire.

63
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,160
Nice to meet you.

64
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,690
Are you the autistic one?

65
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,630
No.

66
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,330
That's me.

67
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,090
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

68
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,210
We've got two pretty straightforward cases,

69
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,250
nice level playing field for an eager group.

70
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,220
Not interested.

71
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,450
Competition can foster teamwork,

72
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,980
which can lead to a greater understanding

73
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,040
and appreciation of residents' strengths and weaknesses

74
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
and improve patient care.

75
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
You're playing the same game Glassman had us do when we were interns.

76
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,450
Not interested.

77
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,360
Winning team gets first dibs

78
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,520
on assisting on all surgeries next week.

79
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,340
- In. - In.

80
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,140
Out.

81
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,270
I pick the boy genius.

82
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,860
That's you.

83
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,180
Dr. Browne.

84
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,880
Kalu.

85
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,240
Dr. Reznick.

86
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,910
Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.

87
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,570
Thank you.

88
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,600
Same stakes as last time?

89
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,220
Absolutely.

90
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,870
Hi, Quinn.

91
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,190
We hear you've had some stomach pain.

92
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,370
Do you mind if we take a look?

93
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,790
It doesn't hurt that bad.

94
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,730
Poor thing says everything is okay,

95
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,300
but when Quinnie didn't want to go swimming today,

96
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,570
I knew that something must be wrong.

97
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,560
We'll be as gentle with her as possible.

98
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,590
Quinn's parents are out of town,

99
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,520
so I'm -- I flew in to babysit.

100
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay.

101
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,390
Let's see.

102
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,160
- That's a... - Penis.

103
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,450
She's not a girl.

104
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,430
He's a boy.

105
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,100
It's just a phase.

106
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,510
Stop saying that.

107
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,100
I'm not a boy. I'm a girl.

108
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,020
- You're transgender? - Yes.

109
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,620
No.

110
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,060
Quinn has XY chromosomes like Jared and me,

111
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,590
not XX like you.

112
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,430
Science says he's male.

113
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,870
No, Quinn has gender dysphoria.

114
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,610
Her assigned gender is not the one she identifies with.

115
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,220
She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy.

116
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,330
But biologically --

117
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,760
Other than biologically,

118
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,770
how do you know - you're supposed to be a boy?

119
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,060
Your question doesn't make sense.

120
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,830
I'm not supposed to be anything.

121
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,020
I am a boy.

122
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,900
Biologically, that's it.

123
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,290
Okay, deep tenderness at McBurney's point.

124
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,870
Could be acute appendicitis.

125
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,290
Murphy, get imaging to confirm.

126
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,580
Mr. Shaw, your chart says that you passed out in class.

127
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,320
- What do you teach? - History.

128
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,630
I got a little dizzy because I skipped breakfast.

129
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,670
I-it's nothing.

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,960
The school insisted on calling an ambulance.

131
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,660
Taken any medications in the last few months?

132
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,330
Uh, I took some Vicodin

133
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,800
after I threw out my back six weeks ago,

134
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,400
and then I had a stomach flu, so I took Ofloxacin.

135
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
But the flu part didn't totally go away,

136
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,920
so I took Azithromycin and Prednisone

137
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,690
because my glands were swollen.

138
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,530
But I still had a sore throat, so I took some Cipro.

139
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,760
What doctor prescribed you all that?

140
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,260
Uh, they were leftovers I had in my medicine cabinet.

141
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,140
All right, lay back for me.

142
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,020
Look, I'm a single dad with twins

143
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,150
who bring home every disgusting germ they touch at preschool.

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,300
I can't afford to miss work.

145
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,660
You've got a fever and you've gone through two IVs

146
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,710
which tells me that you're severely dehydrated.

147
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,700
You can't stand me touching your stomach without wincing in pain.

148
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,680
Dr. Reznick, let's get Mr. Shaw here an ultrasound.

149
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,600
- We've been trying for while. - Five months.

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
I realize my prime egg days were two decades ago,

151
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,090
but I've been vigilant.

152
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,530
Ovulation kits, LH and FSH testing,

153
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,450
basal body temp.

154
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,870
I've checked my estradiol and AMH levels.

155
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,930
The old-fashioned way wasn't working.

156
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,780
Okay, well, there are a lot of possibilities to consider.

157
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,090
Many benign, many easily corrected.

158
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,240
So I will take some samples from you both,

159
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,770
run some tests, we go from there.

160
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,750
There's a clock.

161
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,210
We need to know - if we start with IUI or IVF...

162
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,870
Both of you -- you need to stop worrying.

163
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,030
Isabel, you are not the first 40-something woman

164
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,890
to come here and ask these questions.

165
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,400
Myself included.

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,740
You came to me - because you trust me, yes?

167
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,370
Right. So let me do what I do,

168
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,410
and you two focus on each other.

169
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,970
We're a team, babe.

170
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,510
In this together, all right?

171
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,360
Okay.

172
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,180
I'm afraid, Howard, your appendix has already ruptured.

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,340
Book an OR stat and page Melendez.

174
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,680
Wait. I need to figure out who's gonna take care of my kids,

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,860
call the school so they can get subs for my classes.

176
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,200
Mr. Shaw, if we don't get you into surgery now,

177
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,490
your infection could spread and you could become septic.

178
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,660
Dr. Browne will make all the necessary phone calls

179
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,140
while I prep you for surgery.

180
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,710
Isn't that so, Dr. Browne?

181
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,480
You're in good hands, Mr. Shaw.

182
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,660
We've got you covered.

183
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,550
Let's go.

184
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,660
Hello.

185
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,540
Do you wear dresses?

186
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,700
Murphy, don't.

187
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,830
Quinn is a boy who thinks he's a girl.

188
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,760
I want to know why he thinks that.

189
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,560
Sometimes I wear dresses, but sometimes I wear leggings.

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,780
Do you like the color pink?

191
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,910
I'm more of a purple girl.

192
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,890
- Do you play with dolls? - Since I was 5, but I'm super into mermaids.

193
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,580
Do you take dance --

195
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,770
Murphy, 20 questions are up.

196
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,300
I only asked four.

197
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,360
- Do you wear perfume? - It doesn't matter.

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,060
The CT's ready. Let's go.

199
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,430
- Do you always paint your nails? - Let's go.

200
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,680
Perforated appendix is out.

201
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,650
Lavage or no lavage.

202
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,570
Dr. Browne.

203
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,740
Lavage before closing the wound

204
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,810
decreases residual fluid accumulation

205
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,820
- and minimizes residual contamination. - Claire's right.

206
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,470
Although, a recent study documented a higher abscess rate

207
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,280
when irrigation was used for perforated appendicitis.

208
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,680
Well, someone did their homework.

209
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,230
I'm partial to AMSURG 

210
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,430
since they published me.

211
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,160
As a medical student?

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,530
It was about the cost and stabilization of disease

213
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,310
in patients undergoing transcatheter

214
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,060
and surgical aortic valve replacement.

215
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,320
Are you thinking of specializing in cardio-thoracic?

216
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
A girl can dream.

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,390
Staple up and close up.

218
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,700
It's, uh --

219
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,580
it's good to have you on board, Morgan.

220
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,320
It's great to have another female surgeon.

221
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,350
I'm sorry,

222
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,490
you and I are not gonna be friends,

223
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,340
hanging out, having sleepovers,

224
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,840
braiding each other's hair.

225
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,970
That's not exactly - where I was going with it.

226
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,960
When residency's over,

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,050
the hospital's likely only keeping two of us.

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,670
Shaun is Glassman's pet project, so he's in.

229
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,050
Jared is persona non grata, so he's out.

230
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,330
Which means every time you win, I lose.

231
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,480
And vice versa.

232
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,980
Thanks for the heads up.

233
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,950
Do you think he's complicated or confused?

234
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,280
Dude, you've got to quit calling her a "He."

235
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,660
We're never going to win this competition

236
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,130
with you disrespecting our patient.

237
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,470
- Don't they have transgender people in Wyoming? - Okay.

238
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,820
Transgender patient care

239
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,130
was not part of my - medical school curriculum.

240
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,520
Was it part of yours?

241
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,510
No.

242
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,920
Quinn doesn't have appendicitis.

243
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,890
He has testicular cancer.

244
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,890
She.

245
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,130
We found a mass on Quinn's left testicle.

246
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,600
She has cancer, but --

247
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,100
- Am I gonna die? - No, no.

248
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,500
Prognosis is very good.

249
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,770
We've caught it before it spread,

250
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,830
and we'll do surgery on the mass to remove it.

251
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,140
The CT also showed he has osteopenia.

252
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,970
Murphy, stop with the "He."

253
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,110
Quinnie, it's your mom.

254
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,210
I -- I have to --

255
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,170
Of course.

256
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,230
Osteopenia.

257
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,420
- That's low bone density, right? - Yeah.

258
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,720
How'd you know that?

259
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,170
Do you know how I got cancer?

260
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,650
There are several - possible causes, but I --

261
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,480
- Microlithiasis, mumps, hypospadias -- - Murphy.

262
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia,

263
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
inguinal hernia, HIV --

264
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,230
Murphy. Enough.

265
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,830
Your parents are on their way here.

266
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,780
Um, they just told me --

267
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,580
Quinn, are you on puberty blockers?

268
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,020
That's the likely cause of the osteopenia.

269
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,470
Are you taking leuprorelin or histrelin?

270
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,790
I've been leuprorelin for nine months.

271
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,570
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

272
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,860
Because my parents didn't want my grandma to know.

273
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,260
Looks like he has an abscess.

274
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,460
You have an infection.

275
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,500
We'll drain it, put you on antibiotics.

276
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,410
It's nothing to worry about.

277
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,850
It just means - you might be in the hospital

278
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,840
a couple of extra nights.

279
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,710
I -- I can't spend a couple of extra nights.

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,990
I need to get out of here.

281
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,280
Are you worried about your kids?

282
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,500
Well, they're with my sister, they're safe,

283
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,480
but they've never spent a night without me

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,630
since they were born.

285
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,240
Well, then consider this a blessing.

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,780
A free vacation from your kids.

287
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
They're my life.

288
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,730
My wife died of ovarian cancer last year.

289
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,900
I...

290
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,980
I hate hospitals.

291
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,760
I'm so sorry.

292
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,500
Why don't I find a laptop

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,090
so you can Skype with them?

294
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,930
And I'll rustle up a couple of toy bears from Peds

295
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,080
for you to take home.

296
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,360
Thank you.

297
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,910
I want to reassure you

298
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,250
that the puberty blockers

299
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,770
are in no way responsible for causing cancer.

300
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,630
The leuprorelin did cause your osteopenia.

301
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,960
Does this mean I have to stop taking puberty blockers?

302
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes.

303
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,220
We'll get you on dietary supplements

304
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,570
to help regain your bone strength,

305
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,120
but the puberty blockers are hurting you.

306
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
You'll be fine without them.

307
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,270
Fine?

308
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,240
I -- I don't want an Adam's apple

309
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,730
or a deep voice - or hair all over my body.

310
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,090
You can't reverse that, can you?

311
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,350
No, I'm afraid not.

312
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,120
Girls have body hair, too.

313
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,340
Toy bears, Skype with kids --

314
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,820
you've got game.

315
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,730
"Game"?

316
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,750
I believe the name for what I did

317
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,680
is "Basic human decency."

318
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,220
Everyone has an agenda.

319
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,320
Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's not,

320
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,630
but it's always there.

321
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,890
And you've got this whole "Queen of kindness" thing down pat.

322
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,970
Awfully cynical for someone so young.

323
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,970
Mm, not cynical.

324
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,680
Just the reality of how the world works.

325
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,330
It's Howard.

326
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,940
He spiked a fever, temp's 105.

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
BP's tanking, 80 over 40.

328
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,640
He's soiled his sheets.

329
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,880
Site's clean. Infection should be clearing by now.

330
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,330
- What's going on? - I don't know.

331
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,170
Page Melendez.

332
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,880
Give me 500 milligrams acetaminophen,

333
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,970
2 grams of meropenem IV infusion empirically.

334
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,690
Run a chem panel, CBC, and get cultures ASAP.

335
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,770
Hang in there, Howard.

336
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,080
We're gonna figure this out.

337
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,920
Any word on Quinn Darby's labs?

338
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,040
Big backup today. Nothing much I can do.

339
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,250
Text you when they're ready.

340
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,360
Yeah.

341
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,140
Hey, Gus.

342
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,190
I saw raspberry and rose petal doughnuts

343
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,540
in the cafeteria today.

344
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,860
Got you the last one.

345
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,120
You remembered.

346
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,280
Thank you.

347
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,980
Howard Shaw's labs.

348
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,880
- I put a rush on them for you. - You're the best.

349
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,070
Why did you give Gus a doughnut?

350
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,700
I was being nice.

351
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,820
I needed my patient's labs expedited.

352
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,180
- Gus likes doughnuts. - It's called bribery.

353
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,060
I call it "Basic human decency."

354
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,900
See you later.

355
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,750
Howard has a superbug.

356
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,530
A C. Diff infection?

357
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,170
It's resistant to all medication.

358
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,740
Quinn's pre-op labs are normal,

359
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,600
so we can do the surgery first thing in the morning.

360
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,190
The procedure is called a radical inguinal orchiectomy.

361
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,020
It's radical in that the entire cancerous testicle is removed.

362
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,150
All functionality will remain the same.

363
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,090
Quinn should be able to resume her normal activities in one or two weeks.

364
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,070
See? Baby, that's good news.

365
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,120
No, not really.

366
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,320
Without the puberty blockers,

367
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,700
I'll be the freak in ballet with a mustache.

368
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,530
Aren't there any other options?

369
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,750
I wish there were --

370
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,170
If we do a bilateral orchiectomy,

371
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,800
Quinn will have the testosterone level of a girl.

372
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,970
We are not removing both testicles.

373
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,380
You want to castrate my grandson?

374
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,340
No.

375
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm so sorry - for Dr. Murphy's outburst.

376
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,490
I'm gonna have gender confirmation surgery

377
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,790
when I'm 18 anyway.

378
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,220
Why not just do it now.

379
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,140
Quinn is a child

380
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,720
who still plays dress-up and make-believe.

381
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,850
He may want to have children of his own some day.

382
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,550
We'll give you some privacy.

383
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,450
Thank you.

384
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,680
I will not allow you --

385
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,860
It's not up to you.

386
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,790
You are making me doubt the wisdom of drafting you, Murphy.

387
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,020
If you go around saying inflammatory things to people,

388
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,410
it will only upset them.

389
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,410
How will I know if I said something inflammatory

390
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,640
until I say it?

391
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,100
Test it on Kalu first.

392
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,150
Which you can do while the two of you prep an SDA for this case.

393
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,490
An SDA?

394
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,700
A Shared Decision Aid

395
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,850
is a paper presenting the pros and cons

396
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,720
- of making a difficult -- I know what it is, Murphy.

397
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
But why am I being punished?

398
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,650
It's not a punishment, it's necessary.

399
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,420
It'll help Quinn's family

400
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,190
understand all the options available to them for her care.

401
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,480
Understood?

402
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,270
Understood.

403
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,530
The stool culture and sensitivity test

404
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,960
indicate that you're resistant to every antibiotic.

405
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,660
Which only happens when you've been exposed

406
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,620
to every antibiotic.

407
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,370
I -- I did this to myself?

408
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,690
But I've used those medications before without a problem.

409
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,160
Why did this happen now?

410
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,720
You weren't under a doctor's care,

411
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,840
so you were likely taking the wrong medication

412
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,100
for the wrong symptoms.

413
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,470
But you can fix this, right?

414
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,990
We're gonna have to perform a colostomy

415
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,900
where we attach an ostomy pouching system to your abdomen

416
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,430
to collect waste from your body.

417
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,290
For how long?

418
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,530
Well, with the level of damage

419
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,830
we're seeing throughout the colon, indefinitely.

420
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,970
I'm so sorry, Howard.

421
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,570
I don't understand

422
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,430
why you'd suggest the bilateral orchiectomy

423
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,000
when you don't even believe Quinn's a girl.

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,500
I was answering Dr. Lim's question.

425
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,810
She said there were no other options,

426
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,130
but I found one.

427
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,220
And now we're here.

428
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,130
Yes.

429
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,460
You're actually enjoying this scut work, aren't you?

430
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,470
Yes. We are being helpful.

431
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,610
We're not doing this to be helpful, Murphy.

432
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,530
We're doing this because you pissed off Lim,

433
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,980
and I'm collateral damage.

434
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,680
We're still being helpful.

435
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,600
Doesn't matter.

436
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,990
Doesn't matter, competition's over.

437
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,460
Is it?

438
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,820
We're in here and not with the patient.

439
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,840
No face time plus you calling her a "He"

440
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,570
equals crappy survey scores.

441
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,430
It's okay. It's a game.

442
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,590
- It's not important. - It is to me.

443
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm a pariah.

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,210
These scores are part of our resident evaluation.

445
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,520
Our jobs depend on them.

446
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,990
Mine does, at least.

447
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,480
Then we should do this scut work very well.

448
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,240
Finola called.

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,950
She found an irregularity with one of the tests

450
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,680
but wants to re-run it to be sure.

451
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,050
Okay, so we wait until she re-runs it.

452
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,500
Marcus, we're both doctors.

453
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,190
The results aren't gonna change.

454
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,120
I waited too long.

455
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,330
It's all my fault.

456
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,980
This is the part where you say,

457
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,310
"No, babe, it isn't."

458
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,620
You had goals, other priorities.

459
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,810
You said you supported my career choices,

460
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,920
just like I supported yours.

461
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,980
I do support you. Always.

462
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,150
And I am so proud of you.

463
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,160
But it came at a cost

464
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,890
that we both knew was possible.

465
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,000
- We should have started trying sooner. - When?

466
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,340
When you were 3,000 miles away teaching at Dartmouth?

467
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,650
Or, what, when you were chasing down head of surgery?

468
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,700
- We would have figured it out. - "Figuring it out"

469
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,620
would have meant me and a nanny raising a baby.

470
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,120
I didn't want that.

471
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,640
I tried to bring it up four years ago,

472
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,060
but you wanted to get your practice up and running.

473
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,940
A baby didn't fit in that picture, either.

474
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,390
It is not the same.

475
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,880
How many pregnant women get hired for anything?

476
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,500
Or when they find out a woman's got a child at home,

477
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,790
suddenly it's all "Who's gonna take care of the baby?"

478
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,690
No one asks men that question.

479
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,490
Yeah, well, none of it matters now.

480
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,000
Right? Because it's probably too late.

481
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,880
And I knew it.

482
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,710
I knew this was gonna happen.

483
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,260
You've been stewing over this.

484
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,260
Resenting me. For how long?

485
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,430
I don't resent you, Is.

486
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,470
But, you know, if you want me to sit here

487
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,120
and tell you that it's not your fault,

488
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,980
I -- I can't do that, I'm sorry.

489
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,090
You like?

490
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,650
That door was locked.

491
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,490
Oh, I know.

492
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,740
The cable guy had a cancellation,

493
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,960
so he hooked me up, got us a two-for-one.

494
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Little thanks for being so chill earlier.

495
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,730
Gracias, amigo.

496
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,080
So, what kind of doctor are you?

497
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,030
I'm a surgeon.

498
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,160
A surgeon?

499
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,480
Your stuff doesn't say surgeon, does it?

500
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,980
It's like, uh, Selena and Justin.

501
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,070
It doesn't really go together.

502
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,510
Furniture's from, like, a dozen different places.

503
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,620
Fourteen.

504
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,720
Fourteen.

505
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,050
The people in Casper knew I didn't have any money,

506
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,320
so they gave me things to make a home.

507
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,110
The bookshelf is from Jennifer,

508
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,810
the town librarian.

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,790
My table and chairs are from Mr. Grady's diner.

510
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,270
The lamp is from Sheryl

511
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,620
who teaches Sunday school at Highland Church.

512
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,690
Dr. Glassman, he got me my bed.

513
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,630
Well, you don't have to tell me the whole list, but...

514
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,210
Okay. Yes.

515
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,710
Everything I have works.

516
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,000
There is no need to change it.

517
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,020
Respect.

518
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,470
I'm Dr. Glassman.

519
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,110
I'm the president of the hospital.

520
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,330
Is everything okay?

521
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,280
Sit down.

522
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,630
There has been no change in Quinn's condition.

523
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,160
However, her grandmother has made a claim of child abuse

524
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,630
against you and your husband.

525
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,540
She's claiming that putting Quinn on puberty blockers --

526
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,390
and these are her words,

527
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,190
"Making her think that being trans is okay" --

528
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,040
is a form of emotional and physical abuse.

529
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,270
Now, just to be clear,

530
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,100
we don't believe any of these allegations

531
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,370
have any merit whatsoever.

532
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,780
I know my mom, okay?

533
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,410
She's not gonna drop this.

534
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,710
She'll go to court.

535
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,270
Could she get custody?

536
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,010
Well, she could try, but, uh, Dr. Lim would testify.

537
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,450
They could put her in a foster home.

538
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,330
Ty, she won't make it.

539
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,340
If we let Quinn do the surgery she wants now,

540
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,570
it'll all be over.

541
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,330
There will be no reason for Ruth to fight us.

542
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,880
Do what Quinn wants.

543
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,020
Do the bilateral surgery.

544
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,000
There is an issue.

545
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,240
Your tests confirmed abnormalities in the semen parameters.

546
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,830
I beg your pardon?

547
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,770
The semen analysis.

548
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,160
It showed that you have a low sperm count and low motility.

549
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
It's my fault?

550
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,620
No.

551
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,480
We -- we do not speak in terms of fault.

552
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,040
15% of all couples struggle with infertility,

553
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,360
and of those, 50% have a male factor component.

554
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,170
It's not great news, but it's not a dead end.

555
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,380
So what's the next step?

556
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,620
I'm gonna refer you to Dr. Arjun Dhillon.

557
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,850
He's an excellent urologist,

558
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,140
and he'll give Marcus a -- a full physical,

559
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,940
do some blood work, and an ultrasound.

560
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,800
That can't be right.

561
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,760
- Marcus. - It can't be right.

562
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,610
Marcus. We got this.

563
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,840
Okay?

564
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,480
We're gonna get through this together.

565
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,660
Why didn't you tell me Howard's labs came back?

566
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,490
I should have been there when you broke the bad news to him.

567
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,080
So Melendez could see your touching bedside manner.

568
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,910
It doesn't matter anyway.

569
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,380
Oh, it doesn't? How the hell not?

570
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,870
The poor guy's getting a colostomy.

571
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,180
There's no way we're winning this competition.

572
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,920
You really have no sympathy

573
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
for what Howard's going through?

574
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,030
It's a major bummer, no doubt.

575
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,910
But we don't have time to get emotionally invested

576
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,620
in every patient that we treat.

577
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,890
Our job is to go in, do the surgery,

578
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,930
and get out.

579
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,200
Afterwards -- his poop, someone else's poop --

580
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,920
it's not our problem.

581
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,250
Hey, well, wait.

582
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,030
What if we could get Howard a fecal microbiota transplant?

583
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,290
FMT for a surgical case?

584
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,690
Theoretically, we transfer healthy feces to him,

585
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,210
it restores good flora to the body,

586
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,450
kills off the CDI,

587
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,440
and he avoids surgery all together.

588
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,760
We could actually win this thing.

589
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm gonna pull all the research before pitching it to Melendez.

590
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,460
So, this meeting is called

591
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,540
a Challenging Patient Consultation Process.

592
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,340
The name sucks,

593
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,180
but there are things about it I do like.

594
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,340
All you got to do is talk and listen

595
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,420
and try to understand each other.

596
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,690
What's to understand?

597
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,660
Ruth accused us of being child abusers.

598
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,030
And what's to discuss?

599
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,340
We are Quinn's parents.

600
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,170
We get to make her medical decisions.

601
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,890
What if Quinnie's better off as a boy?

602
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,360
You have no idea - what Quinn has been through.

603
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,980
Every kid - goes through rough patches.

604
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,770
Every kid is confused.

605
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,920
Quinn has always told us exactly who she was, ever since she was 3.

606
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,570
So you let Quinn play with dolls.

607
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,680
Big deal.

608
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
You don't make life-altering decisions

609
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,410
because a child wants to be a princess.

610
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,060
We used to let Quinn do whatever she wanted at home.

611
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,150
But when she went out in public,

612
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,020
we made her present as a boy.

613
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,070
It felt false to her.

614
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,850
She hated it.

615
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,660
She hated herself.

616
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,000
She became reclusive, depressed.

617
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,160
And then a year ago, Quinn tried to kill herself.

618
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,710
Sorry I'm late.

619
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,630
Howard might not need the colostomy

620
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,620
if we give him - a fecal microbiota transplant.

621
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,480
Hasn't the FDA gone back and forth on that?

622
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,910
We could be introducing new bacteria into his system

623
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,620
that could kill him.

624
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,090
The likelihood of that is low.

625
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,850
But not zero.

626
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,530
But if we do the colostomy,

627
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,950
we may not really be helping him.

628
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,980
15% to 30% of patients get recurrent CDI

629
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
after the initial bout.

630
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,190
That's a good point.

631
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,800
I believe 65% of that time,

632
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,410
recurrent CDI becomes chronic,

633
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,910
which can lead to repeated hospitalizations and death.

634
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,240
Are my numbers right, Claire?

635
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,330
Yes.

636
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,740
But recent studies

637
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,850
show better than - a 95% success rate with FMTs.

638
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,690
Howard is a good candidate.

639
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,270
We should try it before he develops a toxic megacolon.

640
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,470
Don't we owe it to him, to his twins,

641
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,590
to at least try an experimental treatment

642
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,190
before doing an invasive surgery

643
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,840
which will alter his life forever?

644
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,460
You're right.

645
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,930
Prep him for the procedure.

646
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,220
I appreciate your passionate advocacy for your patient.

647
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,610
Good work, both of you.

648
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,830
Now you're a team player.

649
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,280
When it benefits me, yes.

650
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,070
Speaking of which, while you were doing your research,

651
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,680
I found Howard a match at the stool bank.

652
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,330
Sample arrives in a couple of hours.

653
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:42,830
Great.

654
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,740
I let them know you'd be the designated doctor

655
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,200
to handle the medical chain of custody

656
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,630
when the sample arrives.

657
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,130
So...?

658
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,970
So you're the only person who can handle the sample.

659
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,600
You'll have to dilute it, blend it, strain it all on your own.

660
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,060
To safeguard against cross-contamination, of course.

661
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,680
Of course.

662
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,400
Your temperature and BP are normal.

663
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Normal. Whatever that means.

664
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,240
Typical. Usual.

665
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,190
Expected.

666
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,640
Yeah, I don't feel like any of those things.

667
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,980
What does it feel like to be a girl?

668
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,940
Are you angry?

669
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Was that an inflammatory question?

670
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,200
I'd rather people ask questions

671
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,040
instead of pointing and staring.

672
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,720
When I used to look like a boy,

673
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,520
I felt...different.

674
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,600
The kids at school didn't understand me,

675
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,930
so they picked on me.

676
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,050
I spent a lot of time alone.

677
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,440
When my parents let me be me,

678
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,210
I felt...

679
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,120
like I didn't - have to pretend anymore.

680
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,530
I felt free, like when you're in a pool

681
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,310
and you just let go and float.

682
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,950
I'm not a very good swimmer.

683
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,190
I don't know what it feels like

684
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,440
to be anyone but me.

685
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,200
Me, too.

686
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,320
Is the bilateral more risky than the unilateral surgery?

687
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,070
The big issue with the bilateral

688
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,770
is Quinn will never be able to have biological children.

689
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,040
If Quinn's parents think that Quinn's mature enough

690
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,380
and strong enough in her beliefs,

691
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,470
then they should do it now.

692
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,500
It's an elective surgery on a child.

693
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,120
There is no medical necessity.

694
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,170
Except with - a previous suicide attempt,

695
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,150
she's still at risk.

696
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,710
Her situation is different now.

697
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,630
She's socially transitioned and living as a girl.

698
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,860
But there just isn't enough good data

699
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,150
on trans kids and their outcomes.

700
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,910
On the other hand, there's very good reason

701
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,600
to preserve future fertility.

702
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
Dr. Lim and Dr. Andrews

703
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,950
are both very excellent surgeons,

704
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,540
and they very clearly have some passionate points of view,

705
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,810
but their views are their own.

706
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,450
You all need to decide what's best for Quinn.

707
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,210
Whatever we decide,

708
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,140
Quinn is still gonna be a girl.

709
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,570
I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept that.

710
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,950
I know that makes me sound horrible.

711
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,980
I know what it's like to not put your family first,

712
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,310
and it cost me.

713
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,250
It cost me a great deal.

714
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,900
And if I had to do it all over again,

715
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,030
I'd ask myself --

716
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,670
is it really worth sacrificing a life

717
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:52,030
with someone I love over an idea that may never be?

718
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,950
Why don't we give them the room?

719
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,380
I got the page. What's going on.

720
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,460
She started screaming in pain and vomiting.

721
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,350
Temp's 104.

722
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,410
Increased groin pain could be attributed to epididymitis,

723
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,070
kidney stones, inguinal hernia...

724
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,090
The extra weight of the tumor

725
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,160
could be causing the testicle to twist on itself.

726
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,700
There'd be no blood flow.

727
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,450
She has a testicular torsion.

728
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,550
She needs surgery now.

729
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,920
Excuse me. Have you made a decision?

730
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,800
Not yet. - I mean, there's a lot to --

731
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,150
We need one now.

732
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,070
Quinn has testicular torsion.

733
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,820
The spermatic cord is twisted

734
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,030
and cutting off blood supply.

735
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,000
We need to operate.

736
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,540
If you want Quinn to live the way she wants,

737
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,970
don't limit her future now.

738
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,700
You heard her when my mom said

739
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,280
she might want kids some day.

740
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,960
She can't even fathom the thought

741
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,590
because she's just a child.

742
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,340
Just do what's medically necessary.

743
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,810
Doesn't appear to be any palpable lymphadenopathy.

744
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,670
It's likely a stromal tumor,

745
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,420
but get that to pathology right away.

746
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,240
Yes, sir.

747
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,790
Quinn has tachycardia and hypotension.

748
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,950
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

749
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,770
EKG's normal. It's not coronary.

750
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,050
CO2 and O2 are normal, so it's not a P.E.

751
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,710
It must be a reaction to the anesthesia.

752
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm already pushing fluids and vasoconstrictors.

753
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,000
Six syringes in, and no sign of leakage.

754
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,410
Okay, we're wrapped up here.

755
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,420
Let's get Howard into recovery.

756
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,000
- Well done. - Thanks.

757
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,910
I was thinking of writing up the procedure,

758
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,790
possibly submit it for publication.

759
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,700
I'd be happy to assist,

760
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,460
seeing as I've done it before.

761
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,340
Thanks, but I think I can --

762
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,630
I read your paper in AMSURG, Dr. Reznick.

763
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,110
You continue to impress.

764
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,990
Coming from you, I take that as a huge compliment.

765
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,990
When you get a chance, Dr. Browne,

766
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,450
you should read it.

767
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,650
Will do.

768
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
I've given vasopressors

769
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,500
and reduced her meds as much as I can.

770
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,800
She's losing volume somewhere.

771
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,280
It was dry when we ligated the spermatic cord.

772
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
I'm still not seeing the bleed.

773
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,350
Could be vagal stimulation from the severed nerve.

774
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,570
But she's not responding to epi.

775
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,960
- Sepsis? - It's too early for an infection.

776
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,010
Her MAP is 20. She's barely profusing.

777
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,330
Okay, excuse me, guys.

778
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,170
- You're breaking scrub. - I'm so sorry.

779
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,240
Grey-Turner sign.

780
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,600
Could be a retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

781
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,240
Jared could be right.

782
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,740
It is possible that there's internal bleeding.

783
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,550
The testicular artery can retract up into the pelvis.

784
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,620
It's rare, but it can happen.

785
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,090
Rare is an understatement. Dr. Andrews?

786
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,310
I don't think we have any other choice.

787
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,090
We need to do an ex-lap. 10 blade.

788
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,230
Murphy, retract.

789
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,800
Internal bleeding.

790
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Jared was right.

791
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,560
Nice call, Dr. Kalu.

792
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,480
Thank you, sir.

793
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,410
Kalu, suction.

794
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,920
We need a clear view of the field.

796
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,800
Fever's down, and the flora in your system seems to be returning to normal.

797
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,650
- We expect a full recovery. - Thank you. For everything.

798
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
Do you know when I can have visitors?

799
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,620
I thought you might ask that question.

800
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,820
There are a couple of eager preschoolers who'd like to say hi.

801
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,600
- Daddy! - Keira! Sammy!

802
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,960
I think you guys have grown!

803
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,570
These are the doctors that saved Daddy.

804
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,080
Dr. Reznick and this is, uh...

805
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,010
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

806
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,830
Dr. Browne.

807
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,050
- Thank you. - Thank you.

808
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,770
You're welcome.

809
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

810
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,220
Who's this guy?

811
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,780
- Bear Bear. - Bear Bear?

812
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,800
Did you do it?

813
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,430
Did you remove both?

814
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,450
No.

815
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,030
Just the cancerous one.

816
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,890
What? Why not?

817
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,120
That's on me.

818
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,810
I couldn't, in good conscience, remove a healthy organ.

819
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,930
Quinnie.

820
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,610
This was our decision.

821
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,590
No! You said you were on my side!

822
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,260
Hey, we are. Always.

823
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,310
We haven't had enough time to talk,

824
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,040
not with each other, with your therapist,

825
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,280
with your doctors.

826
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,180
So I'm gonna turn into a boy.

827
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,820
Well, not right away.

828
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,650
Your endocrinologist will talk to you

829
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,690
about the right timeline for starting feminizing hormones.

830
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,480
You know...

831
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,760
the thought of having your own kids someday

832
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,060
is a big decision,

833
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,490
but you never know what you will or will not want once you get older.

834
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,090
Cis people are always so worked up about having bio kids.

835
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,460
If I really want a kid that bad,

836
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,380
I can just adopt.

837
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
You know, I'll be back when I'm 18

838
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,040
for my gender confirmation surgery.

839
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,930
And when you do, I'll be here to help you.

840
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,560
Patient satisfaction survey scores are in,

841
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
and it was very close.

842
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,110
Not really. She's being kind.

843
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,950
Congratulations go to Dr. Reznick and Dr. Browne.

844
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,800
- Yes. - Thank you.

845
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,840
Congratulations.

846
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,910
Thank you, Shaun.

847
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,690
Claire and I make a nice team.

848
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,670
You should be psyched.

849
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,880
Yeah. I should be.

850
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,060
To the victor belong the spoils.

851
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,450
Pay up.

852
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,420
Humility was never your strong suit.

853
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,230
Thank you, Mortimer.

854
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,190
Don't spend it all in one place.

855
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,690
Spend it?

856
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
I'm gonna frame it.

857
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,970
What made you think of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage?

858
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,910
Homework.

859
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,810
You were right.

860
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,840
Prepping for an SDA was important.

861
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,480
We make a good team.

862
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,350
Quinn doesn't like pink.

863
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,220
I think she will like these.

864
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,520
I hope so.

865
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,990
She's more of a purple girl.

866
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,930
Did you read Morgan's AMSURG article yet?

867
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,440
It is on the top of my to-do list.

868
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,690
I didn't tell you to read it to rub it in.

869
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,380
I told you to read it so you knew what you'd be up against.

870
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,300
You think I need to be more cutthroat?

871
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,340
No. That's Morgan's M.O. You're different.

872
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,770
You're smart, you're special.

873
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,260
Rise up, play the game on your own terms.

874
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,450
Don't wait for it.

875
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:21,000
{\an1}BGM: Rivers And Roads by The Head And The Heart

876
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,960
{\an9}* A year from now we'll all be gone *

877
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,240
{\an9}* All our friends will move away *

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,470
{\an9}* And they're goin' to better places *

879
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:32,320

{\an9}* Nothin' is as it has been *

881
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,000
I heard you saved Quinn's life.

882
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,680
Jared and I did.

883
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,360
I like her.

884
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,560
"Her."

885
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,790
{\an9}* And I guess it's just as well *

886
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,190
So you get that she is a "She."

887
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,000
I have lots of questions.

888
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,020
Yeah, well, questions are good.

889
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,240
Leads to awareness and understanding.

890
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,430
And, who knows, maybe even acceptance.

891
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,250
Being a kid is tough enough,

892
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,490
But being a trans kid? Oh, man, that's --

893
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,390
that's off the chart.

894
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,890
I can't imagine how it must feel

895
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,310
to be so different on the outside

896
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,820
than you are on the inside.

897
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,420
Hey, Shaun.

898
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,040
I can give you a lift.

899
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,660
We could grab a bite.

900
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,700
You said you can't be my friend.

901
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,210
So, no, thank you.

902
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,540

{\an9}* Then we will not relate *

You're not gonna do any laps or nothing?

No.

923
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,230
Then what are you doing?

924
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,420
Understanding.
