00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, big day for this household.

6
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,860
It certainly is. So exciting.

7
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,280
Nothing like starting a new job.

8
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,160
Or finally coming into your own at a job you already have.

9
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,980
The promise of something new.

10
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,580
The rewards finally being --

11
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,670
Opposite things being equally good.

12
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,010
- Cheers. - Yes.

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,670
I have accepted a job at the C.F.J.,

14
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,330
The -- the Center For Justice.

15
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,400
Not, it turns out,

16
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,480
a secret headquarters for superheroes.

17
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,350
No, it -- it kind of is.

18
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,600
It's a legal-aid society

19
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,750
founded by a law-school friend of mine.

20
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,110
I will be an advocate for the people,

21
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,380
a voice for the voiceless.

22
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,000
And just as important...

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,790
Oh, thank you.

24
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,650
Tonight, I am chaperoning the Spring-A-Ding-Fling,

25
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,250
a fundraiser, a dance,

26
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,480
which, under my stewardship,

27
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,600
has shattered school records.

28
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,540
And I added the "A-ding."

29
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,080
It used to just be called the Spring Fling.

30
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,380
I should have said my thing first.

31
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,660
Hey, guys.

32
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,530
For my opening number tonight -- be honest.

33
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,110
Does it look like I have anything on under this?

34
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,120
Tonight is the SCARB.

35
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,680
Southern California Annual Realtors' Banquet.

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,550
It is the banquet for southern California realtors.

37
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,970
Literally, it's the only one.

38
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,440
And this guy is the only two-time host --

39
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,020
Three-time.

40
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,870
three-time host in the history of the event.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,040
Unfortunately, I have to miss it this year.

42
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,830
It's for the best.

43
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,150
She's invisible at these things.

44
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,340
It's tough being married to the rock star.

45
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,300
Luckily, I lined up a substitute date.

46
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,840
Dad. You're still up.

47
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,980
Yeah, just working on some jokes for the banquet.

48
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,380
Hey, how'd you like to come with me?

49
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,230
I would love to!

50
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,420
Not surprised she said yes.

51
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,780
That girl's got real estate in her blood.

52
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,910
She used to come with me to open houses

53
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,390
when she was little.

54
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,320
We may have even talked about

55
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,340
a father/daughter partnership.

56
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,010
Yeah, she's been drifting a little lately,

57
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,980
but I think a taste

58
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,390
of regional real-estate's most glamorous night

59
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,920
might just re-ignite that flame.

60
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,470
I can't believe I have to go to this thing.

61
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,980
But what choice did I have?

62
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,790
I would love to!

63
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,220
But you're not gonna have those cookies without milk, right?

64
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,380
Right.

65
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,040
Come on, Phil.

66
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,290
Break area.

67
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,300
Copier.

68
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,130
My stinky dog.

69
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,010
Oh, look at you.

70
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,310
You just threw up recently. Okay.

71
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,750
Oh, my gosh.

72
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,020
That's you and Michelle Obama.

73
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,230
That's my aunt.

74
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,550
I am so sorry.

75
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,240
I don't know why I thought that --

76
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,540
Calm down, white guilt.

77
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,640
It's Michelle Obama.

78
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,730
Oh, good, yeah.

79
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
Yeah, you've accomplished a lot in 15 years.

80
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,630
Professionally, yeah.

81
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,110
I haven't had a date in six months.

82
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,700
Some sundays, I drive out to visit my frozen eggs.

83
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,080
But, on the plus side,

84
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,980
I have gotten really close with my mom.

85
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,610
Oh, look at that. I see the resemblance.

86
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,440
That's Maya Angelou.

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
Damn it.

88
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,490
It's signed, Mitch.

89
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,390
Yeah. I see that.

90
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,450
This is gonna be fun!

91
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,330
I know!

92
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,920
- I'm just really looking for - You!

93
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,400
What was that outfit last night?

94
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
That was a business dinner!

95
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
What is wrong with you?

96
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,940
Wendy, I tried.

97
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,410
Well, try harder.

98
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,010
Ooh, here's your office.

99
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,110
Okay.

100
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,540
Oh, this is nice.

101
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,400
Yeah. Dennis liked it...

102
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,930
until he didn't.

103
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,940
I'll check on you later.

104
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,660
Okay. All right.

105
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,460
Let's see here.

106
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,440
New guy?

107
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,020
Uh, yes. Hi. I'm Mitchell Pritchett.

108
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,940
Dan.

109
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,750
Hope you don't have any plans for Sunday night.

110
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,960
Dan! What are you still doing here?

111
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,750
Go!

112
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,650
Sorry.

113
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,870
Right.

114
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,780
That way!

115
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,200
Oh, no.

116
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,730
I do love it in leather.

117
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,720
Well, learn to love it in silk.

118
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,000
It's too hot outside to be wearing leather.

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,670
I'm talking about this car.

120
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,570
Oh, by the way,

121
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,860
I do the negotiating at the dealership today.

122
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,590
Why?

123
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,590
Honey, I'm a businessman.

124
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,750
When it comes to people,

125
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,920
I know how to get what I want out of them.

126
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,100
This watch --

127
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,260
The man sold it to me for half of what he was asking.

128
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,920
These -- a third.

129
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,100
These -- for free.

130
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,530
So, who's better at working people, Mr. Businessman?

131
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,920
Fine. We have different approaches,

132
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,380
but we're both pretty good.

133
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,490
Hello, Mitch.

134
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,700
Hey, buddy.

135
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,790
You look like you want to get up and walk.

136
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,030
Late bloomer -- fine.

137
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,070
Who cares if the other kids

138
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,500
call you "Slo-Joe"?

139
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,810
And they do, you know.

140
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,080
Bye-bye.

141
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,240
We're gonna have to reschedule the car shopping.

142
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,510
Mitch has to work.

143
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,520
Cam has to dance.

144
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,330
We have to sit Lily.

145
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,340
- What? - Nothing.

146
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,100
Just -- I could have got us out of that.

147
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,270
Stop!

148
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,200
- Eat it! - Get off me!

149
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
Eat the grass, cow!

150
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
- Hi, Rhonda. - Hi, Mrs. Dunphy.

151
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,060
Hey, mom.

152
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,880
Honey, it's getting very close to time for the dance.

153
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
Shouldn't you go in and get changed?

154
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,940
I did already.

155
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,660
The guys are coming by.

156
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,840
We're gonna ride from here.

157
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,960
What about you, Rhonda?

158
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,070
You want to go in and get cleaned up?

159
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,270
- I'm good. - Are you?

160
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,710
What about that dirt on your face?

161
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,090
Luke, you wait here.

162
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,020
Ride with your friends.

163
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,810
I will bring Rhonda. Come on.

164
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,930
Just, um, give me a good shake like a dog

165
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,900
before you go inside.

166
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,860
I know.

167
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,890
And my dad has three tattoos.

168
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,240
Like, "Why? You're a dad."

169
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,780
Ew! It's so sad when parents try.

170
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,200
My mom double-pierced one of her ears,

171
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
and I'm like, "Hello!

172
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,540
You're 50."

173
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,110
It's so old, like, ancient to have an ear piercing.

174
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,100
Uh, you two decide to go to the dance?

175
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,070
Well, yeah, but not really.

176
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,340
- But, yeah. - What?

177
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,110
We're going ironically

178
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,390
to make fun of all the kids who make a big deal out of it.

179
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,820
"Ironic"? My ass.

180
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,340
Alex likes Drew.

181
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,990
She's just playing it safe.

182
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,020
Now, there are the pushy, obnoxious moms

183
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,170
who try and get involved,

184
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,400
nudge them towards one another.

185
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,140
We mean well.

186
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,130
Fancy shirt, coach Tucker.

187
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,860
Oh, thank you. You know what I like to say.

188
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,490
I might be coach,

189
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,390
but I travel first class.

190
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,970
So, what would you think

191
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,830
about giving the opening remarks at the dance tonight?

192
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,230
The arts committee has never made this much,

193
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,420
and it's all because of you.

194
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,440
Oh, you guys, when I came to this school six months ago,

195
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,890
I never would have imagined you would embrace me.

196
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,070
Excuse me? Is this a chem lab?

197
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,020
Because I'm looking for a big reaction.

198
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,380
And there it is.

199
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,900
Hi. How are --

200
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,350
Who is this?

201
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,240
How was sabbatical?

202
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,590
Amazing.

203
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm rested and ready...

204
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,750
...to take another vacation.

205
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,960
And how are we supposed to know him?

206
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,550
Senor Kaplan, legendary Spanish teacher.

207
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,990
You know, my heart went out to him a little

208
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,810
because he left as everyone's favorite,

209
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,860
and I'm sure word got out about, you know...me.

210
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,330
I just didn't want him to feel displaced.

211
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,400
Okay. Excuse me, big guy.

212
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,220
Gifts for everyone.

213
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,040
Angela, this is fresh from Anuradhapura.

214
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,130
And, uh, Karen,

215
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,590
you might want to eat some chapati with that.

216
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,010
And this is for, um --

217
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,010
- It's Marcia. - Marcia!

218
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,470
Right, of course. I knew that.

219
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,590
I must have been having a "Senor" moment.

220
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,250
Somebody's always on.

221
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,510
Who did this?

222
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,180
What happened?

223
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,320
Somebody knocked my bag down

224
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
and broke my phone.

225
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,580
Lily, do you know anything about this?

226
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,640
He did it.

227
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,990
Joe.

228
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,760
Yep. I'm going to go and play.

229
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,590
She lies.

230
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,430
How could Joe pull a bag off a table?

231
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,330
He can't even walk.

232
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,310
I'll talk to her.

233
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,270
Why you?

234
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,030
Because you're such a businessman

235
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,420
that knows how to talk to people?

236
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,040
Trust me. When I get done talking to her,

237
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,500
not only will she have confessed to the crime,

238
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,410
I might even sell her a closet.

239
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,060
I remember my buddies

240
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,320
and I were playing rock war once.

241
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,820
That's a game

242
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,170
where you chuck rocks at each other's heads.

243
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,220
What could go wrong, right?

244
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,950
I put one through the window

245
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,940
of my old man's Rambler,

246
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,020
and he thought my baby brother did it.

247
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,470
I couldn't take it,

248
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,260
and I told him I did it.

249
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,950
It felt so good to confess,

250
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,200
and my old man was so proud of me,

251
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,690
I didn't even get in any trouble.

252
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,240
Y-you know?

253
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,760
Joe did it.

254
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,290
She's good.

255
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,080
Watch and learn.

256
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,260
I don't think that cleavage thing

257
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,190
is gonna work with this one.

258
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,970
That's not my only trick.

259
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,730
Hola, Lily.

260
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,870
Where did grandpa go?

261
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,330
Don't worry about Jay.

262
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,340
It's only you and me here now.

263
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,210
So, tell me.

264
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,040
Which one of these is your favorite?

265
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,710
Fine.

266
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,890
One by one,

267
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,760
they will disappear.

268
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,950
Sooner or later,

269
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,410
we'll get to the one that you love.

270
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,630
Ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,970
he's the emperor of escrow.

272
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,370
He puts the toot in tooter.

273
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,590
Let's put your hands together for

274
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,080
Phil Dunphy!

275
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,480
Thanks for the kind introduction,

276
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
me.

277
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,630
Now, unlike past years...

278
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,090
I'm not gonna stand up here

279
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,340
and talk your ears off.

280
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,800
No, ladies and gentlemen.

281
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,690
You deserve more.

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
This year,

283
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,630
I'm gonna sing them off.

284
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,780
I'm selling away

285
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,840
Set an open house for Saturday

286
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,190
A gathering of agents

287
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,280
Appeared in caravan

288
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm a new divorce

289
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,710
Now I need a house

290
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,140
That's cat-friendly

291
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,970
They say the greats

292
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,790
never let anything affect their performance.

293
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,380
Well, maybe the greats never had a daughter

294
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,980
who checked out during the third of five planned

295
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,640
real-time, mid-performance wardrobe changes.

296
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm not gonna lie.

297
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
It knocked me off my game.

298
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,580
On the board

299
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,320
Is this part of it?

300
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
No.

301
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,780
It's not part of it.

302
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,220
In law school,

303
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,760
Wendy Kirk could be a little intense.

304
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,540
I always hoped that she'd soften over time, but...

305
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,120
...some people go the other way.

306
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
This place is a nightmare.

307
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,390
The conditions are deplorable,

308
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,460
and no one should have to suffer

309
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,320
this kind of abuse on a daily basis.

310
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,570
What kind of tyrant has such utter disregard for human life?

311
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,710
I can't do this.

312
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,360
You have to.

313
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,010
Wendy needs to hear it.

314
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,890
Yeah, but I'm nervous. You know, what if she --

315
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,240
- Mitchell. - Yes! Hi!

316
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
I just had a great idea.

317
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,650
I think you would be the perfect person to groom Rex.

318
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,540
E-excuse me?

319
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,930
I just think he'd really respond

320
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,230
to someone like you, you know?

321
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,520
Y-you don't mind, right?

322
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,400
Uh, uh, no. No, not at all.

323
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,270
Great. Thanks.

324
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,510
Will you go over and introduce yourself?

325
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,460
I-intro-- okay.

326
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,510
- Okay. Yeah. - Thank you.

327
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,510
Hello. I'm Mitchell.

328
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,630
And, apparently, this is my job now.

329
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh, god, you smell.

330
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,740
People are looking at me.

331
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,040
That's because you let me make you beautiful.

332
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,230
Stop it. Am I?

333
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,870
Yes, you are.

334
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,680
Have fun.

335
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,870
Go. Go.

336
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,320
Drew. Hey, Drew.

337
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,220
Having fun?

338
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,110
"Fun"? Uh...okay.

339
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,170
Oh, Drew. Drew, listen.

340
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,890
Phil and I are gonna be out really late tonight,

341
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,170
so there will not be an adult at the house

342
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,570
when you drop Alex off,

343
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,470
if you know what I mean.

344
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,990
Yeah, don't worry.

345
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,310
I'll, uh-- I'll drop her off,

346
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,250
and I won't go in.

347
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,410
Well... big house,

348
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,290
you know... cute daughter--

349
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,540
I would not be opposed to you walking her in,

350
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,900
keeping her company until we get back.

351
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,750
Like I said,

352
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,090
we will not be back until late.

353
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,900
I hear you, Mrs. Dunphy.

354
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,740
You can trust me.

355
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,990
Well, gonna have to trust you because we have no way

356
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,740
of knowing what you're gonna get up to.

357
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,360
In fact, if your car is blocking the driveway,

358
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,880
I'll just honk twice

359
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,750
and wait for you to come out.

360
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,550
- Okay. - Okay.

361
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,510
Go get her, tiger. Come on.

362
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
Nice job, Tucker.

363
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,310
I mean, you made so many choices

364
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,610
that I never would have made,

365
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,080
but a lot of them are working.

366
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,990
Oh, well, you know,

367
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,110
I just watched the videos

368
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,230
of the many, many dances you planned

369
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,200
and just built off that one on idea.

370
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,680
Hey, kids!

371
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,730
There are my little chalupas!

372
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,030
Um, what did you do to Rhonda?

373
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,920
I cleaned her up.

374
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,220
No, you broke her.

375
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,490
I hate her like this.

376
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,720
She looks fantastic.

377
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
To you!

378
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,530
Fix her. Ugh, it confuses me.

379
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,730
Oh, Luke.

380
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,990
"The house will be empty"?

381
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,610
You are pimping me out!

382
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,400
It is clear that the two of you like one another.

383
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,690
Sometimes, you need a little nudge.

384
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,030
Well, you're a chaperone!

385
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,330
Just disappear!

386
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,880
This dance is not for you!

387
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,820
You're lucky that's water.

388
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,480
Damn it.

389
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,710
She's been stewing in there for an hour.

390
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,190
I say let's lock the door,

391
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,270
cut the power.

392
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,770
Let's show her that we mean business.

393
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Let's try the joint approach first..."Gitmo."

394
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,580
Okay, we've been going over your story,

395
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,830
and it doesn't add up.

396
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,250
My purse was too high for Joe to reach.

397
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,450
He's tall enough to reach up here.

398
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,090
He knocked over the baby powder

399
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,750
trying to get my stuffed animals.

400
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,850
Not buying it.

401
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,510
Look. You can see the footprints where he walked.

402
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,340
Walk?

403
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,170
Lily, Lily, Lily.

404
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,670
Joe can't walk.

405
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,150
He does for me.

406
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,300
So, you have ways of making him walk?

407
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,720
Lily, just admit that you did it.

408
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,970
Come here, Joe.

409
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,370
Come here like you did before.

410
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,350
Honey, you're embarrassing yourself.

411
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,920
- Come here, Joe. - He can't walk.

412
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,070
He's walking!

413
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,500
The candles that I lit worked!

414
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,680
Look at the stride on him.

415
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,650
He's as surefooted as a mountain goat.

416
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,710
Told you.

417
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm so sorry that we doubted you.

418
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,030
Boy, did I get lucky.

419
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,370
I'm going to blame everything on him

420
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,370
until he learns how to talk.

421
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,300
This guy waltzes in here like he's king of the dance

422
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,880
after doing god knows what in Sri Lanka,

423
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
building schools in underdeveloped areas.

424
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,980
What does that even mean?

425
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,310
Is it possible that you're being a little hard on the man?

426
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,760
I turned his two-bit dance into the event of the year.

427
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,370
Look. Burnouts and dweebs

428
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,190
hanging out together in harmony.

429
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,420
That is me.

430
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
I'm sorry, Cam.

431
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,720
Oh, don't feel sorry for me.

432
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,220
Next is faculty dance.

433
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,210
Kaplan can't move.

434
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,200
It's on his Tumblr.

435
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,690
It's his big shame.

436
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,630
Trust me.

437
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,200
He can't touch this.

438
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,170
Okay, time now for the faculty dance.

439
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,510
Go, teachers.

440
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,290
Oh, are you sure?

441
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,550
Stop. It's "Cammer" Time.

442
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,020
Mind if I join you, coach?

443
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,970
While on sabbatical,

444
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,380
I learned a thing or two from Sri Lanka's own Chitrasena.

445
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,010
I don't know who that is,

446
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,470
and it's annoying when you say things

447
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,480
like people are supposed to know!

448
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,100
That pathetic peacock of a man

449
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,570
was not going down without a fight.

450
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,310
I had a choice to make --

451
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,660
be the better dancer or the bigger man.

452
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,120
So, I stepped off the dance floor

453
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,710
and made the obvious call.

454
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,880
You want to win over a crowd?

455
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,920
Invite a lonely mom to dance.

456
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,290
She never saw it coming,

457
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,680
and neither did he.

458
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,770
Hey Senor.

459
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,740
You just got out-coached.

460
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,290
I try and look on the bright side of things.

461
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,350
I-I'm a doggy-bath-is-half-full

462
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,560
kind of guy.

463
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,160
But it was time for me to open my eyes.

464
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,910
I was working for a monster.

465
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,660
I came to this job to be the voice of the downtrodden.

466
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,930
Turns out those downtrodden were my co-workers,

467
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,790
and they were desperate for a hero to slay their dragon.

468
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,730
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

469
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,850
Um, Rex, how's it going with Mitchell?

470
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,470
The new guy?

471
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,590
I haven't met him yet.

472
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,680
That's weird. I asked him to introduce himself.

473
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,970
hey, has anybody seen my dog?

474
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,040
Pixie!

475
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
Oh, there she is.

476
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,210
Okay, Wendy, I'm sorry.

477
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,320
I-I have something to say to you,

478
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,660
something that everybody else here is afraid to say.

479
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,600
Now, I know you're fighting the good fight,

480
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,140
but that is no excuse for the way you treat people.

481
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,830
T-that actually might be one of the reasons

482
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,000
that you have no personal life

483
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,210
because who wants to come home

484
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,510
to a-a cold, emotionless...thug?

485
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,160
W-what are you talking about?

486
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,420
I am an experienced, respected attorney,

487
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,630
and on my first day,

488
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,650
you asked me to bathe Rex.

489
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm not comfortable with that.

490
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,370
And I'm not comfortable with that,

491
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,470
but I did it.

492
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,340
Okay, that's Pixie.

493
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,390
This is Rex,

494
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,200
the intern I asked you to groom.

495
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,990
And that is my mistake,

496
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,950
and I own that.

497
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,520
But that is still no excuse

498
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,740
for the way that you tore into him

499
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,200
for the outfit he wore yesterday.

500
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,060
I was talking about the outfit he picked out for me.

501
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,200
Apparently, I have the one gay intern in the world

502
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,020
with absolutely no fashion sense.

503
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,570
I was unaware of -- of this dynamic.

504
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,550
But I-I-I'm not alone here, all right?

505
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,870
There are people in this room who feel that you are --

506
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,060
How did we say it? --

507
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,540
you are a tyrant with no regard for human life.

508
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,140
That sounds like my summation for the slum-lord case.

509
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,120
Oh, hey, you finished it?

510
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,090
It's wonderful.

511
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,510
But he's nervous to show you.

512
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,350
Why are you so hard on yourself?

513
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,990
Okay, but w-w-what --

514
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
what about you making us work on sundays?

515
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,290
That -- the night of my barbecue?

516
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:28,990
Dan?

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,120
What are you still doing here?

518
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,030
It's your anniversary! Go home!

519
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,640
Oh, god. This isn't happening.

520
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,750
No, no. She's -- she's crazy.

521
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,380
I mean, I saw her attack the vending machine.

522
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,690
That's the only way it works since Dennis broke it.

523
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,360
Dennis is the guy whose office I took?

524
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,470
Yeah, he was the machine's best customer

525
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,500
until he started running.

526
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,380
One day, he said he's got to get out or --

527
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,790
He would die. Okay. Okay.

528
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,880
Wendy, um...

529
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,750
I-I might owe you a little bit of an apology,

530
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,940
so I'm sorry.

531
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,830
Um, clearly, everybody here loves you,

532
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,520
and I-I was wrong about everything.

533
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,540
So...I'm sorry.

534
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,950
You know, you -- you weren't wrong about everything.

535
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,120
I mean, look, I do joke about it, but you're right.

536
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm alone.

537
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,210
And that is not the first time that someone has called me cold.

538
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,300
Okay, those eggs...

539
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,320
those eggs came out of me frozen.

540
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,650
And I'm impossibly tall.

541
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,480
And even if I could find somebody to love me,

542
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,500
they -- they wouldn't be able to reach.

543
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,730
No -- hey, hey. Come on.

544
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,140
You're -- you're an amazing woman.

545
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,780
She's an amazing woman.

546
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,340
And you -- you're a-a role model.

547
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,460
You're a hero.

548
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm a 6-foot hero.

549
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,920
No. Come on.

550
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,550
You're surrounded by people who love you.

551
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,300
Here's Dan and Rex.

552
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,000
Me. Come here.

553
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,720
All the way up to Samuel L. Jackson there.

554
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,560
That's your mother in a Kangol hat, isn't it?

555
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah.

556
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,740
Um, are you sure you know what you're doing, Tad?

557
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,980
I know you're the Mortgage Doctor, but --

558
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,770
Someone said, "Is there a doctor in the house?"

559
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,130
Was I supposed to not get up?

560
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,290
Hey, dad. You need any help out of that dress?

561
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,190
Not unless you want to see me

562
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,070
in nothing but a baby new year's diaper.

563
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,660
That was the big finish

564
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,250
to the song you were texting through.

565
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,280
Hey, I got one text. I saw most of the show --

566
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,120
We're leaving, okay?

567
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,090
Could you just go to the table

568
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,650
and grab my keys and purse?

569
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,620
Fine.

570
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,130
You want to talk about it?

571
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,060
How many kinds of fake doctor are you?

572
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay, time for the big award of the night,

573
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,310
The ROY...

574
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,510
I don't even know why I'm mad at her.

575
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,140
Probably just 'cause she was so bored all night.

576
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,970
Maybe you're feeling rejected?

577
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,080
It's my own fault.

578
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,720
I built up this hope

579
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,610
that she'd want to follow me into real estate.

580
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,910
...Phil Dunphy.

581
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,420
She's got her own life now.

582
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,440
I just don't know where we connect anymore.

583
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,660
You won.

584
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,800
- What?! - Yeah.

585
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,830
Help me up!

586
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,960
As we all know,

587
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,610
Phil had a little accident tonight,

588
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,630
but we're happy to accept

589
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,470
- this award on his behalf.  - Wait, wait, wait.

590
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,320
Wait, w-w-w-w-wait!

591
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,370
I got this.

592
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,840
Hi. I'm, uh,

593
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,850
I'm haley, Phil's daughter.

594
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,130
Dad, you won the ROY!

595
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,180
You all know him as an amazing realtor,

596
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,220
but I know him as the world's greatest dad.

597
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,990
As far as I'm concerned,

598
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,480
he's the dad of the year,

599
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
the "DOY."

600
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,900
It really is a shame

601
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,800
that you didn't hear the rest of his act tonight.

602
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,170
I-I heard him rehearsing it.

603
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,590
Which one of you is J.J. McCubbin?

604
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,350
Oh. Hey, quick question, J.J. --

605
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,670
Why is a great mortgage rate

606
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,510
like your wife in bed?

607
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,420
Once a month and low interest.

608
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,250
What are you laughing at, Skip Woosnum?

609
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,210
You haven't seen a commission

610
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,900
since you joined the navy.

611
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,820
She is killing it.

612
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,620
That's my girl.

613
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,440
I would have hit the word "Navy" harder.

614
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,690
What else? What else?

615
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh! Margaret Furman's here.

616
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,460
Little heads-up to her date --

617
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,400
She's been upside-down in more houses than Fannie Mae.

618
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,440
Or, in her case, Fannie definitely will.

619
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,420
We all want people to think the best of us...

620
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,180
So sometimes we cover things up

621
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,810
to protect ourselves.

622
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,020
But we don't have to be afraid...

623
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,410
Because the truth is always a good thing.

624
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,750
The truth sets us free...

625
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,620
...brings us closer.

626
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,660
So, do you want to tell us

627
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,140
How Joe's shoes ended up on the wrong feet?

628
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,340
I guess the little guy knows how to put on his own shoes.

629
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,400
There you go, buddy. You got this.

630
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,310
What are you doing?

631
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,380
Since Joe can walk now,

632
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,930
I figured he should be doing a few chores.

633
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,950
Steady, big guy!

634
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,300
Chores? What kind of --

635
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,560
There he is.

636
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,930
Attaboy!

637
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,170
Attaboy!

638
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,470
A beer? Are you crazy?

639
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,890
Where you going? You want some?

640
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,660
He'll bring it to you.

641
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,650
I can't believe that you're teaching him to do that.

642
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,290
Wait till you see part two.

643
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,880
Attaboy.

644
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,210
Relax, it was me.
