-嗨  -好啊
- Hi! - Hello.

36
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,420
喜欢我们的毛衣吗
Do you love our sweaters?

37
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,920
我觉得会超适合冰雪舞会跳舞
I thought they would be perfect for the Snow Ball dance.

38
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,070
我在那家有搭配商品的打折商店买的
I got them at the store where you buy things that go with the other things.

39
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,400
我知道那地方  我们就是在那买的
Oh, I know that place. That's where we got

40
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,600
"椒盐"造型的盐和胡椒粉调味瓶
our Salt-N-Pepa salt and pepper shakers.

41
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,430
{\an8}椒盐是最成功的女子说唱团体之一
由三名黑人女性组成

42
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,430
克莱尔总是分不清哪个是哪个
Claire can never tell which one is which.

43
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,300
创意与呈现都很失败的产品
A confusing idea poorly executed.

44
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,540
别再暗示我是种族主义者了
Stop implying I'm a racist.

45
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,040
我们怎么就要去当监护人了
How did we get roped into this chaperone thing?

46
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,980
有个特别烦人的家庭教师协会的妈妈玛乔丽
This incredibly annoying PTA mom, Marjorie,

47
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,580
整天缠着我们为各种活动当志愿者
keeps hounding us to volunteer for things,

48
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,370
我们推脱到终于没借口用了
and we finally ran out of excuses.

49
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,540
我也许该告诉她我们出发了
Ooh, I should probably tell her we're coming.

50
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,280
信了她的邪
Unreal.

51
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,400
"你在哪里"
"Where are you?"

52
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,720
"你跟克莱尔在一起吗"
"Are you with Claire?"

53
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,610
"你还有多远"
"How far away are you?"

54
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,240
"快到了发短信告诉我"
"Text me when you're close."

55
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,530
"我把钥匙锁在车里了"
"I locked my keys in my car."

56
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,940
那是海莉发的
Oh, that's from Haley.

57
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,650
虽然我很想见见这个怪人
Much as I'd love to meet this dingbat,

58
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,900
但他们到底需要多少监护人啊
how many chaperones do they really need?

59
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,120
只用一个人就能拿着水管
Takes one person to turn a garden hose

60
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,100
浇醒发情的人们
on those dry humpers.

61
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,010
如果菲尔要去  那你也得去
If Phil is going, you are going.

62
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,150
我不喜欢在任何场合当唯一一个
I don't like being the only person in the room

63
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,430
没老公的人
without a husband.

64
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,140
这事让我没有安全感
It's my one insecurity.

65
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,460
菲尔在当老好人
Phil's just trying to be nice.

66
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,990
其实他也不想去
He doesn't want to go to this thing, either.

67
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,410
实际上我很期待
Actually, I was looking forward to it.

68
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,630
也许见见所谓的拉拉队员
Maybe meet some of these so-called cheerleaders.

69
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,060
我会告诉她们  我们可以将蝎子摆尾姿势的人
Watch their faces when I tell them we could kewpie a scorpion

70
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,700
往上扔  接住  然后搭架子  
into a cradle catch 

71
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,210
同时观察她们惊讶的表情
and then pop up into a split extension.

72
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,040
当然这些现在大多数都是禁招了
Most of that stuff's illegal now.

73
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,340
我觉得菲尔的意思是
I think what Phil's trying to say is that

74
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,550
我跟他很久都没有度过男人之夜了
he and I haven't had a boy's night in a good while.

75
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,890
就你跟我两个人出去玩玩
I mean, wouldn't it be nice to just hang out together,

76
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,920
难道不好吗
just you and me?

77
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,310
你怎么说  伙计
What do you say, buddy?

78
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,190
啥
What?!

79
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,730
跟我老丈人杰出去玩玩也许挺好的
Might be nice to have a hang with my boy Jay.

80
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,320
如果你没意见
If it's fine with you.

81
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,290
行啊  这是我至少能做的  因为明天
Sure, it's the least I could do, because tomorrow

82
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,570
你就要辅导卢克做家庭作业了
you are going to help Luke with his homework

83
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,740
而我要去葡萄酒庄
while I visit wine country.

84
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,890
我也想去
I want to go.

85
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,630
她的意思是躺在蹦床上
That's just what she calls lying on the trampoline

86
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,890
喝夏顿埃酒
drinking Chardonnay.

87
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,600
好  我们在路上了
Oh, yes! We're on our way.

88
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,590
-好  -再见
- Okay. - Bye-bye.

89
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,080
你俩玩得开心哦
Have fun, you two.

90
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,810
别操心我们  我们会嗨翻天的
Don't worry about us. We'll have a blast.

91
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,480
我们会过得很开心的
We'll have a good time. We'll have a good time.

92
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,030
好棒
Yes!

93
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
这会很好玩的
This is gonna be so great!

94
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,730
当然  等她们出门后
Sure it will. Maybe give them about

95
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,620
五分钟你再走吧
a five-minute lag time before you hit the road.

96
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,390
你什么意思
What do you mean?

97
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,290
你说我们要一起去玩
You -- you said we were gonna do something together.

98
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,530
我是想帮我们摆脱愚蠢的舞会
I was just trying to get us out of that stupid dance.

99
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,590
好吧
Okay.

100
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,700
享受你的夜晚吧  菲尔
Enjoy your night, Phil.

101
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,450
我跟一本写坏警长的精彩西部小说还有约
I've got a date with an epic Western about a crooked sheriff,

102
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,710
而我读到了我预测是不当绞刑的桥段了
and I'm at the first of what I predict to be many wrongful hangings.

103
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,770
如果你不打算出去玩
Well, if you're not up for doing anything,

104
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,240
我还是去舞会好了
I think I'll just go to the dance.

105
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,020
什么  不  你不能那样做
What? No. You can't do that.

106
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,370
会显得我像是个混蛋
Makes me look like a jerk.

107
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,540
那我该做什么
Well, then what am I supposed to do?

108
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,260
-你想做什么都行  -我想去舞会
- Whatever you like. - I want to go to the dance.

109
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,770
你怎么就不懂我意思了呢
How are you not getting this?

110
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,150
好吧  我就回家好了
Fine. I'll just go home.

111
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,640
你要去舞会  对吧
You're going to the dance, aren't you?

112
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
-当然  -好  你赢了
- Of course I am. - All right, you win.

113
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,470
-我们一起玩  -太棒了
- We'll do something. - Awesome!

114
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,190
-你想做什么  -天啊  我不知道
- What do you want to do? - Gosh, I don't know.

115
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,540
我的舞蹈细胞还有些蠢蠢欲动
I mean, dancing is still so much in the air.

116
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,790
你去哪里
Where are you going?

117
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,850
苏格兰威士忌酒庄
Scotch country.

118
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,680
12号桶里冰块不多了
We're low on ice in bucket 12.

119
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,560
蟹肉饼得撑一晚上
Hey, those crab cakes have to last all night.

120
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,630
多推销奶酪
Push the cheese.

121
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,970
演出曲目
Setlist?

122
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,830
你要以《幸运儿[上床]》开场吗
You're starting with "Get Lucky"?

123
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,420
拜托  音乐有个故事起承转合好吗
Come on, we're telling a story here.

124
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,960
你知道现在几点了吗
Do you know what time it is?

125
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
我还以为你要帮我布置
I thought you were gonna help me set up.

126
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,820
抱歉
Sorry, buddy.

127
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,810
我在操心大局[大照片]
I was worrying about the big-picture stuff.

128
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,330
{\an8}欢迎来到冰雪舞会

129
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,380
有足够的地方放吗
Hmm. Is there enough room for it here,

130
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,170
还是我该把它放在后门入口
or should I put it in the back entrance?

131
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,210
你绝对可以把它塞进某个"后入口"
You can certainly put it in a back entrance.

132
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,230
天啊  一切看起来都好棒啊
Oh, my gosh, doesn't everything look so lovely?

133
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,380
这是高中嘛
Well, it's high school.

134
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,040
随你怎么装饰  这里还是
Dress it up all you want, it's still the place I spent

135
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,950
我被虐待狂恶霸折磨了四年的地方
four years being tormented by sadistic bullies.

136
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,620
衬衫不错  米歇尔小妞
Nice shirt, Michelle.

137
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,060
知道吗  时代变了
You know what? Times have changed.

138
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,710
在高中  你想过
In high school, did you ever imagine

139
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,760
你会跟橄榄球教练在一起吗
you'd end up with the football coach?

140
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,190
橄榄球教练倒是没有
The football coach? No.

141
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,990
游泳教练阿提诺老师  我倒是每晚都想
The swim coach, Mr. Artino, almost nightly.

142
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,090
塔克教练  米奇尔
Oh, Coach Tucker, Mitchell.

143
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,440
谢谢你们当志愿者
Thank you for volunteering.

144
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,200
我拒绝不了嘛
I couldn't say no.

145
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,240
我队里的孩子几乎是恳求我来
The kids on the team practically begged me.

146
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,670
我这么重要  激励了这么多人  真是太好了
It's an amazing thing to matter so much and inspire so many.

147
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,870
不  我觉得他们希望你来
Oh, no, I think they just wanted you here

148
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,960
只是为了要整你
so they can prank you.

149
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,970
-是吗  -对
- Hmm? - Yeah.

150
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,900
橄榄球队计划好了一切
The football team has something all worked out.

151
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,540
我不知道详细招数  因为薪水有了上限后
I don't know what it is 'cause I checked out

152
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,080
我就走人了
after they capped my salary.

153
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,800
但向来是惨不忍睹  不忍直视
But there's usually a mess,

154
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
所以你最好在这精致的礼服外面套一个披风
so you might want to throw a poncho over all that finery.

155
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,000
我的天  我好讨厌恶作剧
Oh, my God, I hate pranks so much.

156
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,270
我整场舞会都只能提心吊胆
Now I'm gonna spend the whole dance paranoid

157
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,700
猜测他们要怎么整我
wondering what they're gonna do.

158
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,120
会不会很疼  我会不会哭
Is it gonna hurt? Am I gonna cry?

159
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,220
你是个小丑
You're a clown.

160
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,270
小丑不就是一直在耍别人吗
Isn't that mostly just pranking people?

161
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
不  才不是  小丑又有爱又欢乐
No, it is not. Clowns are loving and joyful.

162
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,840
你知道吗
You know what?

163
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,710
我对你们这种愚昧的想法早有耳闻
I was warned about this kind of ignorance.

164
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,990
不要让我后悔没跟马戏团圈内人结婚
Don't make me regret marrying outside the big top.

165
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,090
什么
What?

166
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,100
我们得擦亮眼睛看好
We got to keep our eyes peeled

167
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
那些尝试偷带酒进来的孩子
for kids trying to bring alcohol in here.

168
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,350
这工作不喝酒我没法干好
I cannot make it through this thing without a drink.

169
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,150
玛乔丽  十二点方向
Marjorie, 12:00.

170
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,100
天哪
Oh, God.

171
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,990
快  假装我们在吵架
Quick, pretend we're having a fight.

172
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,020
她就不会过来了
Then she won't come over here.

173
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,550
你偷了该我继承的遗产  你傍大款
You stole my inheritance, you gold digger!

174
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,480
你这话准备好很久了吧
Wow, you had that one ready to go.

175
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,560
你们在这啊
There you are.

176
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,940
你们收到我的短信了吗
Did you get my texts?

177
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,610
看看我没收的酒
Look what I've already confiscated.

178
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,100
真可耻  交给我吧
Oh, shameful. I'll take that.

179
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,070
我还需要志愿者打电话给家长
So, I still need volunteers to call parents

180
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,770
请他们提供无声拍卖会的拍品
for silent auction items.

181
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,140
我已经排了六个小时的班
I've divided it into six-hour shifts,

182
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,590
所以如果你们能轮流打半个小时电话
so if you switch ears every half-hour,

183
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,230
那就太棒了
it's actually not bad.

184
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,210
我能拜托你们两位女士吗
Can I count on you two ladies?

185
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,460
我太忙了  但我不能替歌洛莉亚做决定
I'm so busy, but I can't speak for Gloria.

186
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,380
偶电话英语不咋地
My phone English no so good.

187
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,380
我懂  我有点爱唠唠叨叨
I get it. I'm a bit of a nag-eroo.

188
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,650
就像我妈总开玩笑说
Like my mom always jokes,

189
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,180
你知道你该去烦谁吗
you know who you should bore with this?

190
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,940
你老公  对了  他离开你了
Your husband. Oh, right, he left you.

191
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,000
那个女人太神经兮兮了
That woman is so uptight.

192
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,400
你知道她需要什么吗
You know what she needs?

193
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,790
一个男人
A man.

194
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,700
你的想法太过时了
That is a very old-fashioned attitude,

195
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,160
但在这种情况下  还是很贴切的
which in this case, seems pretty accurate.

196
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,680
男人  男人  男人  我们去哪找个男人
A man, a man, a man. Where can we find one.

197
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,270
你好  Siri  录一下鉴宝节目
Hey, Siri, record "Antiques Roadshow."

198
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,570
我一个都想不到
I can't think of anyone.

199
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,970
布朗校长
Principal Brown.

200
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,840
他单身  我们可以撮合他们
He's single. We could fix them up.

201
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,120
在这个冬季舞会上相恋
At the winter dance. Mm-hmm.

202
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,470
太浪漫了
That's so romantic.

203
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,290
对  如果她能多关注自己
Yes, and maybe she'll get off our backs

204
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,130
就能少烦一点我们了
if she spends more time on hers.

205
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,240
你真是你爸的亲儿子
You really are your father's son.

206
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,800
你还好吗
Hey, you okay?

207
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,900
有人刚在所有人面前嘲笑了我的领结
Guy just made fun of my bow tie in front of everyone.

208
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,130
问我是不是故意gay里gay气的
Asked if I was trying to look gay.

209
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,250
不  你带着很好看
Oh, that is charming.

210
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,000
我猜高中还是以前的老样子吧
So I-I guess high school hasn't changed that much, has it?

211
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
听着  我想让你重新戴上这个领结
Look, I want you to put this back on

212
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,200
骄傲地戴着
and wear this with pride.

213
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,020
你扔进去之前它就湿透了  是吗
This was soaking wet before you threw it in there, right?

214
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,250
我们还是扔了它吧  没事的
We're gonna let it go. It's fine.

215
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,540
好了
All right.

216
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,660
吐槽你的蠢货在哪里
Where is this idiot?

217
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,870
你是故意想要gay里gay气吗
Are you trying to look gay?

218
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,730
因为你没有胸肌  没有大毛孔
'Cause you don't have the pecs, the pores,

219
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,560
也没有男子气概  猛男
or the pants for it, slugger.

220
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,720
有句比较老的话  跟你发型差不多年头
Hey, here's a reference that hairstyle's old enough to get.

221
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
发型不可则止  "舞"自辱焉
It's not twerking.

222
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,140
好吧  你就是个  就是个  是个...
Yeah, well, you're just -- you're just a -- you're a --

223
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,190
你是个  你是个...
You're a -- you're a --

224
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,360
我先去跳个舞啊
So, I'm gonna go squeeze in a dance real quick

225
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,740
你就慢慢在这里结巴说完这句话吧
while you stagger to the end of that sentence.

226
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,120
我是《每日海豚报》莱斯丽·关·柯林斯
Leslie Kwan Collins, Daily Dolphin.

227
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,790
我认识你好吗
I know who you are.

228
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,100
我们打从幼儿园就是朋友了
We've been friends since kindergarten.

229
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,070
你愿意评价一下我线人所说的
Care to comment on what my sources are calling

230
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,880
"有史以来最棒的冰雪舞会吗"
"The best Snow Ball ever?"

231
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,060
好  但这场派对的成功
Sure, but I'm not the one responsible

232
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,660
不是我一个人的功劳
for this party's success.

233
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,140
也是他们的
They all are.

234
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,600
我只不过是让这一切发生的谦虚公仆
I'm just a humble servant who made it all happen.

235
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,650
让我们单独谈谈好吗  谢谢
Can you excuse us, please? Thank you.

236
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,000
我真是服了你了
You are unbelievable.

237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,050
打住  我承受不起那么多赞美
Stop. I can't keep hearing this.

238
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,770
我才是让这一切发生的人
I'm the one who made all this happen.

239
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,580
你知道凭八千块办起这活动有多难吗
Do you have any idea how hard it is doing all this for $8,000?

240
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,490
你当然不知道  因为...
Yeah, of course not, because --

241
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,070
等一下  舞会的预算是八百块块
Wait, wait, wait. The budget for this was $800.

242
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
你花了八千吗
You spent $8,000?

243
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,470
那可是一整年的经费预算
That's the budget for the whole year.

244
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,460
我发短信问你"冰雪舞会的预算是多少"
I texted you, "What's my budget for the Snow Ball."

245
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,180
你回复了八千  还有一张无聊的动图
You replied $8,000, followed by a gratuitous gif

246
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,730
一张男人撞到蛋蛋的动图
of a guy getting hit in the nards.

247
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,830
就像是在说  别在栏杆上滑板就好啦
It's like just don't skateboard down a railing, right?

248
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,740
-布朗校长  -什么事
- Principal Brown. - Yep?

249
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,020
如果我们学生会的预算想稍微超额
If we were to go over with the student council budget,

250
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,950
再多要一点预算会有多难呢
how hard would it be to get a little extra money?

251
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,960
没问题啊
Oh, no problem.

252
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,300
我们只需要把教员休息室里名画卖了就行
We would just sell the Rembrandt in the faculty lounge.

253
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,830
看到没  问题解决了
See? Problem solved.

254
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,020
-他是在说反话  -怎么了  有什么问题吗
- He's being sarcastic. - Why? What's wrong?

255
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,330
没有  只是在玩"如果钱都花完了"的游戏
Nothing. Just playing "What if all the money got spent?"

256
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,620
你能想象那情景吗
Oh, can you imagine?

257
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,010
预算没了我们就得取消
We'd have to cancel

258
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,220
其他所有的学校活动
every other school event,

259
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,010
先拿摔跤队的庆功宴开刀
starting with the wrestling banquet,

260
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,920
那些狂躁的神经病会把你们头拧掉的
and those hopped-up psychos would rip your heads off!

261
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,060
然后你们就会流血而死
And then you'd bleed to death

262
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,980
因为我们再也没钱请校医了  对吗
'cause we can't afford a school nurse anymore, right?

263
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,550
生蚝
Oysters.

264
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,840
想得美  小伙子们
Oh! Nice try, boys!

265
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,380
没你们的事了
You guys are cool.

266
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,770
快走开
Just, uh, move along.

267
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,580
小卡  你知道一个叫达米安·沃马克的小孩吗
Hey, Cam. Uh, do you know a kid named Damien Warmack?

268
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,480
当然知道
Oh, yeah.

269
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,520
-很刻薄的小孩  -对
- Mean little kid. - Yeah.

270
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,210
他嘲笑我所有的防守队员肥死人
He fat shamed my whole defensive line.

271
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,430
看着一个曾经彪悍的中卫把沙拉里的
There's nothing more sad than watching

272
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,230
烤面包丁挑出来  真是人间惨剧
a once terrifying nose tackle pick croutons out of his salad.

273
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,310
天啊  我现在好纠结
Oh, God, I'm so conflicted.

274
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,150
有个同性恋小孩在欺负橄榄球员
A gay kid is now bullying football players,

275
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,640
虽然看似是种进步
which I guess, you know, seems like progress,

276
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,220
但这种进步是错误的
but the wrong kind of progress.

277
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,320
您要不要吃点...
Would you like a --

278
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,870
反正大部分烤面包片最后都是被丢掉的嘛
In my defense, bruschetta mostly ends up on the floor anyway.

279
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,200
小卡  你好像
Cam, I think you might be

280
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,070
太过担心恶作剧的事了
more worried about this prank than you need to be.

281
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,720
真搞不懂他们为什么想要整我
Well, I just don't understand why they want to prank me.

282
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
我还以为他们喜欢人家
I thought they liked me.

283
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,130
他们当然喜欢你啦
Of course they like you.

284
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,790
对不喜欢的人那不叫整
You can't prank someone you don't like.

285
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
叫做...  叫做攻击
That's -- that's just assault.

286
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,770
但整你  其实是他们在用
But pranking you is their bizarre way

287
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,940
扭曲变态的方式向你表白
of saying that they love you.

288
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,070
这是你在用扭曲变态的方式安慰我吗
Is this your bizarre way of not validating my feelings?

289
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,040
我们可以去打保龄球
Okay, we could go bowling.

290
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,740
昨晚刚去打完  现在打球的兴致是"龄"
Hmm. Had my league last night. I'm a little bowled out.

291
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,380
好吧  那打一轮迷你高尔夫球呢
Fair enough. Round of mini golf?

292
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,370
好主意  你等着
Great idea. Wait up.

293
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,910
我去拿我的青蛙和弹弓
I'll go get my frog and my slingshot.

294
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,420
我们骑单车到下面去
We'll hop on our bikes and go down there.

295
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,480
要不我们吃点东西
We could get something to eat.

296
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,780
-吃过了  -看电影呢
- Already ate. - Go to the movies?

297
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,210
-讨厌排队  -去酒吧呢
- Hate the lines. - How about a bar?

298
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,830
我们大老远开车去
So, we drive across town, pay a 200% markup

299
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,640
花两倍的钱买跟我手上这杯一模一样的威士忌
on the same glass of scotch I'm holding in my hand right now

300
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,090
就为了有某个喝醉的老女人粘过来
just so some drunken old broad can stagger over

301
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,110
说我长得像某老派大牌男演员吗
and tell me I look like Ernest Borgnine.

302
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,230
我不要再提议了
You know what? I'm done trying.

303
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,090
和我做任何事都不能让你开心
I'm sorry there isn't a single thing

304
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,460
真是不好意思
you'd have fun doing with me.

305
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,530
得了吧
Oh, come on!

306
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,950
别一副受伤脸
Don't get all hurt.

307
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,860
我保证  我会答应你下一个提议
I promise your next idea, I'll say yes to.

308
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,310
不是吧
Really?

309
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,440
谢谢你  杰

想要让大家跟你一样难受

之前是我误会了

373
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,300
行了  你到底是想被整还是不想被整

我只是不明白他们为什么还求我来
I just don't understand why they begged me to be here

375
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,250
又不是为了整我

I'm just kidding. They think you're a pushover,

380
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,730
你在的话  他们想干什么都行
and with you here, they can get away with anything.

381
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,590
真是笑话  没什么能逃过我法眼

-真的吗  -假的
- Really? - No!

456
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,210
哪有这种活动
It doesn't exist.

457
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,350
你想参与的那种活动根本不存在
What you want does not exist.

458
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,250
你这是做什么
What are you doing?

459
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,180
我不管你要干嘛
I don't care what you do,

460
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,020
但我要去参加舞会
but I'm going into that dance.

461
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
我喜欢看到孩子们盛装打扮开开心心的
I like to see the kids all dressed up and happy

462
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,950
试图装出一副已经长大的样子
and trying to look older than they are.

463
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,610
我的初吻就是在高中舞会
The first girl I ever kissed was at a high school dance.

464
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,250
其实当时就放着《狮王今夜沉睡》
It was actually to "The Lion Sleeps Tonight."

465
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,030
难怪我刚刚脑子里一直回放这首歌
I guess that's why it was in my head.

466
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,990
姑且告诉你  狮王那晚可一夜都没睡
Let's just say the lion did not sleep that night.

467
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,700
我当时像个野蛮人一样狂灌汽水
I was slamming Mountain Dews like a wild man.

468
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,540
玛莎·古尔丁
Marsha Goulding.

469
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,630
我当时特别迷恋她
I had this huge crush on her.

470
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,470
终于鼓起勇气邀请她去春季嘉年华
Finally got my nerve up to ask her to the Spring Fling.

471
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,340
第一支舞时我吓坏了  总踩她脚
First dance, I was terrified. I'm tromping all over her feet.

472
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,370
但跳着跳着  就放松了
But as the dances went on, it got easier,

473
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,220
山姆·库克的《你令我沉醉》放到一半时
and right in the middle of Sam Cooke singing "You Send Me,"

474
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,330
我鼓起勇气一搏
I went for it.

475
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,290
我当时好惊讶她也回吻了我
I was just so surprised she kissed me back.

476
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
初吻不能再来
Well, you can't have your first kiss again,

477
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,120
但你的下一个吻就在那场舞会上
but you can have your next one right in there.

478
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,660
好啦好啦  就哄歌洛莉亚高兴高兴吧
Oh, what the hell. Give Gloria a thrill.

479
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,430
太好了  杰  因为你使她完整
That's great, Jay, 'cause you complete her.

480
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,260
菲尔你真会说话
Oh, Phil.

481
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,570
不  字面意义上的
No, literally.

482
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,740
"你使她完整"
You complete her.

483
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,970
你是这个笑话的结尾屁股部分
You're the butt of this joke.

484
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,510
毛衣给我
Give me the sweater.

485
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,670
玛乔丽又聪明又有条理
Marjorie is smart and organized,

486
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,710
不论你什么时候需要洗手液或是创可贴
and if you ever need hand sanitizer or a Band-Aid,

487
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,740
她总随身带着
she always has it on her.

488
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,470
她就像一个性感火辣的药房
She's like a sexy, sexy drugstore.

489
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,980
她萌得没治了
She's as cute as a button.

490
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,190
就像个长大的椰菜娃娃
Like a grown-up Cabbage Patch doll.

491
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,180
感觉麻烦事会特别多
Yeah. Yeah, that seems like it'd be a whole lot of e-mails.

492
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,260
坚决拒绝
It's a hard pass.

493
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,010
可是布朗校长  你知道人们都说
But, Principal Brown, you know what they say

494
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,160
在外面就充满热情的人妻回家后多狂野吧
about a mom who's enthusiastic in the streets.

495
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,360
哪有这种说法
That's not a saying.

496
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,280
话说回来  你们两个
Why are the two of you

497
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,420
为什么突然对我的感情生活这么感兴趣
suddenly so interested in my love life, anyway?

498
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,780
因为我们在乎你
Because we care.

499
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,410
你们连我的名字都不知道
You don't even know my first name.

500
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,590
我们知道
Yes, we do.

501
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,960
你叫  普林斯
It's, um... Prince?

502
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,910
{\an8}有同名的黑人歌手

503
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,690
狗屎运猜中的
Lucky guess.

504
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,910
我刚刚在烤肉台那边
I was over at the carving station,

505
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,870
我就想"你知道谁会想吃牛肋排吗
and I thought, "You know who'd love some prime rib?

506
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,630
普林斯·布朗校长"
Principal Prince Brown."

507
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,650
玛乔丽  恐怕你我只是
Marjorie, I'm afraid you and I are pawns

508
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,790
这两个人精心策划的变态计划中的两颗棋子
in a very sick game being orchestrated by these two.

509
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,520
她们两个非常努力地想把咱俩撮合到一起
They're working very hard to put us together,

510
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,770
我也不知道为什么
and I don't know why.

511
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,280
我从没见过她们俩努力做任何事
I've never seen them work very hard in anything,

512
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,970
除了逃避志愿工作的时候
except getting out of volunteering.

513
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,180
凭良心讲  我们也志愿做了很多事
Hey, to be fair, we volunteer for plenty of things.

514
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,870
你忘了我提着水管在慈善洗车募款洗车吗
Yeah, don't you remember me holding a hose at the car wash?

515
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,750
精彩画面  永生难忘
Yeah, everybody remembers that.

516
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,010
所以你对我没兴趣是吗
So you're not interested in me?

517
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,100
我们一直以来都是同事间的情谊
Well, we've always had a working relationship,

518
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,930
我可能只是从没想过跟你有那种感情吧
and I guess I've just never thought of you in that way.

519
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,980
男女之情吗
As a woman?

520
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,970
我在工作时会把男女感情抛到九云霄外
When I'm at work, I turn off that part of myself.

521
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,480
现在那感情又上身了
Uh, it has turned back on.

522
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,430
我去检查消防安全门是否畅通
Oh, I'm gonna check the -- the fire exits.

523
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,090
我们去开始把椅子叠起来
We're going to stack chairs.

524
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,080
慢走不送
Whatever.

525
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,290
我想到了
I've got it.

526
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,610
我们创立一个假军乐队
We start a fake marching band

527
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,390
然后先拿一笔购置乐器的款项
and get the money for the instruments up front.

528
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,630
这根本就是电影《欢乐音乐妙无穷》的翻版
You just described the exact plot of "The Music Man."

529
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,480
下场如何
How'd that turn out?

530
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,670
赢了四座托尼奖
Won four Tonys.

531
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,230
是五座
Five. Ugh.

532
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,210
你怎么可以让这种事发生呢
How could you let this happen?

533
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,750
我哪知道啊  你短信我的时候
I don't know. You were texting me

534
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,980
我正好在直播我的早餐...
while I was live streaming my breakfast, and...

535
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,310
等等
Wait a minute.

536
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,630
我说了是八百块啊
I did say $800.

537
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,710
你看
Look.

538
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,060
天啊  那这事真的是我的锅
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.

539
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,450
哎哟哟
Well, well, well.

540
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,890
风水轮流转  傻逼轮流当
Looks like the dunce cap is on the other foot.

541
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,840
艹
Hey!

542
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,310
你这体型的牲畜吃的就是草
Is what an animal your size grazes on.

543
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,910
艹就是草
Hay is...

544
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,270
而你是只大笨牛
You're a cow.

545
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,540
好啦
Okay.

546
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,850
你这块头  你的体重绝对很完美
You're the perfect weight for your frame.

547
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,850
同志内心挣扎的又一经典呈现
Another proud moment for the struggle.

548
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,400
她来啦
Ugh. Here she comes.

549
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,670
斗士玛丁·璐德·妗女士
Martin Luther Queen, yes.

550
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,050
请您务必跟我说说基佬的内心挣扎
By all means, tell me about the struggle.

551
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,650
可以啊  你个毒舌小娘炮
Okay, you nasty little twink.

552
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,020
你对不起我
You owe everything to me

553
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,600
与所有在你之前的男同前辈
and all the gays that came before you.

554
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,420
我们辛苦争取来的一切
It's because of everything we fought for

555
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,250
才让你能不可一世的在高中里混
that you get to snark your way through high school

556
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,600
穿着内增高招摇过市
with lifts in your shoes

557
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,910
而不是被人塞进置物柜里眼泪汪汪
instead of spending it terrified, shoved in a locker.

558
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,490
我十分自豪说出这番话
I was really proud of that.

559
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,420
我坦白告诉你
Just so you know.

560
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,060
洗澡前先用干的刷子去角质
Exfoliating with a dry brush pre-shower

561
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,990
就能够大大得到改善哦
will really help you with all of this.

562
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,320
能让你回到50岁时的年轻状态
It'll make you look 50 again.

563
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,670
接下来的举动我就不是很自豪了
I'm not really proud of what came next.

564
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,910
你连塞人都像个娘们儿
You shove like a girl!

565
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,850
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

566
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,220
到了买单的时候了
The piper needs to be paid.

567
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,400
你还有单没买吗
You hired a piper?

568
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,900
不  是为错误买单  我得扛起责任
No. I made a mistake, and I need to accept the consequences.

569
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,550
各位同学  打扰一下
Classmates, could I have everyone's attention, please?

570
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,780
我有个不太好的消息
I have some troubling news.

571
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,610
我知道你们都觉得我是校园金童
I know you may all think of me as the golden boy,

572
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,920
天才选手  神一般的人物
the prodigy, the wunderkind.

573
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,900
你谁啊
Who are you?

574
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,920
没错
Indeed.

575
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,670
我都要不知道自己是谁了
I'm not sure I know anymore.

576
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,050
我们有个小问题
We have a little situation,

577
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,180
我想尽早跟大家坦白这事
and I just want to be as up front as I can.

578
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,380
等等
Hold on a minute.

579
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
我才是主席
I'm the President.

580
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,610
这事该由我来
I should do this.

581
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,530
我们要为一位有困难的同学募款八千元
We need to raise $8,000 for a classmate in need.

582
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,530
如果筹不到这笔钱  他可能得一生瘫痪
If we don't get this money, he may never walk again.

583
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,150
我们会发起一个众筹  如果你想要展现
We're gonna make a Kickstarter, and if you want to show

584
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,360
自己是一位有爱心有善心的人给对象看
your date you're the kind of sensitive, caring person

585
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,790
以获得该有的肉体上奖励
who deserves to be rewarded in a physical way,

586
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,570
你就会慷慨乐捐
you'll give generously.

587
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,910
你真是个大说谎家
Wow, you're a good liar.

588
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,480
我收回我以前的话  当主席你实至名归
I take it back. You deserve to be President.

589
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,910
我们就不应该帮忙把那个小贱人
We never should've helped that little punk

590
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,190
从置物柜里救出来
get out of that locker.

591
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,920
我不知道他会对你的毛衣这么狠啊
I didn't know he was gonna be so brutal about your sweater.

592
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,310
-好了  交出来  -什么
- All right, hand it over. - What?

593
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,240
这里是禁大麻区  你个"麻"烦精
This is a blaze-free zone, wastoid.

594
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,850
这里到处都有我的眼线
I got eyes all over this place.

595
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,910
我知道什么是大麻烟斗
I know what vape is.

596
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,490
-教练  那是我的...  -你的啥
- Coach, that's just my -- - Just your --

597
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,190
教练  能跟你说句话吗
Hey, Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

598
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,350
什么事
Yeah, what's up?

599
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,770
我只是想告诉你
Yeah, I, uh, just wanted to let you know

600
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,450
那个呢...  是他的气喘药吸入器
that that's, uh -- that's his inhaler.

601
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,560
是他的...
It's his -- oh.

602
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,070
你是有什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

603
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,160
抱歉了
Sorry.

604
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,710
只是觉得我对他们掏心掏肺
It's just I give everything to these boys,

605
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,500
他们却只觉得我是软柿子
and all they think of me is that I'm a pushover

606
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,300
连整我都懒得整
not even worthy of a lousy prank.

607
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,730
小卡  你有看到歌洛莉亚吗
Cam, have you seen Gloria?

608
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,570
有啊  我上次看到她
What? Yeah, oh, last time I saw her,

609
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,950
她好像是在那一带
she was somewhere over here.

610
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,430
那本来是要倒我头上的
Oh, that was for me!

611
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,790
本来是要来整我的  我的孩子们爱我
That was supposed to be for me! My boys love me!

612
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,580
我就想安静读本书而已
I just wanted to read my book.

613
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,220
你好  我是卢克·邓菲
Oh, hi there. I'm Luke Dunphy,

614

-学生会主席  -而我...
- Student Body President. - And I'm --

615
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,480
但主角并不是我们
But this isn't about us.

616
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,950
是我们一位碰到难关的同学
We have a classmate who's in a pretty bad spot.

617
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,110
但他的人生不见得得止步于此
But it doesn't have to end that way.

618
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,180
有了您的帮助  我们能让他免于挨打
With your help, we can save him from getting beaten up.

619
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,400
挨病痛的打击
By -- by his disease.

620
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,030
一种任何孩子都不该与之"搏斗"的疾病
A disease no kid should have to wrestle with.

621
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,230
我们只需要筹到八千块
We just need to raise $8,000 to --

622
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,860
或九千块的善款  来让他享受豪华治疗
Or $9,000 to get him that super deluxe treatment.

623
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,990
我们只需要八千块
We only need $8000
