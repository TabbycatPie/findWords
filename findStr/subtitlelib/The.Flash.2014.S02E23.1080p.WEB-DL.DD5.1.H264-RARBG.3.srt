00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:03,165
<i>This season on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,906
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay Garrick.

3
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:08,207
<i>Where I came from, I was
a speedster like you.</i>

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,506
<i>Before I arrived on your Earth, I
was in a fight with a man named Zoom.</i>

5
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,081
He will do whatever it takes to
ensure he's the only speedster

6
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,087
- in any world.
- Never forget:

7
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,961
I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:22,540
I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,599
<i>- Cisco, what did you see?
- I saw Jay. He's Zoom.</i>

10
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,100
Who's the man in the iron mask?

11
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,735
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,572
What do you say you and I give this a shot?

13
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,906
Yeah, I would like that.

14
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,255
I've always measured my success

15
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:36,288
by counting the number of victims I've had.

16
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:37,878
But now I think I'm going to start counting

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,715
the number of Earths I conquer instead.

18
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,391
<i>Earth-2 is splitting in half.</i>

19
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:43,994
Tell me I did not just
see the end of the world.

20
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:46,663
- Dad? No. No!
- This is what's gonna make you

21
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:48,594
just like me.

22
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:50,366
Jay? No!

23
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:56,339
No!

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,010
Dad?

25
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:04,146
Dad? Hey! Hey! Hey, look
at me. Look at me. Dad.

26
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:07,783
Don't leave. Not again. Not again.
Dad! Come on. Come on. Come on.

27
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,584
It's all right. No.

28
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,752
Dad.

29
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,340
No, Dad.

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,741
I told you family was a weakness.

31
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,750
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?

32
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,689
And now...

33
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,731
the two of us are the same.

34
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,957
No! No!

35
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,392
There you go, Flash!

36
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:52,827
Use your anger,

37
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,730
just like I did.

38
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,106
I got you, Zolomon!

39
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:43,910
Go on, Barry. Embrace your anger. End me!

40
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,419
Let me do it for you.

41
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,792
So close, Barry.

42
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,695
Another time remnant.

43
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,231
You see, Barry, there could be two of you.

44
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,134
You just have to be
willing to kill yourself.

45
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,570
Yeah.

46
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,472
You're almost ready.

Synced and corrected by johnyd13
~ www.addic7ed.com ~

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,620
And comfort us today

49
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,283
with the word of your promise

50
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:34,291
as we return our brother to the earth,

51
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:36,260
and leave us with the hope

52
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:39,497
that, one day, we'll meet again.

53
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,562
Um...

54
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:58,248
my father's...

55
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,197
I can't do this right now.

56
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,360
It's okay, Barry.

57
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,430
Henry Allen.

58
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,931
Henry suffered two
great losses in his life.

59
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:22,671
He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

60
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:24,724
He suffered guilt,

61
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,651
embarrassment,

62
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:29,172
ridicule, shame, and everything that comes

63
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:32,717
with being blamed for a
crime he didn't commit.

64
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:37,611
Henry Allen was proof that love can get you

65
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,556
through the darkest of days,

66
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:43,194
and that love will keep him
alive in all of our hearts.

67
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,044
I'm gonna find him, Dad.

68
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,416
I promise you I'm gonna take
from him what he took from you.

69
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,452
Hey.

70
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:33,873
Hey.

71
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,078
I thought maybe you should eat something.

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,914
- I'm not hungry. Thank you, though.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,673
Barry, um...

74
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,596
I had no idea that you were The Flash.

75
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,492
What you did for me,

76
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:54,163
all the things that you've done
for everyone, this whole city...

77
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:57,532
And now this with your dad and Zoom.

78
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,236
I'm so sorry.

79
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,938
Thanks, Wally.

80
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:07,487
If there's anything you
need, you just say the word.

81
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,426
All right.

82
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:12,680
Guys,

83
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,039
Zoom's still out there.

84
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,047
We need to come up with a plan.

85
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,497
The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

86
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:23,334
I mean, if he can do that, what else
can he do that we don't know about?

87
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:25,960
Right after he killed his time remnant,

88
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:29,330
- he told me I was "almost ready."
- Almost ready for what?

89
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:32,132
- I don't know.
- Yep. Classic psychopath.

90
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:34,775
Why can't they ever just
say what they want to do?

91
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,942
We also have to figure out
why I keep vibing Earth-2

92
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,373
- being ripped to shreds.
- Seriously.

93
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:42,242
It's like I'm watching
"Transformers" in 4-D,

94
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:45,378
but, like, ten times more realistic

95
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,462
and with much better acting.

96
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:50,150
Look, if you can vibe the future,

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,719
we need to stop Zoom before that happens.

98
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,921
I'm gonna get some air, all right?

99
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,509
I got it.

100
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,761
When I was in the Speed Force,

101
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,421
I felt like

102
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,975
I'd finally come to grips with her death,

103
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,737
with not saving her when I went back.

104
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:35,026
And then the moment...

105
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:39,205
where I'm finally at
the place I can move on,

106
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,567
my father's taken from me.

107
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,661
How am I ever supposed
to find peace with that?

108
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:51,901
I don't know, Barry, but you're
gonna have to find a way to do that,

109
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,012
or it's gonna tear you apart.

110
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,851
I just miss him so much already.

111
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,695
Zoom.

112
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,630
Barry, no!

113
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:16,901
Bad time, Flash?

114
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,396
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.

115
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,637
- This ends now.
- Not yet.

116
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,876
There's always more to take, Barry.

117
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:28,711
You're gonna stay away from them.

118
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,280
Well, that's completely up to you.

119
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:32,482
- What?
- When we first met,

120
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,011
I told you that Zoom needed to be the best.

121
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:38,917
You just didn't realize I
was talking about myself.

122
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,068
Is that what this is about?

123
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:43,399
A race, Barry,

124
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,159
between you and me...

125
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,299
to see who's the fastest.

126
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,843
You win: this is over,
and you get to be the hero.

127
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,478
I'm not racing you.

128
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:56,133
Then your father won't be the only
person you love that I'll take from you.

129
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,069
Think about it, Flash.

130
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,340
All I want to know is
who's the fastest man alive

131
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,990
on either world.

132
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:06,337
I'll be waiting.

133
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,194
So Zoom wants to race you?

134
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:18,081
- He's obsessed with being the best.
- Why would we trust him?

135
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,844
He just wants to race.

136
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,784
You know, it actually makes sense

137
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,292
in a completely-off-your-rocker
sort of way.

138
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,234
That can't be everything he wants.

139
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,804
It isn't. This Magnetar

140
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:31,540
that's being developed by Mercury Labs...

141
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,702
Turns out, it can act as a pulsar.

142
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:36,502
- Whoa.
- What is a pulsar?

143
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:41,449
<i>It's a power amplifier with a highly
magnetized, dense rotating core</i>

144
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:43,918
<i>that can be easily weaponized.</i>

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,702
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

146
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,157
That's what happens to Earth-2.

147
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,525
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

148
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,928
That thing is powerful
enough to destroy a planet?

149
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,797
A lot more than just a planet,
if it has the right power source.

150
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,098
Like what?

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,326
Like me.

152
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,637
That's why he wants to race.

153
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:04,738
He wants to siphon the
energy I create when I run.

154
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,674
He wants to siphon the
energy off both of you.

155
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,141
When Jay captured me,

156
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:10,077
he said that he used to measure his success

157
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,279
by counting the number of victims he had,

158
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,019
but now he was gonna measure it

159
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,950
by counting the number of
Earths he conquered instead.

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,486
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2;

161
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,955
he wants to take out every
other planet in the multiverse.

162
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:24,683
- How many are there?
- Infinite.

163
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:26,493
Yeah, well, he can do that?

164
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,029
If he can create a breach
to Earth-2 all on his own...

165
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:32,845
- He can get to all of 'em.
- One pulse to destroy them all.

166
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,167
I guess I don't have a choice.

167
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,037
I have to race him.

168
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,737
And I have to win.

169
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,898
Bare.

170
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,749
Don't race him.

171
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:55,354
- It's not that easy.
- Yes, it is. You just say no.

172
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:58,157
We find another way to stop
him, together, like we always do.

173
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,059
And do what, Joe?

174
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:03,209
Just sit around and wait for
him to kill somebody else?

175
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,914
Wally? Iris? You?

176
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:08,607
- No. No way.
- He needs you, Bare.

177
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:13,124
He needs your speed again to get what
he wants. We have the advantage here.

178
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,502
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.

179
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,110
That saves the multiverse, this whole city,

180
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,648
all of you.

181
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,750
I won't let another person I
love die when I can prevent it.

182
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,063
This...

183
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:30,922
isn't just about racing Zoom, is it?

184
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,526
You want to kill this guy.

185
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,794
Of course I want to kill him, Joe.

186
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,911
I want to do a hell of a
lot more than just kill him.

187
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:41,699
I want him to suffer for
everything that he's done.

188
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,201
- And he's going to.
- Come on, Bare.

189
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,771
Think about what you're saying.

190
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,340
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

191
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,509
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

192
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,988
And I can't talk you out of it?

193
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,109
- Not this time.
- Then I'm sorry too.

194
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,836
Wha...

195
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,096
What are you doing?

196
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,727
Why did you put me in here?

197
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,619
Because you're too angry right now.

198
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,654
You can't race him like that.

199
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:41,338
Without a plan, you're... You'll lose.

200
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:44,299
Keeping me in here is
gonna get everyone killed.

201
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,894
I'm the only one that can
stop him; you know that.

202
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:50,589
You race Zoom on his terms,

203
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,336
- you'll lose.
- This is not your decision to make!

204
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:57,006
- It is this time.
- No.

205
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,962
We all made it together.

206
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,566
What?

207
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,380
- All of you?
- Bro, I went back and forth.

208
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:07,697
I was, like, a good 60/40 at first.

209
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:09,184
Ramon.

210
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,853
Yeah, yeah, we all made the decision.

211
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:13,655
Come on.

212
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,030
Allen.

213
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,158
Allen.

214
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,993
This is for your own good.

215
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:22,764
Don't do this. Guys, come on. Iris?

216
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,633
Cisco, come on, man. You have to let me...

217
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:29,043
You have to let me stop
him! You have to let me...

218
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:34,693
Did we make the right call here?

219
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,518
Yeah, we did.

220
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,871
You okay, Joe?

221
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:49,306
Yeah, that was just a little
harder than I anticipated.

222
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:51,308
Yeah, locking up Barry...

223
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,079
That was the easy part. Now, using our plan

224
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,489
to take down Zoom without Barry,

225
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,541
that's gonna be the hard part,
but it's gonna be a lot easier

226
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,219
once we know where he is, Ramon.

227
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,254
Chill, man. I'm working on it.

228
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,667
- Work harder.
- Got it.

229
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,359
He's at the industrial park on Leawood.

230
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,999
- Give me that. Mm.
- Yep.

231
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,736
That is some serious nerd love right there.

232
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,029
Snow.

233
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:17,483
Look, everybody here would understand

234
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,336
if you don't want to go through with this.

235
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,573
Jay may be a monster, but there's
a human inside of him somewhere

236
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,408
I've gotten to that part of him before.

237
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,710
I know I can do it again.

238
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,545
I want to stop him, Harry,

239
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,067
for good.

240
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:32,792
Ramon.

241
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,414
So let's go over the plan again.

242
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,111
Okay, Caitlin will distract Jay

243
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,114
so that you and Harry
can hit him with the boot.

244
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:41,547
Cisco's gonna open the breach,

245
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,250
and we're gonna put him through it.

246
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,328
- I'll disarm the Magnetar.
- Destroy the Magnetar...

247
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,063
Save the multiverse.

248
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,931
One more thing. We need to agree.

249
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,766
We all made this decision together,

250
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:56,037
so if anything goes
wrong, we stick with it.

251
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,839
Let's load up.

252
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,653
Hey.

253
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:15,056
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

254
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:18,425
You know, I've just been thinking.
You know, what's... what's next?

255
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,912
What's next? We stop Zoom.

256
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:24,365
Right. Right, I guess...

257
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,199
I don't know, I mean... After that.

258
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,897
I don't know. Haven't
really given it much thought.

259
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,891
Yeah, no... No, I know you haven't.

260
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:33,676
Guess I've just... I've been
thinking about it a lot lately.

261
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,516
You know, I see the way you
are with everyone here...

262
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,354
Caitlin and Cisco,

263
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,201
Iris and Joe,

264
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,048
Barry,

265
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:43,950
especially Barry.

266
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,621
You care about these people a lot.

267
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:49,322
You know, but... But my friends?

268
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,050
They're all back home on our Earth.

269
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:56,606
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
you know, when this is all over,

270
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,232
I'm gonna go back home to live my life.

271
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,789
But if you need to stay here so
that you can live yours again,

272
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,263
I get that.

273
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,787
I understand. It's
okay, because... No, Dad.

274
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,755
Seeing you happy,

275
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,346
that is all I've ever wanted for you.

276
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,830
<i>Okay. In position.</i>

277
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,698
Copy that. We got you.

278
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,635
<i>Okay. Snow, you ready?</i>

279
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,102
As ready as I can be.

280
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,317
Cisco.

281
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,110
Cisco, you good?

282
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,636
Define "good."

283
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:50,815
Ramon. You're gonna be great.

284
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:52,250
Snow.

285
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,747
<i>When you're ready.</i>

286
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,178
Okay.

287
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,568
You got this.

288
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:00,624
Here we go.

289
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,403
<i>Jay?</i>

290
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,466
Caitlin.

291
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:11,843
Jay!

292
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:19,959
How did you find me?

293
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:23,149
Doctor McGee said the Magnetar
was stolen from her labs.

294
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,816
I knew that it had to be
you, so I tracked you here.

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,669
I tracked you here, Jay. No one else knows.

296
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,992
I told you, if you left me...

297
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:39,362
That if I betrayed you, you'd
show me no mercy, I know.

298
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:43,822
But I just want to explain
why I did that. Please, Jay.

299
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:45,768
Talk.

300
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,136
Good job, girl.

301
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,338
<i>Now draw him towards you.</i>

302
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,374
I made a mistake.

303
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:55,011
I am so sorry that I abandoned you.

304
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,280
But you have to understand,
what you said to me...

305
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:01,017
That there was a dark side of me...

306
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,387
<i>That I was more like
Killer Frost than I knew...</i>

307
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,788
I didn't want to accept that.

308
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,425
I tried to lock the darkness inside of me.

309
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,130
But you knew that that was
already a part of me now.

310
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,900
And you're the only one who did.

311
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:23,371
And now, I'm ready to
accept who I really am.

312
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,640
Cisco, get ready.

313
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,944
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

314
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:34,582
But now I want to be the
one that only you know.

315
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,351
Please, Jay.

316
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,952
Let me try.

317
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:46,694
One more step.

318
00:18:46,696 --> 00:18:50,397
I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

319
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:56,671
But it's too late.

320
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,084
Now, Ramon!

321
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:07,881
Damn it.

322
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,150
Tranq him! Tranq him!

323
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:12,643
- Gun is jammed!
- He's walking in.

324
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:28,101
Dad!

325
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,159
- Did you see my dad?
- No, the vibe keeps changing.

326
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:51,860
It's like my brain is
channel surfing or something.

327
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,639
They must be on the move. That's
why the vibe's in flux. Keep trying.

328
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:57,929
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

329
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,331
No, there's no messing with that thing.

330
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,899
Whatever he did to it...
We try and touch it,

331
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,935
we try and move it...
This planet's done for.

332
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,104
Iris.

333
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,309
What's wrong?

334
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,114
Zoom took Dad.

335
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,882
What? How?

336
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,070
We tried to stop Zoom by pushing
him through the breach, but...

337
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,154
he took Joe with him.

338
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,956
Well, where's Barry? Did he go after him?

339
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:29,194
He's not with us. He's
in a cell in the intake.

340
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:32,441
Wait, you... you tried to stop Zoom alone?

341
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:34,765
Long story.

342
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,005
Well, we have to get him back.

343
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,075
Wally, before Zoom took Dad, we all agreed

344
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,978
that if we got him off this Earth,
we would close the breaches for good,

345
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,482
and we would never open them again,

346
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,080
under any circumstances.

347
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,700
Why... why would you do that?

348
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:02,625
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

349
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,060
He made us all agree to it.

350
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,695
Well, guess what. I didn't agree to that.

351
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,034
- Wally...
- Iris, I already lost my mom.

352
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,835
If Dad...

353
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,122
I...

354
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,687
I will say,

355
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,891
if anything, Barry sure has an
ample number of fathers to kill.

356
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,093
If you're gonna kill me,

357
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,455
kill me.

358
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,563
It doesn't matter.

359
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,098
You're not racing anybody.

360
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,668
Come on, Joe. You know Barry
better than that. You raised him.

361
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,871
He'll say yes if he thinks he can save you.

362
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,305
Not this time.

363
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,040
I made sure of it.

364
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:56,711
Who is that?

365
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,413
It would just confuse you.

366
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,881
Try me.

367
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,420
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

368
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,622
<i>When I got struck by the
dark matter and electricity,</i>

369
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:10,525
<i>I became Zoom, the
fastest man alive.</i>

370
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,428
<i>Wasn't long before I had
this Earth on its knees.</i>

371
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,116
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

372
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,197
I wanted more.

373
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,366
I wanted to be faster.

374
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,569
<i>So I created a speed drug.</i>

375
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:22,967
Velocity-9.

376
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:25,439
It made me faster than
I ever thought possible,

377
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:27,274
<i>fast enough to break
the dimensional barrier,</i>

378
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:30,411
<i>fast enough to run to other
universes, other Earths.</i>

379
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:34,048
And then, one day, on
one of those other Earths,

380
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,582
I discovered him.

381
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,284
He's another speedster?

382
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,353
Yeah, you could say that.

383
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:42,556
That was right about the time
I discovered something else too.

384
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,023
<i>All that V-9 I'd been injecting</i>

385
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,678
<i>into my system had a
little side effect.</i>

386
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:49,128
It was killing you.

387
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,064
I searched for a cure.

388
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,799
I tried everything.

389
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:54,778
I even tried to manipulate the Speed Force,

390
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,903
but let me tell you, the Speed Force,

391
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:59,089
the Speed Force does not
like its rules being broken.

392
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,122
<i>Now it's been sending its
enforcers after me ever since.</i>

393
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,892
So you brought him here to steal his speed.

394
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:09,282
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

395
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:11,351
<i>But then the skies parted,</i>

396
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:12,718
<i>and I saw Barry,</i>

397
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,887
<i>and then I stole his speed.</i>

398
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:18,639
I won. I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

399
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,132
Why keep him here?

400
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,979
Trophy.

401
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:27,265
And a little idea I had for fun.

402
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:31,536
You see, I got so tired
of being the villain,

403
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:34,672
<i>so I decided to be the hero too.</i>

404
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:37,709
I even borrowed his name,

405
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:40,527
Jay Garrick.

406
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:46,289
You know what's gonna be great, Detective?

407
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,810
After I beat Barry in the race

408
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,232
and prove that I'm the
fastest man alive on any Earth,

409
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:54,011
he's gonna rot in a cage just
like the one Jay's in now.

410
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:57,648
And then I'll have a Flash from two worlds

411
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,583
to keep me company.

412
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,096
Look.

413
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:16,699
Everyone's gonna freak when they
find out I did this, but I don't care.

414
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,829
We need your help, Barry.

415
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,108
Uh, hey, guys,

416
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,843
Barry's not...

417
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:29,107
In his cell anymore.

418
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,413
- Wally!
- What? I wasn't just gonna

419
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:33,082
- stand here and let this happen.
- You let him take Joe?

420
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,586
What the hell were you thinking?

421
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:36,453
Allen, there was nothing we could do.

422
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:39,922
- You could've let me race him!
- Allen! You're not racing Zoom!

423
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:41,919
What are you gonna do? Are
you gonna tranq me again?

424
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,392
Don't tempt me.

425
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,813
Look, I know you guys made a
pact to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

426
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:47,888
but you did that without me and Wally.

427
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,490
All right? You don't get to do that!

428
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,700
Barry, look at yourself
right now; you're not okay.

429
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:53,569
Cisco, my dad was just
killed in front of me!

430
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,070
Do you have any idea how that feels?

431
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:56,605
Watching someone you love die?

432
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:59,074
- Yes, I do.
- Cait...

433
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:02,897
Look, Barry. I know how cold and angry

434
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:04,927
and distant that can make you.

435
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:08,425
But when this happened to me, you
were the one who kept me in check.

436
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:10,018
You told me to stop and take a breath,

437
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,220
and that's all we're telling you to do now.

438
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:15,523
- I'm telling you I'm good.
- Really? You're good?

439
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:17,625
Because it seems to me you
want to do more than stop Zoom.

440
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:19,494
It seems to me you want revenge.

441
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:23,264
If that's why you're doing
this, Allen, you will lose.

442
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:26,664
Look, you guys.

443
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:29,370
I... you may not think I can do this.

444
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:33,941
You may think I'm too angry.
But we're running out of time!

445
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,309
I have to beat him,

446
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:36,711
and I'm going to,

447
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,946
whether I have your help or not.

448
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:40,882
So which one is it?

449
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:45,408
- So how does this work?
- It's the same way we took Iris

450
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,088
into the Speed Force. Harry
does his best Frankenstein,

451
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,790
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

452
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,259
All right, let's do it.

453
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:03,561
I'll do it.

454
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,105
Say when and where. I'll be there.

455
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,242
Cisco's learned how to
bring people into his vibes.

456
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:11,144
There's one condition.

457
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:15,081
You bring Joe back. But
if he's harmed in any way,

458
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,329
- it's off.
- I'll bring him,

459
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,985
and I won't release
him until after we race.

460
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,449
Deal?

461
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:23,876
Deal.

462
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,835
I tell you, Jay might be crazy-pants,

463
00:26:36,837 --> 00:26:38,970
but he can pick a venue.

464
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:46,577
Brought the whole crew with you, huh?

465
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,113
Can't say I blame you.

466
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:49,614
- Dad.
- Wally!

467
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,582
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

468
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,318
Let him go.

469
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
After we race.

470
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,107
Cut the crap. We know you
plan to power up the Magnetar

471
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,458
so you can destroy the multiverse.

472
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,394
Bravo. You figured it out...

473
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:04,995
almost.

474
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:06,764
I don't want to destroy all of it.

475
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:09,199
This Earth is at the
center of the multiverse.

476
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:12,804
It's the access point to
every other Earth in existence.

477
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:16,774
One trans-dimensional
shockwave, and... poof.

478
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:18,508
Leaving just our Earth.

479
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,677
How generous of you.

480
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,380
Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

481
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:26,917
You might want to say your good-byes.

482
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:36,760
Don't worry.

483
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:38,521
I'm gonna save your dad.

484
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,098
No. You're gonna save our dad.

485
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,896
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It's safer.

486
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:45,669
We're not going anywhere.

487
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:47,370
We got eyes and ears right here.

488
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:50,239
Either he goes, or we all die together.

489
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:54,944
We believe in you.

490
00:27:57,915 --> 00:27:59,099
Wait.

491
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:01,901
Barry,

492
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:04,053
kick his ass.

493
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,060
What are the rules?

494
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:13,829
One lap around the inside of this loop

495
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,098
will produce about 1 gigawatt of energy,

496
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,934
and I need 500-plus to power the Magnetar

497
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,569
enough to do the job.

498
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:22,304
Once it's full, I win,

499
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:24,739
because there is no stopping it.

500
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,274
So all I have to do to beat you

501
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,843
is stop you before that happens.

502
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,179
Yep. It's that simple.

503
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:34,883
But if, at any point, you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

504
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,185
dear old dad number two is a dead man,

505
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:40,187
as well as your little fan club.

506
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:42,323
They're not my fan club.

507
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:45,192
They're the reason that I'm running,

508
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:48,217
why I'm gonna beat you.

509
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:52,500
Let's see what you're made of, Flash.

510
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,671
Just say when, Zoom.

511
00:28:57,673 --> 00:29:00,741
Run, Barry. Run!

512
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:24,031
He's powering up the Magnetar.

513
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,872
Come on, Barry. Catch up.

514
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:45,651
Which one's Barry?

515
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,352
Both of them.

516
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,354
- He made a...
- Time remnant.

517
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,228
Go, all right? Go!

518
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,197
I'll explain later, Joe.

519
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:03,635
A remnant?

520
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,972
Stole my trick, Flash.

521
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,642
But you're too late.

522
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:16,315
Bye-bye, multiverse.

523
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:17,583
No!

524
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,393
What's the time remnant doing?

525
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,162
He's creating his own pulse.

526
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,999
- Why would he do that?
- Because...

527
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,033
if that's out of phase,

528
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,835
it'll counteract that one.

529
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,037
Wait, his body can't handle that.

530
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,540
Then what's gonna happen?

531
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,542
He'll die.

532
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,116
NO!

533
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,798
Ahh!

534
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,039
Ahh!

535
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,414
You're a hero, Barry.

536
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:24,155
You couldn't kill me before.

537
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,516
You won't kill me now.

538
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,024
I don't have to.

539
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,627
Ahh!

540
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:07,008
Okay, so you ran back in time

541
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,747
and made a copy of yourself?

542
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:12,897
Well, uh, basically.

543
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,092
- Yeah.
- It's called a time remnant.

544
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,904
It's not something that I can do every day,

545
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:22,607
but I needed a way to draw the Time Wraiths

546
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,309
out of the Speed Force,
hoping they'd be more upset

547
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,278
at what Zoom had done
than they'd be with me.

548
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,381
Is that what I look like when
they start talking about science?

549
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,731
Pretty much.

550
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,385
Don't worry, Wally. It'll
get easier to understand.

551
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,420
Well, how does that even work?

552
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,022
Same way Zoom did it.

553
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,758
I ran back in time moments before I left.

554
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,995
It's the only way I can
be in two places at once.

555
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:47,798
Okay, so the time remnant, it's still you?

556
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,072
Yeah.

557
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:51,735
- But he died.
- Uh...

558
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:55,772
He was willing to sacrifice
himself for all of us.

559
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:58,074
That's how much he loved us.

560
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,911
You know what? We'll just...
We'll forget about it.

561
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:03,043
Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

562
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,982
You know what? In battle,
choose your weapon wisely.

563
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,152
All right? Some people choose a gun.
I choose a Phillips-head screwdriver.

564
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,853
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. You're so particular.

565
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,088
Ramon, can you just please...

566
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,256
Have you ever worked with a tool before?

567
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,258
- I'm working with one now.
- Are you ready?

568
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,694
One,

569
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,300
two, and...

570
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,899
Ugh.

571
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,901
I don't know what's more annoying,

572
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,435
being in that thing

573
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,469
or listening to you two arguing about it.

574
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:42,989
Um...

575
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,654
you're...

576
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,489
I'm Jay Garrick,

577
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:50,325
the real Jay Garrick.

578
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,698
What?

579
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,585
I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry.

580
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,412
Bare.

581
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:12,980
He looks just like him.

582
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:14,515
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

583
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:16,650
I can't believe this. My dad told me.

584
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:20,121
He told me this. He said his
mom's maiden name was Garrick.

585
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:21,622
I just never thought that that meant...

586
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,257
- Barry, Barry.
- I never thought it meant...

587
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:25,025
Barry, he doesn't know that.

588
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,594
He doesn't know

589
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,762
that he's your dad's doppelganger, okay?

590
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:32,032
You want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

591
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,734
No. No.

592
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:36,103
- You sure?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,038
I just need a minute.

594
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,306
I'll be all right.

595
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:46,478
- That's smart.
- Because of...

596
00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:47,880
- Yeah, and there it is.
- Genius.

597
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:50,550
So the reason you didn't have your powers

598
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:53,019
is because there was
a dampener in the mask.

599
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,563
You see?

600
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:57,523
I don't want to see this thing ever again.

601
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:02,929
So your powers are back.

602
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:06,099
I see Jay... Excuse me... Hunter...

603
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,867
Stole your color scheme too.

604
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,736
He took a lot of things that were mine,

605
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:13,272
except for that. That's,
um... That's all him.

606
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:15,407
He said it was his father's from the war.

607
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,111
Ironically, on my... on our Earth...

608
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:21,046
This helmet stood for hope.

609
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:22,898
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

610
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,586
Well, maybe I can continue that sentiment,

611
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:30,455
take something from him, for a change,

612
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:32,719
make it my own.

613
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:38,630
It suits you.

614
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:40,999
Thank you, all of you,

615
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:43,486
for saving me from Zoom,

616
00:35:44,772 --> 00:35:46,981
especially you, Flash.

617
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,775
You're welcome, Flash.

618
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,048
Now all I have to do is find my way home.

619
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,851
- And where's that?
- I think you would call it Earth-3.

620
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:03,788
Uh-huh. Well, I can
get you to Earth-2.

621
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,443
My daughter and I can
help you with the rest.

622
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:07,846
We can?

623
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,961
Yes, we can.

624
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,963
We're going home.

625
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:19,503
Okay.

626
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,809
Snow.

627
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:28,031
You're a tremendous scientist, but...

628
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,816
- you're an even better person.
- Don't make me cry, Harry.

629
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,294
I've done enough of that already.

630
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:39,288
Detective Joe West...

631
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,656
Harry.

632
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:43,089
You have great kids. You take care of them.

633
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:46,596
Same to you. You take care
of that beautiful girl.

634
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,311
Yes, sir.

635
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:51,801
Hey.

636
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,564
I'm a better man than
I was when I got here,

637
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,207
- and that's 'cause of you.
- I'm not the same either.

638
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:06,886
Hey, don't be surprised if I
project myself over to Earth-2

639
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:10,515
every once in a while, you know, just
to throw your stuff across the office.

640
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,423
I'll miss you too, Cisco.

641
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:24,497
So I guess I can't text
you from another Earth, huh?

642
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,224
I guess not.

643
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:28,199
That's too bad.

644
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,701
Thank you guys, seriously,

645
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,069
for saving our home.

646
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:38,071
- Mm-hmm.
- Ready?

647
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:39,806
Yeah.

648
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,787
Can't stop thinking about
my dad's doppelganger.

649
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,135
Seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

650
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,179
that should've made it easier.

651
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:47,512
It doesn't.

652
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:50,349
It just made me miss him even more.

653
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:53,489
I can't even imagine how
hard that must have been.

654
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:55,780
We just won.

655
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,652
We just beat Zoom.

656
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:01,122
Why does it feel like I just lost?

657
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:06,126
Because you've lost a
lot in your life, Barry,

658
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,462
more than most.

659
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,365
But...

660
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,570
Maybe you and me

661
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,406
seeing where this thing goes,

662
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:23,209
maybe that can give you
something for a change.

663
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:29,449
That's all I've ever
wanted to hear you say.

664
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,152
And I wish that I was in a place

665
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:35,021
where I could try that with you.

666
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:38,824
But I feel so hollowed
out inside right now.

667
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:43,162
I feel more broken than
I've ever felt in my life.

668
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:45,965
If I'm ever gonna be worth anything to you,

669
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,101
I need to fix what's wrong with me.

670
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:53,172
I need to find some... Some peace.

671
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,528
Barry, listen to me.

672
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,247
You waited for me for years.

673
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:05,650
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

674
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,720
So I am telling you

675
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:11,823
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

676
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,992
Wherever you need to go,

677
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,360
whatever you need to do,

678
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:17,833
do it.

679
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,866
And when you get back, I'll be here.

680
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:24,736
Okay.

681
00:40:24,738 --> 00:40:27,205
I love you, Barry.

682
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:45,055
I love you too.

683
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:47,091
And I always will.

684
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,876
That's why I'm so sorry.

685
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,880
But I have to do this.

686
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,597
- Barry!
- Mom!

687
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:37,372
Barry!

688
00:41:37,374 --> 00:41:38,740
No!

689
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,175
No.

690
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:51,586
You're not gonna kill her this time.

691
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,988
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

692
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,017
No.

693
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,911
I'm not gonna hurt you.

694
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:23,114
I'm not gonna hurt you.

695
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,687
Okay? I'm not gonna hurt you.

696
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,988
You're safe.

697
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:35,294
You're safe now.
