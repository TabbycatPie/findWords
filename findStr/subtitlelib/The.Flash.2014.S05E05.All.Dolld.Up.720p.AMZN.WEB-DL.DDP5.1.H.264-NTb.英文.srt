17
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,810
My name is Barry Allen,

18
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,200
and I am the fastest man alive.

19
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,590
To the outside world I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

20
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,200
But secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs

21
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,220
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

22
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,390
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

23
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,030
she changed the present,

24
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,510
and now our world is more dangerous than ever,

25
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,110
and I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

26
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,410
I am The Flash.

27
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,220
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,020
What is that?

29
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,720
It's a game my dad and I used to play.

30
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,300
It's a letter from my dad.

31
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,730
He's still alive.

33
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,050
You put a power dampening chip inside me

34
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,330
to take away my speed.

35
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,740
Is that why you've been so cold to me?

36
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,180
Why you don't want to spend any time with me?

37
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,380
Mom thinks that she had good reason

38
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,440
to suppress my powers in the future.

39
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,200
I support her decisions.

41
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,530
Let's just call it, Barry.

42
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,430
She's not coming. Again.

43
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,390
She's probably just helping with Jenna

44
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,360
so Joe and Cecile can sleep in.

45
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,450
Every day for the past two weeks?

46
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,600
They look really tired.

47
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,430
They do.

49
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,140
Tripped alarm at Central City Art Gallery.

50
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,630
Someone stole a Monet.

51
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,870
At 10:00 a.m.? That's bold.

52
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,950
CCPD's en route, suspect heading west on Ruger.

54
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,510
The thief just turned on to Ramirez off of Fifth.

55
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,590
Almost there.

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
He's not carrying anything.

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,310
Because he handed it off to someone else.

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,330
- Nora? - Nora?

59
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,100
- Uh, where's he headed? - I got him.

60
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,660
I can stop someone on a motor cycle.

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,800
No, Nora, let Barry help, okay--

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,500
I know you did not just cut me off, miss thing.

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
Gotcha.

64
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,490
You okay?

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,860
This is why we train, Nora. Every single day.

68
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,000
Not when you feel like it, not because you're mad,

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,860
and why you always have someone in your ear

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,490
when you're in the field to help you.

71
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,750
- I know that. - Then why did you turn me off?

72
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,540
Because I can't listen to you anymore.

73
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,960
It's always the same condescending,

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,570
I-know-better-than-you crap.

75
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,910
I just want to be me

76
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,000
and you sit behind your desk

77
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,330
and you say "No" Every time

78
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,380
and I've been hearing it my whole life and I'm sick of it.

79
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,240
- Your whole life? - Yes, Mom.

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,990
Since I can remember, and you never change.

81
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,180
Iris.

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,320
You know, Nora,

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,040
I wish you would try to understand

84
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,730
who your mom is today,

85
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,690
and stop seeing her as who she becomes in the future.

86
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,940
- That's for you. - The hell is this?

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,930
Well, that's the hours to apply against my debt.

88
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,890
Fruitful hours spent getting closer to uncovering

89
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,260
the identity of your serial meta-killer, Cicada.

90
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,120
And how's that?

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,460
Well, I apply a complex formula--complex for you,

92
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,730
involving the terminal velocity and the weight

93
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,530
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite and the velocity of Barry

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,100
and Nora traveling when they--

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,190
destroy the satellite, right, allowing me to conclude that...

96
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,440
The debris from the satellite, the satellite shrapnel,

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,160
and the man who would become our Cicada

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,220
would be found within this perimeter.

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,850
And that took you how long?

100
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,990
Oof, Dr. Snow.

101
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,110
Eighteen hours 'cause I'm only semi-excellent at algebra.

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,350
You know this is calculus, right?

103
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,820
Guys, look, calculon, algebra,

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,140
either way it doesn't tell us where the shrapnel fell.

105
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,310
Mais non. You have to scan the entire city

106
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,700
to find the exact location.

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,860
Okay, so you need Sally the satellite to find Sally the satellite

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,590
and we need Thomas Snow to point us to Thomas Snow.

109
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,890
- You lost him. - At Thomas Snow.

110
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,170
We've hit a dead end with regards to my father.

111
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,760
I looked through all of his notes and papers.

112
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,730
There's no more hidden messages we could use.

113
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,040
A satellite to run DNA recognition patterns but...

114
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,750
I thought losing him when I was ten was hard, but,

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,810
the idea that he's out there

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,730
and I might not be able to get to him...

117
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,060
Maybe I can help you.

118
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,860
I thought your powers weren't working.

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,970
No, not fully, but this I can do.

120
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,060
You okay?

121
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,850
I saw him.

122
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,570
I saw your dad in-- in an office

123
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,920
sketching something in a notebook.

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,180
I couldn't quite make out what it was.

125
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,470
Did you see anything else?

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,650
Um, equations on a chalkboard.

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,510
We didn't have a chalkboard in our home office.

128
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,620
No, but tell us everything that you saw.

129
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,770
What's on the walls, what's on the desk, what he was wearing.

130
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,780
Leave nothing out.

131
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,270
He had an ID. It was, like, a yellow logo,

132
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,970
like a yellow state building.

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,420
Yellow logo, so, not a state building.

134
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,060
A university building.

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,050
Hudson University.

136
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,980
- Professor Stein. - And did you know him?

137
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,010
I knew he admired him,

138
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,980
but I didn't realize that they were friends.

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,450
Add that to the growing list of secrets.

140
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's go drive.

141
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,890
Thank you.

142
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,640
It's what I do.

143
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,740
Natalie, come here. I have a pre-wedding surprise for you.

144
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,530
Flawless asscher cut diamond set in Platinum.

145
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,840
Over 383 karats.

146
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,680
My great grandfather gave this to his wife

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,740
on their wedding day.

148
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,550
Tomorrow, it's yours.

149
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,350
Tomorrow? That's torture.

150
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,040
Stop!

151
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,020
Mazel Tov.

152
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,600
Can you describe the man that you saw?

153
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,630
I'd barely call him a man, the way he moved.

154
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,690
And when he looked back at me,

155
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,010
it was terrifying.

156
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,240
- Could you see his face? - No.

157
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,390
He was wearing some sort of clown mask.

158
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,960
And you're sure the necklace is the only thing that was stolen.

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Yes, and it's irreplaceable.

160
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,790
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

161
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,110
Hey. A nice surprise.

162
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,490
Yeah, well, a million dollar jewelry theft is still news

163
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,890
even in Central City, so.

164
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,250
So, you're off the metas, huh?

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,670
Yeah, no, not today.

166
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,790
You know, I think I'm just gonna follow up on this

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,750
while it's still fresh.

168
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,740
- I'll see you tonight, okay? - Okay, wait. Hang on.

169
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,790
I mean, we're working on the same case.

170
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,070
Why don't we pool resources, maybe solve this one together.

171
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, I don't know, Barry, it's just...

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,880
Come on, grab some Big Belly on the way to S.T.A.R. Labs.

173
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,230
It'll be like a date.

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,720
- All right. - All right. Come on.

175
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,240
This is the life.

176
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,220
Seriously, I could stay here forever.

177
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,890
No worries, no schrap from mom--

178
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,470
Wait, wait, wait, what was that?

179
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,530
- Schrap. - Schrap?

180
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,430
Schrap. You know, like all the nagging that mom does.

181
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,110
I mean, she acts like she supports me,

182
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,350
but what she really wants is a boring, quiet daughter

183
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
who just wants to stay inside all day

184
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,430
instead of go out and do anything

185
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,850
that might be the least bit dangerous.

186
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,860
Nora, this is the West house.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
In it, every West is given respect,

188
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,800
most especially your mother.

189
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,230
I am sure she raised you as best she could.

190
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,740
She raised me to be afraid of the world.

191
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,230
But I'm a hero, you know, like dad.

192
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,400
And we have to keep moving

193
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,590
until everyone that needs us is safe.

194
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,880
Okay.

195
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm sorry, what is this for?

196
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,070
When Papa Joe comes back,

197
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,850
this table is going to finally be built.

198
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,460
You wanted to keep moving.

199
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,670
- Oh, do I have to? - Yes.

200
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,260
All right, I'll make you a deal.

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,920
For every chore you do

202
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,100
I'll tell you one thing Papa Joe told me about your father

203
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,360
that didn't make it into the precious Flash museum.

204
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, Mama Cecile, the museum has

205
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,480
a complete record of all of Dad's accomplishments.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,430
Including the time Barry ended up in an alternate past

207
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,750
filled with golden giants called "Grodans"?

208
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,370
Wait, what?

209
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,670
Grodans.

210
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,660
Done. So then what happened?

211
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,220
Not done. Wait for it.

212
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,120
So, why exactly does Caitlin have a key

213
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,870
to Professor Stein's old office?

214
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,640
Clarissa gave me a key. She didn't realize that Martin

215
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,580
and my father knew each other either.

216
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,410
I wonder what he was doing in here.

217
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,160
Well, perhaps Mr. Ramon could vibe the chalkboard

218
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,390
and we could see for ourselves.

219
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,670
What do you think?

220
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,650
What did you see?

221
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,790
Hydrogen chains bonded over and over.

222
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Two oxygen at absolute zero.

223
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,930
It's like it's making heavy water.

224
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,100
Not heavy water.

225
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,000
Ice.

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,820
Another one of my father's hidden messages?

227
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,530
"Khione"?

228
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,420
What kind of a message is "Khione"?

229
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,660
A clear one.

230
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,560
At least to me. Look, monsieur Ramon,

231
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,180
you said that earlier that you could see that Dr. Snow,

232
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,040
her father sketching something, right?

233
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,660
That sketch that you could almost make out...

234
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,820
Did it look a little something like this?

235
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,470
Good lord, are you a speedster?

236
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,890
Speed sketcher. It's a modest talent.

237
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,020
My father was drawing me?

238
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,120
Not you. Khione.

239
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,520
Khione, the Greek goddess.

240
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,040
Child of the North Wind, whose realm was ice and snow.

241
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,560
Khione.

242
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,830
Killer Frost.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,780
That means that whatever Thomas was doing,

244
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,630
he knew that there were two of you.

245
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,040
Also, it stands to reason that Thomas was there

246
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,400
at the point of creation of Killer Frost.

247
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,550
So, he knew the truth about Killer Frost?

248
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,340
- He knew who I really am? - Right.

249
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,200
- Did I scare him away? - No, this wasn't your fault.

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,890
Look, I don't know why he left, but it wasn't because of you,

251
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,310
and we're gonna prove that.

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,190
You okay?

253
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
Yeah, just lost my footing there for a second.

254
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,150
- What- - What did you see?

255
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,970
You guys ever hear of Viera Chemicals?

256
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,190
Oh, it's an old chem lab out in the Barrens,

257
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,460
but it's been shut down for years.

258
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,590
Well, what are we waiting for?

259
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,140
You know, it's been great seeing you out there again,

260
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,430
doing what you love.

261
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,780
Yeah, I guess some girls grow up wanting to be Supergirl.

262
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,050
I always wanted to be

263
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,050
Soledad O'Brien or Christiana Amanpour.

264
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,830
So yeah, it's really great to reconnect.

266
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,460
That's weird. It says the hair I found

267
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,930
is human but it can't pull any DNA.

268
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,130
Maybe run it again?

269
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,750
Come on, Novick.

270
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,640
You wanna improve Gotham City's skyline,

271
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,880
you do it with a building

272
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,290
nobody can take their eyes off of.

273
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,930
That's one of mine.

274
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,410
You go with me, I'll design you a building

275
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,840
that makes the Burj Khalifa look like a strip mall.

276
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,460
Architecture means everything to me.

277
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,770
I mean, you tell me.

278
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,630
How many other architects have won

279
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,940
the Pritzker Prize three times?

280
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,220
Good choice.

281
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,970
Where did you get this?

282
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,510
By some really weird markings

283
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,200
at the bottom of a large gift box

284
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,360
that I'm pretty sure was opened from the inside.

285
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,290
Okay, you know you're opening all of our mail

286
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,640
from now on, right?

288
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,530
Somebody called in a bomb threat at Seaver Architects.

289
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,190
- What happened? - That thing, it did this.

290
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,080
Flash.

291
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,430
That thing destroyed my life's work.

292
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,070
So, he squeezed his way through an air conditioning vent?

293
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,150
Yeah, he could stretch kinda like Ralph,

294
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,420
except he was wearing a--

295
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,530
- Clown mask. - Yup.

296
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,710
Just like the guy that stole the Winehouse necklace.

297
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,790
Mm-hmm. We got a stretching clown meta.

298
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,830
Yeah, that's not creepy at all.

299
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah.

300
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,890
Did you find any more of those weird lines?

301
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,710
No, and if there's more, they're buried underneath

302
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,580
tons of rubble, just like our meta,

303
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,700
unless he was able to stretch out of that one too.

304
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,590
Which...I'm sure he was.

305
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,760
- The lines. - What?

306
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,320
Well, I mean, our meta can stretch and contort, right?

307
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,240
What if his fingerprints can too?

310
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,880
Got him. Peter Merkel.

311
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,970
And he was arrested for B&E two years ago.

312
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,460
Wait, Peter Merkel,

313
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,070
the son of Billionaire Theresa Merkel?

315
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,390
Yup.

316
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,410
How does someone go from being a member of high society

317
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,870
to stealing heirlooms and blowing up buildings?

318
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,940
Maybe we should attend this gala she's hosting

319
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,040
and ask her ourselves.

320
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,380
Uh, I don't know, what if Merkel's there?

321
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,610
So what? We'll come prepared.

322
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,740
Some meta handcuffs for me,

323
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,570
a taser for you, and we get to dress up.

324
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,450
- Barry. - What?

325
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,910
This is a meta investigation; this is not date night.

326
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,390
I'm just saying, I look really good in a tux.

327
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,160
When did this happen?

328
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,510
The night your father disappeared.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Well, well, well. Liquid nitrogen.

330
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,180
That's a potent accelerant, is it not?

331
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,660
Oh, this place it would have gone up. Whoa.

332
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,580
So, all my father's work is completely gone?

333
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,500
Well, not necessarily.

334
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,520
I mean, think about it.

335
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,250
Police listed this fire as accidental,

336
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,550
but they didn't know about the connection to Caitlin's father, so...

337
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,310
Ralph, my father told me to come find him.

338
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,950
Yeah, no, I know that, but a guy who disappears

339
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,680
on the night of a warehouse fire and who's hard to find?

340
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,940
Well, if you think this was arson, let me tell you,

341
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,050
if her father did this, well, he would need a lot of help

342
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,730
covering his tracks, right?

343
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,660
Yeah. Maybe he got it.

345
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,390
Listen, my mom may not be the best person,

346
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,180
but there's no way she'd be party to something like this.

347
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,390
There's one way to find out.

348
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,620
What, you want to question the mother again?

349
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,700
You already did that, and what did you get?

350
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,420
Nothing.

351
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,040
Well it's a clue. Surely, we should follow it.

352
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,140
You already know that this is still

353
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,100
Tannhauser facility, okay? So you're wrong.

354
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,330
Oh, I'm wrong? I'm wrong?

355
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,730
I'm the one who figured out Cicada's mask.

356
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,530
You couldn't figure that out.

357
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,310
You said you wouldn't doubt me, that was your mistake.

358
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,750
Enough, yeah, enough! Just give me this.

359
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,870
Cisco? Cisco?

360
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,500
- You look amazing, by the way. - Thank you.

361
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,220
There's Theresa Merkel. Come on.

362
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,380
Wait. What are we going to say?

363
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,990
We can't just ask her if her son was recently hit

364
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,720
by dark matter into shrapnel.

365
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
- You'll think of something. - Me?

366
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,890
So sorry.

367
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,440
Hi, Mrs. Merkel.

368
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm Iris West Allen.

369
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,900
Oh, I know who you are.

370
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't you usually write about lunatics

371
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
and the heroes who catch them?

372
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,380
Well, you know, supporting the arts is a citywide concern.

373
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,530
- Hmm. - I'm Barry Allen.

374
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,310
And you're obviously not here to make a sizeable

375
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,970
donation which means you, my dear,

376
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,720
are here on assignment.

377
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,500
All right, ask whatever you like. You have two minutes.

378
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,070
Well, it's about your son, Peter.

379
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,570
When was the last time that you saw him?

380
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,410
That would be two years ago

381
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,910
when he broke into his own house.

382
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,690
I was out of town, and my staff had him arrested.

383
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,410
Do you know where Peter is now?

384
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,700
No, and I don't care.

385
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,050
See, I gave him the world.

386
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,540
The finest private schools, his own wing to play in.

387
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,700
But he just never appreciated it.

388
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,710
Enjoy the party.

389
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,850
I feel kinda bad for him now.

390
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
She's so cold.

391
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,770
Can you imagine what that was like?

392
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,260
Hey, you know what? It's not a date without a dance.

393
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,000
Barry, wait. I mean, this is work, right?

394
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,370
We just hit a dead end, so, why don't we just go home?

395
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,910
Just one dance, all right?

396
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,590
Okay.

397
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,560
You know, we never really had our first dance.

398
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,940
Yeah, this is really nice.

399
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,410
Excuse me for a second.

400
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,010
Hey. You okay?

401
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,140
She gave her only son everything that she had

402
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,810
and it wasn't enough.

403
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,140
Just like I'm not enough for Nora.

404
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,110
You are nothing like that woman in there.

405
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,970
You're sure, Barry?

406
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,180
I mean, I love our daughter with all my heart,

407
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,350
but she hates me.

408
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,880
Because I turn my back on her

409
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,180
just like Theresa Merkel did to her son.

410
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,810
I lie to her about everything that she is.

411
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,290
And I prevent her from living the life that she deserves.

412
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,300
- I'd hate me too. - Iris.

413
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,450
You are never going to be the person

414
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,120
that Nora knows from the future.

415
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,680
That's the thing. It's not even up to us.

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,420
I've already become her

417
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,210
and I didn't even have a choice.

418
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,990
While you were unconscious, I scanned your wounds.

419
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,130
There are still trace amounts of aluminum-beryllium alloy

420
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,460
fused within your hands.

421
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,280
It's remnants from Cicada's dagger.

422
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,430
See, this is-- this is what I need. I just need rest.

423
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,960
No, Cisco, rest is not going to fix this, okay?

424
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,690
Every time you vibe or breach,

425
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,840
the dark matter is going to affect your central nervous system,

426
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,670
causing you more and more pain.

427
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,610
Wait-- which you must have been experiencing all day today.

428
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,300
Why didn't you say anything?

429
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,900
Because you're my friend and you needed my help.

430
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,310
Okay, but I would never ask you to hurt yourself.

431
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,770
Every time you vibe

432
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,730
you are going to have more and more seizures.

433
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,350
Then what am I supposed to do?

434
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,180
I remember when these powers were a curse.

435
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,770
Seeing Thawne kill me over and over.

436
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,290
Knowing that darkness.

437
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,430
I didn't want that.

438
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,880
I didn't want to be a hero.

439
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,360
These powers were a part of me. I had to learn that.

440
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,660
And when I did, they showed me everything.

441
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,180
I could vibe every clue.

442
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,000
I could breach us wherever we needed to go.

443
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,310
I could bring my value to the team.

444
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,150
If I can't take the pain, that means Cicada wins.

445
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,810
No. Hey.

446
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,860
Listen, I get it, okay?

447
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,050
When DeVoe took away Killer Frost, I was destroyed.

448
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,910
But you know what?

449
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,660
I'm still here.

450
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,050
And so are you.

451
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,280
Because you are Cisco Ramon.

452
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,340
Genius engineer,

453
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,000
prodigy hacker,

454
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,840
and the mechanic who built a cold gun that could stop a speedster.

455
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,860
And you're my friend.

456
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,290
You're my friend who went out there and hurt himself today.

457
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,910
Just to help me try and find my dad.

458
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,830
And that wasn't Vibe.

459
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,020
That was Cisco,

460
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,750
and that's the guy I need.

461
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,810
That cold gun was pretty amazing.

462
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,220
It was stolen almost immediately

463
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,580
Oh, immediately.

464
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,580
But yeah, it was pretty great.

466
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,170
You know, this case will keep until morning.

467
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Yeah, I know, it's just Merkel's still out there.

468
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,750
And the gala was a dead end

469
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,510
and all we know is that he committed two completely unrelated crimes.

470
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,580
I don't know what to do about Nora, Barry.

471
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,890
Yeah.

472
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,710
Well, look. I mean, you know I'm on your side with this.

473
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,860
If you dampen her powers in the future,

474
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,040
it's because you care about her.

475
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,330
You're doing it to keep her safe.

476
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,660
Yeah. Just because I can protect her

477
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,960
doesn't mean that I'm a good mom.

478
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,600
This isn't like what happened with Francine.

479
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,890
Isn't it?

480
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,180
She left me and my dad kept it a secret all to protect me.

481
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,540
And when she came back, I pushed her away.

482
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,620
I barely had a chance to know her before she--

483
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,520
I lost my chance to connect with my mom and...

484
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,280
Now when I get older, Nora is going to push me away too.

485
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,610
That's not gonna happen.

486
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,370
Well, it sure seems to be going in that direction.

487
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,250
Then choose a different route.

488
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,120
Make a different choice when you raise Nora.

489
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,780
If you don't want to be that person, don't be that person.

490
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,850
It's not that simple, Barry.

491
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,740
You're not your mom.

492
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,370
You're not Iris from the future,

493
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,450
and you don't have to be, ever.

494
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,600
I think you should stop worrying

495
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,410
about who you might become

496
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,510
and reconnect with who you are, now.

497
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,830
Yeah.

498
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,800
Now, let's go home, all right?

500
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,770
Actually, can I just meet you there?

501
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,140
I think I have a lead.

502
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,570
Okay.

503
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,060
Shut up. Dad did not keep singing.

504
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,130
No way was your father

505
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,220
gonna let the middle school production of "Guys and Dolls"

506
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,060
turn out to be a disaster.

507
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,730
Okay, um, one more.

508
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,560
So, when your dad was about ten,

509
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,690
there was a kid in his class that lost his folks.

510
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,650
Kid stopped smiling, barely spoke.

511
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,060
And for some reason, all of the other kids in school

512
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,700
were being so mean to him.

513
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,730
So, your father had lunch with this boy

514
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,570
every single day

515
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,910
for a whole year.

516
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,600
And when springtime came and the yearbook came out

517
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,640
your father gave the kid an entire page

518
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,000
and the photos of his science fair project

519
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,160
made him "Most likely to succeed."

520
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,760
And then the boy finally smiled.

521
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,990
Wait, but dad wasn't in yearbook.

522
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,690
That story wasn't about dad, was it?

523
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,870
It was about mom helping dad.

524
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,850
Wait, were all those stories you told me about mom?

525
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,850
Nora, you're projecting all of these feelings

526
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,780
that you have about Iris 30 years from now.

527
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,870
You're not getting to know who she is today.

528
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,190
These stories that I told you,

529
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,070
they're what made me fall in love with the Wests.

530
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,670
Made me realize how special this family is.

531
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,780
So...

532
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,380
If you liked them, plenty more in here.

534
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,760
Hey.

535
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,690
Hey babe, I just spoke with Mrs. Merkel.

536
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,960
I think I know what Peter wants.

537
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,280
The Jewelry, the building,

538
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,650
they all meant something personal to the victim.

539
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,660
He wants to deliver

540
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,960
the most painfully emotional blow possible.

541
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,700
Just like his family did to him.

542
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,010
You--you okay?

543
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,190
Yeah.

544
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,050
Yeah, sorry, that MO fits perfectly.

545
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,090
Who do you think's his next victim?

546
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,960
Barry?

547
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,210
Come and get him.

548
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,880
Guys, Merkel kidnapped Barry.

549
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,290
- What? - How's that even possible?

550
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,680
He's got Barry's meta-cuffs.

551
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,520
- Well, that would do it. - Who are you calling?

552
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,890
Damn it, Nora pick up.

553
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,970
I'll ping Barry's cell, see if I can get a location.

554
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,010
He's in Eaglesham apartments on Simone Ave.

555
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,370
I don't think he's in the apartments so much as on them.

556
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,270
Right.

557
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,090
Okay, guys. We don't have a speedster,

558
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,220
Cisco can't breach, and Killer Frost is out of commission.

559
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,770
We need to come up with a plan to rescue Barry now.

560
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,530
The extrapolator. We can reach in and grab him.

561
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,400
Great, where is it?

562
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,370
Right.

563
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,330
Uh, about that...

564
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,930
I broke it.

565
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,670
How did you break this? Batting practice?

566
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,900
- It's not user friendly. - You're not user friendly!

567
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,580
Cisco.

568
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,850
It's going to take me at least an hour to fix it.

569
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,520
- Cisco, we don't have an hour. - Well, I--

570
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,740
No, but we do have me.

571
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,240
Let's go save The Flash.

572
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,800
Oh, dude. That was inspiring.

573
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,730
You got a cuff key? - Thanks.

574
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,030
I'll drive.

575
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,500
Actually, I wanna try something.

576
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,920
Saw it in a comic book.

577
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,830
Ah, you're choking me. You're choking me.

578
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,270
Hey, I used to live there.

579
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,910
Ralph.

580
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,260
Oh, I got it.

581
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,660
Police man.

582
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
Fancy cuffs.

583
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,070
Peter, you don't want to do this.

584
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,260
Look, I know how you got your abilities.

585
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,010
The night of the enlightenment, right?

586
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,850
You were hit by a piece of the satellite, weren't you?

587
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,230
Crushed!

588
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,030
Snapped.

589
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,720
Broken.

590
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,380
Okay, well, I know people who can help you.

591
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,610
People who could stop your suffering.

592
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,880
Suffering can't be stopped.

593
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,890
Especially hers.

594
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,670
If you touch Iris--

595
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,410
Don't want to hear your pain.

596
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,210
Only your wife's.

597
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,680
Let him go.

598
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,880
The wife.

599
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,060
You fire, he dies.

600
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,350
Okay.

601
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,010
Okay.

602
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,500
Just don't hurt him.

604
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,250
Hey Caitlin, what's up?

605
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,090
You heard the lady, Raggedy Dandy.

606
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,370
Let him go.

607
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,910
Okay.

608
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,340
Barry!

609
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,820
Mom. Holy schrap.

610
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,990
You just threw yourself off a building to save dad?

611
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,010
- Yeah. - That was beyond schway.

612
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,080
- You're crazy. - I am.

613
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,530
- Thank you. I love you. - I love you.

614
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,130
- Oh, my God. - What?

615
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,050
- Ralph is still up there.

616
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,160
I hope I don't land on my keys!

617
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,400
You guys still have those meta-cuffs?

618
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,230
Iris West Allen, I know badassery when I see it

619
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,510
and that was raw, unrefined, cage-free,

620
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,910
non-GMO, badassery right there.

621
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,560
- You dove off a building. - For me.

622
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,430
Yeah, I guess I kinda did.

623
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,000
What was going through you mind?

624
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,470
"Uh, please, God, don't let me drop this key."

625
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,910
I mean, weren't you afraid? You're not a speedster.

626
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,000
No, I'm not.

627
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,240
But my husband and my partner and my best friend is.

628
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,960
Well, not to interrupt this wonderful moment

629
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,000
that I just interrupted, but, you know,

630
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,600
I helped defeat that boneless bozo too.

631
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,570
It wasn't so easy. And that--God, that mask.

632
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,030
It's like one of those porcelain dolls

633
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,950
that's gonna kill you while you sleep.

634
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,160
I thought it was more like a ragdoll.

635
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,980
Yeah, that's right. Still got it.

636
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,310
Hold your applause.

637
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,940
Guess it's off to Iron Heights

638
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,670
for slippery old ragdoll.

639
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,670
Oh, wait, you're--you're leaving?

640
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,750
Yeah, um, there's something I need to do,

641
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,840
but I'll be right back. I promise.

642
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,960
She looks happy.

643
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,170
Yeah, she really does.

644
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,040
I do that too.

645
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,480
I was writing about what you did tonight.

646
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,990
It was awesome.

647
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Thanks.

648
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,410
I guess it kinda runs in the family.

649
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,530
Where did you get that?

650
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,140
Dad's always adding to it. It's so silly.

651
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,620
No, it's not. It's your life.

652
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,930
I mean, editor of the school paper by age 11.

653
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,530
Exposing a corrupt school teacher at the age of 15.

654
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,880
I mean, you never talk about this stuff.

655
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,270
In the--the future, I mean.

656
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,750
It's, um, one of your off-limits topics.

657
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,930
I'm not allowed to ask about it.

658
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,670
Look.

659
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,090
Nora.

660
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,240
I am not that person in the future.

661
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,250
And nothing is off limits to me, okay?

662
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm not gonna sit behind a desk and say "No."

663
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,440
I want you to live your life.

664
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,250
And...

665
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,580
I want you to be a part of mine.

666
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,480
No secre, no lies, just...

667
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,780
Us being who we are today.

668
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,240
- Really? - Yeah, really.

669
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,870
Did you really stake out the school bathroom in third grade

670
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,470
to prove that the school janitor wasn't cleaning it?

671
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,890
I'm gonna kill Cecile.

672
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,900
But, um, yes.

675
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,940
Wow. That's cool, mum.

676
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,220
Um, is it?

677
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,270
Shirley and I were talking and while we realize our styles

678
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,980
are very different, what we both like...

679
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,730
Is a good mystery.

680
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,820
So we put our heads together.

681
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,290
And after some intellectual hair pulling,

682
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,910
we realized that if your mom wasn't lying...

683
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,400
And Tannhauser was still somehow involved...

684
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,420
There's only one sure place somebody could hide

685
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,130
without anyone knowing about it.

686
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,970
A Tannhauser black ops site.

687
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,830
There you go.

688
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,210
I mean, they've got dozens of them.

689
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,680
They were safe houses to test dangerous pathogens for the CDC

690
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,620
but Mom hasn't taken a government job in years.

691
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,860
They'd all be shut down.

692
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,630
Yeah, that's why it's the best place to hide.

693
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,530
Okay, so how do we find them?

694
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,710
Without Sally? Uh, have you tried Google?

695
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,590
Yes. We just use their satellite.

696
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,570
I don't think we can use someone else's satellite.

697
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,370
Or maybe we can.

698
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,140
When DeVoe took over Sally, he also launched

699
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,780
four of his own satellites to bring about the enlightenment,

700
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,520
but now that he's gone maybe we can work around the...

701
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,330
Multiplexed burst-model channels

702
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,650
and the inter-SV handoff.

704
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,430
We've got eyes and ears.

705
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,790
We've got eyes and ears!

706
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,780
I knew you could do it.

707
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,850
- Oh, sorry. - That was dumb.

708
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,750
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you to...

709
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,520
HAL, Robbie,

710
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,850
Data, and Colossus.

711
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,990
I don't really like those names.

712
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,150
But nonetheless,

713
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,440
those can help us in tracking the shards from the satellite?

714
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,960
These babies can help with anything and everything.

715
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,880
Well, once we figure out which one hit Cicada,

716
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,500
we can figure out how he got his abilities,

717
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,040
maybe find some kind of a weakness.

718
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,310
So, what we are waiting for?

719
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,550
Caitlin? Do you know what this means?

720
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,290
We can locate your father.

721
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,060
Wait, wait. I, uh...

722
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,360
Isn't this what you wanted?

723
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,130
It is, I just...

724
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay.

725
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,330
When you're ready.

726
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,930
Thanks.
