00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,923
What's your name?

183
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,510
Jibril... [coughs]

184
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,678
Jibril Hassan.

185
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,390
[Aviram] Well, Jibril Hassan...

186
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,769
I have some questions for you...

187
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,104
and hopefully you have
some answers for me.

188
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,358
Last night...

189
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,526
at the edge of your camp...

190
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,612
you met someone from...

191
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,863
Nazareth.

192
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,865
No?

193
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,992
Yes.

194
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,914
Palestinian?

195
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,957
Yes.

196
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,839
Why?

197
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,094
She gave me food.

198
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,552
She...

199
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,435
What did she ask you to do?

200
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,689
Nothing.

201
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,982
She just wanted to help.

202
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,192
We have nothing.
People are getting sick.

203
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,444
People are getting sick?

204
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,282
People are getting killed.

205
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,660
A war has started...

206
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,662
because of your friend.

207
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,665
Your leader.

208
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,085
Where is he?

209
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,713
I don't know.

210
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,717
Where is he?

211
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,428
I'm telling you, I don't know.

212
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,974
You really should stop
saying, "I don't know."

213
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,143
He was arrested. That's it.

214
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,936
The girl?

215
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,273
- Did she say where he is?
- No.

216
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,107
No?

217
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,168
Your leader.

218
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,838
What's his name?

219
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,261
al-Masih.

220
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,598
That's not a real name.

221
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,392

223

What's his name?

224

I swear I don't know.

225
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,738
No one knows anything about this man,

226
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,615
and yet they risk their lives

227
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
and trek across deserts for him.

228
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,078
Why?

229
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,623
Why?

230
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
Because he is sent from God.

231
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,301
Say that again.

232
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,680
Say that again.

233
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,936
He is sent from God.

234
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,650
I want to prove something to you...

235
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,984
Jibril Hassan.

[Jibril groans]

237
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,713
I want to prove to you...

238
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,509
that there is no God.

239
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,892
Our Lord, give us goodness
in this world...

[in English] It's empty here.

241
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,781
Sure is.

242
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,450
Real empty.

Yeah, it's Felix Iguero.

246
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,680
Yeah, I know, long time.

- I told you everything.

maybe now that you'd rested...

[sighs] I hid under the rail overpass
in the drains.

252
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,574
I saw the tornado comin',
and when I woke up, he was just...

253
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
He was kinda just there.

254
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,623
- Did you have another episode?
- I don't...

255
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,626
Probably.

256
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,421
It's all kind of a blur.

- I'm just goin' to the bathroom.

- How are you? You holdin' up okay?

267

- I'm fine.
- And Rebecca, is she...

She's... good.

269
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,521
- Better.
- Good, good. That's good.

270
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,857
We were lucky, huh?

271
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,235
So lucky.

272
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,156
The church is the only building

The only one.

Yeah.

You just...

You can't ever give up.

You can't.

- I got him a lawyer.

280

- What?
- Won't cost us a cent.

281
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,013
She's pro bono. ACLU.

282
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,557
Old friend made some calls.
You remember Kip?

283

- Kip from Princeton?
- Yeah, no, I know who he is.

Somethin' big.

287
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,277
None of this is a coincidence.

288
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,573
It was meant to happen, Anna.

289
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,783
It was meant to happen.

290
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,995
All of this.

JTTF already have him.

298
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,733
Then you need to leave that to the FBI.

299
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,760
This is our only opportunity to get intel.

300
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,929
He didn't just click his heels
and end up here.

301
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,265
He clearly had help.
This is bigger than just him.

302
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,185
It's only a matter of time
before everybody knows where he is.

A private jet from here in Amman.

315
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,579
It was forced to land
at Quetzalcóatl International in Mexico

316
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,496
due to bad weather.

Amman, Jordan to Quetzalcóatl, Mexico.

320
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,216
He must have crossed over from there.
It's five miles from the airport.

Well, that doesn’t matter much now.

The scope of this goes
well beyond domestic.

365
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,230

366

- [phone chiming]

369
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,374
Dad, something wrong?

370
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,836
No, no, nothing's wrong.
Something wrong with you?

371
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,421
No, I'm fine.

372
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,424
<i>Well, I thought I'd catch you
before you get to work.</i>

373
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,718
It's... one a.m.

374
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,721
[chuckles] <i>No, it's not.
According to my phone, in Tel Aviv, it's...</i>

375
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,347
I'm in Texas now.

376
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,309
Oh, did you already tell me that?

377
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,021
Uh... No, I just got in.
Last minute flight. Work's crazy.

378
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,774
Well, are you managing to get some rest?

379
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,444
I would be,
if it weren't for these late night calls.

380
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,531
Well, uh, you know,
since you're awake now anyway,

381
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,034
there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

382
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,496
<i>Is there anything that you need?
You know, like... um...</i>

383
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,123
anything I can... do for you?

384
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,666
<i>To help out?</i>

385
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
Help out?

386
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,797
<i>Yeah, just things. Anything.</i>

387
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,216
I'm good, Dad.

388
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,306
You know, I've got the gun out.

389
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,389
What?

390
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,726
<i>Yeah, I'm cleaning it.</i>

391
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,146
- Oh.
- <i>Yeah, the damn thing is jamming.</i>

392
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,899
Uh, I think it's the extractor spring.

393
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,945
<i>These old things,
they can become a nuisance.</i>

394
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,862
[she sighs]

395
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,492
Maybe I should take the hint, right?

396
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,411
[sighs and chuckles]

397
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,455
You're not old, but you are a nuisance.

398
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,543
Well, I’m the only nuisance you got.

399
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,628
Dad, I was joking.

400
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,505
<i>No, I know, I'm just...</i>

401
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,925
I'm tougher than that.

402
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,345
- I should let you go.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

403
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,306
Good night, sweetheart.

404
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,268
Night.

405
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,574
[sighs]

406
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,371
[gasps]

407
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,957
[in Hebrew] Morning, princess.

408
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,083
What's this?

409
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,503
I don't want you to be cold out here.

410
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,174
Thank you.

411
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,386
Now I will stay nice and warm. Thank you.

412
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,098
Daddy, why are you sleeping in your car?

413
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,603
Well...

414
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,732
I had to work...

415
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:30,156
I had to work late last night,
but I wanted to see you.

416
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,286
Daddy, you're hurt.

417
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,832
Ellie! Ellie!

418
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,586
Don't come outside like that
without telling me, understand?

419
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,885
Why can't Daddy come inside?

420
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,223
Oh, Ellie,
Daddy doesn't live here anymore.

421
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,147
You're not where you're supposed to be.
