1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,430
早安
Good morning!

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,100
寿星驾到
There's the birthday boy!

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,410
蛋糕上插满了65根蜡烛
65 candles on one cake.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,860
今天可是你的大日子
This is a big day for you...

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,290
以及那些从太空都能看到蜡烛的宇航员们
and for the astronauts who can see it from space.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,900
生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,570
谢了  你们知道  我就想安静地过一天
Thank you. And just so everyone knows, I want a quiet day.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,120
别给我惊喜
No surprises.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,200
不要惊喜
No surprises.

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,990
昨晚  我发现我怀孕了
Last night, I found out that I am pregnant,

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,620
所以有个大惊喜正等着杰呢
so Jay's gonna get one big surprise.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,170
好吧   两个惊喜 
Okay, two

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,540
如果印着比基尼的烧烤围裙也算上的话
if you count the barbecue apron with the bikini body on it.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,830
也不能怪你  杰
I don't blame you, Jay.

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,010
你这辈子体验过够多的惊喜了
You'd had enough excitement in one lifetime--

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,090
飞机的诞生  印刷术的发明  农业的出现
The dawn of flight, printed books, agriculture.

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,610
这些玩笑是什么意思
All right, what's with all the jokes?

18
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,880
这叫做吐槽
It's insult comedy.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,190
我上网看了迪安·马丁吐槽大会
I've been watching old Dean Martin roasts online.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,720
忘了这老兄不懂什么是网
Like this guy knows from the internet.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,390
有天早上
The other morning,

22
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,310
我看到他在找汽车的手摇启动把呢
I saw him looking for the crank on the front of his car.

23
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,940
{\an8}[早期汽车需以人力带动发动机]

24
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,550
-够了  别说了  -我只想逗大家一乐而已
- Okay, you're done. - I make fun, and we laugh.

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,000
不过说真的
But in all seriousness,

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,470
要是你今天见到一道亮光  千万别走过去
if you see a light today, don't walk towards it.

27
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,350
{\an8}[传说人死后会见到光  重新进入轮回]

28
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,650
抱歉  昨晚你回家时我已经睡着了
I'm sorry I was asleep when you got home.

29
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,010
小卡和米奇一定很失望
Cam and Mitch must be disappointed.

30
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,460
他们为了领养那孩子  下了不少工夫
They were really geared up to get that kid.

31
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,090
但凡事也都有积极的一面嘛
But there's a silver lining.

32
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,890
你说得对  养婴儿麻烦可多了
You might be right. Babies are a lot of work.

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,210
不  我不是那个意思
No, that's not what I mean.

34
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,250
-我是  -再说他们也不年轻了
- I'm-- - Ah, you know, and these two aren't getting any younger.

35
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,660
那种年纪可不要再重新开始
The last thing they need is to start over.

36
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,150
真有那么糟糕吗
Would that be so bad?

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,190
你好啊  杰
Hey, Jay.

38
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,360
你们来干嘛
What are you doing?

39
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,390
-那是什么玩意  -什么
- What the heck is that? - What?

40
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,250
上
Get him!

41
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,060
关于他的65岁寿辰
Jay has been very explicit

42
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,900
杰清楚明白地表达过他的愿望
about what he wants to do for his 65th birthday,

43
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,680
但菲尔·邓菲善于读懂他暗含的意思
but Phil Dunphy reads between the lines.

44
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,530
你们干什么  搞什么飞机  
What the hell is going on?! What are you doing?!

45
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,090
你的生日愿望就要成真了
Making your birthday dreams comes true.

46
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,650
今天是你的好日子哦  老弟
It's your special day, buddy.

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,540
该把他关在后备箱里吗
Should we put him in the trunk？

48
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,740
把他关在后备箱干什么
Why would we put him in the trunk?

49
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,030
你不是说怎么玩都不为过吗
You said there were no bad ideas.

50
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,590
把这蠢玩意取下来
Get this stupid thing off me!

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,040
你说头套能让他平静下来的
I thought you said the hood would calm him down.

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,450
这招对我的猎鹰就管用
It works with my falcon.

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,430
别担心  歌洛莉亚  晚餐时间就送他回来
Don't worry, Gloria. We'll have him back in time for dinner.

54
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,620
对他来说  那就是下午4点了
Which for him is at 4:00 in the afternoon.

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,400
因为他是老人家  真好笑
'Cause he's old! I love it!

56
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,560
这咖啡真不错
This is really good coffee.

57
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,970
的确如此
It really is.

58
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,910
这是中度烘焙还是
Ahh. Is it a medium roast or...

59
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,060
深度烘培
Uh, dark.

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,660
我想说深度  话到嘴边怎么成了中度
Oh. I was gonna say dark. I don't know why I said medium.

61
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,830
你本来肯定可以说对的
Well, you would've been right.

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,890
加的是全脂牛奶还是
Is it whole milk or...

63
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,300
-含脂2%  -含脂2%
- 2%. - 2%.

64
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,580
够了  这太荒唐了
Okay. This is ridiculous.

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,110
{\an8}[比喻明显存在的  但大家都刻意忽视的问题]

66
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,570
我们得谈谈客厅里的那只大象了
We need to talk about the elephant in the room.

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,620
这只巨型填充大象
The giant stuffed elephant

68
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,670
是我们的好基友胡娇送的礼物
was a gift from our good friend Pepper.

69
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,480
同志家庭养小孩算是新鲜事
Gay guys having kids is-- it's relatively new,

70
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,180
所以基友们不太懂得
so our community has not yet learned

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,680
该送婴儿什么礼物
how to modulate baby gifts.

72
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,880
当斯蒂芬和斯特凡的罗可出生时
When Steven and Stefan had little Rocco,

73
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,210
基友朗吉娜请来了
our friend Longinus sent over

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,850
嘎巴宝宝节目的全体演员
the whole cast of "Yo gabba gabba".

75
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,900
如今罗可一见鲜亮的颜色就哭
Now Rocco cries whenever he sees bright colors.

76
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,190
我都不能去他家了
I'm not allowed over there.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,010
我看我们还是把它捐给谁吧
I guess we should donate it somewhere,

78
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,570
顺便把那千斤重的大猩猩也捐了
along with the 800-pound gorilla.

79
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
既然我们不准备领养宝宝了
I mean, you know, now that we're not getting a baby.

80
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,790
顺便一提  这个决定
A decision, by the way,

81
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,780
天亮以后更显得无比英明
which seems even better in the light of day.

82
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,300
我也这么觉得
Mm. No, I totally agree.

83
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,360
-我们没事了  -根本是好极了
- So we're good? - No, we're great.

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
-这事解决得太完美了  -没错
- We couldn't have handled this any better. - No.

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,230
我的新弟弟呢
Where's my new baby brother?

86
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,350
好吧  还忘了这个小家伙
Okay. Uh, slight oversight.

87
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,530
我想看看他  能给他取名拉里吗
Can I see him? Can we name him Larry?

88
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,950
宝贝  过来坐在爸爸们中间
Okay, sweetie. Here, have a seat with us.

89
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,980
听我说
Um, listen.

90
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,280
有件事我们必须告诉你
There's something we need to tell you.

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,740
是关于拉里的吗
Is it about Larry?

92
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,960
那个  算是吧  
Well, uh, yes. Uh, sort of.

93
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,060
事实上  我们无法领养一个新宝宝
Um, it--it turns out that... We're not getting a baby.

94
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,510
我知道你因此而难过
Yeah, and I know this-- this makes you very sad,

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
但我保证我们家还是
but I promise you we're still a family--

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,450
我能养只猫吗
Can I have a kitten?

97
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,640
猫
A kitten?

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,150
如果没有新弟弟
If I can't have a brother,

99
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,850
那我就要养只叫拉里的猫
then I want a kitten named Larry.

100
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,620
怎么回事  拉里是哪个动画片中的人物吗
Okay, w-what's this about? Is Larry on a show?

101
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,700
没有  所以才特别诡异
He's not, which is what's weird.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,760
-舞会玩得开心吗  -特别开心
- Ooh! How was prom? - So fun.

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,220
迈克和我跳了一整晚
Michael and I danced all night...

104
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,320
然后我们留下帮忙打扫会场
And then we stayed after and helped clean up,

105
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,020
那也是件大好事  
which was awesome

106
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,510
因为我见到了下学期教三角学的老师
because I got to meet next year's trig teacher.

107
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,410
我记忆中的舞会可不是这样的
That is not the prom I remember.

108
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,500
我头痛死了
I have such a bad headache!

109
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,180
这才是我记忆中的舞会
That's the prom I remember.

110
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,090
你喝酒了吗
Were you drinking?

111
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,430
妈  你非得又跟我来这一套吗
Mom, do we really have to do this?

112
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,380
你问我喝酒了吗  我坚决否认
You ask if I was drinking, I say "No,"

113
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,550
可你我都知道那不是真的
and we both know that that's not true.

114
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,940
我们不是早就玩腻这一套了吗
I mean, aren't we past this point in our relationship?

115
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,380
才怪  小姑娘  我们才没有
No, young lady, we are not.

116
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,690
那我就没喝酒
Then I wasn't drinking.

117
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,390
我也没喝  邓夫人
Me neither, mrs. D.

118
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,440
我的天  别告诉我他在家里过夜了
Dear God. Tell me he did not spend the night here.

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
妈  你非要又跟我来这一套吗
Mom, do we really have to do this?

120
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,480
妈  我需要做出一个重大决定  
Mom, I have a big decision to make

121
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,010
是关于今年的诗歌夏令营的
about poetry camp this summer.

122
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,010
又是关于要带哪根手杖吗
Is this about the walking sticks again?

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,990
全带上  等你到了那儿再决定用哪根吧
Pack them all and decide when you're there.

124
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,510
我可以主攻十四行诗和自由诗体
I can either focus on sonnets or free verse.

125
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,010
我一直自诩为十四行诗大师
I've always fancied myself a sonneteer,

126
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,750
但我在想  那些推崇自由诗体的女孩
But I'm thinking the free verse girls

127
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,280
在那方面应该也很"自由"
will be freer with everything,

128
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,660
你懂我的意思吧
If you catch my meaning.

129
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,070
对不起  曼尼
Hmm? Ay. I'm sorry, Manny.

130
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,150
我相信你一定能做出正确的决定
I'm sure you will make the right decision.

131
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,250
你没事吧  你似乎心不在焉的
Are you okay? You seem distracted.

132
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,110
曼尼  快坐下  我得告诉你一些事
Manny, sit down. I have to tell you something.

133
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,820
什么
What?

134
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,940
我怀孕了
I am pregnant.

135
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,490
你什么
You're what?

136
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,070
我又要当妈了
I'm going to have a baby.

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,900
哇
Wow.

138
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,910
怎么
What?

139
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,140
你不开心吗
You're not happy?

140
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,320
开心  当然开心
Yeah. Sure.

141
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,140
只是消息太猛  一时难以接受
It's just a lot to take in.

142
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,850
老实说  新生命来的真不是好时候
And I'll be honest, this isn't coming at a great time for me,

143
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,460
我现在有一大堆事要忙
With everything I've got going on.

144
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,800
照顾孩子又不是你的责任
This is not your responsibility.

145
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,200
家里的木制沙拉碗也不是我的责任啊
Neither is our wooden salad bowl,

146
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
但只有我给它涂油
But I'm the only one who oils it.

147
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,190
没有我  那木碗会像海绵一样吸光沙拉料
Without me, that thing would soak up dressing like a sponge.

148
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,000
曼尼  我可以照顾好宝宝的  
Manny, I can take care of a baby.

149
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,210
我成功地把你照顾长大
I took care of you.

150
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,920
拜托  我是个奇才  我自学的怎么用便壶
Please. I was an anomaly. I self-potty trained.

151
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,850
当年幼小的我就是不明白
I just did not get the appeal

152
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,280
为什么要故意把屎尿拉在裤子上呢
of intentionally soiling one's pants.

153
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,680
然而鉴于此
That said,

154
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,070
我也承认很怀念妈妈在我小肚子上的亲亲
I will admit to missing the kisses on my tummy.

155
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,940
杰是什么反应
How did Jay take it?

156
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,950
我还没有告诉他
I haven't been able to tell him yet.

157
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,930
他可能不会太欣喜
He might not be too thrilled.

158
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,960
你这么想吗  我也开始这么想了
Do you think? I was starting to wonder the same thing.

159
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,470
他不喜欢接受改变
He doesn't deal well with change.

160
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,420
我知道
I know.

161
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,520
他现在还每天都在前门查看晚报到了没有
He still checks the front step for the evening paper.

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,990
别担心  妈  我相信他会适应的
Don't worry, mom. I'm sure he'll adapt.

163
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,280
尽管  他现在还把遥控器叫做"敲控器"
Although, he still does call the remote the "Clicker."

164
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,330
是啊
Ay, yeah.

165
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,270
我好无聊  爹地  让汽车跳舞吧
I'm bored, daddy. Make the car dance.

166
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,400
好吧  但只能跳一会儿  好吗
All right. But just for a second, all right?

167
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,020
再来一次
Do it again.

168
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,760
不  一次就够了
No. Once was enough.

169
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,250
如果我不能有个弟弟  那我就要汽车跳舞
If I can't have a brother, then I want the car to dance.

170
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,070
你还真会一次又一次地用这招啊
Wow, you are really comfortable playing that card.

171
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,010
他们不收
They wouldn't take 'em.

172
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,260
他们害怕这些东西身上有臭虫
They were afraid they might have bedbugs.

173
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,050
开什么玩笑  他们拒绝了我们的捐赠吗
Are you serious? They rejected our donation?

174
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,890
我深感被冒犯
I was so offended,

175
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,900
差点没买这个小奶油壶
I almost didn't buy this fiestaware creamer.

176
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,740
只要2块哦
2 bucks.

177
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,700
之前还不知道他们有这好东西呢
Didn't know what they had.

178
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,860
哈  扳回一分
Ah! Score.

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,430
我们接下来要干什么
So what are we gonna do now?

180
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,430
弄只猫  然后给它取名拉里
Get a kitten and then name it Larry.

181
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,910
莉莉  亲爱的  现在养猫不合适
Lily, honey, this is hardly the day to get a kitten, okay?

182
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,010
你能跟她说说吗
Would you just tell her?

183
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,130
我不知道
I don't know.

184
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,370
我现在也想弄一只
I kinda want one now.

185
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,330
我们经历了太多的不愉快
You know, we have been through a lot,

186
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,990
或许领回家一只有爱的小宠物
And maybe the presence of a cuddly little friend

187
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,100
能帮助我们愈合心中的伤口
will help us ease the pain.

188
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,550
好吧  你的意思是说
Okay, so what you're saying is,

189
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,330
你心中有个婴儿形状的伤口
You have a child-shaped hole in your heart,

190
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,250
你打算用一只猫去堵住那伤口吗
And your plan is to cram a cat into there?

191
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,700
他是有名字的
He has a name.

192
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,660
我等不及看到你的眼睛重见光明时
I can't wait till your eyes adjust to the light,

193
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,280
你脸上那惊喜的表情
and we see the look on your face.

194
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,640
我恨你们
I hate you guys.

195
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,980
嘿  菲尔  你想过要留胡子吗
Hey, Phil, you ever think about growing a beard?

196
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,390
我是说  你的脸型很适合的
I mean, you got the face for it.

197
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,280
-你那样觉得吗  -是啊
- You think? - Yeah.

198
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,410
有意思  我也一直想留  但我老婆不喜欢
That's funny. I always thought so, but my wife doesn't.

199
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,170
她知道个什么啊
Oh, what does she know?

200
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,680
瞧瞧  你鼻子那么有型  眼睛又那么深邃
Come on, you got a great nose, those deep-set eyes.

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,070
我是说  你留胡子一定超帅的
I mean, you would look good.

202
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,250
谢谢你  小短
Thanks, Shorty.

204
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,470
有点像乔·哈姆在戏外的造型
It's, uh, sort of a Jon Hamm in between projects.

205
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,810
好了  把我放回车厢里吧
Okay, put me back in the trunk.

我也想啊  但我的裤子是山羊绒的
I would, but--but these pants are cashmere!

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
我来救你  杰
I got you, Jay!

214
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,420
你得让他冷静下来
You gotta calm him down!

- Punch him in the head! - Don't punch him in the head!

216
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,390
别逼我打晕你  我会为了救你打晕你的
Don't make me punch you! I will punch you to save you!

217
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,470
我觉得我像是在被施水刑一样
I think I'm being waterboarded.

218
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,020
是你逼我的
You're making me do this!

219

把这玩意儿拿下来
Get this thing off me!

220
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,550
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,180
我们是打算带你钓鱼的
We're taking you fishing.

222
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,590
不管怎么说
For whatever it's worth,

223
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,940
迪兰昨晚非常表现得极具责任感
Dylan was very responsible last night.

224
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,600
家里能有他真好
He's a good guy to have around the house.

225
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,590
你到底想说什么
Mm. Where we going with this?

226
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,800
既然我不能搬去和他一起住
Well, since I can't move in with him anymore,

227
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,450
他负担不起他的房租钱
He can't afford his apartment.

228
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,590
所以我在想能不能
So I was wondering if it would be okay

229
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,110
让他和我们一起住几个星期
if he could stay with us for a couple weeks?

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
当然可以  不如  
Sure. Oh, you know what?

231
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,420
把我们的大房间让给你们吧
Why don't you guys take our room?

232
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,620
她那是戏谑的说法
She's being facetious.

233
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,680
就是讽刺
Sarcastic.

234
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,970
迪兰不能搬进来
Dylan no stay.

235
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,730
什么
what?!

236
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,410
拜托  他能帮许多忙
Oh, come on! He helps out a lot.

237
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,780
他手可巧了
He is very handy.

238
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,260
是吗  他不是曾把自己反锁在车里吗
Really? The guy who locked himself in his car?

239
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,200
你没资格开口向我求情  小姐
You are in no position to be asking for favors, young lady.

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,590
来  把这个喝了  解酒的
Here. Drink this. It's for your hangover.

241
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,760
闻着太恶心了
Ugh. It smells gross.

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,400
那你就快点儿喝嘛
Well, then you better drink it fast.

243
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,560
恶  我要吐了
Ew! I'm gonna throw up! Ugh! Ugh!

244
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,320
那是解酒的吗
That's a hangover cure?

245
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,550
不是
No.

246
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,300
我这手机应该是短路了
Well, this is probably shot.

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,160
我得再跟你说声对不起  不该打你头
Once again, I'd like to apologize for punching you in the head.

248
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,030
可是只有这样才能救你
It really was the only way to save you

249
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,710
你当时双手被绑着  头也被  罩着
since you were bound and... hooded,

250
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,490
我还得再为这个道个歉
which leads me to my second apology.

251
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,090
先生们  得了  就像我叔叔常说的
Gentlemen, come on. As my uncle used to say,

You know, the more I look at you,

266

就越气愤你咋不留胡子呢
the angrier I get that you don't got a beard.

Two years ago, it was a patch of dirt in my backyard.

为啥这个只对我说
Why would that be between you and me?

284
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,140
因为腌菜数量有限呐
Because there's a finite number of pickles.

But don't worry. All you guys are on the list.

Hey, let's do some fishing.

295
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,320
我感觉好多了  身上总算快干了
I'm starting to feel better now that I'm finally getting dry.

296
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,510
钓鱼吧
Let's do this!

297
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,570
-走吧  -好的
- Let's go! - All right!

298
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,220
当然
Sure.

299
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,590
你知道吗
You know,

300
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,430
我在毕业舞会上喝了一点儿薄荷杜松子酒
I had a little peppermints schnapps at my prom,

301
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,840
但我瞒过了我的父母
but I hid it from my parents

302
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,520
而且在他们起床前  把我男友弄出了门
and I kicked my boyfriend out before they woke up.

303
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,600
那叫做起码的尊重
It's called respect.

304
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,710
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

305
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,070
你要变肥了
You're gonna get fat.

306
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,270
你  我是说
You--oh! I mean...

307
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,450
太好了  太好了  你怀孕了
That's great. It's great! You're pregnant!

308
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,990
棒极了  恭喜你
It's great! Congratulations!

309
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,990
其实是个意外之喜
It was a surprise.

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,080
可不是嘛  我爸爸怎么说
Yeah, I'll bet. What did my dad say?

311
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,720
我还没有告诉他
I haven't told him yet.

312
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,890
我担心他会觉得这个不是个好消息
I worry that he's going to think it's not such great news.

313
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,800
不会的  别傻了
Ohh, no. Don't be silly.

314
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
他会高兴死的
He's gonna be thrilled.

315
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,460
我知道他才不会高兴呢
I knew he wasn't gonna be thrilled.

316
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,810
如果历史可以为鉴
And if history was any indication,

317
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,990
他也不会掩盖自己情绪的
he wasn't gonna be able to hide it.

318
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,010
这是一款法式加拿大美味  叫做布丁
It's a french canadian delicacy called poutine.

319
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,110
看着像是别人吐出来的
Mm. Well, it looks like vomit,

320
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,770
我才不会让那东西"补丁"进我嘴里
So I'm not pou-ting it in my mouth.

321
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,240
我们来了
We're here!

322
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,650
你头发怎么了
What'd you do to your hair?

323
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,080
我想尝试一下新发型
I thought I'd try something different.

324
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,330
干嘛  为了显老吗
What, looking old?

325
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,360
我得赶在老爸
I had to get to dad

326
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,140
对歌洛莉亚说出刻薄话前找到他
Before he said something insensitive to Gloria.

327
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,730
但她肯定会变得很肥的
But she is gonna get really fat, though.

328
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,470
爸  给我回电话
Dad, call me back.

329
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,070
我有很重要的事要告诉你
I have something very important to tell you

330
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,870
那样你回家后就不会说些蠢话
So when you get home you don't say something stupid

331
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,140
就像你以前常干的那样
Like you usually do.

332
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,600
噢  生日快乐
oh, happy birthday.

333
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,980
我不得不说
Yeah. I've gotta say,

334
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,830
你对新宝宝一事的反应  比我想的要淡定的多
You're handling this baby thing better than I would've expected.

335
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,500
你什么意思
What do you mean?

336
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,830
你已经习惯了当家里唯一的孩子
You're used to being the only kid in the house.

337
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,970
马上就会多个新的孩子  杰的亲生孩子
Now there's gonna be a new kid. Jay's kid.

338
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,700
那又如何
So?

339
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,110
以前的曼尼肯定会担心
Well, the old Manny would've been worried

340
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,680
杰会更疼爱新出生的孩子
that Jay would love the new kid more.

341
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,980
我觉得你太低估我的可爱乖巧了
I think you're underestimating how adorable I am.

342
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,550
你说得对  你可比小宝宝萌多了
You're right. You're way cuter than a baby.

343
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,270
我去看看晚饭好了没有
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

344
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,810
有时候我就喜欢扔个炸弹  然后走开
Sometimes I just like to toss a grenade and run away.

345
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,500
来  吸一口气
All right, take a whiff.

346
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,250
确定你喜欢这味道哦
Make sure you like it,

347
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,340
因为以后我们家沙发就会是这味儿了
'cause that's what our couch is gonna smell like.

348
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,690
你好  我们就打算要这只了
Okay, hi. Yes, we're gonna take this one.

349
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,890
你们先别急着要
Oh, I'm gonna need you to slow down a bit.

350
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,470
我们有一些手续要办
There's a process we need to go through

351
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,570
以确定你们是否有资格养猫
to see if you're a suitable cat guardian.

352
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,990
噢是吗  我以为手续就是
Oh, really? Because I thought the process was,

353
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,920
我表示看中了这只
I say, "We'll take this one."

354
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,110
而你感激涕零  因为你们囤猫太多
And then you say, "Thank god because we have too many cats."

355
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,060
不  我们得确保它们都能找到好归宿
No. We need to ensure these cats are going to good homes.

356
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,970
所以你们得先填了这张表
That's why we need you to fill out this form,

357
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,490
然后我们会到你们家实地拜访
And then there'll be a site visit.

358
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,970
是这样  一年来我们饱尝各种辛酸麻烦
Okay, um, we've just been through a very frustrating year

359
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,140
就为了领养个孩子  所以
trying to adopt a baby, so...

360
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,010
希望你能体谅我们实在不愿意
You'll forgive us if we're not really in the mood

361
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,050
为一只猫搞得太折腾
to jump through too many hoops for a cat.

362
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,200
为什么你们没领养成功
Oh. Why wouldn't they give you a baby?

363
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,830
-那问题很复杂  -领养猫也是
- It's complicated. - So are cats.

364
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,340
是吗  那边那只猫一直在舔自己
Are they? 'cause that one over there has been licking

365
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,960
从我们来一直舔到现在
itself ever since we got here.

366
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,730
好吧  我...我弄不下去了
Okay, you know what? I'm--I can't do this.

367
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,710
拉里怎么办
What about Larry?

368
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,330
抱歉  莉莉  今天不行
I'm sorry, Lily. Not today.

369
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,220
米奇尔一走了之  我可不会善罢甘休
Mitchell stormed off, but I couldn't.

370
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,600
我得给她点颜色瞧瞧
I had to give her a piece of my mind.

371
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,570
结果呢
And how'd that go?

372
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,930
我想我可能跑偏了一点点
I may have strayed off topic just a bit.

373
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,940
不可能  大姐
No, sir!

374
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,380
不  在我心中她永远是单纯的诺玛·简[梦露原名]
No, she will always be Norma Jeane Baker to me.

375
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,610
你到底想说什么
What is your point, exactly?

376
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,660
就像离过三次婚的女星
That like the thrice-married starlet,

377
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,550
这只猫被剥夺了享受家庭温暖的权利
This cat is being deprived a stable home.

378
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,960
我很抱歉让你不高兴了
I'm sorry if you're upset.

379
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,100
真正该不高兴的人是你才对吧  女士
You're the one who should be upset, ma'am.

380
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,660
我们可是喜欢动物的爱心人士
we are animals lovers.

381
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,380
那只猫原本可以享"受"最完美的呵护
That cat would've been on the receiving end of affection

382
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,350
24小时不间断
24 hours a day.

383
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,190
满足它的全部需求将成为我们的首要任务
Satisfying its every need would've been our top priority.

384
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,050
好吧  鉴于这样的画面
Okay, in light of that tableau,

385
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,920
我要收回之前说的让那只猫享"受"
I would like to take back the phrase "Receiving end."

386
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,470
老妈  我决定不参加诗歌夏令营了
Mom, I've decided I'm not going to poetry camp.

387
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,630
什么  为什么
What? Why not?

388
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,920
因为等我回来的时候
'cause by the time I come back,

389
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,660
杰会把我的房间变成婴儿房
Jay will have turned my room into a nursery.

390
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,600
不  他不会的
No, he won't.

391
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,830
我不是他亲生的
I'm not his real kid.

392
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,490
我将如狂风中的耳语一般被无视
I'll be as insignificant as a whisper in a windstorm.

393
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,520
瞧你说的  你这么有天赋
Oh, listen to you. You have a gift.

394
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,010
你必须去参加诗歌夏令营
You have to go to the poetry camp.

395
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,080
恐怕我是不会去了
I don't think I can

396
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,700
曼尼拜托  我现在已经够烦心的了
Manny, please. I have too much to worry about right now.

397
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,840
-好吗  -你
-Okay? - You?

398
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
我才是自掘坟墓  
I dug a pretty big hole for myself

399
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,040
今早说了那么多冒犯他的笑话
with those insult jokes this morning.

400
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,870
为什么我不学学里格斯
Why didn't I learn from Rickles?

401
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,670
得在结束时来点摇摆小舞
You gotta end with some ticker.

402
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,940
算了 我认输
Okay, I give up.

403
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,960
我实在摆不出一个不淫荡的体位
I can't find a position that's not sexual.

404
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,250
-淡定  -我淡定不了
- Just calm down. - I can't calm down.

405
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,150
也许我们没有嘴上说的那么没事
You know, maybe we're not as okay as we keep saying we are.

406
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,810
-我知道  -也许我们该离开一段时间
- I know. - Maybe we should go away.

407
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,080
到一个陌生的地方去疗伤
You know, go someplace to heal.

408
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,100
哪里
Where?

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,210
一个拥有华丽剧院的地方
Well, someplace with a vibrant theater scene...

410
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,940
处处是高级餐厅
Top-notch restaurants...

411
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,860
密苏里怀特河畔的风水宝地
The jewel of Missouri's white river.

412
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,040
我们才不要去布兰森
We're not going to Branson.

413
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,190
好吧  你想去哪里
Okay, fine. Where would you go?

414
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,200
不知道  欧洲如何
I don't know. Maybe europe?

415
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,110
伦敦
London?

416
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,010
越远越好
Just somewhere far away.

417
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,080
-我好悲伤  小卡  -我也是
-I'm just sad, Cam.  - I am, too.

418
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,710
我把以后早晨怎么度过都打算好了
You know, I had our mornings all planned out.

419
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,400
我抱着宝宝送莉莉去幼儿园
The baby and I would walk Lily to kindergarten

420
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,830
然后穿过公园回家
and then cut back home through the park

421
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,360
停下来喂喂鸭子  虽然公园不让喂
and feed those ducks that you're not supposed to feed

422
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,870
但大家都在喂
but everybody does.

423
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,260
我买了相框放在桌上
I bought a picture frame for my desk,

424
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,280
它一直在那里静静等待
and it's just sitting there,

425
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,630
他的出现
Waiting for his face.

426
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,940
抱抱
Come here.

427
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,500
我感觉好多了
I already feel better.

428
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,360
我也是
Me, too.

429
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,620
瞧瞧拥抱的力量
See what the power of a hug can do?

430
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,700
省了我们长途跋涉的一路颠簸
Just saved us a long plane ride with a toddler.

431
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,850
-也省了搞一只猫回来  -猫还是得有的
- And a cat that we didn't want. - Oh, we're still getting that.

432
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,230
瞧  看上去如何
All right, how does this look?

433
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,730
超级纯情  都没有肢体接触
Perfectly innocent. They're not even touching.

434
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,900
很好  走吧
Great. Okay. Let's go.

435
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,960
好吧
All right.

436
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,360
坐好了  宝贝
You ready, honey?

437
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,330
去吧  去吧
Go. Go.

438
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,770
你好  邓菲太太
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy?

439
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,400
我听说了海莉问你的事  其实我想告诉你
I heard about what Haley asked you, and just so you know,

440
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,090
我不是有意让你为难
I never wanted to put you in that position.

441
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,280
-没关系的  -那就好
- I'll be fine. - That's good to know.

442
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,950
我表哥迪兰说我可以在他家里住
My cousin Dylan said I could stay at his house.

443
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,220
虽然  其实不是真的家里
Well, not really at his house.

444
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,910
准确的说是...车库
More like behind it... In the garage.

445
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,740
不错啊
Okay.

446
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,240
其实  那里没有墙
Well, actually, there are no walls,

447
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,070
所以更准确的说是停车门廊 
So it's more of a porte cochere.

448
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,800
挺好嘛
Fancy.

449
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,310
反正  我就在那里睡
Anyway, I'll be sleeping in it.

450
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,930
那里有卫生间的
It's got a bathroom.

451
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,870
准确的说  是半间
More of a half-bath.

452
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,280
是个咖啡罐
It's a coffee can.

453
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
总之  我会过得很好
Anyway, I'll be fine

454
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,340
只要能发现一个抵御郊狼袭击的帐篷就行
once I find a nice tent to protect me from the coyotes.

455
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,370
记得把食物挂在高处
Well, be sure to hang your food up high.

456
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,000
我们回来啦
we're back!

457
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,590
寿星驾到
Birthday boy's here!

458
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,000
杰  你浑身都皱皱的
Hey, Jay, you're all wrinkled.

459
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,520
是啊  你想说我人老皮皱
Yeah, yeah, I'm old. I get it.

460
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,690
不  我是指你的衣服
No, I mean your clothes.

461
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,710
像你这么大的时候  我都披兽皮
Yeah, when I was your age, I was wearing animal skins.

462
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,740
哗  你戏谑到我了
Bam! You got me.

463
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,470
我觉得  哗  你戏谑到你自己了
I think, bam! You got yourself.

464
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,690
我只是表示关心而已
I'm just expressing concern.

465
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,590
让我想想  关心我的骨质密度
Let me guess-- about my bone density.

466
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,150
不得不说  你真是个聪明蛋
You know, you're a real smart-ass.

467
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,470
这样下去  我得住地下室了
At this rate, I'll be living in the basement.

468
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,460
真幸运
Lucky.

469
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,450
爸  爸  快点  过来一下
Dad? Dad, okay, quick. Just come here one second.

470
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,520
我有事跟你说
I gotta tell you something.

471
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,990
有人会告诉你一件非常重要的事情
Somebody is about to tell you some very important news.

472
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,720
这辈子第一次
And for the first time in your life,

473
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,430
请你说些好听的话
I need you to react nicely.

474
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,060
-我总是捡好听的说  -从没有过
- I always react nicely. - You never do.

475
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,120
我说的那个人现在非常脆弱无助
And this person in question is very vulnerable right now.

476
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,520
所以求你一定要表现出关爱与支持
So could you please just be loving and supportive?

477
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,960
-生日快乐  老爸  -谢谢
- Happy birthday, dad! - Oh, thank you.

478
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,860
好孩子
That's a boy.

479
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,500
抱歉我们迟到了  但事出有因
Sorry we're late, but it's for a good reason.

480
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,810
我们考虑养只猫
We're thinking about getting a cat.

481
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
那  真是太好了
Well, isn't that wonderful?

482
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,880
我为你们感到激动  这是个重大决定
I'm thrilled for you both. This is a heck of a decision.

483
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,470
我完全支持
You have my full support.

484
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,550
好的
Okay.

485
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,600
家里再添位成员真是太好了
I think it'll be a perfect addition to the family.

486
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,940
我知道我自己会爱死那小家伙的
I know I'll love the heck out of the little bugger.

487
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,200
我只希望那边的小家伙不要吃醋
I'm just hoping that little one over there doesn't get jealous.

488
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,910
噢  "这个小家伙"不会有事的
Oh, this little one will be just fine

489
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,620
现在他知道自己在家是个啥地位了
now that he knows where he stands--

490
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,090
活在你新宝贝的阴影下
In the shadow of your new baby!

491
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,130
他说什么呢
What's he talking about?

492
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,860
他说的是我怀孕的事
He's talking about I am pregnant.

493
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,650
-拜托  -怀孕
- Oh, come on! - Pregnant?!

494
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,790
你开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me!

495
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,080
恶心  我没想到外公还能做
Oh, gross. I didn't know grandpa could still do it.

496
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,570
别这么无礼  卢克
Don't be disrespectful, Luke.

497
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,330
面对歌洛莉亚  谁都能硬起来
Anyone could do it with Gloria.

498
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,030
如果你习惯了一成不变的生活  不乐意接受
And if you're too set in your old ways to be happy about it,

499
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,660
我可以一个人养大这孩子
I can raise it on my own.

500
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,820
我以前养过  现在也可以做到
I have done it before, and I can do it now!

501
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,300
我和众多久经考验的坚强拉美女性一样
I come from a very long line of strong Latin women

502
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,070
习惯了不见老公的鬼影
whose husbands are nowhere to be found!

503
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,540
-你说完了吗  -是的
- Are you done? - Yes!

504
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,390
-我能发表意见吗  -请说
- Can I say something? - Go on!

505
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,820
这是我这辈子听到的最棒的消息
That's the greatest news I've ever heard.

506
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,390
是吗
It is?

507
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,750
我一整天都在听我的未来依然光明的鬼话
I spent the day hearing what my future had in store for me,

508
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,990
没一句我爱听的
and I didn't like one bit of it.

509
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,670
感觉像我的人生已经到头了
It felt like my life was ending.

510
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,120
现在你告诉我  我能有个全新的开始
And now you're telling me that I get to have a new start...

511
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,020
和我心爱的女人一起
with the woman of my dreams.

512
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,040
我觉得我快哭了
I think I'm gonna cry.

513
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,650
我早哭了
I'm way ahead of you.

514
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,530
你能相信吗
Can you believe this?

515
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,190
就是说啊  人家连猫都不让我们养
I know. They wouldn't even let us get a cat.

516
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,640
真是太好了
It's gonna be great!

517
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,390
我会变成大肥婆
I'm gonna get so fat.

518
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,630
大部分都挺好[除了变胖]
Mostly great.

519
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,230
恶心  他们又来了
Oh, gross. They're at it again.

520
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,200
你不喜欢就别看
If you don't like it, don't look.

521
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,910
她看起来不错啊  是吧
She looks great, doesn't she?

522
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,870
是啊
Yeah.

523
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,790
我一直腹黑地希望她增肥  没想到是增在肚子上
Not really gaining weight the way I would've expected.

524
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,590
我终于明白了为何大家都说孕妇光彩照人
I finally understand why people say pregnant women glow.

525
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,650
菲尔  我怀过三次
Phil, I have had three children.

526
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,350
爸  歌洛莉亚  拆我们的礼物吧
Hey, dad, Gloria, open our present.

527
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,780
希望是高级货
Ooh! I hope it's something fancy.

528
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,670
是给宝宝的  我好喜欢
It's for the baby. I love it!

529
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,170
我们在希思罗机场买的  免税
We got it in a shop at Heathrow, duty free.

530
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,820
{\an8}[Duty既指税  又指宝宝拉屎拉尿]

531
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,170
很快就不能"免屎"了
Not for long.

532
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,860
是不是好棒的说
Isn't it absolutely brilliant?

533
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,280
我们在伦敦就待了两周  
Okay, we were in london two weeks.

534
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,480
别拽口音了  麦当娜
Lose the accent, Madonna.

535
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,220
你的脸上怎么全是抓痕
Why is your face all scratched up?

536
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,500
白痴拉里干的好事
Stupid Larry.

537
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,000
感觉好怪
This feels so weird.

538
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,130
很适合你
It suits you.

539
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,230
别开没营养的玩笑
Don't even joke about it.

540
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,300
够了  他明天就得给我搬
That's it. He is moving out of the house tomorrow.

541
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,460
真的吗
Really?

542
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,980
你的胡子也得刮
Oh, and that beard is going.

543
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,910
好吧  但小短可得伤心死了
Fine, but it's gonna kill shorty.

544
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,780
好了各位  都过来吧
Okay, everybody, let's gather together.

545
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,190
曼尼将为大家读一段
Manny's gonna read us a little something

546
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,400
他在诗歌夏令营中做的诗
that he prepare in his poetry camp.

547
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,530
多谢  妈
Thank you, mom.

548
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,030
谨以此诗献给我即将到来的弟弟或妹妹
This is for my new baby brother or sister.

549
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,630
欢迎你  小家伙
"Welcome, little one.

550
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,020
张开双眼  融入这个家吧  
Open your eyes and take your place.

551
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,730
这里是你命中注定的归宿
This is where you're meant to be,

552
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,700
依偎在母亲的胸前
Nestled in the bosom of your mother."

553
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,720
真幸运的宝宝
Lucky baby.

554
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,770
-什么  -爱你  宝贝
- What? - Love you, baby.

555
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,030
这里是你命中注定的归宿
"This is where you're meant to be,

556
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,610
父亲的怀抱
in the arms of your father.

557
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,770
他的漫长人生造就了今日的他
His long, long journey has readied him for this day,

558
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,010
尽管他的皮肤也许松弛了
though his skin may be loose,

559
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,440
他的头发已稀疏
his hair but a wisp,

560
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,130
岁月的沉淀让他的眼神混浊不清
and his eyes milky with age,"

561
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,340
好了  就念到这里吧
All right, we're done here.

562
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,550
得去喝一杯
Get a drink.

563
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,820
别为你赶我走的事心怀愧疚  邓太太
Don't feel bad about making move out, mrs. D.

564
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,140
我知道这一天终会到来
I knew this day would come eventually,

565
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,530
我有心理准备
and I'm totally covered.

566
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,290
太好了  那我们回见了
Great. So we'll see you around.

567
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,110
我有个老朋友那里有地方
I got a place with an old friend of mine.

568
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,360
与其说地方  不如说是储物间
Well, not so much of a place as a storage pod.

569
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,550
与其说是朋友  不如说是浣熊
And not so much of a... friend as a raccoon.

570
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,080
你有室友我很开心
Good to know you'll have company.

571
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,040
我叫它小泡  因为它的嘴里全是泡沫
I call him bubbles because his mouth is all foamy.

572
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,100
迪兰  你的小把戏我早看穿了
Dylan, I'm on to your little game.

573
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,240
我知道你说的全是假的
I know non of this is ture.

574
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,340
你就是想我内疚  然后让你留下来
You just try to guilt me into I letting you stay.

575
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,550
你说的对  对不起
You're right, I'm sorry.

576
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,260
我住车上好了
I'll just live in my car.

577
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,030
我可以借个衣架吗  
Think I can borrow a coat hanger

578
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,010
我怕又被关在车里了
in case I get lock in there again.

579
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,620
-老天  -什么事啊
- God. - What's going on?

580
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,720
不行  全刮掉
No, no no. All of it.

581
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,390
你不想在我恢复天使面容前与魔鬼共舞吗
Sure you don't wanna dance with the devil before I get rid of it.

582
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,230
快去
Go.

583
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,670
好吧
Fine.
