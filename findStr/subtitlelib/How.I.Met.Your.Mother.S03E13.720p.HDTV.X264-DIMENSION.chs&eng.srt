1
00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:03,574
孩子们  有时候在人生中  只是不经意的一瞥
Kids,sometime in life you've seen someone

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:05,904
你便立即知道
And you just instantly know

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,934
这就是你一直在寻觅的那个人
This is the person for you.

4
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,054
它可以在任何地方发生
It can happen anywhere.

5
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:12,734
即便是在一个去除纹身的小诊所的候诊室里
Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic.

6
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:16,774
当我碰到丝戴拉的时候  这种感觉油然而生
And that's what happened when I met... ...stella.

7
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,804
蝴蝶形臀纹
Ah,the butterfly tramp stamp.

8
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:25,184
这可是我的拿手项目
My bread and butter.

9
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,024
我猜这跟糟糕的分手
So I'm guessing that the real story

10
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,844
还有酒精有关吧
Involves a bad breakup and some booze.

11
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,194
除非这是个帮派的纹身
Unless it's a gang tattoo,

12
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,554
如果是那样的话  我想是时候换个帮派了
In which case,i think it's time to find a new gang.

13
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:33,964
不  只是一开始我认为有个
No,i just thought it would be cool

14
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:35,324
毛毛虫的纹身会很酷
To get a caterpillar tattoo,

15
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,534
过了几周  不知道怎么搞得  突然间它就破蛹了...
And then a few weeks went by,and all of a sudden...

16
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,264
经过十次一小时的疗程就可以把这个去除
Well,i can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions,

17
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,964
不过我得提醒你激光手术会很疼的哦
But,i should warn you,laser surgery's very painful.

18
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,234
那你就会发现
Well,i think you'll find

19
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:47,104
我特别能忍受疼痛
I have a very high tolerance for pain.

20
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,474
就在昨晚  我看完了一部超烂的电影
Just last night,i sat through the worst movie ever made.

21
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:50,874
九号行星外层空间计划(史上最烂电影的榜首)
Oh,plan 9 from outer space?

22
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:55,084
不  比这个更烂  命运之手(美国60年代恐怖片)
No, the worst movie--Hands of fate.

23
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:56,704
我可是上过医学院的医生
Uh,i'm a doctor,went to medical school.

24
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,284
相信我一定是九号行星这部比较烂  如果你不相信我
It's plan 9. if you don't believe me,

25
00:00:58,294 --> 00:00:59,824
帕梅拉剧院现在就有在放映这个片子
It's playing down at the pamela theater.

26
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:02,304
那我可真不相信你  医生
Uh-huh. I don't believe you,doctor.

27
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:04,564
那你今晚有什么安排
Well,what are you doing tonight?

28
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:08,964
你好
hello.

29
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,394
好啊  泰德
Hey,ted

30
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,764
把钱包收起来吧  今天晚上我请客
Hey,put that away. tonight's on me.

31
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:14,124
不  还是不要了...
Oh,no,no,don't...

32
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:15,234
别客气  我坚持
Come on,i insist.

33
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,434
你人真好  谢谢啦
That's so nice. thank you.

34
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,164
朋友们  这是我朋友泰德
Hey,guys,this is my friend ted.

35
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:19,204
今晚他请客
He wants to pay.

36
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,664
哇  太感谢了
wow,thank you.

37
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,704
一  二  三  四
One,two,three,four.

38
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,784
出什么问题了吗
Is something wrong?

39
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:31,184
没有  只不过...
No,it's just,um...

40
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:32,814
我只不过是有点尴尬罢了
I'm just a little embarrassed.

41
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,884
我以为这是约会呢
I thought this was a date.

42
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:36,514
不过没事儿
But it's no big deal.

43
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:38,754
别担心
Don't worry about it.

44
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:40,324
怎么了
What's wrong?

45
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,484
泰德觉得尴尬  他以为这是个约会
Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date.

46
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,634
泰德以为这是个约会
Ted thought this was a date.

47
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:48,004
丝戴拉  你知道泰德以为这是个约会吗
Stella,did you know ted thought this was a date?

48
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,314
什么  我不能和我的病人约会
What? I'm not allowed to date a patient.

49
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:50,934
这是美国医协的规定
It's an ama rule.

50
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,904
她不能和她的病人约会
She's not allowed to date patients.

51
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:53,604
这是医协的规定
It's an ama rule.

52
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,374
她不能和她的病人约会
She's not allowed to date patients.

53
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:56,104
这是医协的规定
It's an ama rule.

54
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,874
她不能和她的病人约会
She's not allowed to date...

55
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,074
我听见了
Yeah,i got it.

56
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,114
我们都听见了
We all got it.

57
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:02,384
泰德真是个冤大头
Ted's a schmuck.

58
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:20,694
-所以你买了所有人的票  -对呀  对呀
-And you bought all the tickets. -yeah,yeah.

59
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,764
是啊  你说对了
Hey,you were right.

60
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,434
这是我看电影以来最糟的经历
Worst movie-going experience ever.

61
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:27,674
当然  这跟电影本身没什么关系
Of course,it had nothing to do with the movie.

62
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,444
我感到很抱歉让你误会那是个约会
I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.

63
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,444
没关系
No,it's fine.

64
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:33,574
能和你在女友之夜一起出去也不错啊
I got to hang out with you on girls' night out.

65
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,804
好吧  如果你不能和你的病人约会
All right,so if you're not allowed to date a patient,

66
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,944
我就...  我就等到10个疗程结束后
I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up

67
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,174
再约你出去
And then I'll ask you out then.

68
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:43,014
那我还是提前先告诉你
Well, then,fair warning:

69
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,484
到时候我还是会说不行的
I'm going to say no.

70
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,914
是吗  我从你那儿感觉到的可不是这么回事
Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you.

71
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:50,024
我觉得你已经盯着我的臀部看了很久了
I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time.

72
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,864
-为什么  你结婚了?  -不是
-What,you're married? -no.

73
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:52,864
-有男朋友了?  -不是
-Boyfriend? -no.

74
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:54,104
-是同性恋?  -不是
-Lesbian? -no.

75
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:56,504
-只和黑人约会?  -不是
-Only date black guys? -no.

76
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,564
那你现在可以充满信心的说
And yet you can say with absolute confidence

77
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,434
十周之后  如果我约你出去
That ten weeks from now,if I ask you out on a date,

78
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:05,304
-你的答案将是...  -不行
-Your answer will be... -no.

79
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:06,844
不行
No... hmm.

80
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,514
她说不的时候
What could she mean

81
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,714
究竟是什么意思
When she says no?

82
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,084
我不知道
I don't know,

83
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,754
总之是很神秘就对了
It is totally cryptic.

84
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:15,954
这离结束还早呢
This is far from over.

85
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,684
我是说还有十周的时间呢
We're talking ten weeks from now.

86
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,354
谁知道到时候她会怎么想呢
Who knows what she'll want then?

87
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,524
你知道十周后
Do you know what you're going to want

88
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,884
你午饭想吃什么吗
For lunch ten weeks from now?

89
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:24,694
炒牛肉酱  河虾鸡尾酒还有奶昔
Sloppy joe,shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.

90
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:26,734
泰德  你知道一个女人要决定是否
Ted,do you know how long it takes a woman

91
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:28,694
跟一个男人上床需要多久吗
To decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy?

92
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,624
8.3秒
8.3 seconds.

93
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:31,324
在那之后
After that,

94
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,294
她就心意已决
Her decision is made.

95
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,664
不会再改变主意了
She will not change her mind.

96
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,794
-这种说法太荒谬了  -是吗
-That's ridiculous. -is it?

97
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:38,814
描述一下你第一个8.3秒见到丝戴拉的情况
Describe your first 8.3 seconds with stella.

98
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,044
低腰蝴蝶纹身的  到你了
Lower back butterfly tattoo-- you're up.

99
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,284
那就算是我们开始不怎么顺利
So we got off to a rocky start.

100
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,384
对于有些人来说或许是个问题
That may be a problem for some guys,

101
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,554
但是随着时间的推移  我的优势就显现了
But I get better over time. right?

102
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:54,554
我可不像排行榜上前四十的歌曲
I'm not some top 40 song--

103
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,694
那么通俗易懂的
Easily digestible.

104
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:56,984
我是很复杂的
I'm complex.

105
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,684
需要时间和不断的聆听来反覆揣摩
I require time and multiple listens.

106
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,894
我是"天堂之梯"(齐柏林飞船乐队的名曲)
I'm "stairway to heaven."

107
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:06,134
罗杰・达尔崔会气得在棺材里打滚的(摇滚乐队谁人乐队主唱)
Wow,roger daltrey just rolled over in his grave.

108
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,504
我又弄错了  是不是
That's not the right guy,is it?

109
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,844
他还没死  是不是
He's not even dead,is he?

110
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:15,414
我觉得那很不错  泰德
I think that's great,ted.

111
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,244
你怎么想就怎么去做
You can do whatever you set your mind to.

112
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:19,444
事实上  你激发了我
In fact,you've inspired me.

113
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:21,554
我决定从今以后不咬指甲了
I'm going to stop biting my nails.

114
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:23,924
可亲爱的  你喜欢咬你的指甲啊
But,baby,you love biting your nails.

115
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:27,954
我知道  但我这是为了泰德而做的牺牲
I know,but I'm doing this for ted.

116
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,924
老天  这还真是很难啊
God,this is really hard.

117
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,024
给我十个疗程的时间
Give me ten sessions,

118
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,064
我要把那个"不行"变成"行"
I'm going to turn that "no" into a "yes."

119
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:34,994
-泰德  是吗  -恩啊
-Really,ted? -mm-hmm.

120
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,334
-你这么认为?  -恩啊
-You think so? -mmm.

121
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,164
那说说那天的疗程后来发生了什么
Well,tell me,how did the rest of that session go?

122
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,494
这个可能会有点疼哦
This is going to hurt a little.

123
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,504
没事  我能忍住
Yeah,well,i can handle pain.

124
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:46,174
有一次我在打网球...
This one time I was playing tennis,and...

125
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,204
不过去掉纹身的确是很疼
Yeah,but tattoo removal really hurts.

126
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,644
也许每个人都那么叫的吧
Everyone probably sounds like that.

127
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,754
医生  一切还顺利吧
Doctor,are you all right?

128
00:04:56,764 --> 00:05:01,464
我怎么听到一个女人尖叫的声音
I heard a woman screaming in here. oh.

129
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:10,604
祝贺我还有九周美好的时光
Here's to nine more great sessions.

130
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,884
时间如流水
And so thess weeks went by.

131
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,904
第二个疗程的时候我告诉她
The second session I told her about how I spent a summer

132
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,714
我是怎样用一个夏天的时间来帮助贫民区的孩子
Working with inner-city kids.

133
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,094
第三疗程我们不停地说法语
The third session we both spoke nothing but french.

134
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,564
第四疗程我让她笑得
The fourth session I made her laugh so hard

135
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,894
从椅子上掉了下来
She fell out of her chair.

136
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:36,954
-到了第五个疗程  -还是"不行"
-So by the time the fifth session came around... -still no.

137
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:37,664
还不行
Still no.

138
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:38,934
到底是什么问题
What's up with that?

139
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,974
我是指  我都用上杂耍了
I mean,i juggled.

140
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:42,064
你杂耍?
You juggled?

141
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,604
我以为你本意是想打动她的
I thought you were trying to impress her.

142
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:45,644
你还玩魔术勒
You do magic.

143
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,404
杂耍哪里比魔术更逊啦
How is juggling any lamer than magic?

144
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,484
魔术才不逊勒
Magic's not lame.

145
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:50,374
我不明白  我是说
I don't get it. I mean...

146
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,314
这逊吗
Is this lame?

147
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:54,314
巴尼  不要
Oh,barney,no,no.

148
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,744
我们说过了  不许再在桌子上变火花
We said no fireballs at the table.

149
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:57,984
你到底是有什么问题
What the hell is wrong with you?

150
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,714
我们周围都是酒精  老兄
There's alcohol in here.

151
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:00,984
-巴尼  -我
-Barney... -I...

152
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,014
我们已经谈过这点了
We've talked about this.

153
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:03,024
你违反了消防安全规范
It's a fire code violation.

154
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,394
我知道  但是是泰德先惹我的
Yeah,but ted provoked me.

155
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:06,784
不  你现在得接受处罚
No,no,you are on a time-out.

156
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:11,694
-坐到那儿去  -但...  -过去
-Go sit over there. -but... -go!

157
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,794
不管怎么说  我就是不明白
Anyway... I don't get it.

158
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:15,204
她现在应该要喜欢上我了才对
She should be into me by now.

159
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,844
你能做到的  泰德
You know,you can do this,ted.

160
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,114
我原来说我不再咬指甲了
I said that I would stop biting my nails,

161
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:20,974
瞧  耶!
And kablam-ey.

162
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,144
这是个挑战
It's just a challenge.

163
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,844
当你用你的裸臀对着别人的脸的时候
It can't be easy to woo someone

164
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:26,374
想打动她  可不是这个容易的事情
While you're sticking your naked butt in their face.

165
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,384
对狒狒来说  它们就喜欢这个
Works for baboons.

166
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,424
这就是传说中的"展示"
It's called "presenting."

167
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,024
我就剩下四个疗程了
I got four sessions left.

168
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,264
肯定有什么方法是我还没发掘到的
Ther-there's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.

169
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,994
你是没有办法把"不行"变成"行"的  泰德
You can't turn a "no" into a "yes," ted.

170
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:39,954
这是不可能的
Can't be done.

171
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:40,664
那不一定  巴尼
I don't know,barney.

172
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,724
我的意思是  有时候坚持是有回报的
I mean,sometimes persistence pays off.

173
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,594
我后来就说了"行"的啊
I said "yes" eventually.

174
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,104
胡说  你才没有
No,you didn't.

175
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,734
你说的是  "不行  我们不能这样  我们是朋友"
You were like,"no,we can't,we're friends.

176
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,204
-这会破坏了我们这个小团体的气氛  -我指泰德
-It would mess up the dynamic of the group." -to ted.

177
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,144
好吧(巴尼也追过罗宾)
Oh,righ

178
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:52,464
等等
Wait a second.

179
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,974
慢着  我想到了
Wait a second,i got the angle.

180
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,134
先生  请不要冲着我喊
Sir,please don't yell at me,

181
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,204
因为如果有人冲着我喊的时候
Because when people yell at me,

182
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:59,554
我会忍不住想哭
I have a tendency to start crying.

183
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:00,914
请不要这样做
Please don't do it.

184
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,684
艾比  我以前就告诉过你
Abby,i've told you before. please.

185
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,554
如果他们对你无礼的话  就把电话挂了
When they're rude to you,hang up the phone.

186
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,324
加油
go on,

187
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,864
你能做到的  把电话挂了
You can do this,hang up.

188
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,824
艾比  挂掉它
abby,Hang it up.

189
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,594
我实在没有时间浪费...(电话的声音)
I am too busy to waste my time...

190
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,564
我很抱歉  我真希望
I'm sorry,i just wish

191
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,054
这些病人能对你仁慈一点
That some of the patients would be nicer to you.

192
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,994
那个接待
The receptionist.

193
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:21,574
那就是我的突破口
That's my way in.

194
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,644
我喜欢这主意
I like this.

195
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:24,304
可以勾引那个接待员
Seduce the receptionist.

196
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:25,744
这个计划相当不错
That's a great plan.

197
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,074
这不是我的计划
That's not the plan.

198
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,744
-而且这对我和丝戴拉能起到什么帮助  -谁?
-And how would that help me with stella? -who?

199
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:32,554
我有计划了
Here's the plan

200
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,754
你好啊  给你
hi. here.

201
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,684
我半路停下
I stopped--

202
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,394
你好  我半路停下买咖啡
Hi,i stopped for coffee

203
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,324
然后我想...  我也许可以给你带点什么
And i... and I thought I'd grab you something.

204
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,684
谢谢  你太好了
Oh,wow,thank you,that's so nice.

205
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,394
你就像个骑士
You're like a knight.

206
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:52,604
-我该叫你泰德爵士  -你说什么
-I should call you sir ted. -what?

207
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,164
没什么  没什么
Nothing. nothing.

208
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,274
真的很傻
It's really stupid.

209
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,964
姿曼医生  泰德来了
Um,dr. zinman,ted's here.

210
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,374
谢谢  谢谢  艾比
Thanks. thanks,abby.

211
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:05,004
现在我们就等着吧
And now we wait.

212
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,054
相当确定的是
And sure enough,

213
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,914
在第七阶段  她以全新的方式看我
By session seven,she saw me in a whole new light.

214
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:13,354
-我就要违反我的原则了  -尽管违反吧
-Okay,i'm about to break my big rule here. -break it.

215
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,124
好的
Okay.

216
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,164
艾比和她的教友
Abby goes bowling

217
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,494
每周三晚上都会去打保龄
With her church group every wednesday night...

218
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:21,664
她是真想约你  但是她害羞
and she really wanted to invite you,but she's too shy.

219
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:24,834
艾比是...?
Abby is...?

220
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:27,504
我的接待员
My receptionist.

221
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,234
那天你给她带咖啡了
You really made quite an impression on her

222
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:30,704
给她留下的影响很深
With the coffee the other day.

223
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:35,134
-我的意思是她不停地谈到你  -是艾比啊
-I mean,she has really not stopped talking about you.-oh,abby.

224
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,514
我还以为你说艾伦呢
I thought you said "alan."

225
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,874
-但是刚才你问我  艾比是...?  -是的
But you just said,"abby is...?" right.

226
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,924
你说的对  我以为我说的是艾伦
Right,i thought I said "alan."

227
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,684
谁是艾伦
Who's alan?

228
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,054
谁是艾比
Who's abby?

229
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:53,694
-我的接待员  -回答正确
-My receptionist. -exactly.

230
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:58,664
-怎么会这样  -泰德
-What is happening? -ted.

231
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:00,994
你只要想做你自己就行了  不要耍花招
You just got to be yourself,no more gimmicks.

232
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,604
你说得对  不要耍花招
You're right,no more gimmicks.

233
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:04,634
再来最后一个花招
One more gimmick.

234
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,404
你知道她的架子上有什么吗?
You know what's on her shelf?

235
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,374
励志书  《我的力量》
That self-help book the power of me.

236
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,384
我知道  我知道  但是我觉得
I know,i know,but I thought

237
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:13,744
如果我读了那本书  我就有新话题和她讨论了
If I read it,maybe we'd have something new to talk about.

238
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,474
真是一本不错的书
It's actually a great book.

239
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,124
它交给我完整记忆的力量
It taught me the power of complete memory.

240
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,454
我能借你的书看一下吗
Can I borrow your copy?

241
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,364
我不记得放在哪了
I left it somewhere. i forget.

242
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:27,564
你好
Hi.

243
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,064
泰德・莫斯比  预约姿曼医生
Ted mosby for dr. zinman.

244
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:32,104
你好  泰德  我会转告的
Hi,ted. I'll let her know.

245
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:36,264
用心灵感应?
Telepathically?

246
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:38,544
真有意思
That's funny.

247
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,274
这主意不但有意思而且很聪明  太棒了
That's funny,smart,and great.

248
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,114
很抱歉  我迟到了
I am so sorry that I am late.

249
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,744
我每天好像只有两分钟的午餐时间
I have,like,two minutes for lunch everyday.

250
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,374
-太疯狂了  -是的  我能理解
-It's crazy. -yeah,i understand.

251
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:50,114
我刚才看了看那个旧的书架
I was just,uh,checking out the old bookshelf here.

252
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,414
原来你也读《我的力量》
I see you've read the power of me.

253
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,444
-真有意思  -你说什么  不不
-It's funny... -what? oh,no.

254
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:57,514
你弄错了  我从来不读那种垃圾
No,no,no,no,no,i would never read that piece of crap.

255
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:58,624
大概是哪个病人落下的
Some patient left it here.

256
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:00,494
谢天谢地
Oh,thank god.

257
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:02,164
你说的太对了
I couldn't agree more.

258
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,034
那绝对是垃圾
That's total crap.

259
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,734
我看见有人坐地铁时看那本书
I see people reading that on the subway

260
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,434
我就想冲他喊  "找点事做吧  伙计!"
And I just want to shout,"get a life,people!"

261
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,894
-泰德  我找到你的书了  -什么
-Ted,i found your book. -what?

262
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,074
你的那本《我的力量》
Your book the power of me.

263
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:12,504
一定是不小心掉进垃圾桶了
I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.

264
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:13,674
什么  这...这不是我的
What? no,that's... that's not mine.

265
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:14,924
我从来没见过它
I've never seen that before in my life.

266
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,924
才怪  我刚看到你在大厅还读呢
No,you were reading it in the lobby.

267
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,684
不可能  你看错人了
Wha-- no,you have me confused with someone else.

268
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:19,844
不会的  看这里
No,no,look right here.

269
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,084
"泰德・莫斯比私人藏书"
"from the personal library of ted mosby."

270
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:24,754
是你吧
That's you.

271
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,494
泰德  我不得不说
Ted,i hate to say this,

272
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,524
是时候去搞那个接待员了
But I think it's "nail the receptionist" time.

273
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,094
我可不去搞那个接待员
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.

274
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,094
泰德  每个男人从小的梦想
Ted,every little boy wants to grow up

275
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,304
就是搞上一名医生或者律师
To nail the doctor or the lawyer.

276
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,654
总得有人来眷顾一下接待员吧
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.

277
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,264
我喜欢的是丝黛拉
No. I like stella.

278
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,904
我听不下去了  泰德
Okay,i'm gonna stop you right there,ted.

279
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:46,164
你的小美人丝黛拉  有些美中不足
Your little stella is not so perfect.

280
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:47,244
什么意思
What do you mean?

281
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,014
我特意去诊所
I went down there

282
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:52,584
想亲眼目睹一下她的风采  是真的
And checked her out for myself. yeah.

283
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,404
在那过程中
And while I was down there,

284
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,554
我发现了一个秘密
I discovered that she had a secret,

285
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:01,024
天大的...耸人听闻的秘密
A terrible... terrible secret.

286
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:02,894
是什么
What? what is it?

287
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,874
稍候  我尿急
Hold on,i gotta pee.

288
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:14,444
我回来啦
Okay,i'm back.

289
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,284
最近工作怎样
What's going on at work?

290
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:17,714
到底是什么秘密?!
What's the big secret?!

291
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:18,744
好吧
Oh. oh,right.

292
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,714
我要预约姿曼医生
Hi,i'd like to see dr. zinman,please.

293
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,084
请问有什么具体事宜
Sure,what's it regarding?

294
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:23,094
我只是想看看她
Oh,i just want to see her.

295
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:25,524
目睹一下  看看她的相貌
Want to look at her,see what she looks like.

296
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:27,564
我...我不明白
I- I don't understand.

297
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:28,594
抱歉  我是否不小心

先生  请不要吼我

但是  接下来的对话纯属意外

That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

319
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,204
不可能
That's not real.

320
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:25,254
是啊  这是我编出来的
You're right,ted. I'm just making that up.

321

我知道  谁会对毛发感兴趣呢

你把我倒数第2次的机会给弄砸了
