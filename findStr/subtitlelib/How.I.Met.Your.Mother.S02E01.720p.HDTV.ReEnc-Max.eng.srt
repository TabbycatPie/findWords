1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,500
Ted:Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,640
It was June of 2006,and life had just taken
an unexpected turn

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,630
Dad,Dad, can't you just skip ahead
to the part where you meet Mom?

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,340
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,690
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,190
It's all part of the story.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,390
Could I go to
the bathroom??

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,760
No.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,750
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,450
For me, it started out great

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,620
In fact, day one was amazing.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,320
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,040
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life,

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,400
your uncle marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,580
marshall: So that's it?

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,230
We're breaking up?

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,460
Marshall,I'm sorry.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,440
I just...

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,150
I just need to go to san francisco and do this art program and-and figure out who I am outside of us.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,550
And the only way that I can do that is if...

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,320
if we don't talk for a while.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,190
For a while.

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,420
Try never,okay?

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,290
You walk out that door,and we're done.

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,070
You're never going to hear my voice again.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,360
I should call her.

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,780
No,no.
Ted it is--

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,550
if you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.

29
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,920
Now,listen,whenever you feel like calling her,you come find me first.

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,690
And I will punch you in the face.

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,820
You're a good friend,ted.

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,990
So,did you hear the big news?

33
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,100
You mean how lily and marshall broke up,

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,340
and lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night,yeah,I think he knows.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,950
Oh,my god.

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,300
I-I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,250
Wh-- what happened?

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,230
Well,she left.

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,040
And I don't even know if she's coming back.

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,170
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

41
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,460
Bro,I am so sorry.
Thanks.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,290
I know it must be tough,

43
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,630
but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better,but will actively excite you?

44
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,990
Sure.

45
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,320
For the first time,ever,the three of us are single at the same time.

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,020
I've dreamed about this day,boys,and it's going to be legendary.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Together,we will own this city.

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,930
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,we'll be there.

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:27,630
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking,we will be there.

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,300
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo,

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,780
sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,"What's up,new york?

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,760
" We will be what is up new york.

53
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,250
Gentlemen,we are about to embark on...

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
aw,man,you guys did it,didn't you?

Proudly Presents

57
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,000
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning...

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,060
and love is ending,the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

59
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,730
For one thing,you spend most of your time in bed.

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,700
your friends can't stand to listen to you.

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,850
He's so ticklish.

62
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,220
It was a really beautiful song.

63
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,800
So...

64
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,590
stupid,man.

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,270
and you never seem to wear pants.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,180
hey,marshall.

67
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,720
Hey,ted.

68
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,850
You hungry?

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,610
What's the point?I could eat some food.

70
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,000
It's just going to leave me.

71
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,410
Well,at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,980
Come on,it's sunday.It's pancakes day.

73
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,430
Lily always made the pancakes.

74
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,750
God,I loved her pancakes.

75
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,280
So soft.

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,730
So warm.

77
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,250
So perfectly shaped.

78
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,450
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

79
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,930
Come on,you got to eat something; what can I get you?

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,710
Beer.

81
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,790
No,that's what you had for dinner.

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,090
Fine.

83
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,750
Then I'll just have leftovers.

84
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,980
Barney: So,he stays home all the time not getting laid?

85
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,210
No,see,that's what you do when you have a fiancÃ©.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,620
He should be down here celebrating.

87
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,020
He's free.

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,240
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

89
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,160
You should write and illustrate children's books.

90
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,880
You know what marshall needs to do.

91
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,740
He needs to stop being sad.

92
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,280
When I get sad,I stop being sad and be awesome instead.

93
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,970
True story.

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,140
It's only been a month.

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,640
He just needs to go at his own pace.

96
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,930
Anyway,lily's the one who caused this whole mess.

97
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,340
Hey,cut her some slack.She's our friend,too.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,310
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

99
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,590
Figure out who she is?

100
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,540
Yeah,she should call me; I got a whole list.

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,570
She's selfish.

102
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,580
She's immature.

103
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,170
She'S...

104
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,490
What?

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,220
God,your eyes are so blue.

106
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,980
Aw,teddy bear.

107
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,250
oh that's A...

108
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,790
yeah,it was hard to feel too bad.

109
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,440
I was dating the woman of my dreams,and things were going great.

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,690
Well,for the most part.

111
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,860
So,I found her shampoo.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,690
I guess she left it here.

113
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,640
It smells like her.

114
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,400
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

115
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,100
Somehow,erotic and comforting all at the same time.

116
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,780
That's my shampoo.

117
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,920
Oh,sorry.

118
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,850
Mmm,I thought he'd never go to sleep.

119
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,880
Already?

120
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,500
He's calling her.

121
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,690
I don't hear any-- he's calling her.

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,670
No.

123
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,850
Okay,you're right,I won't call her.

124
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,260
I will not call her.

125
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,420
Well,I called her.

126
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,810
And get this,she changed her number.

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,820
What,like I'm going to stalk her,or something?

128
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,720
Like she's so special.

129
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,860
Like she's the only lily aldrin out there.

130
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,700
'Cause there are four others in the san francisco area alone,

131
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,620
and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.

132
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,080
Does he know I'm in here?

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,530
Yeah,hey,robin.

134
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,150
Anyways,one of the lily aldrins said...

135
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,650
this has to stop.

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,340
Ted,we just started dating.

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,310
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,and yet somehow,we have a baby.

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,850
He can't feed himself.

139
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,010
He cries a lot,he keeps us up all night.

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,690
Have you tried breast-feeding?

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,280
Nailed it!

142
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,710
Look,they were together nine years.

143
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,510
It's only been a month and a half.

144
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,310
He just needs to go at his own pace.

145
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,720
He slept on our floor last night,ted.

146
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,480
He watched a scary movie.

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,760
It is time for some tough love.

148
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,630
We need to get him out of that apartment.

149
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,940
He needs fresh air.

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
He needs sunshine.

151
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,990
Mmm,sunshine.

152
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,710
Gentlemen,please welcome to the stage,sunshine.

153
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,810
All right,I really don't think this is going to help.

154
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,190
Do you know why you're not over lily yet?

155
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,320
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.

156
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,880
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs; it's a scientific fact.

157
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,470
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,450
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with lily'S.

159
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,230
There are a lot of them.

160
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,280
Well,they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.

161
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,670
Now,this journey may take as many as a million boobs,so we begin here tonight,my friend.

162
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,340
Two at a time.

163
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,720
Those count as four.

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,700
This is fun right?

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,840
We're outside,it's a beautiful day.

166
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,220
The indians are winning.

167
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,810
I got to admit,it is really nice to be outside.

168
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,160
Yankee fans,please turn your attention to the diamond vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.

169
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,530
Oh,no.

170
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,640
it's all a big lie!

171
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,620
She's just going to break your heart.

172
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,190
you can drag me out of here,but she has no soul!

173
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,940
We've tried everything-- baseball,strippers.

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,020
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

175
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,610
I think he's beyond repair.

176
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,460
See,this is the problem with guys.

177
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,180
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.

178
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,880
Oh,and what's your prescription,dr.Estrogen?

179
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,650
Eat haagen-dazs and watch love actually,till your periods sync uP.

180
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,170
yeah,that's the stuff.

181
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,530
Oh,my god.

182
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,210
How long have you been doing this?

183
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,390
Well,my dad taught me to me shoot when I was a kid.

184
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,090
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed,I come here,and it reminds me that...

185
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,940
guns are fun.

186
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,890
um,you know,ted is kind of against guns.

187
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,040
And that's why ted's never going to find out about this.

188
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,390
Whoa,that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun,didn't it?

189
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,330
No,I-I just mean,please don't tell ted.

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,180
You want to try?

191
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,470
Only hell yeah.

192
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,580
Oh,yeah,yeah,this is what I needed.

193
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,700
I felt so powerless this whole time,but this...

194
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,360
this is power.

195
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,820
This is...

196
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,340
I should of mentioned the recoil.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,670
I got to hand it to you,when he got home,marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?

198
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,570
'Cause I was actually,like,three days away from suggesting that.

199
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,970
Sometimes,all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.

200
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,660
yeah,yeah!

201
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,960
Well,congratulations.

202
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,150
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.

203
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,710
You win.
Oh,what do I win?

204
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,130
I'll tell you what you win: I'm taking you away this weekend.

205
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,210
You are?

206
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,040
That's so nice.

207
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,690
Yeah,my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in montauk,oh,it's really romantic.

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,960
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

209
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,090
Wow,must be a nice house,I've seen pictures of your uncle.

210
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,150
This is going to be so great.

211
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,950
We'll finally get some time alone.

212
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,430
Are you sure marshall's going to be okay with this?

213
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,040
Yeah,absolutely.

214
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,870
Dude,I'm doing much better.

215
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,530
In fact,take my car.

216
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,520
Really?
Yeah.

217
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,490
Hey,thanks...

218
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,430
and,hey,if you need anything day or night,just call me-- you know what,please don't call me.

219
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,950
What?What's wrong?

220
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,680
It's,uh,lily's credit card bill.

221
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,630
She must have forgotten to switch her address.

222
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,020
So?

223
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,920
So,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in san francisco.

224
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,260
No.No,no good can come from looking at this.

225
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,530
You've made too much progress already.

226
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,080
I know but I just,maybe the-- no!

227
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,640
You're going to thank me for this.

228
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,420
You're a good friend,ted.

229
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,160
August 5th,one charge-- tickets.

230
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,060
To what?

231
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,280
George clinton and the p-funk all-stars.

232
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,420
August 10th,one charge: Tennis emporium.

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,950
August 18th,two charges: Mario's bistro and,get this,pet palace.

234
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,410
You guys see what this means,right?

235
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,790
Wow,mario's bistro.

236
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,880
What a perfect place to whore around.

237
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,920
Only the best for my little lily pad.

238
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh,funk legend george clinton,

239
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:49,500
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me onstage to dance with you courtney cox-style.

240
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,850
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.

241
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,670
You know,marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years,

242
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,840
but I didn't do it,because I never truly loved him.

243
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,240
I got you a gift.

244
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,330
A ferret.

245
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,080
Oh,I'll buy it some food next door at the pet palace.

246
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,040
Oh,I've always wanted one,but marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.

247
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,120
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.

248
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,060
It was.

249
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,440
I love you,funk legend george clinton.

250
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,380
I love you,too,lily.

251
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,770
That's right,marshall,she's all mine.

252
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,760
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

253
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,340
that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

254
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,020
Yeah,why are you afraid of ferrets?

255
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,890
They're adorable.

256
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,870
Because,robin,they're like fuzzy,tube-shaped rats.

257
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,810
Plus,those charges are from,like,a month ago.

258
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,480
Exactly.

259
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
For new charges,you have to go to her online account.

260
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,550
You can see credit card activity from,like,two hours ago.

261
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,820
But,you know,don'T.

262
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,600
Why do you talk?

263
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,410
Why do you talk?!

264
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,160
He needs her password.It's not like he has her password.

265
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,370
Ooh,this is good,he has her password.

266
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,570
There's a charge from earlier today: The kellett hotel on 5th.

267
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,790
I don't believe this.

268
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,580
Lily's back in new york.

269
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,170
I can't believe this.

270
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,150
Lily's in new york?

271
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,740
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back,she'd call me.

272
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,030
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.

273
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,510
This has been "holding it together"?

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,420
Okay,you know what?I'm calling her.

275
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
No.
Ted,give me the phone.

276
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,960
You're not calling her,this changes nothing.

277
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,790
You,come here.

278
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,680
Look,while we're away this weekend,can you keep an eye on him,make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

279
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,420
You want me to babysit him?

280
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,740
20 bucks.

281
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,660
An hour.

282
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,870
And money for pizza.

283
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,630
Uh,yeah,how about you do it for free or every time we hang out,you have to watch this?

284
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,550
Come here.

285
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,460
My little blue-eyed baby,baby lips.
Ooh,ooh,sugar,sugar...

286
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,650
okay,I'll do it!Stop being a couple.

287
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,510
Marshall.

288
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,680
Marshall,marshall!

289
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,640
Ted,I know I shouldn't do this,but I have to!

290
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,910
You call her we were together for nine years!

291
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,870
And everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi...

292
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,340
hello,lily aldrin's room,please.

293
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,250
Thank you.

294
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,880
Hang up now.
Ted,I can't hang up now.

295
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,050
The missiles are in the air,and I know that you don't approve.

296
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,110
Hello.

297
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,010
Uh,a guy answered.

298
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,680
There's-there's a guy in her room.

299
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,380
I'm going down there.

300
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,180
Barney: Dude,you can't do that.

301
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,400
Have to go down there,and I have to tell her I love her;

302
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,130
I have to beg her to take me back,even if I have to get down on my knees.

303
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,430
Marshall,you can't do that.

304
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,570
Oh,really,why not?

305
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,960
Ted: 56 days.

306
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,590
That's how long it took me to get right about here.

307
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,060
Because you're pathetic!

308
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm sorry,but right now,you are not marshall.

309
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,480
You are the miserable,whining,shampoo-sniffing ghost of marshall,

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,130
and frankly,a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like lily.

311
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,110
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line?

312
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,070
Marshall.

313
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
The real marshall.

314
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,850
But if you go down there right now like this,you're going to blow it for him,and he's never going to forgive you.

315
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,620
Of course,whatever I say,you're just going to do the opposite,so have a great weekend.

316
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,240
Good luck screwing up your life.

317
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,600
Come on,robin.

318
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,770
is it still okay if we borrow the car?

319
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,550
Bold.

320
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,690
Bold to go for the car.

321
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,010
What?

322
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,220
I didn't say a thing.

323
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,130
You think I was too hard on him.

324
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,690
I didn't say a thing.

325
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,030
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.

326
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,370
You're the one who said "tough love.

327
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,970
" Yeah,tough love,not "hand the guy a noose.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,620
" Oh,but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?

329
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,010
Yeah,he told me.

330
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,350
So you're a gun nut?

331
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,340
No,I'm a gun enthusiast.

332
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,350
Do you know how many people are killed each year the second amendment protects my right to bear arms...

333
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,480
all right,all right,all right.

334
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,770
I was too hard on him.

335
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,170
A little.

336
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,780
I'm going to call barney,see how they're doing.

337
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,410
go for barney.

338
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,610
Oh,hey,where are you guys?

339
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,400
We're at a fundraiser,helping young women raise money for community college.

340
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,720
Strip club,nice.

341
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,200
Is marshall okay?

342
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,710
yeah,he's here and he's great.Uh,hang on.

343
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,810
Marshall?

344
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,950
Tell ted that--

345
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,290
Already?

346
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,870
What?What uh-oh?

347
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,430
He's gone.

348
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,440
You lost him?

349
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,520
I can't believe this.He's going to go down to that hotel.

350
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,250
Crap,you're right.

351
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,900
Okay,okay,here's the plan,here's the plan.

352
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,900
You go down to the hotel and find him.

353
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,100
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.

354
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,980
On three.One,two...
barney!

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,620
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

356
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,210
A really nice one.

357
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,960
Hi,uh,could you tell me what room lily aldrin's in?

358
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,720
Marshall.

359
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,090
What happened?

360
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,590
Well,I went up to lily's floor,and I had this little speech in my head--

361
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,680
everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love,loyalty,respect.

362
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,770
I knocked on the door.

363
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,680
So you knocked out lily's new boyfriend?

364
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,870
Yeah.

365
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,490
It wasn't lily's boyfriend.

366
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,140
What?
Who-- who was it?

367
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,870
Ted: His name was joey adalian,although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

368
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,160
Apparently,earlier in the summer...

369
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,440
lily: Oh,this is so embarrassing.

370
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,670
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

371
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,020
I know,I know.I'm sorry.

372
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh,here we go.

373
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,570
No,that's-that's a button.

374
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,660
It was a button.

375
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,870
Do you,uh,take credit cards?

376
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Yes,I do.

377
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,250
So lily's not back in town,and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

378
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,430
Th-that's good news,right?

379
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,590
Yeah.

380
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
I don't know.

381
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,800
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.

382
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,210
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.

383
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,980
She was my whole life,man,and now she's-she's gone.

384
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,880
You know,first day of college,I showed up,I was so freaked out,and-

385
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:34,100
and I got up to my room,and there was my roommate,lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.

386
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,170
Had headphones on,big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.

387
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,370
Happy.

388
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,480
Confident.

389
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,770
Not afraid of anything.

390
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,900
That guy was you.

391
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,800
You before you met lily.

392
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,400
Ted?

393
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,140
Yeah?

394
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,270
I was high that day.

395
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:55,810
I was.

396
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,200
I was so high,I thought you were the dean.

397
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:08,490
Wh-what I'm saying is there's a version of you without lily,and it's not this.

398
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,070
You can't let lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.

399
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,900
Okay.

400
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,100
Okay,resolved.

401
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,050
Starting tomorrow,I'm going to start being okay.

402
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,800
Cheers.

403
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,790
But he wasn't,'cause that's not how life works.

404
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,800
The next day,he found one of her socks or something,and we were back to square one.

405
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,470
And then,one morning...

406
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,600
ted,I think you should see this.

407
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,540
Oh,no,what now?

408
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,910
Marshall,what are you doing?

409
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,720
It's sunday.

410
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,660
It's pancakes day.

411
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,510
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

412
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,500
so good.

413
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,010
So good.

414
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,180
But marshall had come back from the dead.

415
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Because while baseball,strippers,and guns can help,

416
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,780
the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
