1
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:04,435
<i>Kids,
Stella Zinman was the girl</i>

2
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:06,977
<i>I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with.</i>

3
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:10,571
<i>Until she left me at the altar,
smashing my heart to smithereens.</i>

4
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:15,677
<i>So when I ran into her seven months later,
there was only one way to deal with her.</i>

5
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:17,187
Stella!

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,484
- Great to see you!
- You, too.

7
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:21,217
And Tony!

8
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,296
- Hey.
- Hey! What a nice surprise.

9
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:26,091
"What a nice surprise"?

10
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:31,101
No, a nice surprise would be if a safe fell
from 40 stories and smushed them both.

11
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,500
I mean, you didn't let them have it?

12
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:36,006
No, we had a nice friendly chat,
then they went their way and I went mine.

13
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,702
Ted, you blew it. He blew it, right?

14
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:42,538
- Well played, sir.
- Bravo.

15
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,276
- What?
- You see, Robin, Ted played it cool,

16
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:47,545
which is exactly what
he should have done.

17
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:50,213
As a matter of fact,
I'd say on a scale ranging from...

18
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,152
And I kept this sweater of yours

19
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:59,254
and sometimes I just sit in the bathtub
for hours just, you know, just sniffing it.

20
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,890
...all the way to...

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,259
This is my new fiancée.
She's basically Stella,

22
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,703
except she's French and,
as you can see, she's got enormous cans.

23
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:20,482
I'd say you nailed it.

24
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:24,146
I'll do you one better.
You, sir, got Stella thinking.

25
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:28,123
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.
Did I choose the wrong guy?"

26
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,194
Give it a week, you'll get her back.

27
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:32,922
And her front.

28
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:37,126
Did you just feel that?
I think we just had a "what up" quake.

29
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,471
I don't want her back. Or her front.
I just want to move on.

30
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:45,736
And this was an important step
towards that. To moving on.

31
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,102
<i>And, you know, I really meant it.</i>

32
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,478
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,586
- I made a terrible mistake.
- I know.

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,750
- I'm a better person than you are.
- You totally are.

35
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,827
Let's get back together
and have way more sex than before.

36
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:05,088
Deal!

37
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,370
Hello, Ted.

38
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,814
No, come in. It's not weird at all.

39
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,826
Ted, Teddy, Ted, Ted, Ted.

40
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:41,427
I knew it was wrong to
steal somebody's fiancée.

41
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:45,832
I mean, I grappled with it. I was up nights.
And not for the good reason.

42
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:48,030
Well, sometimes for the good reason.

43
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,164
I mean, Stella and I hadn't
seen each other in five years,

44
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:54,301
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,
it was just fast and furious.

45
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:56,243
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.

46
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,406
- You see this bald patch?
- Yeah, Tony...

47
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,245
Anyway, we moved on.

48
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:03,218
Me, Lucy, Stella,
we were gonna move to LA.

49
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,414
I was gonna become a screenwriter.

50
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:10,085
Then we bumped into you,
and you just looked so sad.

51
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,093
Sad? No. I...

52
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:16,188
I think what you're calling sad
was actually a jovial nonchalance.

53
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,062
Ted, you looked awful, okay?

54
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,329
Like a little dachshund puppy
with a bad back

55
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:22,371
that's got to pull itself around on a cart.

56
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:23,530
Why are you here?

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,872
Look, Ted,
I know I can come across pretty tough,

58
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,776
but I can't bear to have hurt
someone the way I hurt you.

59
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,044
I think fate put me on that corner
to make this right.

60
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,178
Obviously, I can't fill that giant crater
that Stella left in your heart.

61
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:39,983
I've been dating. Like, a lot.

62
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,387
And then I heard you got fired.

63
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,289
I transitioned
into small business ownership.

64
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:47,454
- It's the backbone of the economy.
- No, it's not.

65
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,896
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,401
And I want to use that money
to make this right with you.

67
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,833
Tony is rich? Oh, Ted.

68
00:03:56,173 --> 00:04:00,337
Oh, Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,512
Tell me he wrote you a big, fat check.

70
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:07,845
A check so big it doesn't take
its shirt off when it goes swimming.

71
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,818
That is a big, fat check.

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,481
A check so big, if you had sex with it,
you wouldn't tell your buddies.

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,285
That is a big, fat check.

74
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:20,352
A check so big that when you sit next to it
on an airplane, you find yourself wondering

75
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:22,124
whether the check should
have bought two seats.

76
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:25,326
- That...
- Is a big, fat check!

77
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,562
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.

78
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,336
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.
- A job?

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,139
Every year, my family gives a lot of money
to Columbia University, so I got some pull.

80
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,509
How would you like to design...

81
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:41,641
<i>My heart leapt into my throat.
A new library? A new student center?</i>

82
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:45,517
...your very own curriculum
as a professor of architecture.

83
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,580
No, thanks.

84
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:52,250
What do you mean, "No, thanks"?

85
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:56,196
Ted, you would be a great professor, okay?

86
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,735
You are knowledgeable,
you're a good talker,

87
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,066
and when you need to,

88
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,470
you can grow a very handsome neck beard.

89
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,969
I'm not gonna be a professor.

90
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,271
Teaching architecture is what you do

91
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,006
when your career has totally bottomed out
and you need to pay the bills.

92
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,944
Hey, hey, hey! Small business owner.
Backbone of the economy.

93
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:18,986
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?
I'm gonna be just fine.

94
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:21,388
- New topic.
- Okay, new topic.

95
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,948
I just got a $200 speeding ticket today.

96
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,052
That sucks, dude.
You couldn't talk your way out of it?

97
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,791
- You can't talk your way out of a ticket.
- I've done it.

98
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,131
It was... What was it? It was 1998.

99
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,134
- So where's the fire?
- There's no fire.

100
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,807
Actually, you know, there is a fire
at this barbecue I'm headed to.

101
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:47,508
Nothing special. Burgers, ribs, brats.

102
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:51,211
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...

103
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:55,456
- Did you say brats?
- Yeah, brats.

104
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,820
My mom marinates them in Belgian beer
for two days. No big.

105
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:03,956
Funny thing was, I could've
sworn that one of those thick, succulent,

106
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,762
hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.

107
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,803
Weird. Anyways, what were you saying?

108
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:11,395
What... What did it say? The brat?

109
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:16,511
It said, "Property of Minnesota
State Trooper Jorgensen. "

110
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:20,882
You a...
You a brat man, Officer Jorgensen?

111
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:26,011
- You going to this address?
- Mmm-hmm.

112
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:29,249
Follow me and lean on the horn.
We're gonna be running some reds.

113
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:35,954
Well, duh. I would've done that, too,
if I'd have been going to a barbecue.

114
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:37,293
Damn, I was.

115
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,196
See, it's all about sizing up your opponent.

116
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:42,566
I could tell that the officer was a brat man,
because, well, he was out of breath

117
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:47,267
just from walking to my car
and he had mustard on his holster.

118
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,276
Marshall Eriksen!

119
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:53,007
Manipulating an officer of the law
with your sausage.

120
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:54,707
That is very hot.

121
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,320
You think I can't talk
my way out of a ticket?

122
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,220
You think I can't
talk my way out of a ticket?

123
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:06,124
I am Barney Stinson,
master of manipulation.

124
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,322
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,

125
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,365
I think I can talk my way out of a ticket.

126
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,833
Challenge accep... Wait for it.

127
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,335
What? I don't get it.

128
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,477
Oh, "Ted. " "Accep-Ted. "

129
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:24,678
I get it now.

130
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:30,112
- What now?
- You want to be an architect? Great.

131
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:33,312
Guy I went to private school with
wants a new house built.

132
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,615
Job's yours if you want it.

133
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,213
Tony, look, I don't need your help.

134
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,520
Here's what he's offering you.

135
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,325
That is a big, fat check.

136
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,705
Showtime.

137
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,207
License and registration.

138
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,575
Oh. Of course, Officer. Right away.

139
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,855
Sir, this is a gift certificate
for a custom-tailored Italian suit.

140
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,651
So, we done here?

141
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,654
$375!

142
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,819
- And he kept the gift certificate.
- Oh, man.

143
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,456
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him
to short-sheet him on the crotch.

144
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,000
You are bad at this, dude.

145
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,865
Whatever, Robin.

146
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,697
Like you've ever talked your way
out of a ticket.

147
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:29,538
Are you kidding me? Robin's a pretty girl.
Pretty girls don't get tickets.

148
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:32,442
I bet Robin's been pulled over tons
of times, never once gotten a ticket.

149
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:34,276
That is outrageous!

150
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,143
And factual.

151
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,943
License and...

152
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,557
Oh, honey. Oh, no, no, no, don't cry.

153
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,991
It's okay. No ticket for you.

154
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,586
Just go a little slower next time, okay?

155
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,426
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Okay.

156
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,326
Thank you.

157
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,869
Yeah!

158
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,970
Excuse me.
I think I left something in New Jersey.

159
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,437
Hey! How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?

160
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,880
Well, it started off great.

161
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,851
I want to design a house that celebrates
the landscape without overpowering it.

162
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:18,323
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright
designed Fallingwater in 1935, there's...

163
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:21,623
Yes, yes, that's all fine.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

164
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,788
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.

165
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,299
- Specifically, the laundry room.
- The laundry room?

166
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,893
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,

167
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,599
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.

168
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:39,236
I'm a man who likes to do his own laundry,
and sometimes, it gets messy.

169
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,544
- Messy?
- Messy.

170
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,413
Steel chains will dangle from the ceiling
at a height of 9 feet.

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,651
And that is where my laundry bags
will hang for three days and three nights

172
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,283
before I clean them.

173
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,655
Ted, it... It kind of sounds like
what this guy is asking you to design...

174
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,599
- It's a murder house.
- It is. It's totally a murder house.

175
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,594
You know, as a martial artist,
I'm trained to trust my instincts,

176
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,642
and my instincts are saying
this feels very good.

177
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,972
The steak is so rare.

178
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,217
Right? Right?

179
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,048
One final concern, soundproofing.

180
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,988
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.

181
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,151
I'll show you what I mean.

182
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,459
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,
and you tell me if you can hear me.

183
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,636
Tony, does something feel off
about this guy?

184
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,967
Yeah.

185
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,941
Off the hook! Bro, you are nailing this.

186
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,945
Ted, you can't design a murder house!

187
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,175
I'm not gonna design a murder house.

188
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,548
- Ted, you can't design a murder house!
- I'm not gonna design a murder house!

189
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,856
Bring it.

190
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,128
Officer, please, my wife is about
to have a baby! Her water just broke!

191
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,858
Where's your wife?

192
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,260
She took the other car.
This is Italian leather, so...

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,361
I... Come...

194
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,298
I'm sorry about that murder house thing.

195
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,640
That was my bad. That's on me.
So, new plan.

196
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:25,845
You, my friend, are gonna build
the Statue of Liberty a husband.

197
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,681
Now, I got some suction down at City Hall.

198
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,254
Tony, stop it!

199
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,688
I don't want your help, okay?
You don't have to do this.

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,224
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

201
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,816
Because.

202
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,292
When you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.

203
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,196
I can only imagine you feel the same way.

204
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay, well, let me put your mind at ease.

205
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,934
I don't want Stella back, okay?
She lied to me and left me at the altar.

206
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,673
What kind of person does that?
I'm better off without her.

207
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,915
She's all yours, buddy.

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,784
There you go. Load off my mind.

209
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,619
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>

210
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,421
<i>and I began to put this
whole business far behind me.</i>

211
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,756
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

212
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,759
Stella.

213
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,198
Tony broke up with me.

214
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,443
Wow. Okay, Tony broke up with you?

215
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,144
He said it was because
of something you said.

216
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,478
You got Tony to dump Stella?

217
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,713
I am very sorry, but I'm going
to have to insist that you bump this.

218
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,647
Let's... Let's talk out in the hall.

219
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,884
I'll be waiting.

220
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,729
So, why are you here?

221
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,164
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late, but here goes.

222
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,742
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.

223
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,969
We dated for a long time,

224
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,912
but then I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds,

225
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,984
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.

226
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,714
And for a long time,
I just focused on being a mother.

227
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,290
I forgot about Tony. I forgot about

228
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,792
the very idea of being in love.

229
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,463
And then you came along
and reminded me.

230
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,658
And I loved you for that.

231
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:29,102
I loved you so much, in fact,
that it was just shy of enough.

232
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,175
But I never stopped loving Tony.

233
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,913
Take him back, honey. He's sorry.

234
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,978
No, that's... That's not...
That's not what's happening.

235
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,452
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.

236
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,392
It was good seeing you, Stella.

237
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,257
Can you talk to Tony?

238
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,961
- What?
- He'd listen to you.

239
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,399
I mean, you changed his mind.
You could change it back.

240
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:02,269
- I know it's an awful thing to ask...
- Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.

241
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:05,706
Well, I don't know what else to do, okay?
I love him.

242
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:10,780
Oh, you love him. So, what? You're...
You're appealing to the romantic in me?

243
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,509
Is that your strategy?

244
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:16,348
Because that guy's gone.
You can't pull those strings anymore.

245
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,514
They're not attached to anything,
thanks to you.

246
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:21,586
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

247
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:24,820
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

248
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:29,127
Okay, you can do this. You can do this!

249
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,160
Oh, you can do this.

250
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,601
- License and...
- License and registration.

251
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,105
Excuse me?

252
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,735
I can only assume you need a license
to have a face that beautiful.

253
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,403
And that body?

254
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,277
I'm guessing something that explosive
has to be registered

255
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,578
with the proper authorities.

256
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:51,881
- Get out of the car.
- Why? Am I under arrest?

257
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,183
No.

258
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,093
But you're about to be under me.

259
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,828
No. False. Did not happen.

260
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,666
That's a line from a porno.
I've seen that porno.

261
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,933
Hell, I've made that porno.

262
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,133
When will you guys realize
that the only difference

263
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:15,406
between my real life and a porno
is my real life has better lighting?

264
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,448
- You're lying.
- I am not lying!

265
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,744
I swear on my mother.

266
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,047
I swear on Goliath National Bank.

267
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,849
I swear on my suits.

268
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,824
I am not lying.

269
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,417
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>

270
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,424
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

271
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,659
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

272
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,928
Is there anything
I can do to make this better?

273
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,027
No.

274
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,203
- Hello.
- Ted, it's me! It's Barney.

275
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,870
It's me!
I need your help and I'm in big trouble!

276
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,006
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
What happened?

277
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,944
I'm guessing something that explosive
has to be registered

278
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,248
with the proper authorities.

279
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:02,749
- Get out of the car.
- Why? Am I under arrest?

280
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,520
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.

281
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:08,826
You've had 15 moving violations
in the last three days. Get out of the car.

282
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:12,663
But, no, my wife's having a baby!
I have a sausage with your name on it!

283
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:13,758
Out of the car now!

284
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:18,566
I need you to come to Brazzaville,
New Jersey and bail me out.

285
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:20,341
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

286
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,308
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea of the kind
of the hardened criminals

287
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:24,971
they've got me in here with.

288
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,641
Are we gonna get our spray paint back?

289
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:29,843
Save me, Ted!

290
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,954
You want to do something for me?
I need a ride to New Jersey.

291
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,856
Okay. You'll pay for tolls, right?

292
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,294
I'm kidding.

293
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:44,426
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>

294
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,970
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail
and drove all the way home.</i>

295
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,732
Oh, by the way, Ted,
how's that girl you've been seeing?

296
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,366
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?

297
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:56,673
Oh, you mean Claudette?
Yeah, she's... She's fine.

298
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,443
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.

299
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,575
Ever! Bye, Stella.

300
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,611
Bye.

301
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:11,420
Ted, I'm so sorry again about everything.

302
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:15,490
- For what it's worth...
- I'll talk to Tony.

303
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,793
Really?

304
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:20,764
I want you to be happy, Stella.
I'll talk to him.

305
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,096
<i>And I did.</i>

306
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:26,266
<i>I don't remember what I said to him,
but I guess I changed his mind,</i>

307
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:30,813
<i>because the next day,
they flew to California.</i>

308
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,246
<i>Stella set up a new dermatology practice.</i>

309
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,878
<i>And against all odds, Tony found
some success as a screenwriter.</i>

310
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:41,151
<i>His movie, The Wedding Bride,
was a big hit.</i>

311
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:42,622
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>

312
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,627
Okay, but just tell me this. Why Tony?

313
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,892
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?

314
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,466
Like, what... What is it?

315
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,535
He's the one.

316
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,166
The one.

317
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,498
Yeah, I know it's kind of sappy, but, yeah.

318
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,572
Okay, I'm gonna say something out loud

319
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:10,880
that I've been doing a pretty good job
of not saying out loud lately.

320
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:14,122
What you and Tony have,

321
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:17,658
what I thought for a second you and I had,

322
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:21,261
what I know that Marshall and Lily have,

323
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:26,233
I want that. I do.

324
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,934
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen, and...

325
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,106
I guess I'm just...

326
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,208
I'm tired of waiting.

327
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:43,682
And that is all I'm going to say
on that subject.

328
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,653
You know, I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket.

329
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,954
Really?

330
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:54,557
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house

331
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:57,860
doing, like, 90 on this country road,
and I got pulled over.

332
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:00,093
So this cop gets out of his car.

333
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:02,397
He kind of swaggers on over and he's, like,

334
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:05,667
"Young lady, I have been
waiting for you all day. "

335
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:09,339
So I looked up at him and I said,
"I'm so sorry, Officer.

336
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,538
"I got here as fast as I could. "

337
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,512
For real?

338
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,484
No. It's an old joke.

339
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:22,613
I know that you're tired of waiting,

340
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,953
and you may have to wait
a little while more,

341
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,859
but she's on her way, Ted.

342
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,502
And she's getting here as fast as she can.

343
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:45,680
Bye, Stella.

344
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,106
Goodbye, Ted.

345
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:21,981
She tracked me down two days later
using a phone book.

346
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,849
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.

347
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,810
Hey.

348
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,719
- Hey, Lily!
- Lily!

349
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:30,950
You're back!

350
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:34,960
Barney, when you told me
that peanut butter and jam joke,

351
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:37,462
I was completely disgusted.

352
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,500
But I was in the shower this morning
and it popped into my head

353
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:45,061
and it actually made me laugh.
Peanut butter.

354
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:48,404
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.

355
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,477
Marshall's words, not mine.

356
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:54,070
- Well, it's good to see you again, Lily.
- Thanks.

357
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,410
So what have you been up to?

358
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,644
I'm going to an amnesia ward
with a bunch of photos of my "children"

359
00:20:58,753 --> 00:20:59,845
and a wedding ring.

360
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:03,219
I'm gonna find the hottest patient/my wife,
and we are going...

361
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:06,919
Okay, so that's good enough for tonight.
I gotta ease back into this.

362
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,586
See you tomorrow!
