who is she?

355

- I have no idea.

356
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,984
- We could run her through
the facial recognition.

357
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,352
- She had a mask on.

358

- Hey.

It was very good.

362
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,495
It was like mine.

363
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,130
It was made by somebody

364
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,299

of a speedster.

365
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:45,970

with access to tech and a lab.

When I designed V-9,

368
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,714
I was having trouble formatting
the extracellular matrix,

369
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,549
so I called a colleague of mine
at Mercury Labs

370
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,885
for some assistance,
Eliza Harmon.

371

this speed drug?

372
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,955

of information
compartmentalization.

374
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,692
I only gave her three
of the eight components

375
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,494
necessary for V-9's structure.

376
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,562

the full recipe.

377
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,865
- Unless she reverse engineered
her own V-9.

378

but that's way

379

- Yeah, vaguely.

409
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,444

it was somehow involved.

- How?
What did you have me working on?

411
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,414
- It's classified,

412
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,816
but let's just say it was
some kind of enhancement,

413
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,019

that my research was stolen.

00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:29,934
<i>Hey, she's got me</i>
<i>in the Pipeline!</i>

[glass shattering]

522
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,378
- What do you want?
- Where's the V-9, Caity?

523
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,880
I need a fix.

524
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,181
- Eliza, is that you?

525
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,816
- Oh,
Eliza's not here right now.

526
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,351
My name is Trajectory.

527
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,386
- Oh, why do the crazy ones
always name themselves?

528
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,090
- Look, Eliza, Velocity-9
is very dangerous, okay?

529
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,558
It made a friend
of mine very sick,

530
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,861
and he already had
the speed force in him.

531
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,262
Look, your cellular system--

532
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,830
- Enough!

533
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,566
You are boring me to death.

534
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,803
Hand over the V.

535
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,304
- I'm a physician.
I took an oath.

536
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,106
I can't give you anything
that will hurt you.

537
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,842
- Right,
so either hand over the V,

538
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,244
or the cat guy gets it.

539
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,312

542
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,661
There's nothing left.

543
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,364
- Hey, I was really hoping
you wouldn't make me do

544
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,666

Oh, well.

547
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,304

548
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,605
Wait.

549
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,576

- We have all the ingredients.

553
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,554

- Ah, latte for me,
and a Flash for you.

557
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,575
Wow, this guy even gets a drink
named after him.

558
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,710
- Yes, he does; he's saved
a lot of people's lives.

559
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,079
They just want
to show their appreciation.

560
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,481
- A little too much,
if you ask me.

561
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:28,085
- Why can't you see
what everyone else sees?

562
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,220
- A few years back,
I won the Dornfeld Award

563
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,655
for Investigative Reporting

564
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,624
for my story on corruption
in the mayor's office.

565
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:38,062
I investigated a man
that everyone loved.

566
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:41,365
The mayor was young,
telegenic, a former war hero.

567
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,201
He was voted in with
overwhelming popular support.

568
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,903
It was...
[chuckles]

569
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:50,441
But--but I knew that his
campaign was bought and paid for

570
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,675
by the mob.

571
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,845
- Okay, but not everyone
is a corrupt mayor.

572
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,780
- But I saw him for
what everyone else

573
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,749
was too blind to see.

574
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,384
Everyone wants a hero.

575
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,853
- Yeah, but in this case,
The Flash actually is one.

576
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,022
- Iris, Iris, it's our job

577
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,925
to ensure that people,
even heroes,

578
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,761
are held accountable
for their actions.

579
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,962

580
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,031
- [chuckles]

581
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,600
- So I'm guessing

582
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,669
on your list
of dating pros and cons,

583
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,705
being anti-Flash
is a major dealbreaker.

584
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,976
- Dating pros and...

585
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,845
did you think that this...

586
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,880
- Oh, what?
No, no.

587
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,782
No, forget what I said.
I get it.

588
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:37,021
You just wanted to talk
about the story some more...

589
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:41,425
To stall.
[chuckles]

590
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,327
Right,
because you're trying to get out

591
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,597
of writing this article
altogether.

592
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,499
- Scott, wait,
please don't leave.

593
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,736
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that this was...

594
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,972
- Why would you?

595
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:58,142
Excuse me.

596
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:13,557
- It's what you wanted.

597
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,259
Now let her go.

598
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,996
- How do I know
the two of you

599
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,799
didn't lace this with a sedative
to put me on my ass?

600
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,535
- We wouldn't do that.

601
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,403
- You can never
be too safe, right?

602
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,407
- No!

603
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,782
- Thanks for the fix, Snow.

604
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,820
- Get Barry.
- Are you okay?

605
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,559
- Well, good job
on the cell, Cisco.

606
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,560
- Jesse.

607
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,228
- What happened?
- Turn her on her side.

608
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,730
- Eliza shot her up with V-9.

609
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,398
- She's going into shock.
It's too pure.

610
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,899
- Stay with me, Jesse.
Stay with me.

611
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,434
- What do we do?

612
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,535
- We've got to get
the V-9 out of her system.

613
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,003
- She needs a blood transfusion.

614
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,206
The new blood will flush
the drug out of her system.

615
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,741
- What blood type is she?
- PZ negative.

616
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,076
- Yeah, that's not a thing
on this Earth, man.

617
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,578
- I'm a match.

618
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,249
- Jesse.

619
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,202
- Hey.

620
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,005
- What happened?

621
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,575
- We--you're fine.
You're--you're gonna be fine.

622
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,978
We got the drug
out of your system.

623
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,412
- Oh.

624
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,715
Looks like you
saved the day again.

625
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:50,087
- Look, honey,
I know that this isn't enough.

626
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,623
I promise you, though,

627
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,359
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

628
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:58,762
making it up to you for the--

629
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,430
for that terrible thing
that I did.

630
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,667
- Yeah?
- Yes.

631
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,569
- And how many
more terrible things

632
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,538
are you gonna do to protect me?

633
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,644
- What does that mean?

634
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,213
- I mean,
everything that you do

635
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,783
and everything
that you have done for me,

636
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,986
it's so dark,
and--and you don't even see it.

637
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,056
I mean, you didn't even
hesitate out there.

638
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,391
- Of course not.

639
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,959
I'm not going
to lose you, Jesse.

640
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,529
- Okay, but you just gave
that crazy speedster

641
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,066
everything she wanted
without even blinking,

642
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,534
without even thinking

643
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,603
what other lives
could be at stake.

644
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,405
- It is my job
to keep you safe,

645
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,040
to protect you;
that's my job.

646
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,709
That's all that matters.

647
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,444
- Well, maybe it shouldn't be.

648
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,854
- Caitlin, I know she was
your friend and all,

649
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,989
but homegirl has gone
cuckoo bird.

650
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,757
- Now she's out there
with more V-9.

651
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,860
- What she doesn't know is,
I put in micro tracker

652
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,061
in the drug.

653
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,562
- Hmm, that's a brilliant idea.

654
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,967
- You can run,
but you can't hide.

655
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,435
- I'm the one
to blame for all this,

656
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,936
so I need to help fix it.

657
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,938
- There's plenty of blame
to go around, Snow.

658
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,139
What's her location?

659
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,175
- Central City bridge.

660
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,110
- Why is she running
back and forth?

661
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,411
- Villains gonna vill.

662
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,280
- She's creating friction,

663
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,549
and at that vibration
and speed...

664
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,451
- What?
- Complete chaos.

665
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,920
She could destroy
that whole bridge.

666
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,288
- And everyone on it.

673
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,059
You won't get to her running
across the river.

674
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,195
- I will if I jump.

675
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,565
