20
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,620
Hello. I'm Freddie Highmore.

21
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,870
The following episode portrays our hope for the future,

22
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,910
a future where no one will have to wear masks

23
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,870
or take other steps to stay safe from COVID.

24
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,750
Until then, please protect yourself and others.

25
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,510
I'm Jordan Allen.

26
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,840
My first year in med school, I designed an ankle brace

27
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,140
that monitors extent of immobilization via a phone app.

28
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,550
When I licensed it to Bioventus,

29
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,600
I was able to pay off over half my student loans.

30
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,640
John Lundberg.

31
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,940
I've worked every summer since I was 16 at Camp Hope Heartland,

32
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,770
a summer program for kids with cancer in Des Moines,

33
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,900
where I grew up.

34
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,530
Asher Wolke.

35
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,860
Uh, when I was 18,

36
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,530
I left the Hasidic community that I was raised in.

37
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,450
I realized if there really was a God,

38
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,540
it had to be a cruel being that I felt nothing but contempt for.

39
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,960
That's also when I decided to go to med school,

40
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,130
and start dating men.

41
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm Olivia Jackson. I'm 25. From Chicago.

42
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,100
I play Ragtime piano alone in my apartment.

43
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,730
Is that interesting?

44
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,060
Will Hooper.

45
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,730
Technically, I'm a professional athlete.

46
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,570
Although in a sport nobody pays attention to,

47
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,320
and the stipend barely covers our training expenses,

48
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,860
but I'm on the US National Rowing team.

49
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,160
Men's Eight.

50
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,080
Hey, I'm Enrique.

51
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,290
I spent last summer in Costa Rica,

52
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,830
where I learned to surf, which I'm totally obsessed with now.

53
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,460
Uh, I had a pretty interesting encounter

54
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
with a saltwater crocodile.

55
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,920
I just thought it was a big...

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
Why are you wearing a swimsuit?

57
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,720
Oh, they're actually hybrid boardshorts.

58
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,560
I like to work hard,

59
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,890
and it's easier to do when you're comfortable.

60
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,020
Plus, I think the casual dress puts patients at ease.

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,910
And Dr. Lim said that the shorts were fine.

62
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,370
Hospital policy requires all residents to...

63
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,160
He's not a resident. He's a resident applicant.

64
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,460
One of six finalists for four openings.

65
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,420
Now, they'll be shadowing for two days.

66
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,840
Give them the grand tour, show them the ropes,

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,250
feel free to turn up the heat a bit.

68
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,880
See how they react under pressure.

69
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,090
You will be responsible for supervising them,

70
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,090
so I want your totally honest input

71
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,510
before I make any final decisions.

72
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,640
Those shorts...

73
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,350
Let's call them strike one.

74
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,520
Oh, and in addition to being an Olympian,

75
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,770
Will Hooper is a Rhodes

77
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,520
and graduated top of his class at Stanford.

78
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
He is very handsome.

79
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
He's very full of himself.

80
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,440
He's ranked first by every top program,

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,740
so whatever you can do to recruit him to ours, do it.

82
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,070
I can already give you my input on the sh...

83
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,530
Don't judge a book by its boardshorts.

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,340
You wanted to see me?

85
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,550
Good morning.

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,170
Sorry. Good morning.

87
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,510
What'd I do wrong?

88
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,430
Just wanted to check in.

89
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,680
See how the new role was coming along.

90
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,100
Honestly?

91
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,060
You could start our new supervisor-resident

92
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,560
relationship with a lie.

93
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,270
That's always fun.

94
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,900
Internal medicine is

95
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,730
boring.

96
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,400
Between smokers and obese diabetics,

97
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,320
seems like all I'm doing is protecting people from themselves.

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,620
As a surgical resident,

99
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,900
you never treated drunk drivers?

100
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,750
Or extracted random objects from guys'...

101
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
I get it. People are stupid.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,170
Not my point, but true.

103
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,630
Not the same adrenaline rush,

104
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,880
but internal medicine can be rewarding.

105
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,100
Given time, if you're patient.

106
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,680
Thanks.

107
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,520
That is not how I thought this meeting was gonna go.

108
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,480
I thought one of the nurses complained about me.

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,940
Wasn't just one.

110
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,820
And if it happens again,

111
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,360
this meeting will go exactly

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
how you thought it would.

113
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,830
Sorry.

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,000
I should've just canceled the appointment.

115
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,130
You were right.

116
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,590
Dizziness went away as soon as I stopped

117
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,340
drinking coffee and Red Bull all day.

118
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,800
No worries.

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,590
Can you lie flat on your back, please?

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah.

121
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,680
You get that scar in a fire?

122
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Sort of.

123
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,100
A homemade Roman candle when I was 12.

124
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,520
You'd be surprised

125
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,440
how many of us at the firehouse were pyros as kids.

126
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,190
I made a potato gun for my sixth-grade science fair.

127
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,650
Almost got me kicked out of school.

128
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,860
You'll have to come visit us sometime.

129
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,570
You'd fit right in.

130
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,620
You see something?

131
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,370
Don't talk. Just breathe normally.

132
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,250
You have a large tumor on the wall of your heart.

133
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,300
Cancer?

134
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,470
I don't know.

135
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,680
But you're definitely gonna need surgery.

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,350
As soon as possible.

137
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,240
I appreciate you letting me share your case with the whole class.

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,030
No problem.

139
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,820
I stopped being shy after the 100th time I had to do this.

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,780
I'll be using a version of Lejour's technique I've adapted.

141
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,200
We'll divide the breast into three pedicles,

142
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,870
and then redistribute the tissue

143
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,830
and insert saline implants to correct the tuberous breast deformity.

144
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,540
Why would you want breast implants?

145
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
You're beautiful.

146
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,550
And your breasts look fine

147
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,590
just the way they are.

148
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,420
No. No, they don't.

149
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,550
The base is constricted,

150
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,550
horizontal development is deficient,

151
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,220
and the nipple-areola complex...

152
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,470
- Murphy. - It's okay. He's right.

153
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,140
That's why I'm here.

154
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,230
Thank you.

155
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,600
I know that you're trying to be nice.

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,230
My friends and family have been telling me for years,

157
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,190
"You're beautiful just the way you are."

158
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,570
But I don't feel beautiful.

159
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,650
You're 17.

160
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,820
Every girl your age feels like that.

161
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,530
That can't be true.

162
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,990
Tuberous breast deformity is a rare condition.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,700
We're not going to debate

164
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,710
a personal decision the patient's already made.

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,040
I've been thinking about this since I was 13.

166
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,050
Every time I look in the mirror.

167
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm about to start college,

168
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,970
and there is no way that I'm gonna begin this new chapter

169
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,590
until I'm fixed.

170
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,890
Great.

171
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,600
You thinking median sternotomy or right thoracotomy?

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,350
I'm thinking I should finish my review of the imaging.

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,230
Sure. No rush.

174
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,570
Actually, there is a bit of a rush.

175
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,900
But you know what I mean.

176
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,450
So, newbies. What up? Where y'all from?

177
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,240
Like hometowns, or...

178
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,990
Med schools.

179
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,410
Why would I care where you grew up?

180
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,530
Stanford.

181
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,410
- Uh, NYU. - Harvard.

182
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,540
Preferred specialties?

183
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,370
Ortho. All the way.

184
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,420
Neuro.

185
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,540
I'm planning a dual specialty

186
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,500
in neonatal and pediatric oncology.

187
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,130
Impressive. Also unlikely.

188
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,630
I know, it's a ton of work,

189
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,050
but I'm pretty good at multi-tasking.

190
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,380
In med school, I did a combined MD/PhD...

191
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,050
- What's your mom do? - My mom?

192
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,600
Don't stall. Just answer.

193
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,680
She teaches high-school French.

194
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,390
Homemaker.

195
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,100
Surgeon.

196
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,730
Ouch. Dad?

197
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,560
Also a surgeon.

198
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,150
Double ouch. And yours?

199
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,360
Hasidic rabbi.

200
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,310
You've left the nest.

201
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,690
Actually, the... the whole forest.

202
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,820
And yours obviously works on Wall Street.

203
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,450
But not a trader.

204
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,910
I'm guessing... an M&A lawyer?

205
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,910
How'd you know?

206
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,080
She's read your resume,

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,370
researched your social media.

208
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,660
She's probably run a credit check, too.

209
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,540
And you're under 50, but wear Brooks Brothers button-downs.

211
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,960
Are you done yet?

212
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,380
Left thoracotomy

213
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,170
with a possible incision into the right atrium

214
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,210
and inter-atrial septum as needed.

215
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,230
Left atrial approach through Sondergaard's groove

216
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,510
makes more sense.

217
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,010
Not to me.

218
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,550
He's my patient.

219
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,100
But you're not a surgeon.

220
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,310
Which is why there is no reason for you to be grilling them,

221
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,190
or picking the approach.

222
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,810
Stop worrying about protecting your turf.

223
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,980
Stop stepping all over it.

224
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,230
You're looking at tests I did for my patient.

225
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,900
How am I stepping all over your turf?

226
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,320
I think what Dr. Browne is trying to say is,

227
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,740
given there's no perfect approach,

228
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,610
maybe it's best to defer to

229
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,570
the surgical department's recommendation.

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,120
Did he just mansplain?

231
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,500
Not at all. I... I was just trying...

232
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,120
So you're just gonna do it again?

233
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,290
No, I'm just trying...

234
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,790
Shut up.

235
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,380
We're gonna go in through a left thoracotomy.

236
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,880
Not my preference,

237
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
but it'll work.

238
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,340
What were you thinking?

239
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,840
You thought you'd impress me

240
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,260
by undermining the patient's confidence in my judgment?

241
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,180
I'm sorry. That wasn't my intent.

242
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,730
And you're supposed to be a mentor now,

243
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,310
modeling professional behavior,

244
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,400
not making it worse, Murphy.

245
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,190
She questioned your surgical plan.

246
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,230
I defended it.

247
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,530
How can we both be wrong?

248
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,610
I don't need you to defend me.

249
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,530
And I never wanna have a surgical debate in front of a patient.

250
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
We're not in front of the patient now.

251
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,250
The patient's breasts are small and a bit asymmetrical,

252
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,500
but no woman's breasts are perfectly shaped.

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,380
You're wearing Prada shoes and a Dolce & Gabbana blouse,

254
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
which cost more than most med students' rent,

255
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,010
so, clearly, you understand

256
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,050
your appearance has a tremendous impact on how people treat you.

257
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,270
There's a difference between nice clothes and a major surgery.

258
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,890
And I also understand the cosmetic surgery industry

259
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,020
is dominated by male physicians with a sexist bias.

260
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,030
I've invited you to observe as a learning opportunity.

261
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,280
So I'd suggest

262
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,990
less lecturing

263
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,950
and more listening.

264
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,830
We'll access the tumor via an incision

265
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,540
in the chest wall between your ribs.

266
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,840
It'll be an easier recovery

267
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,500
than if we opened your sternum.

268
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,170
Are you sure you don't want us to call your family

269
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,300
before we put you under?

270
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,130
Why? So they can freak out and worry?

271
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,640
I'd rather just give them the good news when it's over.

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,970
It is going to be good news, right?

273
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,430
With a bit of cardiac rehab and a positive attitude,

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,940
which I know you have,

275
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,480
you'll be back sliding down the fire pole in no time.

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,400
Our firehouse has stairs.

277
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,650
Bummer.

278
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,360
It's a social media group

279
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,820
where we all pretend to be ants.

280
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,070
Why?

281
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,700
Because ants don't care about politics, sports teams,

282
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,120
or anything else people get so savage about.

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,870
Male ants develop from unfertilized eggs,

284
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,040
which means they don't have a father and can't have sons.

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,210
But they do have grandfathers and can have grandsons.

286
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,300
Interesting.

287
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,380
And confusing.

288
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,840
Is it just me, or are those doctors watching us?

289
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,220
They're the new resident applicants.

290
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,930
They're here so Park, Claire, and I

291
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,180
can evaluate them for Dr. Lim.

292
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,560
So, why are they standing over there?

293
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,190
Park had a video chat with Kellan,

294
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,190
and I had a real lunch with you.

295
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,740
Shaun, you can't just have them stand there while you eat.

296
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,240
Part of being a good boss is being a good host.

297
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,370
You need to introduce them to people.

298
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,450
Like me. Right now.

299
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,120
Come here, please.

300
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,630
Dr. Allen, Dr. Lundberg, Dr. Guerin,

301
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,710
this is my girlfriend, Lea.

302
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,880
She runs the IT department now.

303
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,470
Okay.

304
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,010
Nice to meet you all. Please join us.

305
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,470
Shaun's been telling me all about you.

306
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,390
N... no. I haven't.

307
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,980
So, I hope Shaun's not being too hard on you.

308
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,520
No, he's been great.

309
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,150
And the case we're observing is really interesting.

310
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,440
We're correcting a 17-year-old girl's tuberous breasts

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,110
with saline implants.

312
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,740
Dr. Allen told Dr. Andrews it was unethical.

313
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
He got mad.

314
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,410
I didn't say it was unethical. I just...

315
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,500
I suppose I shouldn't have interfered.

316
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,830
Well, I don't know what a tuberous breast is,

317
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,750
but I think implants are way overrated.

318
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,340
That's because your breasts are excellent.

319
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,090
Thank you.

320
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,300
That's exactly my point.

321
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,800
Mine aren't huge,

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,220
but every guy who's ever seen them up close and personal

323
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,930
has been thrilled.

324
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,440
I definitely was.

325
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,980
I am thrilled by every part of your body.

326
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,740
Sorry. My bad. Total TMI.

327
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,610
I'm not even bothered by your adenoidal voice.

328
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,030
Except when you talk to your mom on the phone.

329
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,280
But I just put on headphones.

330
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,670
At least you'll know he'll be a totally honest boss.

331
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,220
The incision's extended superiorly

332
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,430
to meet the atriotomy,

333
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,600
- and then the inter-atrial septum is opened up. - Retractor.

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,100
A Carpentier retractor is used to visualize the mitral valve.

335
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,020
That will allow a clear view of the tumor.

336
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,310
Can we turn the channel?

337
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,400
Color commentary's getting a bit annoying.

338
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,820
With the right atrium opened obliq...

339
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,530
How's Team Browne? Any early standouts?

340
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,860
Jackson's a bit timid, but smart.

341
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,240
Wolke is definitely enthusiastic.

342
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,660
And your star recruit is...

343
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,580
pretty full of himself.

344
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,710
I'm looking for surgeons, and according to his recs,

345
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,380
he can dissect and suture like a pro.

346
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,460
I thought you were also looking for our input.

347
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,010
He's ranked first by every top program.

348
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,590
You really think they're all wrong and you're right?

349
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,100
So, what brings you all to the biz?

350
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,600
Had my ACL reconstructed in high school,

351
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,850
both my rotators in college.

352
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,020
I love the idea of fixing people,

353
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,820
helping them be the best they can be.

354
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,070
Surgeons are the ones with the God complex, right?

355
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,610
I have that.

356
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,660
I spent my life speaking Yiddish and studying the Talmud,

357
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
and not shaving the sides of my hair,

358
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,370
because someone up there supposedly cares.

359
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,630
Uh, but then I realized

360
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,460
no one's up there.

361
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,090
No one cares.

362
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,800
No benevolent higher power is going to save us, so...

363
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,760
we have to save each other.

364
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,680
Can you top that?

365
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,940
- Definitely not. - Try anyway.

366
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,360
You're obviously smart. You've got two degrees from Harvard.

367
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
My parents are Harvard alums, so...

368
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,570
I'm sure that helped me get in.

369
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,400
You're not gonna get hired by undermining your own...

370
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,740
Something went wrong.

371
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,280
Looks like they nicked a pulmonary artery.

372
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,080
No. If they had, Browne would be suctioning

373
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,290
instead of Lim reaching in with her hands.

374
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,130
What are they doing now?

375
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,630
Nothing.

376
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,170
We can't access the tumor

377
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,720
without compromising his entire cardiac outflow tract.

378
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,300
What about going in the way I suggested? The median sternotomy.

379
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,100
The tumor's too far back. We need to close him up.

380
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Proton beam radiation would be too toxic to the heart.

381
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,230
So is immunotherapy.

382
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,280
We can't access the entire tumor surgically,

383
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,360
and we can't kill it without killing his heart along with it.

384
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,700
What if we cut out the parts we can access

385
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
and try our luck with chemo on what's left?

386
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,200
IV doxorubicin and ifosfamide might slow the growth,

387
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,250
give him a few more months.

388
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,870
No, I'm not sending my patient home with just a few extra months.

389
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,210
It's better than nothing.

390
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,750
What about a transplant?

391
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,500
Not an option.

392
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,880
Heart tumors are a contraindication.

393
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,590
What if we transplant his own heart?

394
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,430
If we take it totally out of his chest,

395
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,390
we'd have access to the posterior heart.

396
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,510
We could excise the tumor,

397
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,680
fix the defect it left behind,

398
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
- and then put it back in. - Cool.

399
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Not cool.

400
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,190
At least with a normal heart transplant,

401
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,850
you'd be getting a healthy heart.

402
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,360
Her idea keeps the risk of removing the heart,

403
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,690
and adds the risk that the heart we'd be putting back in

404
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,440
has just been severely compromised

405
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,990
having had a tumor cut out of it.

406
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,160
He's young, and the part of his heart not infiltrated

407
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,820
with tumor is strong.

408
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,120
Do a cardiac MRA and see

409
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,500
if the tumor's infiltrated the coronary arteries.

410
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,580
If it hasn't, Morgan's idea could work.

411
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,130
I'll schedule it.

412
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,050
Dr. Murphy is dividing the breast parenchyma

413
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,970
into three pedicles.

414
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,140
Anyone know where this technique is derived from?

415
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Breast reduction surgery.

416
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,350
That's right.

417
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,980
And why would I use a breast reduction technique

418
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,230
to make the patient's breasts larger?

419
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,480
The technique frees up the tissue.

420
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,360
You can bring the pedicles together

421
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,400
to make the breasts smaller

422
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,490
or spread them out over an implant to make them larger.

423
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,320
Very good.

424
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,990
And now I'm going to turn the sound off.

425
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't worry. Nothing's wrong.

426
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,450
I just wanna talk about you behind your backs for a little bit.

427
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,670
So, first impressions.

428
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,580
Murphy?

429
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,880
I like Dr. John Lundberg.

430
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,130
I haven't even heard him speak yet.

431
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,550
He has the highest U.S.M.L.E. Scores.

432
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,430
And that's important to you?

433
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,050
Yes.

434
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,930
It shows he has a broad knowledge of medicine.

435
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,680
What is important to you?

436
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,890
Well, I'm more interested

437
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,810
in what they can do

438
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,770
with their knowledge,

439
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,020
which is why, so far, I'm most impressed with Jordan Allen.

440
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,990
No. No, you said she undermined you.

441
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,400
Which takes courage

442
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,450
and an assertiveness that will serve her well.

443
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,990
Then why did you tell her to stop lecturing you?

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,330
It's easier to teach an aggressive resident restraint

445
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,120
than a passive one to assert themselves.

446
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,460
What about you, Park? What's important to you?

447
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,510
I wanna know who I can stand to be around for 80 hours a week.

448
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,840
One thing I learned as a cop,

449
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,220
you don't really know a person

450
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,720
until you've had a few drinks with them.

451
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,600
LAD and circumflex look clean.

452
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,730
What's with the right coronary?

453
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,360
It looks narrowed at the origin.

454
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,820
It's a bit narrow, but looks like a normal variant.

455
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,150
Yeah, but it seems hazy,

456
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,530
like there could be some tumor infiltration.

457
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,950
What do you guys think?

458
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,290
- Us? - Yeah.

459
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,790
Come take a look.

460
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,210
I guess...

461
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,290
- It's angiogenesis of the left... - Stop.

462
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,880
Interrupting a female coworker

463
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,210
is almost as annoying as mansplaining.

464
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,470
This isn't a rowing race.

465
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,800
You don't always have to speak first.

466
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,140
I... do not love the interruption.

467
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,480
But...

468
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,810
I like the enthusiasm.

469
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,810
What were you gonna say?

470
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,780
First, um, I'm not sexist.

471
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,950
Of course not.

472
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,110
He's shifting from right to left dominant circulation

473
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,910
to feed blood to the tumor.

474
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,200
- Angiogenesis. - I doubt it.

475
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,870
Surgery already showed

476
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,540
his tumor extending to the right side, as well.

477
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,160
What were you gonna say?

478
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,290
The pulmonary artery is right behind that vessel.

479
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,880
It's causing radiographic scatter in this area.

480
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,800
The haze is just an artifact.

481
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,470
His arteries are clean.

482
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,180
I think she's right.

483
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,640
Your idea might just work.

484
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,360
If you invert the sutures

485
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,690
and bury them under the skin,

486
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,520
the scar will be invisible.

487
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,940
No one will ever know we were here.

488
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,570
Nice work, both of you.

489
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,870
Her BP's dropping.

490
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,700
Push fluids, start IV pressors. Check for bleeding.

491
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,160
She's in V-tach. Move in the crash cart.

492
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,000
No bleeding. No hematomas.

493
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,540
Charging.

494
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,460
Clear.

495
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Sinus rhythm. Her BP is stabilizing.

496
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,560
Get her to the ICU. I want post-op labs,

497
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,150
CTA chest, and full 24-hour cardiac telemetry.

498
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,440
We need to figure out what just happened.

499
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,870
She's stable,

500
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,950
but diffuse delta wave slowing.

501
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,830
Minimal brain activity.

502
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,500
An undiagnosed metabolic disorder could've caused

503
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,460
an adverse reaction to the anesthesia.

504
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah, but her pre-op labs were all normal.

505
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,970
It's gotta be some sort of hidden heart condition.

506
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,300
You're big on opinions.

507
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,930
How are you with ideas?

508
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,680
What would you do next?

509
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,720
I'd check train of fours

510
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
and reverse the paralytics with neostigmine.

511
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,400
If Dr. Murphy's right, she should wake up.

512
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,690
Smart. But risky.

513
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,320
The meds will stress her heart.

514
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,990
If Park's right, she could arrest again.

515
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,610
I saw a similar case last year. In Borneo.

516
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,570
You interned at a hospital in Borneo?

517
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,040
Uh, no. I, uh, volunteered at an orangutan rescue foundation.

518
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,080
Our guide, a local villager, fell out of a tree.

519
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,930
It was, like, 80 feet up.

520
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,500
How is falling out of a tree similar to a patient arresting

521
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,630
during breast reconstruction surgery?

522
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,190
Well, he broke his back,

523
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,560
but when we got him to the hospital,

524
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,760
I found he also had heart damage from rheumatic fever

525
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,140
and metabolic abnormality from iodine deficiency.

526
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,670
It's rare here, but it's common there.

527
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,030
We only realized it when we ran a nuclear profusion scan

528
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,260
of his entire body.

529
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,810
Good catch.

530
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,400
But a scan that extensive requires multiple radioactive tracers.

531
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
You think her heart could handle that?

532
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,590
Not tonight.

533
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll get consent from the mom.

534
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,970
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

535
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,090
Once we confirm atrial closure, we'll put the heart back in.

536
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,190
Dr. Lim will reconnect the aorta

537
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,750
and the superior venous connections,

538
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,860
while I connect the inferior.

539
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,240
During my sub-internship,

540
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,330
I assisted on multiple heart transplants.

541
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,390
Even sutured the atrial cuff in one.

542
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,040
I got to scrub in on a liver transplant once.

543
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,700
The... The patient died.

544
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,910
What'd you learn?

545
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,420
That bile duct leaks are a lot harder to detect than bleeds.

546
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,890
Good. Next time, I'd lead with that

547
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,700
instead of the patient's death.

548
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,670
Are you all done yet?

549
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,500
Why?

550
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,360
Dr. Park wants everyone to join him in the break room.

553
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm Alex Park.

554
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,410
I'm a former amateur martial arts competitor

555
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,040
who once thought it'd be fun to spar with a pro boxer

556
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,770
visiting my dad's gym.

557
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,310
And that guy was, uh, Mike Tyson.

558
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,210
Who's Mike Tyson?

559
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,700
He's a guy from The Hangover.

560
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,200
With the tiger and the tattoo on his face.

561
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,960
Nice. You've just revealed you're crazy and old.

562
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,240
I've seen the musical Wicked over 50 times.

563
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,020
The San Francisco tryout, Broadway, Chicago.

564
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,090
I've even seen a friend's boyfriend's niece play Glinda

565
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,800
at Stagedoor summer camp.

566
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,140
Nerd. Next.

567
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,810
I'm Claire Browne.

568
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,800
I love music,

569
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,000
but I hate musicals, and, um, I don't...

570
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,640
I don't really like to talk about myself, so it's Shaun's turn.

571
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,550
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy.

572
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,270
I used to not like music,

573
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,620
but my girlfriend, Lea, she changed my mind.

574
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,500
I also like to watch The Weather Channel on TV.

575
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,330
And...

576
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,310
I think pickles are disgusting.

577
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,810
Cops know how to manage up.

578
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,450
Managing down's another story.

579
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,930
Well, he's mature, thoughtful,

580
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,180
doesn't have an ego.

581
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,960
Neither does Murphy,

582
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,160
but do you think that qualifies him to supervise First Years?

583
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,030
Well, Murphy's smart,

584
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,710
brutally honest, has no regard for social convention.

585
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,930
It works for Bill Belichick.

586
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,300
The Patriots are the most corrupt, dishonest organization

587
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,800
in the history of the NFL.

588
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,740
Well, the Seahawks suck.

589
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,370
So, how's your experience been here?

590
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
It's been good.

591
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,850
Did you consider any other programs

592
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,900
or was this your first choice?

593
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,550
This was my only choice.

594
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,770
Why do you hate God?

595
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,530
Uh, actually,

596
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,380
I don't believe there is a God.

597
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,870
I thought maybe it was because you believed he hated homosexuals.

598
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,520
I... I don't think this is something

599
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,710
that we should be discussing at work.

600
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,670
Why not?

601
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,530
Well, because it's personal.

602
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,150
Do you have a boyfriend?

603
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,570
I... I'm sorry, but you can't ask that question in a workplace.

604
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,000
Dr. Park, he wants us to get to know you.

605
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,640
How can I do that without asking personal questions?

606
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,370
I have a girlfriend, and she is very important to me.

607
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,580
It affects my life in every way.

608
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,390
Probably should've thought of that before you told her

609
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,390
how much her voice annoyed you.

610
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,260
I said it didn't bother me.

611
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,340
It... It was a compliment.

612
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,280
What I heard is you criticizing her voice,

613
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,360
and you bringing her mother into it.

614
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,670
You're in trouble.

615
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,110
What about Browne?

616
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,210
She may have as much problem being a leader as Murphy,

617
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,520
and without his gifts.

618
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,510
She has her own gifts.

619
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,300
Yeah, dealing with patients and their families.

620
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,460
But with her colleagues, she can be insecure.

621
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,130
Her assertiveness has always been a question mark for me.

622
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,140
They've all got areas that need improving,

623
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,410
but I've gotten to know Browne a bit better these past few months.

624
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,130
She's stronger than she looks.

625
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,480
When's the last time you saw anyone digging

626
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,530
a ditch in a suit and tie?

627
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,670
Surgeons don't dig ditches.

628
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,900
They help people at the most vulnerable time in their life.

629
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,740
And you shouldn't take the responsibility on

630
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,640
if you're not fully committed to it.

631
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,430
You're entering a new phase in your career,

632
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,860
position of authority.

633
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,260
Maybe my clothes are making you feel disrespected.

634
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,250
No.

635
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,470
The truth is,

636
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,600
I just hate wearing anything that makes me feel like a suit.

637
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,850
Great news.

638
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,530
I was able to get Sowinski on anesthesia for tomorrow.

639
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,240
Why? What happened to Foley?

640
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,000
Nothing, I just think Sowinski's better.

641
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And we definitely need the A-team on this.

642
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,290
Yeah, I... I agree.

643
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,310
Which is why I went out of my way to get Foley.

644
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,470
But Foley doesn't do well under pressure.

645
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,960
- Remember that time... - Morgan.

646
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,650
You need to butt out. You're not a surgeon. This is not your job.

647
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,450
My job is to help my patient through the entire treatment process.

648
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,540
The best anesthesiologist for transplant surgery is Sowinski.

649
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,520
And I've already cleared it with Lim, so that's who it's gonna be.

650
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
Deal with it.

651
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,420
Are you mad at me?

652
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,980
I said your voice doesn't bother me.

653
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,940
It was a compliment.

654
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,420
Actually, what you said is that you love my breasts so much

655
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,520
that with the help of noise-canceling headphones,

656
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,530
you're willing to put up with my annoying voice.

657
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,280
Yes.

658
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,670
Not a compliment.

659
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,830
So you are mad at me?

660
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,710
I'm not mad, Shaun. I'm just busy,

661
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,740
trying to keep, like, a billion bots and hackers out of our network.

662
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,730
Actually, no. I'm not doing that.

663
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,740
Gonna go home.

664
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,880
You want to have some tequila, stat?

665
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,880
We also have some pizza left.

666
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,460
No, I don't want tequila or pizza.

667
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,470
That must mean you're mad.

668
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,410
I'm just... upset.

669
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,460
And confused.

670
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,440
And I really don't think there is anything you can do about it,

671
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,970
so you just need to stop trying and leave me alone.

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
She's not mad at me.

673
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,700
She's definitely mad at you.

674
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,570
She doesn't usually hide what she thinks.

675
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,370
She's not mad at him.

676
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,430
She knows how he is, how he talks.

677
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,660
She's mad at herself. And scared.

678
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,680
We all have stuff that we're insecure about.

679
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,180
That's why it's so risky falling in love.

680
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,320
We all hope that when we let our guard down,

681
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,570
it's for the one person that doesn't see our flaws.

682
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,740
So, what do I do?

683
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,230
You were being honest. You can't apologize that away.

684
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,020
You gotta figure out what she needs

685
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,030
to feel secure in the relationship again.

686
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,400
Don't look at me. I'm single.

687
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,880
It's not my place to comment on your personal life.

688
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,280
You have an opinion. Let's hear it.

689
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,490
Fine.

690
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,950
Can you zoom in on her skull base?

691
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,390
I can, but why?

692
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,520
We're worried about her heart and metabolic abnormalities.

693
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,120
We shouldn't be. Not anymore.

694
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,190
You and Dr. Murphy were both wrong.

695
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,050
She doesn't have a cardiac or metabolic issue.

696
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,170
She has poor blood flow in the artery supplying blood

697
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,470
to the area of her brain that controls consciousness.

698
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,340
A small clot in her artery of percheron.

699
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,890
If we don't remove it fast, she's never going to wake up.

700
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,480
That's amazing.

701
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
No, it's not.

702
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,760
The heart's totally outside of the body and still beating.

703
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,300
It's like it has a mind of its own.

704
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,900
She should've started the reimplantation by now.

705
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Is everything okay, Dr. Lim?

706
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,610
The tumor had tendrils invading the right atrial wall.

707
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,920
We took so much tissue to get a clear margin,

708
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,180
there's not enough left to reconstruct his heart's inflow chambers.

709
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,810
How about expanded PTFE graft?

710
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,030
There's not enough atrial remnant to attach the graft.

711
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,090
You could use the septal wall.

712
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,110
He's got dense conduction fibers there.

713
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,940
- It could cause heart arrhythmias. - Not if you use...

714
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,640
He's got low arterial pressure.

715
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,950
He's springing leaks at the cannulation sites.

716
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,200
It's a bleeding disorder caused by prolonged bypass.

717
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,740
You need to get his heart back in ASAP.

718
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,010
Morgan, we can't put the heart back in with two missing chambers.

719
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,480
It's a rare complication,

720
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,010
but a blood clot is a risk in any surgery.

721
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,000
It's too deep in the brain for open surgery.

722
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,330
If we go rooting around in there,

723
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,020
we'd definitely damage the PCA and kill her.

724
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,920
We could inject a dissolving agent into the clot.

725
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,140
There's a 50% probability it won't fully dissolve,

726
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,950
which could leave her with permanent weakness

727
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,170
and cognitive difficulties.

728
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,410
Assuming she wakes up at all.

729
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,830
We need to remove the clot with a stent retriever.

730
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,240
If we rupture the posterior cerebral artery,

731
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,030
she'll die on the table.

732
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,140
Or total recovery.

733
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,100
That's how she came into this hospital.

734
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,240
That's how she's leaving.

735
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,720
Prep her for stent retriever.

736
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm hanging platelets and fresh frozen plasma.

737
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,070
His pressure is still in the toilet,

738
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,250
but the bleeding is slowing down.

739
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,110
Not for long.

740
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,460
Small intestine submucosa has the right compliance

741
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,090
to shape the chamber walls, but...

742
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,840
There isn't enough to cover that much area.

743
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,380
Use too little and he'll have heart failure in a month.

744
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,080
I know. That's the "but."

745
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,510
How thick is his deep fascia?

746
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,660
If it's over 2 millimeters...

747
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,610
Morgan.

748
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,670
Get out.

749
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll be quiet.

750
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,470
No, you won't. You can't.

751
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,020
So leave the OR gallery.

752
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,640
Now.

753
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,170
We need 2.6-millimeter-thick tissue with perfect compliance

754
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,770
for arterial filling and contractile pressures.

755
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,790
If it was just the valve, we'd use a bovine pericardial graft.

756
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,400
But cow heart tissue

757
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,920
is not durable enough to do an entire chamber.

758
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,300
But pig bladder tissue is just right.

759
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,580
I've used it for bladder reconstructive surgeries,

760
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,700
but never hearts.

761
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,070
Let's rebuild the entire atrial walls with it.

762
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,130
Get down to the tissue procurement lab

763
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,780
and get 200 centimeters of porcine bladder tissue.

764
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,510
Her EEG delta waves are slowing further.

765
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,450
She only has one vessel feeding her thalamus.

766
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
That's why the clot landed where it did.

767
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,930
I'm approaching the artery of Percheron.

768
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,760
I'm one millimeter from the clot.

769
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,930
Stop right there.

770
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,600
If we disrupt this clot,

771
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,700
we could cause a shower of emboli into her brain.

772
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,910
Deploying the retriever.

773
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,760
EEG just went flatline.

774
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,520
Calm down. I'm almost...

775
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,760
Got it.

776
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,230
Blood's flowing through the artery.

777
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,960
Her brain tracing's looking better.

778
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,890
This should fill the gap

779
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,750
between the inferior and superior vena cava

780
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,650
when the new chambers get sewn in.

781
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,190
Where's that graft?

782
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,390
I need more sponges. The bleeding is getting worse.

783
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,650
Oh, he's tanking. Can you push epi?

784
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,020
I already did. He's maxing out.

785
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,970
I'm running out of ways to keep his pressure up.

786
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,460
I got it.

787
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,580
They had 205 centimeters of it.

788
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,870
Thank you.

789
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,000
If you want to gown up, you can watch from down here.

790
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,770
Definitely. Thanks.

791
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,050
I thought telling her how much I love her

792
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,160
in front of other people would make her feel good.

793
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,120
But Dr. Guerin said I made her feel insecure, and scared.

794
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,220
Women are sensitive.

795
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,830
When commenting on their flaws,

796
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,530
total honesty is a high-risk procedure.

797
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,630
That sounds sexist. Aren't men also insecure about their flaws?

798
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,100
Men are much, much worse.

799
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,930
And also, we're really stupid.

800
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,970
Okay.

801
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,580
What can I do now?

802
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,260
I've already said my stupid stuff.

803
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,230
I don't want her to be upset with me.

804
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,710
I have a thought.

805
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,400
I think this run of sutures will hold it to the annulus,

806
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,800
but I'm worried about leaks.

807
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,750
We can put a second row of pledgeted sutures

808
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,220
to make sure it's hemostatic.

809
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,690
That is unreal.

810
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,020
It's a work of art.

811
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,100
Now let's get it back in

812
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,570
while we can still get him off bypass alive.

813
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,560
Re-perfusing the heart.

814
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,880
We've got a rhythm.

815
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,100
There was a complication during the reconstruction surgery.

816
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,130
A clot, which caused you to lapse into a coma.

817
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,410
We performed a second surgery on your brain,

818
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,760
which was successful.

819
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,360
You're gonna be fine.

820
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,270
But my breasts...

821
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,740
The clot occurred after we finished inserting the implants.

822
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,900
I think you're gonna be very pleased with the results.

823
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,520
Thank you.

824
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,110
I... think I'm sorry.

825
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,170
Dr. Guerin said I should never say anything

826
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,850
that might sound negative to a girlfriend.

827
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,330
And Dr. Glassman said total honesty

828
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,780
is a high-risk procedure with a girlfriend.

829
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,730
It's better to show my love than try to explain it.

830
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,920
But I want to be totally honest with you.

831
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,640
I don't like your body because it's excellent.

832
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,000
I like it because it's yours.

833
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,330
And I love hearing you talk.

834
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,220
When I hear your voice,

835
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,830
especially when I've had a difficult day,

836
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,490
I find it comforting.

837
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,320
Now I want to hug you. Can I?

838
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,460
I'd like that.

839
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,330
I love you.

840
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,220
Thank you.

841
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,770
For your total honesty.

842
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,090
Your surgery went well.

843
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,180
With some time in rehab,

844
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,070
you should be back to work in a month.

845
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,650
Thank you.

846
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,090
Don't thank me. Thank your surgeon.

847
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,740
She did all the important stuff.

848
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,900
Lim's golden boy is in. Nothing we can do about that.

849
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,650
So that leaves three openings.

850
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,830
The thought of working with Will Hooper for the next two years...

851
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,030
If Dr. Lim thinks he'll be a good resident,

852
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,030
I'm sure she has good reasons.

853
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,630
She probably thinks arrogance is helpful to a surgeon.

854
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,610
Well, we could try to change her mind.

855
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,110
Eh, she asked us to evaluate the applicants, not her.

856
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,930
She asked us to be totally honest.

857
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,980
Eh, "totally honest" is a relative term

858
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,520
when you're telling your boss she's totally wrong.

859
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,370
So, Hooper's in. Who else?

860
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,790
Dr. Andrews likes Dr. Jordan Allen.

861
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,520
Oh, I do, too. She's confident, driven.

862
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,880
She won't take a lot of hand-holding,

863
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,380
and keeping Andrews happy keeps us happy.

864
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,610
That leaves two more. Who's next?

865
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,320
Asher Wolke is very up-front about who he is.

866
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,660
- I like that. - He's definitely eager.

867
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,450
And he couldn't be more open to learning.

868
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,760
Agree.

869
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,380
That leaves one more.

870
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,070
John Lundberg.

871
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,060
Smart, professional, mature.

872
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,340
He's a no-brainer.

873
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,380
Lundberg's in.

874
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,800
Lundberg's out.

875
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,160
He stopped by my office before he left.

876
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,510
Said he's no longer interested.

877
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,660
He said you all were unprofessional.

878
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,020
Drinking at work.

879
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,700
Asking inappropriate questions.

880
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,190
Dating drama.

881
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,840
So, who's your alt? Olivia Jackson or Boardshorts?

882
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,420
Olivia knows her stuff, but she's a bit insecure.

883
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,220
Her answers sound like questions.

884
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,060
I like Boardshorts. He's sensitive.

885
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,250
Like a woman.

886
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,780
I vote for both of them.

887
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,220
That's not an option. We don't have the budget.

888
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,900
Hooper is the worst.

889
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,410
The person I said was the best?

890
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,950
He is arrogant and obnoxious.

891
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,040
If he works here, we'll hate him,

892
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,590
the work will suffer, and we'll either kill patients

893
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,170
or we'll kill him.

894
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,120
And there is no way that you don't see that,

895
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,370
which makes me think...

896
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,700
You do.

897
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,260
This was a test.

898
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,230
You just wanted to see if we'd be totally honest.

899
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,040
Well done.

900
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,920
Hooper is definitely the worst.

901
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,130
I only let him shadow as a favor to a board member.

902
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,890
I figured I'd give him a second chance

903
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,590
after his obnoxious interview.

904
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,990
And also do a little experiment.

905
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,140
So...

906
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,340
It's Jordan, Asher,

907
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,420
Olivia, and Enrique.

908
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,470
To the next phase of your surgical training.

909
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,700
You helped pick them.

910
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,310
As senior residents, it's now your job to help train them.

911
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,250
And don't take this responsibility lightly,

912
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,890
because if you don't train them well,

913
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,630
people will die.
