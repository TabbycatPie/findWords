1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,868
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,904
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:09,110
<i>To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:12,113
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:15,717
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,686
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,256
<i>but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,426
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:27,529
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,325
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

11
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:31,526
No!

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,294
The man who saved Central City.

13
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:34,729
Why did you want to kill me?

14
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,898
- He promised he'd take me home.
- Who?

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,401
- Zoom.
- Wells killed my mother.

16
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,702
I don't know anything anymore,

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,370
especially who I can and can't trust.

18
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,205
S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

19
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:46,141
People can't just waltz in and out of here.

20
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:48,043
Exactly.

21
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:51,112
- Stay where you are.
- My name is Jay Garrick.

22
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,681
Your world is in danger, Barry Allen.

23
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:56,484
Please, just let me explain.

24
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:58,153
I mean you no harm.

25
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,420
How do you know my name?

26
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,823
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow,

27
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,925
Cisco Ramon, Detective Joe West...

28
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,627
Enough.

29
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,562
That part about explaining
needs to happen right about now.

30
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:09,330
This world is in danger.

31
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,499
What other worlds are there?

32
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,668
When you created the
singularity above Central City,

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,038
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,873
I'm sorry, a breach?

35
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,242
Yes, a portal connecting our two earths.

36
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:23,678
And what precisely is your concern?

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,549
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

38
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,417
But then a different Al
Rothstein tried to kill you.

39
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,139
Atom Smasher.

40
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,473
That man was from my world.

41
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,875
If he got through the breach,

42
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,443
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

43
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:41,595
Okay, so, Jay, how exactly
do you know all of this?

44
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,886
Where I came from, I
was a speedster like you.

45
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,388
They called<i> me</i> The Flash.

<i>Before I arrived on your earth,</i>

48
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,668
<i>I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.</i>

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,594
Zoom?

50
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:04,763
I've heard that name before.

51
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:08,534
Atom Smasher, he said Zoom
sent him here to kill me.

52
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,602
Who is this guy?

53
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,237
He's a speedster, like you and me.

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,672
And fast. Maybe the fastest of all.

55
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,207
But evil.

56
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,544
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

57
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,817
<i>We were engaged in our
fiercest battle ever,</i>

58
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,652
<i>racing throughout my city.</i>

59
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,020
<i>But I wasn't fast enough to stop him.</i>

60
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:32,157
<i>Zoom had me beaten.</i>

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,324
Aah!

62
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:34,726
<i>He was about to kill me</i>

63
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,494
<i>when suddenly there was a blinding light</i>

64
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,897
<i>and the sky split open.</i>

65
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,232
<i>A breach, between my world and yours,</i>

66
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:44,335
<i>caused from the singularity.</i>

67
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:45,837
<i>It pulled me in...</i>

68
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:54,245
And I somehow ended up in your world.

69
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,648
Powerless. Unable to return home.

70
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,949
What do you mean?

71
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,684
I lost my speed.

72
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:00,652
How?

73
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:03,821
Not entirely sure.

74
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,226
So, you've been in Central
City for six months.

75
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,761
Why haven't you come to see us before?

76
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,596
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.

77
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,097
I didn't know who you all were.

78
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,533
Took me that long to piece it all together.

79
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,302
So that's how you know our names.

80
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:19,437
You've been following us.

81
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,941
Look, I know how this sounds.

82
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,742
The existence of another earth,

83
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:26,678
you, another Flash,

84
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,648
it all came as an
unexpected shock to me, too.

85
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,318
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

86
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,719
There is.

87
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:38,523
We're gonna... do some tests on you.

88
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,825
See if you're telling us the truth.

89
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:45,296
'Cause if you're not, this Zoom,

90
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:49,000
he's not gonna be your only enemy.

91
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:00,345
Where the hell am I?

92
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:01,946
You want to go home?

93
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,549
You only have to do one thing.

94
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,550
What's that?

95
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,952
Kill The Flash.

96
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,825
So, Mr. Garrick,

97
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,294
how long have you been
The Flash on your world?

98
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,030
Not long enough to call me Mister.

99
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:20,264
Please, it's Jay.

100
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,566
Jay, of course.

101
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:24,335
On my world, I've been The
Flash for about two years.

102
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,738
And how did you get your speed?

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,806
Not really sure. I was at my lab

104
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:31,776
trying to purify heavy water
without any residual radiation

105
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,611
when there was a blinding light.

106
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:36,014
I fell into a coma. When I woke up,

107
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,716
I could run almost as
fast as the speed of light.

108
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,419
Sorry. Did you say lab?

109
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,121
Are you a scientist?

110
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:44,655
Well, I certainly didn't
work at a place like this,

111
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:45,957
but, yeah.

112
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,459
I had a respectable solo operation.

113
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,595
Part-time chemist, part-time physicist.

114
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,697
Part-time superhero.

115
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,667
I can forget that superhero
part now, though, huh?

116
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,136
Is any of this possible?

117
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,038
A breach to another earth? It's not, right?

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,305
The contrary. Just recently,

119
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:04,008
the many-different-worlds
theory proposed interaction

120
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,010
with parallel universes was plausible.

121
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:08,012
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

122
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,281
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

123
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:11,449
It doesn't add up.

124
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,717
I'm gonna be honest here,

125
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,985
I don't understand what the hell

126
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,453
any of you are talking about.

127
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:17,755
So, Jay is saying he's from,

128
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,957
like, a mirror-world.

129
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,859
Or a parallel universe

130
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,228
that's very, very similar to ours.

131
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,665
Multiverse would be a more apt description.

132
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,401
- No, not helping.
- Bless your heart.

133
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:33,071
Okay, let's see if this helps.

134
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,975
This is our earth.

135
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,813
Let's call it Earth-1.

136
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:44,818
And this second Earth,
let's call it Earth-2.

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,687
This is where Jay claims to be from.

138
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,025
And these other earths, three, four, five,

139
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:57,596
to infinity, all of them,
are nearly identical to ours.

140
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,099
And they all exist at the same time,

141
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,402
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

142
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:08,706
For example, the Joe West on
Earth-2, your doppelganger,

143
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,108
he might not be a detective.

144
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,743
He could be a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist.

145
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,314
And you, the Barry Allen here is The Flash,

146
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,817
but over there, he could be an electrician.

147
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,689
So, I'm assuming that the
people on all these other earths

148
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,024
work to make money to pay bills and such.

149
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,026
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

150
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,428
I'm heading back to the station.

151
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,163
Call me when this makes
a little bit more sense.

152
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,531
I'm still trying to wrap my head

153
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,665
around this whole idea of time travel.

154
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:40,805
There is, one problem that remains.

155
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,207
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

156
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,642
there is a breach

157
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,544
somewhere in Central
City that we need to find

158
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,312
and close for good.

159
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:49,614
Yeah, but how do we find it?

160
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,082
We don't even know what to look for.

161
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:52,950
Well, I... I suggest we
put our heads together

162
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:55,987
and come up with a solution.

163
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,723
Not literally, of course.

164
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:01,192
Those days are over.

165
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,367
- What'd you find?
- Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low.

166
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:12,303
And he does have regenerative capabilities.

167
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:13,971
Other than that, I'm
not seeing any evidence

168
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,673
of the Speed Force in his system.

169
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,308
We don't even have proof
that he's a speedster,

170
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,843
much less from another earth?

171
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,378
Not necessarily.

172
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,512
What does that mean?

173
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,347
Well, Jay doesn't know this,

174
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,782
but while I was testing his heart rate,

175
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:26,584
blood pressure, and motor responses,

176
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:30,421
I also measured his autonomic
reactions while we were talking.

177
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,924
You gave him a lie detector test?

178
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:35,326
And he passed it.

179
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:39,597
What if he's not a good guy,

180
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,499
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

181
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:44,702
Keep running tests. See
what else you can find out.

182
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,849
Detective West, sir.

183
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,851
Yes, Officer...?

184
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:03,120
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

185
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,789
Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions

186
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,657
available on your
anti-meta-human task force.

187
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,293
Yeah, everybody quit. There
is no task force anymore.

188
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,763
Well, I know someone who's
interested in being on it.

189
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:14,432
Me.

190
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:15,600
You do realize that

191
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,134
meta-humans have super powers, right?

192
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,769
And even if they didn't,

193
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,605
you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

194
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,006
Because I'm a woman?

195
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,808
I didn't mean to imply that.

196
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,477
Good, because I know how
difficult this job would be,

197
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,412
but I think I'm an excellent candidate.

198
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:31,115
I triple-majored at Hudson in
biology, chemistry, and physics.

199
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,950
I'm in prime physical condition.

200
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:34,986
And I rated top of my
class in marksmanship.

201
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,387
Your class?

202
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,888
You don't even have your stripes yet.

203
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,624
Soon. Been on the job seven months, sir.

204
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,859
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

205
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,160
Detective Thawne, yes.

206
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,596
I know that he died and the one before him,

207
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,965
Fred Chyre, died, too, but
the one before that's not dead,

208
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,267
just transferred.

209
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,202
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

210
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:54,405
- Listen, Officer...
- Spivot, Patty Spivot.

211
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,641
Yes, Spivot, the answer's no.

212
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:58,576
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.

213
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,312
- Please, just an interview.
- You just had the interview.

214
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,914
Didn't get the job.

215
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,158
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

216
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,493
I get it, kid.

217
00:09:15,495 --> 00:09:17,128
You're doing what you think you have to.

218
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,363
But you'll all realize
soon enough that this,

219
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,499
the tests, it's unnecessary.

220
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,267
I want to help you, Barry, not harm you.

221
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,336
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

222
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:27,138
If what you told me about Zoom is true,

223
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,873
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

224
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,408
instead of locking me up in here,

225
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,409
you better start listening.

226
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,010
Because if Zoom is involved,

227
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:35,246
you are gonna need a lot
more than just me at your side

228
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,714
to stay alive.

229
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:37,948
<i>Barry, there's a fire at the waterfront.</i>

230
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,684
<i>Fire department's en route.</i>

231
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,852
I'm on my way.

232
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:43,788
Be careful.

233
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,188
That was the Flash.

234
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,034
That was a big fire.

235
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,568
It's out, Cisco.

236
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,303
Copy that, see you in a bit.

237
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:40,689
I thought it would be harder than this.

238
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,805
<i>Barry?</i>

239
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,507
Hello? Are you there?

240
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,176
- What was that?
- I don't know.

241
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:03,179
<i>We need to find out.</i>

242
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,817
- Bar.
- Hey.

243
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,185
What are we dealing with here?

244
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,620
Pfft. Well, definitely a meta-human.

245
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,789
Had a pretty solid look
at him between punches.

246
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,925
And he was, like, made of sand.

247
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,193
Sand?

248
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:19,762
- Okay.
- These walls are too porous

249
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,130
to pull any prints.

250
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,431
I can't even get one off the boat,

251
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,500
but check this out.

252
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:28,070
There's gasoline burns everywhere.

253
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,572
Water didn't go off.

254
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,241
Sprinklers weren't working.

255
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:33,943
This was arson.

256
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,412
Excuse me? Barry Allen?

257
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:38,013
- Yeah.
- Hi.

258
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,816
Two days in a row,
Officer. What a coincidence.

259
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:43,752
Or kismet, if you believe
in destiny or fate.

260
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:47,923
- I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
- Hey.

261
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:49,058
I'm really excited to meet you.

262
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,594
- I'm a huge fan.
- Excuse me?

263
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:54,463
Your forensic reports.
I... I read them sometimes.

264
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,899
Who am I kidding? All the time.

265
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,601
I've actually read them all.

266
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:01,504
Wow, I don't think that <i>I've</i> read them all.

267
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:03,405
They're always so detailed.
You know, they really paint

268
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,508
a picture like you were
somehow actually there

269
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,110
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

270
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,078
Thank you.

271
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:13,048
Anyhow, I... I found, something.

272
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,317
Well, I think I found
something. It's just a theory,

273
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,853
- but I would like to show you.
- Great.

274
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:21,323
So, this right here is the
point of origin of the fire.

275
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,726
And look.

276
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:25,027
I don't know a sandblaster on the market

277
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,529
that can make a cut that precise,

278
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,931
so I think a meta-human may have done this.

279
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,066
Here. Took a sample for you.

280
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,701
There's also some fingerprints

281
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,036
on the back of the pipe.

282
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:35,971
You should have gone into CSI work.

283
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,707
I love the science, but out
here's where all the action is.

284
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,209
Isn't that right, Detective West?

285
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,479
The answer's still no, Officer S...

286
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,515
- Spivot, yeah.
- Spivot.

287
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,117
What was that about?

288
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,252
I'm trying to join the
anti-meta-human task force.

289
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:53,055
- Ah.
- But you heard him.

290
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,790
Hey, he's kinda like your dad, right?

291
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:57,226
So, do you have any advice on
how I can crack his no-code?

292
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:00,162
Yeah, I've been trying to
pick that lock since I was 11.

293
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,431
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

294
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,632
- Deal.
- All right.

295
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:04,700
It was nice to meet you, Barry.

296
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,870
Yeah, you too. Ahem.

297
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,113
His blood pressure is
low, his heart rate is low,

298
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,683
his oxygen levels are impressive.

299
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:23,285
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

300
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,689
No, but he's certainly in
the physical specimen range.

301
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,834
In more ways than one.

302
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,394
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

303
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,230
That's enough for today, Jay.

304
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,864
Thank you.

305
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,468
Found it at the crime scene.

306
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,204
I mean, it's gotta be from the
meta-human that attacked me.

307
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:44,907
What is this stuff? Sand?

308
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,508
It's not sand.

309
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,644
It's human cells whose myosin II protein

310
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,646
have migrated to the cell's periphery.

311
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,748
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

312
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,918
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

313
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,987
giving them the appearance of sand.

314
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,888
And how do you know this?

315
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,290
They belong to a meta-human

316
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,558
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

317
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,859
I know you're new here,

318
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,294
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

319
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,862
The whole "naming the bad guys thing,"

320
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,031
that's my jam. But you know what?

321
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,165
I'm gonna let you have that one

322
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,233
'cause I actually kinda like it.

323
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,234
I'm not mad at that one.

324
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,602
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

325
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,105
Oh, sorry.
It was all we could find, so...

326
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,574
I was gonna say, 'cause
it looks a lot smaller

327
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:22,645
on you, right?

328
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:26,048
I gotta do this thing.

329
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,584
So, who is this Sand Demon?

330
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,885
I don't know his name,

331
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,353
but I know how to stop him.

332
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:32,655
You know what?

333
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,423
I think we'll be fine on our own.

334
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,859
Look, Barry, I don't
know what else I can do

335
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,794
to prove to you I'm on your side.

336
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,195
I've been poked, prodded.

337
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:43,299
I even subjected myself
to a full body scan.

338
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:44,633
I was being thorough.

339
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,302
Sand Demon's from my world.

340
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,771
Let me teach you how to stop him.

341
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:51,907
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

342
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,009
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

343
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:56,111
He must have sent Sand Demon
here to do the same thing.

344
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:57,946
Don't you get it? Anyone
close to the Flash,

345
00:14:57,948 --> 00:14:59,782
all of you, are in a lot of danger.

346
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,483
All right.

347
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,419
If you're so good,

348
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,387
you would have caught him already.

349
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:09,525
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

350
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:19,968
Hey, beautiful mind,

351
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,771
I think you need to take a breather.

352
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,174
After some, lengthy calculations,

353
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,975
I believe I have discovered the key

354
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:29,812
to proving the proposed breach theory.

355
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:32,614
Exotic matter.

356
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,184
You mean, like,

357
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,418
transdimensional energy?

358
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,620
Precisely. Exotic matter,

359
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,724
transdimensional energy
will theoretically leak

360
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,159
from one universe into another.

361
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,328
Now, if this breach Mr.
Garrick's talking about

362
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,263
is real, if there is indeed

363
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:52,768
a hole in our universe
which leads to his earth...

364
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,470
We can make some adjustments

365
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:56,805
and upload an electrophotography program

366
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,207
to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

367
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,376
and essentially photograph

368
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,844
the exotic matter leak.

369
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:05,147
Thereby giving us the
locale of said breach.

370
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,549
Last time I saw the kit, it
was in the fabrication room.

371
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,385
- I shall return.
- Oh, hoo, hoo.

372
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:12,054
- Ha-ha!
- Getting gooseys.

373
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,989
All right.

374
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:17,593
Let's see what you're made of.

375
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:19,128
That's too much.

376
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,738
Barry?

377
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,781
I thought it'd be harder than this.

378
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,753
What's happening to me?

379
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,537
- Hey.
- <i>I found our meta.</i>

380
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:02,805
<i>His name is Eddie Slick.</i>

381
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,406
We tracked those prints to his address.

382
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:07,009
All right, where are
you? I'll meet you there.

383
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,043
Too late. He made me.

384
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,878
<i>What? Joe?</i>

385
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:34,336
So, can I be on your task force?

386
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,598
That look familiar?

387
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,501
How about now?

388
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,903
- What's it look like?
- A fire.

389
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,538
There you go, genius.

390
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,506
It's the fire you started
in the third ward last night.

391
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,742
Man, I didn't start no
fire there last night.

392
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,277
What? Were you out of town?

393
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,645
Your cat get sick?

394
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,013
Well, let me guess.

395
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,314
You don't start fires anymore.

396
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,716
You been rehabilitated.

397
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,284
Yeah, I done it before. So what?

398
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,256
I didn't do this one.

399
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:11,126
I always start a fire with
something that's hard to trace.

400
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:13,362
You know, like acetone or something.

401
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:17,166
Or maybe you don't need
to use accelerants anymore.

402
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:18,867
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.

403
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,335
You know that, right?

404
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,438
You think I'm one of
those meta-human freaks?

405
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,973
If I had powers, you don't
think I would have used them

406
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,175
to get away from you?

407
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,676
December, 2013. Where were you?

408
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,711
- Why?
- Answer the damn question.

409
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:32,247
- Where were you?
- Blackgate Penitentiary.

410
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,050
You don't believe me. Check your records.

411
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,985
Jimmy, I need you to
confirm something for me.

412
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,221
So, Joe told me what you did.

413
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:40,422
I'm impressed.

414
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:42,458
No, all I did was, you know,

415
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,992
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

416
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,694
then track Slick down from there.

417
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,796
That's all.

418
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,598
Yeah.

419
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,833
How's it going with Joe?

420
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,168
You any closer to cracking his no-code?

421
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,436
Are you kidding me?

422
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:56,438
He's like the permission Sphinx.

423
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,208
Or like a magic eight
ball with just one answer.

424
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,542
Or like, you know,

425
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:02,244
the Bridgekeeper protecting the Holy Grail.

426
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,980
- What is your quest?
- Oh, to join your task force.

427
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,082
- No.
- Aah!

428
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,922
Well, maybe I can put
in a good word for you.

429
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:18,760
That would mean a lot to me, Barry.

430
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:19,828
- He needs me.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:24,967
Okay, so, Slick wasn't in Central City

432
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,035
the night the particle
accelerator exploded.

433
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,270
He's lying.

434
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,038
He's a dirt bag, and an arsonist,

435
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,540
but he's not lying about
this. He's not a meta, Barry.

436
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,942
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

437
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:35,410
Do you think it's possible

438
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,312
that the Slick in there has a...

439
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:41,350
A doppelganger? I don't know.

440
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:44,653
<i>Yesterday's surprise broadcast
from a Star City vigilante</i>

441
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,855
<i>who is calling himself the Green Arrow</i>

442
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:48,290
<i>has spawned a massive outcry of
both support and dissenters...</i>

443
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,758
Catchy.

444
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,728
I hate it when they put
a color in their name.

445
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,930
- Yo.
- Yo.

446
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,098
- The sample you gave us?
- Yeah.

447
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,533
Not sand.

448
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,101
Definitely human cells.

449
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,303
Yeah, I know. It's not him, I get it.

450
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:03,405
I hate to say it, but I
think this Earth-2 theory

451
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,174
- is starting to make sense.
- For real?

452
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,609
What, you think Jay is
lying about the Sand Demon?

453
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,845
I don't know. That's my point.

454
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:13,349
But I'm not gonna just believe
some guy that walks in here

455
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:16,785
and says a few things
that sort of check out.

456
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,254
Sort of? He was... he was right about Zoom.

457
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:21,089
We don't even know anything about Zoom.

458
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,925
What is Zoom? Is Zoom even real?

459
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:25,127
Right now, that's just, you know, a story

460
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,428
around a campfire.

461
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,031
I mean, have you discovered a breach yet?

462
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,166
Not yet, but we know how to now.

463
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:34,937
Have you found one thing to
suggest that Jay is a speedster?

464
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:38,140
Is the Speed Force even in his system?

465
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,043
It doesn't appear to be, no.

466
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:43,111
See?

467
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,214
We are scientists.

468
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,949
You are a journalist.

469
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:50,185
We test, we prove, we
report. That's what we do.

470
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:53,222
Except right now, nobody
here wants to do any of that

471
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,226
except me.

472
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,896
Can we have the room for a minute?

473
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,171
What has happened to you?

474
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,073
Are you... me?

475
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:12,808
Yes, you.

476
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,176
The you that I grew up with.

477
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,978
The you that is my best friend.

478
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,379
The you that became The Flash.

479
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:20,082
I haven't seen that
you in a very long time.

480
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,750
A lot's changed, Iris.

481
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,151
Yeah, it sure has.

482
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:26,888
You have learned how to not trust people.

483
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,324
What is it about Jay that you don't like?

484
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:32,027
I don't know.

485
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,566
It's because he reminds
you of Harrison Wells.

486
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,434
I trusted that man.

487
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:41,470
For months. We all did.

488
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:46,742
And you know what?

489
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,610
Eddie is dead.

490
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,445
Ronnie is dead.

491
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:54,183
And a whole lot of other
people in this city,

492
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:56,351
they are dead

493
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:57,953
because we trusted him.

494
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:01,356
I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

495
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:04,196
Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells.

496
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:11,635
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people.

497
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:16,938
Because you believed in them.

498
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,041
This team that you have here,

499
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,275
they will follow your lead.

500
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:22,978
They'll do what you say.

501
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,214
But if they think that
you don't believe in them,

502
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:29,117
it won't be long before
they don't believe in you.

503
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:36,692
Get to walking.

504
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,827
I don't want to see your
ugly mug around here again.

505
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:40,462
Sayonara.

506
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,500
We didn't have probable cause.

507
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:46,501
I get it.

508
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:47,769
One thing you should know

509
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,071
about dealing with these meta-humans,

510
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:51,473
nothing is ever as it seems.

511
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,641
Speaking of which,

512
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:53,942
you're the only person here

513
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:55,777
who wants to be on my task force.

514
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,146
You want to tell me why you're
so hell-bent on being on it?

515
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,316
You want to tell me why
you're so hell-bent I'm not?

516
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:06,521
Didn't I just tell you

517
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:08,423
I didn't want to see your
ugly mug around here again?

518
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,193
Well, you're gonna have to, Detective West.

519
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:14,062
So I can get to the Flash.

520
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:31,380
I like you. You'll do the trick...

521
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,281
just fine.

522
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,153
Finally come to your senses?

523
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,522
Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer.

524
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:53,757
A woman that I know.

525
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,025
And you need my help?

526
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,861
I need you to help us save her.

527
00:23:57,863 --> 00:24:00,597
Before something happens.

528
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,699
I guess you're gonna have
to trust me now, huh, kid?

529
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,335
<i>We're looking for any structures</i>

530
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,736
that promote humidity.

531
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,905
Greenhouses, grow rooms,
anything of the sort.

532
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,874
His body will literally start to fall apart

533
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,208
if he becomes dehydrated.

534
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,810
- Like dry sand.
- Exactly.

535
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,179
Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts.

536
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,381
He creates a diversion, then
strikes when you're distracted.

537
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,616
Okay, then what do we do?

538
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:20,951
We use your speed to get to him

539
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:22,886
before the distraction can happen.

540
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:26,022
Jay, how do I stop somebody
who can slip through my fingers?

541
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:28,425
The way I was never able to.

542
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,893
With lightning.

543
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:32,429
Yo, are you about to pull a Zeus right now?

544
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,763
What are you talking about?

545
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,165
Barry's gonna hurl lightning

546
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,634
from the energy he creates when he runs.

547
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:39,602
Because lightning plus sand equals...

548
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,870
Glass.

549
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:43,106
Time to learn something new, kid.

550
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:45,976
All right.

551
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:47,310
Choo!

552
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,515
Give me a sec.

553
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:55,485
Hey, are you good?

554
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:56,753
That was Singh.

555
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,455
CCPD still hasn't found anything yet.

556
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,957
Irony is, I didn't want Patty
to have anything to do with

557
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,225
the damn task force in the first place.

558
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,793
And she gets taken because of me.

559
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,161
No, no, no, this isn't
your fault, all right?

560
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,930
It's hard not to think that.

561
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,832
Well, look, we're gonna
find Patty, all right?

562
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:12,435
Whatever it takes.

563
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:26,349
Flash is coming for you, you know?

564
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,618
Yes, I'm sure he is.

565
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,887
You can't beat him.

566
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,423
I don't care what powers you have.

567
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:36,693
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

568
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:39,996
Is that why you need to
build that concussive bomb?

569
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,631
Yeah, I know what it is.

570
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:45,101
I'm a cop. I've seen one before.

571
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:47,937
This isn't gonna kill the Flash.

572
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,039
I am.

573
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,876
This... is gonna kill you.

574
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:00,950
You know you got lucky, right?

575
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:03,653
You think you were chosen.

576
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:05,789
The rest of us don't mean anything.

577
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,290
But it's not true.

578
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:10,928
You were just at the right
place at the right time.

579
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,164
Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

580
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,500
They only highlighted the worst
parts of who you already were.

581
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:20,170
Maybe you're right.

582
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,005
Maybe not.

583
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,174
Either way, you and the
Flash are about to find out

584
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:26,042
what those worst parts are.

585
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,615
I've searched all the vacant
buildings in Central City

586
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:35,251
and none of them fit the
description that we need.

587
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:37,687
And I've looked at any draw
upticks on the electrical grid.

588
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,689
Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid.

589
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:42,158
We gotta do whatever it takes.

590
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,563
I'll be back.

591
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:52,068
Okay, come on.

592
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:06,749
Flash is coming for you, you know?

593
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,053
Yes, I'm sure he is.

594
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:12,021
You can't beat him.

595
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:14,524
I don't care what powers you have.

596
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:17,861
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

597
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:21,531
Oh, no.

598
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:26,302
Mr. Ramon?

599
00:27:26,304 --> 00:27:29,606
What are you doing down here?

600
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,674
I figured out where Patty is.

601
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:35,245
And how exactly did you do that?

602
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:38,414
Just a hunch.

603
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,949
We gotta tell Barry.

604
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,387
Again.

605
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,758
I've been doing this for an hour.

606
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,327
It's not working.

607
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,562
It's because you're trying to rush it.

608
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:12,033
This is the one time you need to slow down.

609
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:14,535
Let the energy pass over you,

610
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:17,237
then simply direct it to
where you want it to go.

611
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,706
All right, Jay...

612
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,107
I don't know if I'm gonna get this in time.

613
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,143
You'll get it. I believe in you.

614
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,778
The last person that helped me like this

615
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
was a man that I looked up to.

616
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,048
Idolized.

617
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,384
He taught me how to get
faster, how to get stronger,

618
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:33,620
how to use my powers to save people.

619
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,723
That same man murdered my mother.

620
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,595
It's a tough break,

621
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:44,665
but I'm not him.

622
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,267
Yeah.

623
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,669
I know where they are!

624
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:52,706
The abandoned Woodrue grow house.

625
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,041
That's where Slick's keeping Patty.

626
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,642
Dude, great job.

627
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:58,278
And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon

628
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,381
and I were attacking a
speedster on two fronts,

629
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,349
I would probably want to slow you down,

630
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:04,818
like, by using a concussive bomb

631
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,121
- or something like that.
- That's a good thought.

632
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,023
He's actually used one on me before.

633
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:11,291
His body absorbs the blast
so it doesn't affect him.

634
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:14,028
Well, kid, gonna have
to think of something.

635
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,162
You know what?

636
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:16,897
What if we give Slick a diversion?

637
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:17,965
He knows you, right?

638
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:19,333
You said you went up against him.

639
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:22,102
Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.

640
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:23,437
He doesn't know that.

641
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,772
You got your suit?

642
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:26,840
Sure. Well, except my helmet.

643
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,542
- Helmet?
- Silver kettle helmet?

644
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:29,777
Gold wings?

645
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:33,180
Don't tell me you guys found it.

646
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,789
Never thought I'd see that again.

647
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:47,327
It was my father's,

648
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:48,896
from the War of the Americas.

649
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:51,331
Did you just say War of the Americas?

650
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,967
I wish you would have just
told us you lost your helmet.

651
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,003
Would have saved us all a headache.

652
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,079
Well, sure you want to do this, Flash?

653
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,713
Yeah.

654
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:09,750
Let's go see what you're made of... Flash.

655
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:26,900
I'm in the security feed.

656
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,136
Go, Barry!

657
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,408
Is that you, Flash?

658
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,676
Found your way here.

659
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,014
I came quite a distance.

660
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,216
I thought you were dead.

661
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,784
You were wrong.

662
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:45,185
Like usual.

663
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,556
Let the girl go.

664
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,525
Have at it. But you touch her,

665
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,161
she goes boom.

666
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:57,965
And I think even you aren't
fast enough to save her.

667
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,972
Quite a bit slower on this
Earth, aren't you, Flash?

668
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,583
You don't have your speed, do you?

669
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,852
Slick's distracted. Go, Barry.

670
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:47,147
- Jay!
- Barry!

671
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:52,986
Patty's alive.

672
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,022
Must be my lucky day.

673
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,057
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

674
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,092
Now I get to kill The Flash from two worlds

675
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:01,728
before I go home.

676
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,232
He's choking Jay.

677
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,967
Barry, you gotta do something now.

678
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,180
Come on!

679
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,959
Aah!

680
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,541
You okay?

681
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:49,610
Yeah. I'm okay.

682
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:50,911
Nice shot, kid.

683
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,383
Flash?

684
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,718
Coming.

685
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:12,703
You're pretty good at this.

686
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,406
I've had a lot of practice
over the last year.

687
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,945
It was really courageous
doing what you did today,

688
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,548
standing up to the Sand
Demon without any powers.

689
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,217
Ah, Barry did all the work.

690
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,319
I just stood there and took a few punches.

691
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,722
It was more than a few.

692
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:34,691
This is a lot harder than I thought.

693
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,193
Losing something that was such a big part

694
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:38,962
of who I was for so long.

695
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:42,267
I lost something that
was a part of me, too.

696
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:45,469
It's hard,

697
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:48,906
but it gets easier every day.

698
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:55,513
You just have to find a new way to live.

699
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:58,615
Just because it's a different life

700
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:00,717
it doesn't mean it's a worse one.

701
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:08,225
And, speed or no speed,

702
00:34:08,227 --> 00:34:10,928
in my book you were still a hero today.

703
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,696
I'm just sorry

704
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:15,432
we didn't all realize
it a little bit sooner.

705
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,568
Especially me.

706
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,104
I'll leave you two speedsters alone.

707
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,008
So, I hear they call you
"The Scarlet Speedster"

708
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,944
Yeah.

709
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,679
- What about you?
- "The Crimson Comet."

710
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:30,814
What is it with

711
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:32,282
alliteration and nicknames?

712
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:37,921
Hey, look, Jay...

713
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:40,757
So, thank you for all your help.

714
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:43,760
And for being so patient with me.

715
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:46,763
Nah, anytime, kid. You're a quick study.

716
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:48,699
Took me a lot longer to
learn how to toss lightning,

717
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:49,933
believe me.

718
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,336
Then I suppose I had the right teacher.

719
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:55,873
It's going to be a lot
harder to take down Zoom.

720
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,242
Who is this guy?

721
00:34:58,244 --> 00:35:00,043
No one knows.

722
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:02,946
He showed up around the same
time as when I got my powers.

723
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:05,048
Killed a lot of people in my world.

724
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,086
I spent about two years tracking him down.

725
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:11,855
But he was too smart, too quick.

726
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,892
He's always one step ahead.

727
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:16,560
You really think he's just

728
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:18,595
bringing these guys here to kill me?

729
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:20,864
Zoom is obsessed with destroying me.

730
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:23,634
- Now he wants to destroy you.
- Yeah.

731
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:26,737
He needs to be the best.

732
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:29,039
And he will do whatever it takes

733
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,409
to ensure he's the only speedster.

734
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:33,411
In any world.

735
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:39,216
- Officer Spivot?
- Detective.

736
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:40,417
You're supposed to be home resting.

737
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:42,052
I'm okay, sir, really.

738
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,388
Look, I'm sorry you got
mixed up in all this mess

739
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,622
because of me.

740
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,591
It's not your fault.

741
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:49,326
Do you really think you have what it takes

742
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:51,195
to be part of my task force?

743
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:52,896
I know it, sir.

744
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,798
Well, I always check the jacket of anyone

745
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,999
I'm considering for it.

746
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,768
In my research on you,

747
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,704
I found out we got a mutual acquaintance.

748
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:03,440
Mark Mardon.

749
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:05,442
I need you to be honest with me here.

750
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:07,546
Why do you want to do this?

751
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:12,716
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

752
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:19,757
He had a little shoe
shop down on Chesterfield.

753
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,092
It was a cash business.

754
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:24,628
One night he went to Fairfield bank

755
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,597
to make his weekly deposit,

756
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,900
and the Mardon brothers showed up.

757
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:32,636
While he was waiting in line,

758
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:36,173
Mark shot my dad in the face
for a few hundred dollars.

759
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:42,179
Then a few months later, Mark
and his brother got powers.

760
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,682
Two murderers got superpowers.

761
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,451
So that's why I'm here, Sir.

762
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:51,089
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

763
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:54,358
'Cause there's some bad people out there

764
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,562
and they can do anything.

765
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:00,864
And I may not have powers,

766
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:03,767
but I want to stop them.

767
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:06,770
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

768
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:15,214
Monday, 8:00 a.m.

769
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,915
Don't be late.

770
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,752
Late for what?

771
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:24,321
The task force, Detective.

772
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,500
Joseph.

773
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,571
Hi.

774
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,741
Been a long time.

775
00:37:47,913 --> 00:37:51,281
Yeah, it has.

776
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,116
Why are you here?

777
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,652
Because you didn't return my calls.

778
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:59,623
And I wanted to see you.

779
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,392
And our daughter.

780
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,335
Any progress with the electrophotography?

781
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:13,603
The satellite picture of
the city's still rendering.

782
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:17,107
While we wait,

783
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:18,709
care to tell me what's going on with you?

784
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:20,077
What? Nothing.

785
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:23,947
Two hunches in one day.

786
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:25,782
Slick's locale,

787
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:28,085
and that he'd be using a concussive bomb

788
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:30,120
to thwart Barry.

789
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:32,923
Do I need to inform you of
the odds of such a prediction?

790
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:36,760
Something's happening to me.

791
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:40,130
I'm starting to perceive things.

792
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:41,798
Horrible things.

793
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,669
It started after Wells killed
me in the other timeline.

794
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,439
It came back when Atom
Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

795
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:52,642
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

796
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,878
I get a vibe,

797
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,116
and then a vision of something
that's already happened,

798
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:00,917
and then it's gone.

799
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,522
That's how I knew where Slick was.

800
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,324
Cisco, this is amazing.

801
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:09,926
We... we have to study this,
figure out just what to do.

802
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:11,495
No, no, no, we're not doing any of that,

803
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:13,163
and we're certainly not
telling anybody, either.

804
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:15,365
Cisco, I would think you'd
be the one most intrigued

805
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,667
with knowing exactly what
this is and how it works.

806
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:20,270
I'm seeing things I don't want to see.

807
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,671
And knowing things I don't want to know.

808
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,373
I just want it to stop.

809
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:26,710
Professor, I don't want
anyone to know about this.

810
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,011
Not yet.

811
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:34,618
It's okay to be afraid, you know?

812
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,954
Wells told me this was my future.

813
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:43,326
That he gave me this power.

814
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:46,530
But everything he did was evil.

815
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:50,000
That's what scares me, Professor.

816
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,769
You have to promise me

817
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,872
you won't tell anyone about this.

818
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,341
I promise.

819
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:04,080
Oh, wow.

820
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:08,185
It appears that while
we were indeed successful

821
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:09,553
in closing the singularity,

822
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:12,088
there was an unfortunate side effect.

823
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,157
- What are you talking about?
- Using electrophotography,

824
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,726
Cisco and I were able
to search Central City

825
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,396
for any signs of energy entering our earth

826
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:20,864
from another dimension.

827
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:24,468
From any "breaches" , as
Mr. Garrick described them.

828
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,437
But, of course, there
isn't just one breach.

829
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:30,407
There's 52 of them scattered
throughout the city.

830
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,176
These breaches are
pockets of time and space

831
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:35,946
folded into and upon itself.

832
00:40:35,948 --> 00:40:39,115
But the most significant
breach of all appears to be

833
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,550
this one.

834
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,988
And where exactly is that located?

835
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,124
It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

836
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:50,727
And just beyond that breach

837
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,931
is an entirely diff... fferent...

838
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,568
Professor?

839
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,669
Professor!

840
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,480
<i>I'd like to personally welcome you</i>

841
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:12,415
to the Scientific and Technological

842
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,284
Advanced Research Laboratories,

843
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,953
or, as it's more commonly known,

844
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,421
S.T.A.R. Labs.

845
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:21,091
Founded in 1991, S.T.A.R. Labs is leading

846
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,827
the world in exciting new
technological discoveries

847
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,695
that, as our motto suggests,

848
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:28,999
are truly bringing us
tomorrow's world today.

849
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:31,568
Specializing in artificial intelligence,

850
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,538
genetics, and meta-human stu...

851
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,909
Oh, are we in for an unexpected treat.

852
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:42,646
It is my absolute honor to
introduce you to the founder

853
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:44,247
of S.T.A.R. Labs,

854
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:46,683
the savior of Central City,

855
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,652
Dr. Harrison Wells.

856
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:58,261
Hello, kids.
