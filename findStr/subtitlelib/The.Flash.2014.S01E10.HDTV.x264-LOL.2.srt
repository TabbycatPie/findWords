1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:05,138
- My name is barry allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,839
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,309
Killed by something impossible.
- Run, barry, run!

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,278
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,249
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,951
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:21,054
But secretly, I use my speed

8
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,556
To fight crime
and find others like me.

9
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:26,125
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

10
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,494
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,764
I am the flash.

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,599
Previously on<i> the flash...</i>

13
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,902
You killed my mother. Why?

14
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:40,173
- If you want to know that,
you're gonna have to catch me.

15
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,442
Not fast enough, flash.

16
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:43,810
- I love you, iris.

17
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,778
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,613
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,753
My name is barry allen.

20
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,556
I am not the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,425
That title belongs to the man
who killed my mother.

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,567
But not for long.

23
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,002
- That was too close.

24
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,637
- He told me to make it hard.

25
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,306
- Pretty sure he didn't tell you
to make him dead.

26
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,007
- Remember,
this is just supposed to be

27
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,177
A training exercise
to improve barry's speed.

28
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:22,648
- Cisco, you gonna bring it
or what?

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,484
- Bring it.

30
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,373
- Why isn't he running away?

31
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,041
Barry, run away.

32
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,972
- Very impressive, mr. Allen.

33
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,374
Your reaction to stimuli

34
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,776
At super-speed
continues to improve.

35
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,446
- It's still not enough.
- It will be.

36
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,414
You keep working like you are,
you stay focused like you are,

37
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,649
And you will be ready
the next time

38
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,717
Your man
in the yellow suit comes around.

39
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,188
- I think
you mean the reverse-flash.

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,124
What? He said it, not me.

41
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,892
And he's right.

42
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,728
Yellow suit, red lightning,
and evil...

43
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,630
The reverse of barry.

44
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,566
- Meh.
- Actually, I kind of like it.

45
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,234
- All right, I'm still ready
for another round.

46
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,602
How many more drones
do you have left?

47
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,070
- Two.

48
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:54,740
And they've got lasers.

49
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,409
No.

50
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,004
- Told you it would break.

51
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,840
- And the shrink says I'm crazy.

52
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,275
What is this place?

53
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,444
- Customs warehouse.

54
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:35,882
Imported cars from europe,
all worth a fortune.

55
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,283
- Question.

56
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,518
How do you suggest you and I

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,419
Drive all these cars
out of here?

58
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,622
- We're not.

59
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:44,657
We're not stealing anything.

60
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,093
- What are you talking about?

61
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:51,264
- Our entrance set off
the silent alarms.

62
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:57,270
The cops will be arriving
in 2 minutes and 14 seconds.

63
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,971
- Bring them.

64
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:07,113
- That's not for the cops,
as we discussed.

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,919
He'll be here.

66
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,230
- You do hear that, right?

67
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:28,601
- He's not coming.

68
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,002
We're leaving.

69
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,038
- This better make sense
real fast, buddy.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,006
- It will. Let's go.

71
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,047
- You promised me I'd get
to do my thing.

72
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,182
- I always keep my promises.

73
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,450
Seat belt.

74
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,597
- Are you sure
nothing's missing?

75
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,399
- That's what the supervisor
said.

76
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,101
I can check again.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,174
- Bar.

78
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,742
- Hey.

79
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:13,946
Well, the breakage
indicates that the door somehow

80
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,849
Had zero viscoelasticity
when it hit the ground.

81
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,484
- What does that mean
to normal people?

82
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,319
- Sorry. Uh...

83
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,922
The steel shattered like glass.

84
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,068
It was frozen, joe.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,570
- Snart.

86
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:39,105
- He's back.

87
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,641
- I thought snart
was some world-class thief.

88
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:45,611
All these expensive cars...
He didn't take any of them?

89
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,846
It doesn't make sense.

90
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,115
- Eddie, put out an apb
on snart.

91
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:52,418
- Got it.

92
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,055
- Snart wasn't here
to steal anything.

93
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,757
- He was setting a trap.
- For me.

94
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,226
And by me, I mean...
- yeah, I know who you meant.

95
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,536
- God, you're beautiful.

96
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,172
- Mick.

97
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,974
- This is a joke.

98
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,710
How do you know this flash
didn't skip town, hmm?

99
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,578
Maybe that's
why he didn't show up.

100
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,980
Or maybe he's dead.

101
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,082
Or maybe someone
smarter than you iced him.

102
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,317
- He's not dead,
and he didn't leave town.

103
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,653
- You will tell me
what we're stealing this time.

104
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,321
We are partners, after all.

105
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,958
- This is what we came for.

106
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,497
- That's worth money?

107
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,234
- It's called fire & ice, an
abstract modern-day masterpiece

108
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,537
Said to represent
the dichotomy of being.

109
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,072
- It represents to me

110
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,742
That people with lots
of money buy dumb stuff.

111
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,177
- Osgood and rachel rathaway,

112
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,012
One of the richest couples
in central city,

113
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:57,083
Paid 25 million for it in paris.

114
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,218
They're flying home with it
today.

115
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,088
- Mm.

116
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,422
- Captain cold is back?

117
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,857
- For a non-metahuman,

118
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,093
Leonard snart is proving
to be quite the nemesis.

119
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,461
- He still has the cold gun,

120
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:11,130
The one he stole from us,
the one I built.

121
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,632
- Well,
what does he want this time?

122
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,301
- The flash.

123
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,236
If snart wants a fight
with the flash,

124
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:18,370
Then I'll give him one.

125
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,905
- Well...

126
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,540
You don't think I should?

127
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,642
- I didn't say that.
But, barry,

128
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,079
As fast as you are, you
cannot be everywhere at once.

129
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,048
And it becomes then a question
of priorities.

130
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,283
Now, in the last month,

131
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,819
You have made a commitment
to increasing your speed,

132
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,021
Enhancing your reflexes,
and it's working.

133
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,257
You're finally getting faster.

134
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,228
- Okay, but what am I supposed
to do, just ignore snart?

135
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,366
- The last time you had a fight
with snart, a train derailed.

136
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,136
You were lucky to get
all those people to safety.

137
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,871
And if you don't give
him that fight...

138
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:56,075
- He may just back off,
and there'll be no casualties.

139
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,811
- Look, barry, cisco
and I will work with joe

140
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:02,848
And the police
and devise a way to catch cold.

141
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,383
Yes, I said it, cisco.

142
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,951
As soon as it came
out of my mouth, I heard it.

143
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,386
- Yeah, we can definitely
come up with ways

144
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,521
To neutralize snart.

145
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,189
- Listen, barry.

146
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:14,260
Whether or not you go
after snart, that's your choice.

147
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,329
We here, we will do
whatever we can to support you.

148
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,667
But after this past christmas,

149
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,470
After the events
with the reverse-flash...

150
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,042
I just think he poses
a greater threat to all of us.

151
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,613
- Okay.

152
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,452
- T-minus three days
and counting...

153
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,854
Till the big move in.

154
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,689
You know,
I've never had a roommate.

155
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,192
But it did occur to me
that if we ever get in a fight,

156
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,327
I can't just storm away
and go home,

157
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,796
Because home will be with you.

158
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,865
- Are you predicting
many arguments?

159
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,034
- Have you met me?

160
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,169
- I remember the night we met.

161
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,005
I stopped a mugger
who stole your bag.

162
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,907
- My hero.

163
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,247
- Hey.

164
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,682
- Hey.

165
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,417
- Eddie, you know where joe is?

166
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,019
- Uh... I think he's upstairs
in your lab.

167
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,888
- Okay, thanks.

168
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:27,032
- No second thoughts
about moving in together?

169
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,200
- None.

170
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,905
- Joe, hey.

171
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,840
- Hey. I'm glad you're back.

172
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,675
I've been going
over snart's file.

173
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:40,346
- Thanks.
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

174
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:43,782
As csi, my work
on this case is done.

175
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,352
And as the flash,

176
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:49,555
I don't think
I can focus on snart right now.

177
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,392
- You mind telling me
what brought about this change

178
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,194
Of heart?

179
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,330
- This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom,

180
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,232
Is still out there.

181
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,533
I have to be ready
to face him,

182
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,203
Which means amping up my speed.

183
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,239
It's a question of priorities.
- Your mom's killer

184
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,275
Isn't the only reason
you've been doing this.

185
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,877
You told me that if you
could use your powers

186
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,747
To save someone from a burning
building, you would.

187
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:18,083
- Look, dr. Wells and s.T.A.R.
Labs are gonna work with you.

188
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,752
Cisco thinks he has a way

189
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,620
To protect the police
against snart's cold gun.

190
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,322
- Barry, I can understand
if you're scared.

191
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,492
We talked about this.
- Of course I'm scared, joe.

192
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:28,093
This guy could run
into the precinct

193
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,095
And kill everyone
in here in seconds.

194
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,031
He threatened iris.

195
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,732
I won't let him hurt
the most important people

196
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,067
In my life again.

197
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,536
If that means devoting
every second

198
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,705
I have outside this place
to getting faster

199
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,007
And to stopping him,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

200
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,109
I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

201
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,462
- Aw. Mcsnurtle the turtle.

202
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,830
How you been?

203
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,066
When did you stop
sleeping with this?

204
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,801
It was your favorite.
- He was.

205
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,636
But if I remember correctly,

206
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:14,340
You took him away from me after
I broke your<i> duke ellington:</i>

207
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,241
<i>Live at the blue note</i> vinyl.

208
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,643
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

209
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,681
- You can have him back now.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

210
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,252
Oh, dad.

211
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,489
- I'm going to miss you, baby.

212
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,324
- Dad, I'm only
ten minutes away.

213
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:35,427
- I know.
Don't you worry about me.

214
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,396
I'll be fine, just like always.

215
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,266
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,968
- You came to help her pack?

217
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,570
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

218
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,107
Iris said that she had
something for me.

219
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,175
- Oh, um...

220
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,845
I found this in my closet.

221
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,683
- I haven't seen this in years.

222
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:02,154
- Well, the nerd survival kit
is still intact.

223
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,857
- Wow.

224
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,292
- I thought
those might be worth something.

225
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,967
I am so late for work.

226
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,841
I promise I will clean this
up when I get back, okay?

227
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,377
- Bye.
- Bye, yeah.

228
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,915
- Okay.

229
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,153
You mind telling me what's
going on with you and iris?

230
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,088
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

231
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,857
That's funny, because I have
these two things called eyes,

232
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,027
And it doesn't look like you
two are fine.

233
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,196
- I told iris.

234
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,565
- You told iris
you're the flash?

235
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,867
- No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,369
No.

237
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:56,475
I told her
how I felt about her.

238
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,210
- Oh, god.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,179
- What did she say?

240
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:04,249
- Well, I mean, she's still
moving in with eddie, isn't she?

241
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,553
I just want to pretend
like it never even happened.

242
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,988
I mean, that's what
we're both doing, so...

243
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,725
- Well, not saying how you feel
is what got you in this mess

244
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,794
In the first place.

245
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,696
Speaking of which,

246
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:21,133
We both know she's not gonna
clean this mess up anytime soon.

247
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,868
- Nope.

248
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,206
Sure.

249
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,152
- Uh, excuse me.

250
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,222
If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

251
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,725
- You have our attention,
mr. Ramon.

252
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,794
- Okay, check it.

253
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,562
So dr. Wells and I,

254
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,931
We took your ballistic shields
and...

255
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,437
And we lined them with a pretty
sweet compacted heating ribbon

256
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,873
Designed to repel
temperature attacks,

257
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,475
Especially
those reaching absolute zero,

258
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,511
Like captain cold's gun.

259
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,212
- And that's supposed
to keep us from getting

260
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,047
Turned into popsicles?
- Um, yeah.

261
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,983
Yeah, they will.

262
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,152
- How are we supposed to trust
anything from s.T.A.R. Labs

263
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,187
After you nuked the city?

264
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,626
- You're right.

265
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,462
You're right,
you shouldn't trust us.

266
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:27,432
What happened a year ago...
that was our fault.

267
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:32,337
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

268
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,940
But tomorrow
is a different story.

269
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,643
Tomorrow's a different thing.

270
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:41,146
We just want the chance
to make things better.

271
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,981
Observe.

272
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,747
- Dummies are one thing.

273
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,849
My officers are another.

274
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,724
- You seem pleased
with yourself, doctor.

275
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,727
- Well, I'm just happy to help
the police catch snart, joe.

276
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,662
- Barry might be able
to help too.

277
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,233
- I think cisco's heat shields
are more than up to the task.

278
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,568
And, joe, if barry
feels he's gonna endanger lives

279
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,337
By taking on snart
and, conversely, feels

280
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,038
He's gonna
save lives by training

281
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,909
To take on the man in yellow...

282
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,844
That's ultimately his call.

283
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,081
- You know what makes
barry so special?

284
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,051
He wants to help everyone
he can, however he can.

285
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,786
Always has.

286
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,555
Until now.

287
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,691
- I guess it's just a question
of priorities then.

288
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:04,663
- You know, barry
said the exact same thing to me.

289
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,566
And I thought,
"doesn't sound like him."

290
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,235
I guess because
it sounds like you.

291
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,613
Hey.

292
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,649
- Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.

293
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,817
- No, it's okay.
I was just kind of focused.

294
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,586
- Gotcha.

295
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,155
What's firestorm?
- It's one of the last things

296
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,125
Ronnie said to me before he...
Flew away.

297
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,794
My dead fiance can fly.

298
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,796
I haven't broke that
to my parents yet.

299
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,399
You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

300
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,734
No, I just...

301
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,238
I told iris
how I felt about her.

302
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,839
- Bold choice.

303
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,776
- I knew where we stood before.
We were best friends.

304
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,111
And... I don't know.
Now I just don't know

305
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,147
What's normal for us anymore.

306
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,516
- Before I met ronnie,

307
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,153
I knew exactly what was going
to happen every day of my life.

308
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,588
It was predictable.
I like predictable.

309
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,325
But when ronnie
and I started dating,

310
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,860
Everything started to change.

311
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:14,399
He made me try indian food
and scuba diving.

312
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,803
At first it was scary.

313
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:21,139
But then it was better.

314
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,209
Things weren't really normal
with you pining after iris

315
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,812
And her being totally unaware.

316
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:30,182
Whatever happens next,
it will be better.

317
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,756
- Wait, caitlin.

318
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,191
Scuba.

319
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,726
- What about it?

320
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,828
- Self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus,

321
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,696
It's an acronym.

322
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,665
- What if firestorm
isn't a word?

323
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,073
Fusion ignition research
experiment and science

324
00:17:55,075 --> 00:18:01,146
Of transmutation originating rna
and molecular structures.

325
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,782
It's 800 pages.

326
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,028
There's a lot
of stuff in there,

327
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,064
But it mostly
focuses on transmutation,

328
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,233
Which is the process of altering
the structure of an element

329
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,868
By unzipping the atoms...

330
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,972
- And rebuilding it to create
an entirely new element.

331
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:29,107
- Well, the article
was co-written by jason rush,

332
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,309
Who's a grad student
here at hudson university.

333
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,311
So if anybody knows
what happened to ronnie...

334
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,780
- Maybe he does.

335
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,782
- Maybe.
- Thanks.

336
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,258
- Pleasant flight,
mrs. Rathaway?

337
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,626
- Yes, quite.
Thank you.

338
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,897
- Careful, please.
It's worth a fortune.

339
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,064
- Welcome home, mr. Rathaway.

340
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,800
- Thank you, ethan.

341
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:02,441
- Sir, your son hartley...
he called again.

342
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,509
- We don't have
a son anymore.

343
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,650
- Someone better call 911.

344
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,664
- Move.
Move!

345
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,132
- Snart, freeze.

346
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,943
- Mick!
- Gaaaah!

347
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,344
- What the hell?

348
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,047
- Why do they call you people
the heat?

349
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,382
<i>I'm the heat!</i>

350
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,322
- Forget them, mick.
Get ready for him.

351
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:53,058
- It's beautiful.

352
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,960
- Mick.

353
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,795
Mick.

354
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,797
<i>Mick!</i>

355
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,969
We go, now!

356
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,184
Is he all right?

357
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,221
Okay.

358
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,390
- Hey. Hey, are you okay?

359
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,791
- I'll call you back.

360
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,994
I'm fine.

361
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,629
Snart's new partner,

362
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:34,032
He's got this
handheld flamethrower.

363
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,668
Almost everyone was treated
on the scene, but...

364
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,603
We got two in the burn unit,
though.

365
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,605
- I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you.

366
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,173
- It's all good.
But...

367
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,710
The next time snart
and his pyro pal show up,

368
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:49,948
You make them sorry
they ever messed with you.

369
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,683
I got to call the hospital.

370
00:20:56,122 --> 00:21:00,392
- The cop's bullet ruptured the
secondary internal fuel chamber.

371
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,060
It could've been worse.

372
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,262
You were right to get me
to learn every part and circuit

373
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,898
Of this thing.
Repairing it was...

374
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,166
A snap.

375
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:09,601
- Give me one reason

376
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,436
I don't kill you right now.

377
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,038
- It's gonna be hard to find

378
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,673
Someone else to listen
to your winning speeches.

379
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,008
- You lost it out there,
just like the last job.

380
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,177
You lost focus, became obsessed.

381
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,513
- I'm obsessed?
What about you?

382
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,615
You're usually counting
the seconds, got the whole thing

383
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,352
Planned out,
dotting "t"s, crossing "I"s.

384
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,721
But all you care about now
is the flash.

385
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,556
- We have to put him down.
- Why?

386
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,191
We got the finger painting.

387
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,593
It's worth millions.
It's ours.

388
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:35,894
We're rich. Job done.

389
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,395
- And what about the next job,
mick?

390
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,064
And the job after that?

391
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,665
With weapons like these,

392
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,602
No one can stand against us,
no one except the flash.

393
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,878
If you want out,
take the painting and go.

394
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,916
But if you want central city
to be our home where we can do

395
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:01,519
And take whatever we want...

396
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:04,255
This is our chance...

397
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,157
Your chance.

398
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,994
- Mm.

399
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,801
Very motivational.

400
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,737
How do we get him?

401
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:22,307
- The flash
isn't so different from us.

402
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,409
He's got partners too.

403
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,752
- Jason rush?

404
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,654
- Yes. Dr. Snow?

405
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:38,757
- Please, call me caitlin.
Thank you for meeting me.

406
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,091
- Oh, happy to.

407
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,826
Although,
to be totally up front,

408
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,295
If this is about the resume
I mailed in to s.T.A.R. Labs,

409
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:47,298
I've already accepted a position
at mercury labs.

410
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,102
- No, actually, I wanted to talk
to you about f.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.

411
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,175
- I'm sorry. This was a mistake.
I have to go.

412
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,244
- No, look, someone
I care about is in trouble,

413
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:04,315
And you're the only clue
I have to help him.

414
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,417
Please.

415
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,189
- What's the line?

416
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:14,859
I never got paranoid till they
started plotting against me?

417
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,195
- Why would they be
plotting against you?

418
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,731
- Because of our work,
because of f.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.

419
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,366
- Transmutation,

420
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,168
The ability to alter matter
on a molecular level.

421
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,903
- We had some rudimentary
success

422
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:28,039
With our stage one testing,
working with sand grains.

423
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,841
But professor stein
said that we should...

424
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,043
- Sorry, professor martin stein?

425
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,012
He was the co-author
of the paper?

426
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,414
- Yeah, he was our team leader.

427
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,818
He didn't believe in baby steps,
so we skipped to stage three.

428
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,320
- Which was?

429
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:45,056
- We melted a concrete wall.

430
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,025
But the university
threatened to shut us down.

431
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:48,593
So professor stein

432
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,795
Published his paper
without them giving permission,

433
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,497
And they went nuts.

434
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,032
So he went to talk
to a friend of his

435
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,167
To secure private backing.
- And who was that?

436
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,970
- He didn't say.
He just said he'd call me later.

437
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:03,208
And no one has seen or heard
from professor stein since.

438
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,543
- What do you think
happened to him?

439
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,213
- All I know is that the army
showed up the next day

440
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:11,049
And confiscated
all of our research.

441
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:15,420
So tell me, dr. Snow, do you
think I'm being too paranoid,

442
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,089
Or not paranoid enough?

443
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,416
- Car trouble?

444
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,821
Aah! Aah!

445
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,273
- I hope we're not enemies.

446
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,876
- What? No, of course not.

447
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:15,513
- I thought you might blame me

448
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,482
For pushing you
to pursue your training

449
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:19,818
Rather than help the police.

450
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,287
- Look, I'm an adult.

451
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,190
I make my own choices,
my own mistakes.

452
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,328
And I'm glad
you push me to be better.

453
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,264
It's so weird.

454
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,933
There was a time in my life

455
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:38,937
That I would've paid money
for your autograph.

456
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,605
And now we're...

457
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,640
- Partners.

458
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:49,781
- I was gonna say friends.

459
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:55,787
- In case you doubt it,
you push me to be better too.

460
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,057
- Guys, you have to come
look at this.

461
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,892
When the heat gun was fired,

462
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,261
It increased the surrounding
temperature of the air

463
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:07,065
Dramatically, sort of like
an extreme heat wave.

464
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,766
Heat wave.
- Stop doing that.

465
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,902
- Okay. I measured
the temperature output

466
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,204
Of both the cold
and heat guns, right?

467
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,907
And while the cold gun
achieves absolute zero,

468
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,910
The heat gun successfully
reaches absolute hot,

469
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,778
Or the hottest temperature
an object can reach.

470
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,015
- Planck temperature.
- So potentially,

471
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,217
These two guns
could cancel each other out.

472
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,854
- Yeah, but to do that, you'd
have to make them cross streams.

473
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,623
- You mean like<i> ghostbusters?</i>

474
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,892
- That film is surprisingly
scientifically accurate.

475
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:36,828
- And really quite funny.

476
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,663
- Hey, joe. What's up?

477
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,512
Joe, anything?

478
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:56,915
- There's no sign of caitlin.

479
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,050
Oh, my god.

480
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,622
We're getting her back.
We have to find snart.

481
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,924
- Damn right we do.

482
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:08,760
Come on, let's go.

483
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,098
- Joe, joe.

484
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,668
We got a hit,
a second pair of prints.

485
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,436
They belong to a mick rory.

486
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,271
- Who is he?
- Big-time arsonist.

487
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,907
He and snart worked a job
last year that went bad.

488
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,642
Half of rory's body
was burned in a fire

489
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,477
That got out of control.

490
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,446
He escaped from an ambulance
on the way to the hospital,

491
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,615
Hasn't been seen since.

492
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:32,784
Why would they kidnap
someone like caitlin?

493
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:35,119
- Joe, thawne,
it's on every station.

494
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,490
- Greetings, citizens
of central city.

495
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,993
I am leonard snart.

496
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,395
But you can call me cold.

497
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:47,465
I'm gonna make this very simple
for everyone.

498
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:50,501
That red streak you've been
hearing whispers about,

499
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:55,006
The one mysteriously saving
people these past few months?

500
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,276
Well, surprise, he's real.

501
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,514
He calls himself the flash.

502
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:08,086
Porter and main, tonight,
sundown.

503
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,055
Come out, come out,
wherever you are, flash.

504
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,691
Show the whole world
you're real.

505
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,795
Or this woman dies.

506
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,798
- No, don't come for me.
Stay away!

507
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,877
- You're a friend of his, huh?

508
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,146
He's fast...

509
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,315
Like fire.

510
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,184
Fire, it's undefinable.

511
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:44,022
Heat, light, energy.

512
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,224
It's an evolution
when things burn.

513
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,893
- You're sick.

514
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,130
- Maybe you're the sick ones.
You ever think about that?

515
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,564
- Not really.

516
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,700
- Mm.

517
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,169
You've got third-degree burns.

518
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,072
Why didn't you get skin grafts?

519
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,408
- The fire revealed
my true self,

520
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,543
Showed me who I really am.

521
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,812
I wonder what your flash
will reveal

522
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,815
When I burn his suit
and skin off.

523
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,786
- Do whatever you want to me,
but leave him alone.

524
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:18,289
- Oh, okay.

525
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,591
You and this flash must be
really close

526
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,994
If you're willing
to die for him, hmm?

527
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,231
You want me to show you
who you really are?

528
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:30,134
That'd be fun.

529
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:34,072
Show you who you...
Really are.

530
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,274
- Mick.

531
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,909
Time to go.

532
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,480
- You better pray
the next people

533
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:45,950
That come
through this door is us.

534
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,065
- Hey.
- Okay, you're on.

535
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,467
Good luck, son.

536
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,634
- Thanks.

537
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,703
- Barry,
after tonight,

538
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,972
Everyone's gonna know
that the flash exists.

539
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,574
Are you ready for that?

540
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:13,544
- I'll see you soon.

541
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,478
- Did... did you see that?

542
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,214
That was him.
That was the flash.

543
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,649
- I don't believe it.

544
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,990
- Believe it.

545
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:01,859
- The scarlet speedster.

546
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:05,163
Any preference
on how you'd like to die?

547
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:08,866
The flame or the frost?

548
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,503
Not in the mood for chitchat.
Gotcha.

549
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,305
Ready when you are.

550
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,455
- Cover me!

551
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,627
Run on this.

552
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:47,838
- Barry.
Barry, are you okay?

553
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,106
You know what you have to do.

554
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,309
- Yeah, get them
to cross their beams

555
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,877
And cancel their guns out.
I know.

556
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,178
- Mick!

557
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,149
- Ah!
Gotcha!

558
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:08,092
Yeah, not as easy
as it sounds.

559
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,731
- Eddie, eddie!

560
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:16,000
- Iris, what are you doing here?
- They evacuated jitters.

561
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,702
I saw your car.
- No, you can't be here.

562
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:18,936
It's not safe.

563
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,379
- Are you sure caitlin's here,
cisco?

564
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,047
- Starting from caitlin's car,

565
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,716
I pieced together surveillance
footage that led us

566
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,284
To his general area.

567
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,286
- But there's over a dozen
warehouses here.

568
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,754
- Yeah, but only one of them

569
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,923
Has had the heat on
the last three nights.

570
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:41,192
And I'm betting
mick rory likes it hot.

571
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:43,060
- Okay.

572
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,029
Stay behind me.

573
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,539
- Caitlin.
- Hmm!

574
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,908
- Caitlin, is that you?
- Mm-mm.

575
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:01,846
- Caitlin.
- No!

576
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,447
- We're gonna get you
out of here.

577
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,082
Cisco!

578
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,584
Cisco, down!

579
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,630
- The fight is spreading
beyond the evac area.

580
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,632
We need to expand the perimeter.

581
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,470
- We can't.
We can't let this spread.

582
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,149
Oh, my god!

583
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,617
- Thawne, where are you going?

584
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:40,918
- Eddie, eddie.
- Thawne!

585
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,965
- I thought I was gonna die.

586
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,768
- Not while I'm around.

587
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,104
Or him.

588
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,320
- Hold on!

589
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:19,690
I got him!
- Look out, look out, look out!

590
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,332
- I can't get them
to cross streams.

591
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,534
Speed isn't getting it done.

592
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,303
- You're right.

593
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:35,673
Maybe the way to do this
is not by going faster.

594
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:37,308
- It's going slower.

595
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,009
- Yes.

596
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,745
- Okay.

597
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,819
- Thanks for playing, kid.

598
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,356
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

599
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,124
I didn't see that coming.

600
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,560
I guess you win this time.

601
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,630
- There won't be a next time.

602
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,402
Thank you, detective.

603
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,115
- Aah!
I'm gonna burn

604
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,484
Every last one of you pigs!

605
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,319
Get your hands off me!

606
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,954
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

607
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,624
Yaaaaah!

608
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,864
- Partner's a real hothead.
- That's funny.

609
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,599
- You know what's hilarious,
snart?

610
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:09,800
We got you.

611
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:11,368
- Congratulations.

612
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,437
- Get him out of here.

613
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,610
- Nice work, eddie.

614
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,479
- It wasn't me.

615
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,448
It was the flash.

616
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,184
We're not gonna
be needing these for the trial.

617
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,520
You'll make sure...
- they'll never hurt anyone

618
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,955
Ever again.

619
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,729
- Mr. Ramon.

620
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,665
Thank you.

621
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,506
- He was like a lightning bolt,
zipping through the streets.

622
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,808
Took them both out
singlehandedly.

623
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,544
- That's amazing.
- I wonder who he is.

624
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,647
- If you ask me, he's a hero.

625
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,853
- Okay, all right.
- I think that's it.

626
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,956
- This better be it.

627
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,892
- Well, like you said,

628
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:09,927
You're ten minutes away,
so if you forget something...

629
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:10,929
- Okay.

630
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,234
Dad.

631
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:20,170
- I can't say it enough.

632
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,106
I'll miss you.

633
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,511
- You know you can come
around anytime, joe.

634
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:30,347
Just give us a heads-up.

635
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,916
Or not.

636
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,951
Come around whenever.

637
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:36,220
You want a key?

638
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,091
I'm gonna go.

639
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,861
I'll wait... In the truck.

640
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,574
- Why don't I give
you two a minute?

641
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,183
- Well...
Look, I know things have been

642
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,352
Really weird
between us recently.

643
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,622
- Yeah, they have.

644
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,162
- Well, did you know
that I can see into the future?

645
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:19,263
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

646
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:20,664
Did I forget to tell you that?

647
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,499
- You did not mention it, no.

648
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,269
Wow.

649
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,271
So what do you see?

650
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:35,779
- I see you and eddie
being really happy together.

651
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,449
And things aren't weird
between us anymore.

652
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:43,520
It took a little time,
but everything's back to normal,

653
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:47,591
And we're still best friends.

654
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,628
- The future
doesn't sound so bad.

655
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,096
- No.

656
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:56,400
And it'll be here faster
than you think.

657
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:02,973
- Dad, is it okay if I...

658
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,141
- Yeah.

659
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,919
My baby girl.

660
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,863
- See you.

661
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,371
Pffft.
Well...

662
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,546
- You okay?

663
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,515
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,183
How about you?

665
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:48,919
- It was bound
to happen sometime, right?

666
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:50,487
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,923
- Want to order some pizza
and watch the ball game?

668
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,325
- Make it pizzas and you're on.

669
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,662
- You know, if you ever
need somebody

670
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,330
To come and eat your food,
I'm there.

671
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,999
Besides, the laundry machines
in my building

672
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,901
Have been broken for,
like, a month, so...

673
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:05,569
- I don't know why you

674
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,404
Moved into that deathtrap
in the first place,

675
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,740
Since you still got
a perfectly good room here.

676
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,375
- You said you were turning it
into a gym.

677
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:14,845
- We both know I'm not
turning it into a gym.

678
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,480
- Yeah.
- Besides,

679
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:20,384
You got me running around enough
as it is.

680
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:22,653
- You know, it is getting hard
to hide the blasting

681
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:25,556
In and out of my apartment
at all hours of the night

682
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:27,758
From my neighbors.

683
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,096
I suppose it would make sense
for me to move back in.

684
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,099
I mean, I am a millennial.
That is what we do.

685
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,135
Well, don't do it
on my account.

686
00:40:38,137 --> 00:40:39,737
I'll be fine on my own.

687
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,205
- Oh, yeah, me too.

688
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:44,475
Sure.

689
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,481
All right, roomie.
You order the pizzas.

690
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:51,815
I'll unpack.

691
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,318
- No way.

692
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,686
I want to help you.

693
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,822
I want to enjoy this.

694
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,958
- All right.

695
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,630
You know this does nothing
to me.

696
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,332
- Just drink it.
- Mm-hmm.

697
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,974
- I should've burned
the entire city block down.

698
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,877
But instead, I listened to you.

699
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,578
We had the painting.
We had the guns.

700
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,314
We could've had everything.

701
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,050
But you had your stupid plan.

702
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,220
How is that stupid plan
