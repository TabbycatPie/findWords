变得更坚强一点

更健康一点  然后更远一点

没人发现我消失了18个小时吗

你们怎么没在制作寻人启事啊
Why aren't you all making posters?

84
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,910
我以为你在办公室呢
I figured you were in your office.

85
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,410
我昨晚很早就睡了
I went to bed really early last night,

86
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,860
我今早起床的时候  以为你去跑步了
and when I woke up this morning, I thought you'd gone for a run.

87
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,600
艾丽克斯呢  难以置信
Alex? I can't believe this!

88
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
亲爱的  重要的是你没事
Well, honey, the important thing is that you are okay.

89

我很抱歉  但是我得去上班了
Now, I'm very sorry, but I've got to get to work.

90

竞标一个大项目

92
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,500

I'm back in there.

93

我想住在外面

94
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,450
不行  先生  我们不要再争这个事了
No, Senor, we're not having that argument anymore.

毛克利就住在外面

96

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,530
父母开炸薯条油驱动车的脏小孩吗
whose parents drive the car that runs on French fry oil?

98
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,610
不是  是《丛林奇谭》书里跑来跑去的脏小孩
No. It's that dirty kid that runs around "The Jungle Book."

99
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,160
杰  告诉他不可以住外面
Jay, tell him he can't.

100
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,890
我第一次看《人猿泰山》的时候  也想住外面
First time I saw "Tarzan," I wanted to live outside.

101
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,840
老爸说可以  我就走进森林里  认识了个流浪汉
Dad said fine. I walked in the woods, met a hobo.

102
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,320
他教我用鸟喙开罐头
Taught me how to open a can with a bird's beak.

103
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,250
这故事可没有帮助
That story's not helping!

104
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,420
我非去不可
I'm doing it.

105
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,700
不行  杰
No! Jay!

106
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,620
当然不行

为何要学习自力更生
Why learn self-reliance when the industrial machine

108
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,570
工业机器就仰仗不断的消耗不是吗
depends on constant consumption?

109
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,790
我不吃蛋了  我喝粥
No eggs for me. I'll be having porridge.

110
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,770
你真的还要这么做吗
Are you really still doing this?

111
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,780
这个夏天  我去华雷斯参加婚礼时认识了弗里达

113

共产主义会如何消除世界上的不公

114

多华丽的婚宴啊
Mm. What a beautiful reception.

115
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,140
可不
Yeah.

116
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,460
对  这不是个好东西
Oh, right. That's a bad thing.

117
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,130
我现在生活很朴素  对我也有好处
I live simply now, and it's good for me.

118
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,390
这可能助我有朝一日亲到她吗  是的
Might it also help my chance of kissing her one day? Yes.

119
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,960
如果这意味着我必须生活在一个
And if that requires living in a world

120
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,090
由政府选择我们所有歌曲的世界  也没关系
where the government chooses all our songs, so be it.

121
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,140
我要端杯咖啡
I'm gonna take a coffee

122
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,010
给装监控摄像头的家伙
to the guy putting up the security cameras.

123
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,860
劳动者需要的不是咖啡  杰  是尊严
It's not coffee the laborers need, Jay. It's dignity.

124
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,930
我要为此抗争
And I'm going to fight for that

125
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,020
直到我擦破手指  压弯脊背
until my fingers are raw and my back is bent.

126
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,200
六个月前  你还因为泡了太多泡泡浴
Six months ago, we took you to the dermatologist

127
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,420
被我们带去看皮肤科医生
for taking too many bubble baths.

128
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,030
给你倒了杯咖啡
Brought you this.

129
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,780
谢谢  快搞定了
Oh, thanks. Almost done here.

130
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,780
慢慢来
Take your time.

131
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,260
重要的是...
Important thing is...

132
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,610
糟糕
Oh, no.

133
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,130
你猜怎么着
Guess what.

134
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,250
我装上监控摄像头的同一天
A black family's moving in right across the street

135
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,600
对面搬来了一家黑人
the same day my security cameras are going up.

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,870
这不能赖我啊
Well, what am I supposed to do?

137
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,330
我几周前就预约了
I made the appointment weeks ago

138
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,230
就在这条街上发生了入室盗窃之后
right after the break-in down the street.

139
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,580
但他们会以为我是一看到他们就决定的
But they'll think I made the call the minute I saw them

140
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,390
因为我是个种族歧视的老男人
because I'm a racist old man.

141
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
为什么邻居会假设你有种族歧视呢
Why would the neighbors just assume that you're a racist?

142
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,580
歌洛莉亚  歌洛莉亚  歌洛莉亚
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria.

143
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,150
你永远不会理解白人老男人所面临的成见
You'll never understand the stereotypes old white men face.

144
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,060
进了
Goal!

145
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,540
好球  汤姆
Nice shot, Tom.

146
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,760
你想跟我们一起玩吗
Do you want to play with us?

147
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
我现在不玩硬汉接触性运动了
You know, I'm off contact sports right now.

148
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,310
因为我玩家庭跑步猜谜时把脚踝扭了
I twisted my ankle playing running charades,

149
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,730
但你俩该准备去上舞蹈课了
but you two should get ready for dance class.

150
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,410
快点去
Okay, go. Go, go, go!

151
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,170
你为什么看起来这么心满意足
Okay, why do you look so satisfied?

152
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,660
是不是刚听到证明
Did you just listen to an NPR story

153
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,880
你某件事说对了的广播报道
that proved you right about something?

154
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,420
不  但你知道汤姆吧
No, no, but you know Tom,

155
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,760
跟莉莉一起玩的朋友
the friend that Lily's playing with?

156
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,960
我听说过  但莉莉还没正式介绍我们认识
Well, I know of him. We haven't formally been introduced.

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,960
其实汤姆以前是女孩缇娜呢
Well, it turns out that Tom used to identify as...Tina.

158
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,440
真希望你没有告诉我这事
Oh, I wish you wouldn't have told me.

159
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,250
我本来对自己的性别识别雷达很自豪呢
You know how proud I am of my gender identificadar.

160
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,370
汤姆在学校一直不太顺遂
Well, Tom's been having some problems at school,

161
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,860
但莉莉一直都很尊重他
and -- and Lily has been really respectful of him.

162
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,570
她太贴心了
Oh, she is so sweet.

163
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,830
是的
She really is.

164
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,820
这一切全是她自己的功劳
She gets all the credit on this one.

165
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,200
谁的功劳真的不重要
This so doesn't matter.

166
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,860
是我们教育她要勇于接受新事物
We raised her to have an open mind.

167
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,380
的确  我们也应该被点个赞
Totally. We deserve some kudos here, too.

168
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,090
点的赞够我们每人都有赞了
There's enough kudos for everyone.

169
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,130
"点赞"会是杰出教育奖的绝妙名字啊
You know, a kudo would be an excellent name for a parenting award.

170
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,860
谢谢你  格温妮丝
Oh, thank you, Gwyneth.

171
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,570
莉莉  如果你还在看颁奖转播  快去睡觉
Lily, if you're still watching, go to bed.

172
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,610
滚出去  你个怪胎
Get out of here, you weirdo!

173
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,330
当老板之后就会变成扫兴鬼
Part of being the boss is being a bummer.

174
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,230
一开始心里挺难受  但我逐渐学会了接受
It was hard at first, but I've learned to accept it...

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,690
通常都能吧
mostly.

176
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,410
真的很...
It's really been...

177
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,700
玛格丽特  你明知道我就在这里
Margaret, you knew I was in here.

178
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,970
抱歉  我刚收到了一些消息
Sorry. I just had some messages.

179
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,740
卢克的辅导员说
Uh-huh. Luke's guidance counselor --

180
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,870
卢克又在课上睡觉了
Luke fell asleep in class again.

181
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,840
海莉的汽车贷款迟交了
Haley's car payment is late.

182
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,520
还有信用卡公司说
And the credit-card company.

183
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,870
菲尔在一家名为
Phil made a large purchase

184
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,170
应对困难蜡烛网的西藏网站上进行了大采购
on a Tibetan website called CopingCandles.Com.

185
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,690
让创意团队别嬉皮笑脸了
Tell the creative team to get their giggles out.

186
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,230
我十分钟后就能见他们
I'll be ready for them in 10.

187
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,630
但当你上班时一直是扫兴鬼
But when you've been the bummer all day at work,

188
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,230
你就不会想在家也是这个身份
you don't love having to be the bummer at home, too.

189
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,020
亲爱的  你弟弟在吗  我有事骂他几句
Hi, honey. Is your brother around? I need to yell at him.

190
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,180
他当然在
Of course he's around.

191
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,440
他怎么可能会不吵我
Why would he leave me in peace

192
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
乖乖在餐桌上写点作业
to do some work at the kitchen table

193
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,720
而不是强行冲进来...
when he could just barge in and --

194
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,410
卢克  关掉游戏
Luke! Game down!

195
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,370
你今年读高三
This is your senior year,

196
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,460
也是你能不当废柴的最后一年了
also known as your last year to not suck.

197
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,520
-亲爱的  -爸爸  你点一下"提交订单"
- Honey. - Dad, you hit "Place order" once,

198
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,450
然后等着确认
and then you wait for the confirmation.

199
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,400
-抱歉  -别抱歉  聪明点
- I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry! Be smart!

200
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,880
那愤怒的怒吼
That angry screeching

201
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840
是我家新任扫兴鬼传来的天籁之声
was the sweet sound of my new home bummer.

202
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,200
我好累  好痛苦  好烦躁
I'm just so tired and in pain and irritable.

203
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,420
这让我非常生所有人的气
It just makes me so mad at everyone.

204
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,900
抱歉嚷嚷了  妈妈  你为什么打电话来
Sorry for yelling, Mom. Why were you calling again?

205
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,110
我忘记了
I forgot.

206
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,110
去你的  妈妈  下次写下来
Damn it, Mom! Write it down next time!

207
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,950
好了
All right.

208
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,110
我们到了
Here we are.

209
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,010
好  别忘了给放克大师琳达
Okay. Don't forget to give Funkmaster Linda her check

210
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,310
今天课程的支票
for today's class.

211
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,630
-再见  汤姆  -再见  汤姆
- Bye, Tom. - Bye, Tom.

212
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,790
莉莉  你能待一会再下车吗
Hey, Lily. Can you hang back a second?

213
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,530
我不该多待  琳达说迟到的人逊爆了
I shouldn't. Linda says being late is wiggity-wack.

214
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,070
我们只是想知道你在家时为什么
We just want to know why you called Tom a weirdo

215
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,170
叫了汤姆怪胎
back at the house.

216
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,290
我不知道
I don't know.

217
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,640
我们不能取笑跟我们不一样的人  好吗
Okay, well, we don't make fun of people who are different, okay?

218
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,230
-你知道二爸和我有多艰难吗  -是啊
- You know how hard it was for Daddy and me? - Yeah.

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,860
我在保守的密苏里州长大  受尽了欺侮
Growing up in Missouri, I was so mistreated

220
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,610
我最好的朋友之一是我在小溪里找到的
that one of my best friends was an old scarecrow

221
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,500
一个老稻草人
I found in the creek.

222
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,070
你的故事要是少说点细节
Some of your stories would be more impactful

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,310
会更有震撼力
with fewer details.

224
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,130
好吧  我下次不会了  我可以走了吗
Fine. I won't do it again. Can I go now?

225
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,610
但你明白你做的事为什么错了吗
Okay, but -- but do you understand why what you did is wrong?

226
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,750
明白了
Yes!

227
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,250
心里好膈应啊
Well, this bothers me.

228
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,270
他们本来处得很好  就因为起一点小争执
They're getting along great, and then one little spat,

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,530
她下意识就是喷出幼稚无知的话吗
and her instinct is to go all baby bigot on him?

230
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,940
我这话是带着爱说的
Well -- and I say this with love --

231
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,220
但她这整个夏天是和你保守老家的家人
she did just get back from spending a full summer

232
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,840
一起度过的
with your family in Missouri.

233
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,880
所以是要怪我的家人吗
Oh. So we're blaming my family, then?

234
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,330
我只是想说  或许她从那里回来后
I'm -- I'm just saying maybe when she gets back from there,

235
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,130
需要再提醒她我们的价值观
she needs to be reminded of our values.

236
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,960
你懂  反土逼化一下
You know -- un-hick her.

237
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,910
哎妈  土字都上来啦  
Oh, the H-bomb!

238
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,540
这大概是针对美国南方人
Possibly the most offensive slur

239
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,320
最具冒犯性的侮辱词了吧
ever thrown around in the South.

240
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,900
是吗  还有...
Well...y--

241
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,350
我喜欢那里的人啊
Look, I-I love those people, too,

242
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,640
但你刚的确也承认了
but you did just admit

243
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,610
他们可能有些守旧
they can be a little close-minded down there.

244
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,350
他们是有点老古板啦
Well, they are a little bit set in their ways.

245
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,620
1980年之前  没胡子的人去竞选市长
It was actually illegal to run for mayor without a mustache

246
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,000
-是违法的  -瞧
- until 1980. - See? It's --

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
-82年到85年也是这样  -好吧
- And then again from '82 to '85. - Okay.

248
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
{\an8}输入错误

249
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,720
输入
Input.

250
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,510
输入
Input!

251
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,850
请不要再扔遥控器了
Please don't throw the remote again.

252
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,850
我只是在试着找信号
Oh, I was just, like, trying to get signal.

253
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,930
另外几个遥控器坏了又不能赖我
Don't blame me about breaking the other ones.

254
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,030
有一个是意外被踩坏
One got stepped on,

255
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,870
另一个是意外掉进食物打碎机
and the other one fell down the garbage disposal.

256
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,030
这些理由也太假了
You're not even trying.

257
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,380
总之  别再担心你的遥控器了
Anyways, stop worrying about the remote control

258
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,820
担心一下你的狗吧
and worry about your own dog.

259
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,610
她在墙角撒尿
She's peeing in the corner.

260
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,740
说不定你把她留在外面
Maybe if you ever leave her outside,

261
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,270
她就能看家护院  我们也不需要摄像头了
she will guard us, and we wouldn't need cameras.

262
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,260
首先  斯黛拉并不会在墙角撒尿
First of all, Stella's not peeing in the corner,

263
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,520
因为她的如厕习惯是我亲自训练的
because I housebroke her myself.

264
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,610
其次  我的狗永远不需要工作
Second of all, no dog of mine should ever have to work.

265
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,560
他来了  我的老朋友
There he is. There's my old pal.

266
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,830
杰  你最近怎么样
Jay. How you doing, huh?

267
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,230
真高兴你能打给我
I'm so glad you called.

268
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,130
自从跟瑞内塔分手以后我就不怎么见朋友了
I haven't been good about seeing people since Reynetta left.

269
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,960
你听说了吗  她开始跟我弟约会了
Did you hear? She started dating my brother!

270
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,500
今天天气这么好  我们去外面聊吧
Listen, it's such a nice day. Let's go outside.

271
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,450
你家后院环境不是更好吗
Isn't your backyard nicer?

272
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,910
没有啊  只有个泳池和一些椅子
Nah. It's all pool and chairs.

273
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,340
所以你近来如何啊  兄弟
So, how you been, buddy?

274
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,220
我也想跟你说一切都好让你不用担心
I want to tell you everything is okay so you won't worry,

275
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,500
可是情况真的太糟了
but things have been real bad.

276
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,380
你知道有什么能帮助你吗
You know what might help?

277
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,670
把帽子摘了  让你的脸接触阳光
You pop that hat off, you get a little sun on your face.

278
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,360
阳光太刺眼了
Ooh! The sun is rough on my eyes.

279
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,190
我几乎每天都哭
I cry almost every day.

280
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,060
基本上我只有擦枪的时候才会开心一点
Pretty much, the only time I'm happy is when I clean my gun.

281
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,150
生活就是这样  给我一个拥抱吧
Yeah, life, huh? Here, give me a hug.

282
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,230
就是这样
There you go. Oh.

283
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,490
就是这样  杰  你真是个好朋友
There you go. You're a good friend, Jay.

284
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,220
你自己也有很多麻烦  可你还是会帮我
You got your own problems, but you're right there for me.

285
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,000
靠
Damn it!

286
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,150
你为什么需要他们知道你有个黑人朋友
Why do you need them to know you have a black friend?

287
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,570
我装摄像头的那天他们刚好搬进来
I'm putting security cameras in the same day they move in.

288
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,020
这事我很生气  但是被抱抱的感觉挺好
I'm mad about that, but it feels good to be held.

289
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,030
过来
Come here.

290
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,000
过来
Come here.

291
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,620
记忆重现  恶梦  焦虑
Flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety --

292
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,410
我被锁在壁橱里的经历
My imprisonment in the closet

293
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,940
导致我出现了创伤后应激障碍的所有症状
resulted in all the symptoms of PTSD.

294
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,880
我的保险公司帮我找了一条治疗犬
My insurance company helped me to find a therapy dog

295
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,520
并且同意报销全部费用
and agreed to cover everything,

296
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,750
直到他们发现我不是参军得病
and then they found out I wasn't in the military.

297
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,660
不是吧
Oh, boy.

298
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,770
艾丽克斯  亲爱的你能帮我重启路由器吗
Hey, Alex, honey, could you help me reset the router?!

299
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,410
人家怕怕
Oh! No.

300
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,110
室内开伞要倒霉  要倒霉
Bad luck! Bad luck!!

301
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,980
艾丽克斯的电脑里有她在高中
Alex's laptop had every piece of homework

302
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,580
完成过的所有作业
she ever did in high school.

303
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,300
简直就是传说中的圣杯
It was the Holy Grail...

304
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,460
是这么叫吧
I think.

305
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,330
多亏了艾丽克斯的当年努力
Thanks to Alex's hard work,

306
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,200
我这辈子都不需要学习这词的意思了
I don't know what that is and never will.

307
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,230
不能再来一次了
Not again!

308
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,570
爸  我不知道你在家
Oh, Dad, I didn't know you were home.

309
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,630
海莉  谢天谢地
Haley, thank God.

310
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,860
你能帮我重启路由器吗
Could you reset the router for me?

311
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,580
我也想  可我午饭吃晚了
I would, but I took a late lunch from work,

312
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,060
我得赶紧回去上班了
which I have to get back to work.

313
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,710
-你没事吧  -我没事
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

314
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,190
我只是紧张导致换气过度了
I think I'm just hyperventilating.

315
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,930
可能过个二十来分钟就好了
Should pass in like 20 minutes or s-so.

316
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,920
好吧  我要回公司了
Okay, well, I'm gonna head back.

317
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,810
我也不能老是迟到
Wouldn't want to be consistently late

318
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,430
结果被炒吧
and get fired, right?

319
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,300
艾丽克斯  亲爱的
Alex, honey.

320
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,940
乖孩子
Good girl.

321
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,020
乖孩子[狗狗]
Good girl.

322
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,840
输入  我知道你能听到我的话
Input! I know you can hear me

323
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,600
因为我看到你闪绿光了
because I can see your green light!

324
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,030
感觉就像在看凶残比特犬跟小鸡
It's like one of those videos where the pit bull

325
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,230
一起游泳的视频一样
swims with the baby chick.

326
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,220
你知道肯定会有坏事发生
You just know something bad's gonna happen.

327
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,970
你的车钥匙呢  我需要从你车借电
Where are your keys? I need the jumper cables.

328
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,420
-发生什么了  -我待了一个小时在车上
- What happened? - I spent the last hour in my car,

329
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,950
开窗听黑人放克乐团的歌  听到车没电
listening to the Commodores with my windows down,

330
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,000
结果我们的邻居都没出来过
and the neighbors didn't even come outside.

331
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,320
肯定是你的黑人好朋友哈林篮球队
That must be your good friends the Harlem Globetrotters.

332
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,230
-你好  -你好
- Hey. - Hey!

333
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,530
歌洛莉亚邀请我们到泳池边
Gloria invited us to sit by the pool

334
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,140
待到莉莉上完嘻哈课程
till we have to pick up Lily at hip-hop.

335
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,790
我的亚洲孙女在学黑人音乐嘻哈吗
My Asian granddaughter takes a hip-hop class?

336
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,290
我们为什么不去前院聊这件事呢
Why are we not talking about this in the front yard?

337
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,780
我们买了纸杯蛋糕  曼尼  吃纸杯蛋糕吗
We brought cupcakes. Manny, cupcake?

338
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,200
我懂了  想拿中产阶级的鸦片堵住我的嘴
Oh, I see. Fill my mouth with bourgie opiates

339
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,500
好让我不能为人民说话吗
so I can't speak for the people?

340
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,630
受不了啊
That was a lot.

341
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,290
他想让一个共产主义接班人的女孩儿亲他
He's trying to get a Communist girl to kiss him.

342
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,770
我们也有关于孩子的烦恼
We have our own kid problems.

343
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,680
今天下午莉莉跟汤姆玩耍期间
I mean, we had an incident this afternoon

344
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,860
发生了一点小摩擦
during Lily's playdate with Tom,

345
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,120
那孩子以前性别认同是"蒂娜"
who used to identify as... Tina.

346
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,370
我不懂你为什么要做这种手势  不过我喜欢
I don't totally get the hand thing, but I like it.

347
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,410
他们吵起来了  莉莉对他说了最不该骂的话
They had a fight, and Lily said the worst possible thing.

348
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,800
那可怜的男孩已经有太多不幸的经历了
I mean, that poor boy's been through enough. Mm.

349
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
他父母肯定也经历了很多困难
Oh, I am sure that the parents have gone through a lot, too.

350
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,610
当然  那种事不可能是
Sure. You just don't get comfortable

351
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,470
一下子就能接受的
with something like that overnight.

352
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,180
我问你们一个问题
Let me ask you guys something.

353
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,440
如果某一天  莉莉想当卢[男生名]
If, someday, Lily wanted to be Lou

354
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,150
然后去做了全套"切切拼拼"的手术
and had the whole chop-chop, bing-bang thing,

355
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,510
你们会作何反应
how would you be with that?

356
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,240
-我们爱莉莉  -是卢
- We love Lily. - Lou.

357
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,360
我们爱卢
We love Lou.

358
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,130
-无论她做任何事都不会  -是他
- And there's nothing she could do -- - He.

359
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,740
-他  -无论他做任何事
- He. -There's nothing he could do

360
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,870
都不会改变我们的爱
that would change that.

361
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,000
所以你们不像汤姆爸妈那样需要时间适应
So you wouldn't even need the minute that Tom's parents did?

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,350
也不是  也许需要一点时间
Well, no, no. Maybe a minute.

363
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,300
有很多我多年来一直幻想要做的事
I mean, there'd-there'd be a lot of things that I'd be giving up

364
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,600
都不能实现了
that I've always imagined doing,

365
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,150
比如在婚礼上挽着身着婚纱的她走过红毯
like -- like walking her down the aisle in her wedding dress.

366
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,570
-你懂的  -或是低声在他老公耳边说
- You know? - Or whispering in her husband's ear

367
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,720
丫永远别想取代我
that he'll never replace me.

368
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,840
这就有趣了  因为当初
Well, that's interesting, because the minute it took me

369
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,630
我也需要一点时间来接受
to accept the fact that my son

370
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,430
我儿子的生活
was living a different

371
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,680
会和我所预期的不同
kind of life than the one that I anticipated,

372
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
米奇尔却说我是个
Mitchell called me an 

373
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,170
老顽固直男
old, straight, white bigot.

374
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,060
而如今你们和我如出一辙
And now you're just like me.

375
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,350
我天  米奇尔  难道莉莉是跟我们学的
Oh, my God, Mitchell. Are we where Lily gets it?

376
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,210
难道我们没有自以为的那么开明吗
Are we not as open-minded as we think?

377
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,650
可仗着自己开明对别人说教是咱的招牌啊
But that's our thing -- lording our tolerance over others.

378
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,360
我想这件事证明了
I guess what this proves is,

379
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,270
每个人都或多或少心存偏见
there's a little bit of prejudice in everyone --

380
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,230
无论是你  我
you, me,

381
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,000
还是街对面因为监控摄像头而评判我的邻居
the neighbor across the street judging me for my cameras.

382
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,480
我要去做我早就该做的事
I'm gonna do what I should have done at the beginning --

383
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,220
和他们把话说开
talk to them.

384
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,730
那可不是个好主意
That's not a good idea.

385
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,780
你等着瞧
Watch me!

386
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,090
乔  我不会让你去野外生活的
Joe, you're not going to live outside!

387
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,880
好吧
Fine!

388
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,050
艾丽克斯总是电脑不离身
Alex is never away from her laptop,

389
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,400
所以我每次只能偷一份作业
so I had to steal assignments one at a time.

390
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,150
我并不以偷窃为荣
I'm not proud of stealing,

391
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,370
但我也不是不以我的手法为傲
but I'm not unproud of how I'm stealing.

392
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,990
宝贝  太对不起了
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

393
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,000
但既然你醒了
but now that you're awake,

394
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
跟我说说家里发生什么事了
what happened in here, huh?

395
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,110
让我告诉你家里发生什么事了
I'll tell you what happened here --

396
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,930
一整天都是这个死样子
the same thing that's been happening all damn day!

397
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,040
我周旋于这些禽兽之间
Me dealing with animals who don't care

398
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,550
他们开着空调还将门窗大敞四开
that we are air-conditioning the outside

399
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,640
坚持要看无趣的家庭主妇互泼红酒
and insist on rotting their brains by watching vapid housewives

400
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,210
来自降智商
spit wine on each other.

401
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,120
而你  连个盘子都懒得用
And you. Can't even be bothered to use a plate!

402
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,870
真是个扫兴鬼  对吧
Oh, she's a bummer, huh?

403
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,910
有什么好笑的吗
Something funny?

404
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,320
没有
No.

405
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,340
你在家做什么
What are you even doing home?

406
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,350
你每周二不是要帮你老板照看猫吗
Don't you cat-sit for your boss on Tuesday nights?

407
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,590
艾丽克斯  也许我带你去散个步或驾车兜风
Alex, maybe you'd feel better if we went for a walk

408
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,600
你会感觉好些  开车带你去遛遛
or a ride in the car, huh? Go for a ride in the car!

409
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,100
这家里让人分心的事太多了
You know what? There are just too many distractions here.

410
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,600
我不在乎我病成啥样了  我得回学校去
I don't care how sick I am. I have to go back to college.

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,230
-不行  -不行
- No! - No!

412
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,400
-不行不行  -你当然得回去
- No, no, no, no, no. - Of course you do!

413
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,510
你猜我是不是那种
Was I the kind of person

414
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,520
会强行把病重的妹妹送回学校
who would send her sick sister back to school

415
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,390
只因为不想让她发现我被解雇了的人
just to keep her from figuring out I got fired?

416
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,660
那你猜我在社区大学时
Did I use her laptop

417
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,360
有没有从靠她作业不挂科
to get through community college?

418
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,650
让我送你回去  今天可是周五
Let's get you back there. It's Friday night.

419
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,740
说不定有派对能让你远远听个热闹
Maybe there's a party you can listen to.

420
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,240
-不好意思  无意打扰  -你好
- Excuse me. I don't mean to bug you. - Hello.

421
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,540
你才搬过来  我就住在街对面
You're just moving in. I'm right across the street.

422
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,980
-听我说  -让我猜猜看
- Listen. - Let me stop you.

423
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,660
你早就预约好今天装监控摄像头
You had the cameras scheduled,

424
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,360
担心我看见了会误会
worried about how it would look,

425
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,780
还特意叫你的黑哥们过来
brought your black friend out,

426
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,420
大声放黑人乐队的歌
blasted Commodores.

427
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,730
我也不是第一次搬进白人社区了
It's not my first time moving into a white neighborhood.

428
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,070
-咱之间没误会  -真的吗
- We're good. - Yeah?

429
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,160
{\an8}该州95%都是白人

430
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,160
我在新罕布什尔州做过实习住院医生呢
I did my residency in New Hampshire.

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,660
好  你们有什么需要尽管开口
All right. Listen, you guys need anything, let me know.

432
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,220
没问题  我叫肖恩  顺带一提
You got it. I'm Shawn, by the way.

433
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,690
-杰·普里契特  -杰
- Jay Pritchett. - Jay.

434
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,010
没事的  歌洛莉亚  都处理好了
It's okay, Gloria. All handled.

435
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,480
这是我妻子  歌洛莉亚
This is my wife, Gloria.

436
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,670
这是肖恩  我希望我的发音准确
This is Shawn -- and I want to get this right,

437
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,660
很美的非洲名字  肖恩·舜玳伊缇
beautiful African name -- Shawn M'badawe.

438
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,890
我说的是"顺带一提"
I said, "by the way."

439
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,220
莉莉  我们需要谈谈
Hey, Lily. We need to talk.

440
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,200
其实我刚好有事要出门
I was actually just heading out.

441
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,790
不许逃  请你坐好
No. Sit down, please.

442
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,850
你对汤姆那么刻薄是不对的  知道吗
Look, it was wrong of you to be mean to Tom, okay?

443
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,630
尽管你大爸和我
Even though Daddy and I

444
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,550
偶尔也在本该开明时没有做到
aren't always as open-minded as we should be,

445
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,810
但我们希望你能青出于蓝
we-we want you to be better than us.

446
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,410
好的
O-kay.

447
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,980
不许逃  我们要接受他人真实的一面
No. Listen. We accept people for who they are.

448
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,810
二爸和我会无条件接受真实的你
Daddy and I would accept you no matter what --

449
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,260
无论男女  无论直弯
boy, girl, gay, straight...

450
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,190
不过如果你是女同
though, if you're a lesbian,

451
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,870
可千万得是风趣的那种
please be the fun kind.

452
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,100
我不是因为汤姆过去是缇娜才吼他
I didn't yell at Tom because he used to be Tina.

453
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,780
-什么  -我吼他是因为他嘲笑...
- What? - I yelled at him 'cause he made fun of...

454
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,560
嘲笑什么
Made fun of what?

455
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,840
-这有什么可笑的  -谢天谢地
- What's-What's to make fun of? - Oh, thank God.

456
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,460
他因为这幅画说你们是怪胎
He called you guys weirdos for putting that painting up,

457
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,000
所以我才说他是怪胎
so I called him a weirdo.

458
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,910
宝贝  你怎么不告诉我们
Well, honey, why didn't you tell us?

459
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,120
因为我不想让你们伤心
'Cause I didn't want your feelings to get hurt.

460
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,840
我们怎么会伤心
Get hurt? How?

461
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,360
就因为那个无礼的汤姆不懂艺术吗
Because that rube Tom knows nothing about art?

462
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,130
小卡  她一直在保护我们
Cam, she was protecting us.

463
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,800
但你不必这样做的  宝贝  知道吗
But you don't have to, sweetie, okay?

464
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,330
你不必为了照顾我们的感受
Don't feel like you can't be honest with us

465
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,980
而有所隐瞒
just to protect our feelings.

466
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,290
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Really.

467
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,510
你有任何想法都可以告诉我们
Hey, you can tell us anything.

468
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,500
好吧
Okay.

469
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,600
我也讨厌那幅画
I hate the painting, too.

470
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,370
听起来虽然很难受  但本着宽容的精神
It was hard for us to hear, but in the spirit of tolerance,

471
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,190
我们接受一个9岁小孩
we accepted the fact that a 9-year-old

472
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
也许不愿意入睡时
might not want to fall asleep

473
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,570
伴着两个半裸的父亲注视的目光这件事
under the watchful eyes of her half-naked fathers.

474
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,500
快通知西斯廷教堂的人  艺术已经过时了
Call the Sistine Chapel. I guess art is out.

475
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,380
你是讨厌壁画  还是单就这...
So, do you hate the whole idea of murals, or just --

476
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,350
快刷
Roll!

477
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,890
绝对很兴奋吧
It's going to be so exciting

478
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,960
要回到到处都是科学东西的地方
to get back to all that science stuff again.

479
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,660
就是烧杯  计算器  激光枪什么的
You know -- beakers, calculators, ray guns.

480
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,510
艾丽克斯  你确定你不想
Alex, are you sure you don't want

481
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,700
在家多休养几天吗
to spend a few more days here to recover?

482
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,960
如果你想的话  你可以睡在我们床尾啊
You can sleep on the end of our bed if you want to.

483
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,140
-对  留下来  艾丽克斯  -睡一觉听起来确实不错
-Yeah, stay, Alex. -Sleeping does sound good.

484
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,950
可不是吗
Doesn't it?

485
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,180
但在那之前  不如先洗一个舒服的热水澡吧
But, first, how about you take a nice, hot shower?

486
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,100
就是希望那一大摞湿毛巾没像今早一样
I just hope that big pile of wet towels isn't on the floor

487
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,120
还在地上
like it was this morning.

488
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,870
你们对我太好了
Aww, you guys are so sweet.

489
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,130
别啊 想想那些科学的东西 
No, but what -- what about all the science stuff?

490
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,310
那些好玩的  比如用实验室护目镜头带
All the fun. You know -- snapping each other in the butts

491
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,170
-互相弹对方的屁股  -其实呢
- with your goggle straps. - You know what?

492
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,420
在这里多留上几天
Staying here a few more days

493
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,560
也许有助我快点恢复健康
may help me kick this sickness a little faster.

494
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,440
这就对了嘛  等一下
There you go. Wait a second.

495
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,350
我记得我不是已经把我的电脑打包进去了吗
I thought I already packed my laptop.

496
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,140
为什么它会在走廊的桌子上
Why is it on the hallway table?

497
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,940
时间万物为何会出现在它出现的地方
Uh, why is anything anywhere?

498
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,970
为什么我们的脚不是在胳膊的后面
Why aren't our feet at the end of our arms?

499
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,900
谁打开了我高三写的《愤怒的葡萄》论文
Who opened my 12th-grade "Grapes of Wrath" essay?

500
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,770
天啊  你想要我留在家
Oh, my God. You just want me to stay here

501
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,640
是为了偷我以前的高中作业
so you can steal all of my old homework.

502
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,070
我迫不及待要听你
Wow. I can't wait to hear what you have

503
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,390
对他这次做错事有何看法
to say about this lapse in judgment.

504
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,130
这也比妈妈在做的事情好多了
Hey, it's better than what Mom's doing.

505
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,980
她在利用你来教训我们
She's just using you to yell at us.

506
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,570
我认为这句顶嘴就该扼杀在摇篮里
I would nip that back talk in the bud.

507
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,340
真不敢相信  他说的是真的
I can't believe it. He's right!

508
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,940
亲爱的  你又开始不开心了
Honey, you're getting upset again.

509
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,310
快来  我们去给你拿零食
Come on. Let's go get a treat.

510
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,700
不要那么抚摸我  还有带我散步之类的
Stop with the petting and -- and the walks.

511
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,510
你就是把我当成一条治疗犬
You're using me as a therapy dog.

512
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,580
这完全是无稽之--
That's ridiculi--

513
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,390
我有吗
Am I?

514
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,800
那卢克干的好事怎么说
Well...what about what Luke's doing?

515
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,820
我们已经处理过他的问题了
We just dealt with him.

516
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,850
还有  海莉
And, Haley...

517
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,910
你是这个家里唯一真正关心我的人
you are the only one who really cares about me.

518
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,020
就这么决定了  我要回学校
That's it! I'm going back to school.

519
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,200
我开车送你  宝贝
I will drive you, sweetie.

520
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,390
艾丽克斯  不要  停下  别动
Alex, no. Stop! Stay!

521
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,980
快跟我说  让人类停下来是怎么说来着
How do you ask a human not to go, again?

522
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,720
-艾丽克斯  等等  -对  等等
-Alex, wait! -Right.

523
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,590
我们不是不走  她就是停下来喘口气
We're still leaving. She's just catching her breath.

524
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,040
别这样  我感觉好糟糕  我没意识到自己犯错
Come on. I feel so bad. I had no idea what I was doing.

525
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,660
那我就感觉更糟糕了  我是明知故犯
I feel worse. I really, really knew what I was doing.

526
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,710
我们家又病又可怜的闺女  
Our poor sick daughter. 

527
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,060
我们应该好好照顾她的
We should be taking care of her.

528
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,610
所以我们是认识到错误就够了
So, is knowing all this enough,

529
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,520
还是需要做点实际的举动呢
or do we have to, like, do something?

530
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,020
我看得都心碎了
Breaks my heart.

531
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,640
我看我得辞掉工作  回来照顾她到康复
I should quit my job and nurse her back to health.

532
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,390
你被辞退了  对吧
You got fired, didn't you?

533
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,970
艾丽克斯不得不休学一学期
Alex had to take the semester off.

534
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,190
我有些失望完全是因为她有些失望
I was disappointed 'cause she was disappointed,

535
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,480
不过我又有点暗爽她能多留在家久一点
but I was also kind of happy to have her home a little longer.

536
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,360
口罩戴上
Aww. Mask!

537
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,390
小卡
Cam?

538
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,950
我就是想告诉她
Oh, I just wanted to tell her how proud I was

539
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,220
我为她今天的表现感到很骄傲
of how she handled herself today,

540
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,480
但她已经睡着了
but she's already asleep. Well,

541
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,710
你可以等她明天醒来再告诉她  好吗
you can tell her in the morning, okay?

542
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,430
对了  我读到一个关于
Oh, by the way, I found an article online

543
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,770
黑山人艺术修复家族的文章...
about a family of Montenegrin art restorers --

544
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,540
算了  宝宝  快走吧  别想它了  
Let it go, babe. Come on. Come on.

545
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,750
小卡
Oh, Cam.

546
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,160
看她多有心
Look what she did.

547
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,490
杰  你在干吗  快回房睡觉吧
Jay, what are you doing? Come to bed.

548
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,360
我有这些最先进技术的摄像头
I've got these new state-of-the-art cameras.

549
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,670
我想我可以回顾一下这一整天
I thought I'd review the day,

550
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,940
我们的邻居到底瞪了我们多少次
see how many times our neighbor glared at us.

551
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,160
等等
Wait a second.

552
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,300
那个是曼尼在舔垃圾箱里杯子蛋糕的包装纸吗
Is that Manny licking cupcake wrappers from the trash?

553
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,560
我就知道他会屈服
I knew he'd fold.

554
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,320
这疯狂的舔势  看起来都有点色情了
Ah, the vigor. It's almost pornographic.

555
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,200
这些摄像头到处都有吗
Are these cameras everywhere?

556
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,690
是啊  刚才那个是垃圾箱周围
Yeah. That's the garbage area.

557
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,250
我们还能看到后院  前门
Then we got the backyard, front door.

558
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,270
再就是里面  等等
Go inside. Wait.

559
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,310
原来是乔在角落尿尿  不是斯黛拉
That's Joe peeing in the corner, not Stella.

560
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,230
没事了 他已经住在院子里的
That's it. He lives outside now.

561
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,310
快走吧  我们从摄像头里看着他就行了
Come. We'll watch him from the cameras.

562
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,130
等一下
Hold on.

563
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,200
你这是有病啊
You have a problem.

564
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,620
我要去给你搞那种橡胶遥控器
I'm gonna get you one of those rubber remotes,

565
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,680
就是幼儿园
they put in nursery schools

566
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,370
-还有疯人院用的那种  -谢谢
- and insane asylums. - Thank you.
