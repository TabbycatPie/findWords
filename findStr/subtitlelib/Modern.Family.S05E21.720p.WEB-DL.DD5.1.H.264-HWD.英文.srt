1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,370
Yeah, honey, Mitchell helped me

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,190
pick up the shirt. You're gonna love it.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,710
Oh, I wish I could pick you up some lip gloss

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,410
but we are already at the car.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,250
Okay, bye, honey.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,930
Getting pretty good, huh?

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,140
Yeah, but you were always good.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,940
I'm just glad you stuck with it.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,230
Seriously?

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,490
What?

11
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,100
It's playing itself.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,940
I didn't know.

13
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,700
You honestly thought that I just became a piano virtuoso, dad?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,050
You knew my whole life.

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,500
Have you ever seen me take a lesson?

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,180
I thought maybe you were self-taught.

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,090
- Like when I taught myself to play the clarinet. - Exactly.

19
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,980
I never played the clarinet.

20
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,090
Can we drop it?

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,910
Let's go get an ice cream.

22
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,160
What about my lactose intolerance?

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,860
Oh, I'm not loving this game.

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,370
This sucks.

25
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,710
My teacher gave me mononucleosis.

26
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,930
As a parent, I feel I should ask about this.

27
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,400
Slow down. It's not like she gets that many tugs on the line.

28
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,450
It's for A.P. Bio.

29
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,920
We have to write a report about a disease,

30
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,990
and I got the worst one. This is a joke.

31
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,060
Actually, it's pretty serious.

32
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,200
Back in college, I caught mono

33
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,560
from my roommate, Ling.

34
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,530
Served us right for fooling around.

35
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,690
Never share a flute, kids.

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey, can you drop me off at the library?

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,630
Sorry. I'm meeting some friends at that coffee shop on lake.

38
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,250
You mean the one next to the library?

39
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,240
That's a library?

40
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,050
I thought it was a church

41
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,170
for a religion that didn't allow makeup.

42
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,960
When is the washing machine gonna get fixed?

43
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,190
I'm wearing a swimsuit underneath my pants.

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,230
Everybody's gonna have clean clothes soon.

45
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,530
The repair guy's supposed to come today

46
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,720
between 10:00 and 2:00.

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
Oh! Honey, can you be here for that?

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,910
Can I sit around in an empty house and wait for someone?

49
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,400
Baby, I'm a realtor.

50
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,620
I have a license for that.

51
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,680
You sure you don't mind?

52
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,640
Go. Run your errands.

53
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,350
It'll give me a chance to get started on these dishes.

54
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,050
Oh, good. All right, come on, Luke.

55
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,820
All right. See you guys later.

56
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,620
Oh. More dishes than I thought.

57
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,790
That lasagna's gonna be a tough one.

58
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,160
Somebody's gonna need a scrub brush.

59
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,690
Hello?

60
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,790
What?

61
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,280
No...way!

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,620
June 10, 1988.

63
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,870
Carla Concannon and I spent the afternoon

64
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,740
frolicking at the public pool.

65
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,920
Later, at her house, things got private

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,200
while a 45 of Carly Simon's

67
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
"Nobody does it better" played.

68
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,520
It was my first time, her first time...

69
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,280
with me.

70
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,980
I always thought it'd be fun to own that 45.

71
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
When the record store finally called that morning,

72
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,890
I ran right down so I wouldn't miss the repairman.

73
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,290
I had to have it.

74
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,890
It was the chance to relive

75
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,090
those magical 3 minutes and 42 seconds,

76
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,190
which was also the length of the song.

77
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,790
But then it dawned on me --

78
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,710
I was cheating on my wife

79
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,380
with the red-hot memory of another woman.

80
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,460
I could not let Claire find out.

81
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,130
I had to destroy the evidence.

82
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,270
Luckily, I'm cool under pressure.

83
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,910
What?! No!

84
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,340
When did he...?

85
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,910
Come on!

86
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,860
There were a couple of snags,

87
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,210
but I think I covered my tracks pretty well.

92
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,690
I'm so sorry it took so long to get you these clothes.

93
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,850
I left them in the back of my car

94
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,570
and completely forgot about them.

95
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,810
Sounds familiar.

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,430
I was in the pharmacy for three minutes.

97
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,060
You had a cracked window and a juice box.

98
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,460
Let's retire that story.

99
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,380
Can I wear this for the family photo?

100
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,930
Oh, honey, that's adorable, but, you know,

101
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,870
Gloria wants us in jeans and a black T-shirt --

102
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,280
Classic and casual.

103
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,660
And then maybe afterwards, we can stop by

104
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,530
and change the scenery in a high-school play.

105
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,380
That is a really cute dress.

106
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,550
Oh, yeah, thank you. Just got it yesterday.

107
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,280
Really?

108
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,420
It reminds me of something I gave you six months ago.

109
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,690
Do you ever put her in the girls' hand-me-downs?

110
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,520
- Oh, yeah. All the time. - Really?

111
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,530
Because if my girls' old clothes aren't to your taste,

112
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,540
I could always just... give them to somebody else!

113
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,960
Okay, calm down, Claire.

114
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Your voice is getting to that pitch that disturbs our cat.

115
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,760
Oh, my God.

116
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,820
You will not believe what dad just said.

117
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,090
So, we're at the mall, right?

118
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,320
And there's a piano there. I sit down behind it.

119
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,420
- I start... - Come on, Mitchell.

120
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,510
He's just not wired for compliments.

121
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,930
I'm sure your playing was great.

122
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,660
I don't play the piano. I've never taken a lesson.

123
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,070
- Are you sure? - Oh, my god.

124
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,340
My own family doesn't even know me.

125
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,640
Mitchell, please. Don't be so sensitive.

126
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
You don't see me pitching a fit

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,070
because Cam is too much of a snob

128
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,430
to use our hand-me-downs.

129
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,540
Sn-- I'm sorry -- snob?

130
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,660
I will have you know I come from simple farm folk.

131
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,710
There is permanent dirt underneath

132
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,840
these fingernails from working the soil.

133
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,410
Really?

134
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,540
I had no idea that re-potting your orchids

135
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,120
counted as "Working the soil."

136
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,550
Okay, they're in soil, are--

137
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,660
You know what? I don't want to talk about this.

138
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,420
I don't need to listen to this.

139
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,740
I'm gonna go out and get some air.

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,970
I know the feeling.

141
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,980
Retire it. Seriously.

142
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,050
Does Joe look a little pale to you?

143
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,740
This whole country looks pale to me.

144
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,360
I think he needs a little color for tonight's photograph.

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,570
What do you think is the minimum age for a spray tanning?

146
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,880
Now that Joe is here

147
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,560
and that his head is finally normal-shaped,

148
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,510
I decided to take a new family portrait.

149
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,340
Hola!

150
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,020
How did it go at the mall?

151
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,980
Bought a shirt, angered my son --

152
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,480
another successful outing.

153
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,370
Ooh. I've been wanting to do this.

154
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,580
Quick -- what's the ring around an angel's head?

155
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,390
- What? - Halo!

156
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,040
You did the angel one!

157
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,170
Ordinarily, I'd be delighted,

158
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,140
but this isn't gonna be one of our fun chats.

159
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,410
You mean like that time you called me

160
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,600
when you saw that blimp?

161
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,400
It was so low, they waved back.

162
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,630
I'd done a pretty good job

163
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,530
eliminating all traces of that record,

164
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,190
but there was still one loose end.

165
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,660
You know, earlier today,

166
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,380
when we ran into each other on the street?

167
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,180
I didn't see you. You didn't see me.

168
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,540
Okay, so you're saying

169
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,520
whatever either one of us might have been doing

170
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,630
will remain forever --

171
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,570
I didn't see you. You didn't see me.

172
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,350
Just to be c-- hello?

173
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,830
Jay's so cool. He gets it.

174
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,090
I didn't know what he was talking about,

175
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,430
but I needed him to keep his trap shut.

176
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,350
You see, lately, I may have been dabbling

177
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,700
in something that... strong, virile men like me

178
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,640
aren't supposed to be dabbling in.

179
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,830
And it wouldn't exactly fit my image

180
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,290
if people found out I was considering entering...

181
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,280
a certain adorable dog in a dog show.

182
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,830
Gloria thought I was out getting my tires rotated.

183
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,240
Actually, I was buying Stella a decorative show collar --

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,730
you know, just in case.

185
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,840
I figure if she looks beautiful,

186
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,140
she'll feel beautiful.

187
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,060
Guess who we ran into at the library.

188
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
How would I know? I was here the whole time.

189
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,440
Sanjay Patel. He's got Crohn's disease.

190
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,850
- No! - I know. So lucky.

191
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,730
He's totally going to win that science scholarship.

192
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,300
He should use it to find a cure for baldness,

193
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,730
'cause that kid is 16 with a comb-over.

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,190
That's it!

195
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,590
I'm just gonna pick a new topic.

196
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,420
I want a disease that everyone in the school

197
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,290
is going to talk about.

198
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,340
All right!

199
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,360
Why are you standing there?

200
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,580
'Cause I missed you. I love you so much.

201
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,220
Oh, wow. Love you, too.

202
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,860
How'd it go with the repair guy?

203
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,980
The repair guy came, but I missed him.

204
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,380
"Why? What were you doing?"

205
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,600
"Listening to a record."

206
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,330
"What record?" "It's not important."

207
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,250
"Phil!"

208
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,270
"The soundtrack to my first sexual experience

209
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,970
that I think about from time to time.

210
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,820
Honey, where are you going?! Don't take the kids!"

211
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,710
He didn't show up.

212
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,850
What?! That is so annoying!

213
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,860
I know. Put away your groceries.

214
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,770
I'll call him and reschedule.

215
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,880
No, no, no, no, no. You are too nice.

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,050
I am calling.

217
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,810
I am not resting till I get to the bottom of this.

218
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,450
It's no big deal.

219
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,360
It's not the first time I've been stood up by some guy.

220
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,070
Oh, listen to your words, Phil.

221
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,090
Yep. Yep.

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,680
She called me a snob, Mitchell.

223
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm -- oh, I'm sorry if I don't rush

224
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
to throw Lily in every bargain-bin rag

225
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,650
Claire tosses our way.

226
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,120
You're not really shedding the "Snob" tag with that.

227
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,650
Look, why don't we just put Lily

228
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,400
in one of Alex's shirts for the picture tonight?

229
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,390
She'll see right through that.

230
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,640
No, you're thinking of Haley's shirts.

231
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,010
No, I mean it'll look ke we're doing it

232
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,690
just because she brought it up.

233
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,530
Well, I know. That's why I'm looking for a photo

234
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,700
of Lily in a hand-me-down to show Claire,

235
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,090
but I-I can't seem to find one.

236
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,630
By the way, I'm barely in any of these.

237
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,740
Mitchell, are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?

238
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,070
Yes! Sometimes I feel like this family looks right past --

239
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,470
You're suggesting that we stage a photograph.

240
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,860
Put Lily in some hand-me-downs.

241
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,650
Make it look like it's from the past --

242
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,040
Christmas, say -- just to prove Claire wrong.

243
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,750
Simplicity itself.

244
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,940
That's not remotely what I'm saying --

245
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,320
Mitchell, don't second-guess yourself.

246
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,320
It's simplicity itself.

247
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, once again, I would like to speak to a supervisor.

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,140
Listen, if my husband said nobody came, nobody came.

249
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,130
Dad, it's your move.

250
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,050
No, I think I should just play it cool for now.

251
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm so sorry.

252
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,050
Score!

253
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,870
I got a disease that's rare and fun

254
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,090
-- narcolepsy.

255
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,890
The company swears that the driver was here at 10:00.

256
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,240
They're putting him through to me right now.

257
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm gonna chip away at his story.

258
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,580
Let's see how you get out of this.

259
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm thinking.

260
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,850
It's a neurological condition

261
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,300
where people under extreme stress actually fall asleep.

262
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,870
It's like a way for the brain to escape.

263
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,930
I bet he was doing something he shouldn't have.

264
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,710
I'm just gonna let him keep talking till he makes a mistake.

265
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,440
Everybody makes mistakes.

266
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,590
And the noose tightens.

267
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,580
Why were my headphones in the couch?

268
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, good. You do keep GPS logs on all your drivers.

269
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,630
There's no way out.

270
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,300
Let me just write down your name.

271
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,040
Hey, does anybody need a receipt from Flipside Records?

272
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,380
Damn it!

273
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,790
I didn't even see that!

274
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,400
I see you're registered for tonight's show.

275
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
First one, huh?

276
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,340
Yeah.

277
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,430
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

278
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,650
with that whole prancing-in-a-circle thing

279
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,550
in front of everybody.

280
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,500
Can someone else run her through her routine?

281
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,420
It has to be the owner.

282
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,820
I suppose that's the best. We have a rapport.

283
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,660
All right. See you at 5:00.

284
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,230
5:00.

285
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,440
Uh, I got a family thing at 5:00.

286
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,510
Do these things tend to start on time?

287
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,830
Of course. It's not a cat show.

288
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,340
Well, I better speed it along. Come on.

289
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,400
I can't believe mom made me take you here.

290
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,250
This is my only black shirt,

291
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,930
and mom needs me to wash it.

292
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,960
It's only when I see the less fortunate

293
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,190
that I realize how lucky my clothes are.

294
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,340
All the machines are taken. We're gonna have to wait.

295
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,150
Oh, I am not spending any more time

296
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,530
in fluorescent lighting than I have to.

297
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,580
You're gonna sneak your shirt in with someone else's load --

298
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,710
Like that guy's. Go that way.

299
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,790
I'll distract him.

300
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,360
Excuse me.

301
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,930
Haley?

302
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,380
Oh, my god. Kevin.

303
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,460
It's "Keith."

304
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,270
You really don't remember

305
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,100
the guy you abandoned at Coachella?

306
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,810
I didn't abandon you. I-I texted you.

307
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,850
That deejay put me in a trance.

308
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,810
Yeah. It's -- it's almost

309
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,330
like you were using me for tickets.

310
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh. That's crazy.

311
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Can you get those again?

312
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,370
Or was that just, like, a one-time thing with your uncle?

313
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,730
It was a one-time thing.

314
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,960
Okay, so, good seeing you.

315
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,930
Yeah.

316
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,060
- Remind me never to date you. - You wish.

317
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,630
Please. I could totally get you.

318
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,220
Like to see you try.

319
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,800
All right, Lily, can you come in here, please?

320
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,220
It's Christmas already?

321
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,510
Probably should have prepped her.

322
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,070
Okay, no, it's not actually Christmas.

323
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,070
We're just gonna take a fun photo.

324
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,050
Which I am going to be in because I am a member of the --

325
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,020
Where is my stocking?

326
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,960
Oh, relax.

327
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,230
It's not in the shot, and neither are you.

328
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,860
Here -- I want you to take the picture from right over here.

329
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,080
This way. Okay, great.

330
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,980
Lily, I want you to put this on

331
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,590
and then stand in front of the tree, and we'll pop a shot off.

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,590
Ooh! Look at all the pretty presents!

333
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,210
Those are just empty boxes.

334
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,850
You're killing me!

335
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,730
I don't know which one it is!

336
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,380
I didn't see him put it in!

337
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,970
Wait! I think I found it.

338
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,920
He's coming!

339
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,380
What?! No!

340
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
What are you doing?

341
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,310
Uh, I-I saw that your laundry was done,

342
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,650
and I was gonna fold it for you to make us even

343
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,930
for what you thought that I did that I didn't do.

344
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,910
Even?

345
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,330
I held your popcorn for eight hours

346
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,720
waiting for you to come back.

347
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,310
I walked all the parking areas twice,

348
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,640
checked every medical tent.

349
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,940
By the time I got back to my car,

350
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,420
it had been broken into and the battery was gone.

351
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,650
I had to trade my festival pass

352
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,420
for a ride home in a horse trailer.

353
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,970
But...

354
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,090
Looks like someone got a concert t-shirt.

355
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,540
Dad, is there anything bothering you

356
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,150
that might be causing -- I don't know --

357
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,670
major psychological stress?

358
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,150
No. I've been acting normally, haven't I?

359
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,730
Did something happen earlier today?

360
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,440
Uh, nothing at all.

361
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,700
Because you seem a little tense.

362
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,280
What? No, I don't! Stop badgering me!

363
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,170
I love your mom! Let's listen to some music.

364
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,020
Boy, the way you cook things up sometimes,

365
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,780
it's a little --

366
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,070
- Dad! - What?!

367
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,140
You fell asleep!

368
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,440
It's like the fifth time today.

369
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,730
I think it has something to do with that guy

370
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,130
not showing up to fix the washing machine.

371
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,220
Well, that's not exactly what happened.

372
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,100
You snuck out to buy

373
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,730
"Nobody Does It Better" from Flipside Records,

374
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,610
and he showed up?

375
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,170
That's more exactly what happened.

376
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,000
How do you know all this?

377
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,690
I've been watching you all day.

378
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,190
I think the guilt from that has been causing you to fall asleep.

379
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,510
So you know about Carla?

380
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,810
I do now.

381
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,900
- Dad! - What is happening?!

382
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,730
I was skeptical about the jeans and t-shirt,

383
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,820
but I like it.

384
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,000
Any chance the photographer could fire off a couple solo shots?

385
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,480
Look at the bottom of Joe's face.

386
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,250
What happened? Did you leave him in the sun?

387
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,910
No, I took him out for five minutes

388
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,760
to give him a little color.

389
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,100
I must have not closed the visor all the way down.

390
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,120
Why is it so important to you that he has color?

391
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,070
Because we're sending this picture

392
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,310
to our family in Colombia,

393
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,410
and I have a son that doesn't even look Colombian.

394
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,550
Now they're gonna look at this picture,

395
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,820
and they're gonna think that I am a terrible mother,

396
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,380
that I can't even take care of my own child.

397
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,020
I think your reputation is set.

398
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,080
I can still do this with my arm

399
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,140
'cause I slept in the sink till I was 3.

400
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,340
Ha-lo!

401
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,920
People are here. I'll deal with Joe.

402
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,260
- Okay. - Come on, buddy.

403
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,760
Ohh. Come on.

404
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,750
Hola. Claire is on her way.

405
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,690
Dad, you have to confess to mom.

406
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,710
Clearing your conscience is the only way to make this stop.

407
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,620
Really?

408
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,170
I hope so, or else I have to rewrite the whole end of my paper.

409
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,990
Just the two of you? Where's the rest?

410
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,590
I had hoped to get this picture thing wrapped up by 5:00!

411
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,640
They're all coming separately.

412
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,290
Cam, do me a favor -- call Mitchell and light a fire under him.

413
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm right here, dad.

414
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,350
Oh. Good. I didn't see you come in.

415
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,810
You opened the door for me.

416
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,650
You thanked me for bringing a bottle of Chardonnay.

417
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,910
Doesn't sound like me.

418
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,860
Hey, guys. We're here.

419
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,190
Finally. Let's do this.

420
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,320
Luke, where's your black shirt?

421
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
Right here. I'll get changed.

422
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,950
All right. Shake a leg.

423
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,260
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi!

424
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,020
Hey, Lily, be careful.

425
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,460
Don't get anything on that beautiful outfit.

426
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,730
Recognize it? Look familiar?

427
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,390
Yes, I do, but I hardly think

428
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,320
that putting her in one of Alex's hand-me-downs

429
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,060
proves anything after I pitched a fit.

430
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,830
Well, first of all, I think it's really healthy

431
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,000
that you do admit it was a fit.

432
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
But if you need further proof,

433
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm sure I could find a photograph over here.

434
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,380
Sure. Go ahead.

435
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,310
No me.

436
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,250
No me.

437
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,230
No me.

438
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,590
Ah. There we are.Christmas morning last year.

439
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,480
Oh, my god.

440
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,420
Oh, it's Alex's old pajamas!

441
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm so sorry. I owe you an apology.

442
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,210
Sometimes I can be really --

443
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,760
What's that?

444
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,410
Uh, the calendar opened to december,

445
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,260
the half-eaten cookies for Santa Claus,

446
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,670
the nibbled-on carrots for reindeer? I don't know.

447
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,240
No, that looks like last month's Vanity Fair.

448
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,470
Oh, well, you know, every month's "Young hollywood."

449
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,830
Mm, and didn't Lily just lose that tooth?

450
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,190
Nope, it's still there. It's just dirty.

451
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,190
Christmas-morning chocolates.

452
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,740
Uh, and I am quite sure that's a reflection of Mitchell

453
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,060
in the clothes he was wearing this morning.

454
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,970
Oh, yay, I finally made it into a picture.

455
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,390
Just couldn't change, could you?

456
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,260
You are a snob.

457
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,190
- Okay, you know what... - You're a snob.

458
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,690
...it hardly takes a snob to recognize

459
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,170
- the clothes you put your children in... - Snob!

460
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,940
are uninspired at best.

461
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,650
- Claire,Cam, enough! - Oh, really?!

462
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,350
Everybody in this family has good taste.

463
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,370
It's just different.

464
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,320
It's causing too many fights.

465
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,270
That's why today I just put everybody

466
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,840
in a simple T-shirt-and-jeans outfit.

467
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,740
Mm. There's a new rule from now on --

468
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,970
nobody gives clothes to anyone else's children.

469
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,090
Well, I think that's probably for the best.

470
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,400
Thank god I don't have to spend one more of Joe's birthdays

471
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,670
with a funny smile on my face.

472
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,940
Thank you, Cam. He loves it.

473
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,450
Twinsies!

474
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,540
Okay, everybody, it's picture time.

475
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,690
Where's Luke?

476
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,630
Right here.

477
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,230
Honey, what are you wearing? Is that a girl's shirt?

478
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,220
I guess I grabbed the wrong one from the laundromat.

479
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,610
If I'm being honest, I don't hate the way it fits.

480
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,420
It must be that guy's girlfriend's shirt.

481
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,680
Is it bad that that makes him

482
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,810
more interesting to me?

483
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,860
Yes. Stay away.

484
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,750
Don't worry about Luke. We'll stick him in the back row.

485
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,070
Not everyone can look their best in the picture.

486
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,400
Joe's ready.

487
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,060
What did you do to him?

488
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,710
You want him to look more Colombian.

489
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,910
What's more Colombian than the Colombian flag?

490
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,810
He's perfect.

491
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,010
Not a banner day for my male heirs.

492
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,750
Claire, you're in the back.

493
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,620
Phil, you're behind Claire. No rabbit ears.

494
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,870
I don't want you messing around behind Claire's back.

495
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,110
Cameron, Lily, come on in.

496
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,050
It's picture time.

497
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,080
Honey.

498
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,940
There's something I need to tell you.

499
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,990
Uh, you know how you can treasure

500
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,280
special moments in your past

501
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,030
that in no way diminish the special moments in your present?

502
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,730
Yeah, sweetheart, it's called having a memory.

503
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, I wouldn't mind a friendlier tone as I move through this.

504
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,910
What did you do?

505
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,540
Up, up, up, up, ah!

506
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,620
No, that's the wrong way, sweetheart.

507
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,460
What fell out of Lily's pocket?

508
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,230
Is that a diamond ring?

509
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,900
Huh. That'll go great with your shirt.

510
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,180
It looks real.

511
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,070
It is real.

512
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,460
A small occlusion, but very good color.

513
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,390
This is Claire's.

514
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,300
No.

515
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,240
Claire's got her's on.

516
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,510
Ay, Phil, please, you cannot tell the difference

517
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,140
between this beautiful, but a small, diamond

518
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,780
and that chunk of glass

519
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,610
that should have made her finger fall off weeks ago.

520
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,210
I feel like I am getting you in trouble.

521
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,260
Picture time!

522
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,320
What's happening?

523
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,230
Okay, don't be mad.

524
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,220
Um, I lost my real ring a few months ago,

525
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,680
and I just realized it must have fallen

526
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,690
in the box of clothes I gave to Lily.

527
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,980
Why'd you take it off?

528
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,380
Well, I got pulled over,

529
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,080
and I wanted to flirt my way out of the ticket

530
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,810
by pretending I was single

531
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,440
And it worked, and I kind of liked it.

532
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,120
And then I felt so guilty about liking it

533
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,650
that I just wanted to erase the whole thing.

534
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,770
So you lied?

535
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,750
Yes. I lied. I'm sorry.

536
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,570
Does that make me a terrible person?

537
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,670
No, no. Are you kidding me?

538
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,470
We've been married for a long time.

539
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,790
Of course we're gonna have our little secrets.

540
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,170
The important thing...

541
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,440
...is that we know the difference

542
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,410
between a harmless indulgence...

543
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,140
and a real indiscreet--

544
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,190
Gloria?

545
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,340
- Left. - Thank you.

546
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,920
Okay, it's picture time!

547
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,210
Everybody, hury up.

548
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,500
Get in your positions.

549
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,660
All right?

550
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,960
All right, I think that everyone is here.

551
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Okay, ready?

552
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,680
And smile!

553
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,120
Are you kidding me?

554
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,730
Nobody noticed I wasn't here.

555
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,700
What does it take with you people?!

556
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,240
Ay, Joe, my baby, are you okay?

557
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,470
Yeah, yeah, maybe -- maybe that -- that's what it takes

558
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,660
for you to pay attention to me --

559
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,320
Throw a temper tantrum like -- like Joe.

560
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,430
I could just throw a big...temper tantrum that --

561
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,790
Or if I make a mess of everything and...

562
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,370
I feel like that was aimed at me.

563
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,460
You want to talk about it?

564
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,100
Or I could just play some piano.

565
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,390
So I'm in the ballpark.

566
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Look.

567
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,800
If it seems sometimes like we don't notice you,

568
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,580
maybe that is because we are focused...

569
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,020
...on our own stupid problems,

570
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,910
And you're so steady.

571
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,860
Oh, you mean boring.

572
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,020
- No. - Yeah.

573
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Calm.

574
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,430
Because you live your life

575
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,810
the way you want to.

576
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
In fact, you inspired me recently.

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,980
Oh, how so?

578
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,040
Fine.

579
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,810
I've been going through this thing lately.

580
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,350
It all started when I noticed

581
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,470
a group of guys in the corner in the park.

582
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,160
And, uh, honestly, when I first found out what they were doing,

583
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,180
I thought it was kind of weird,

584
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,280
but I found I kept thinking about it.

585
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,280
And I thought I'd give it a whirl.

586
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,550
Ok-- okay. Go on.

587
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,260
I think you know where I'm going with this,

588
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,720
but one of the older guys showed me the ropes.

589
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,010
Next thing I know,

590
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,110
I'm hanging out at that park in that corner every day

591
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,260
and loving it.

592
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,740
But I must have also got some shame about it

593
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,840
because it feels good

594
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,170
when I'm doing it, but...

595
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,270
Is that me now?

596
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,290
A guy with a show dog.

597
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,280
There it is!

598
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,610
Okay, see, I-I knew what it wasn't.

599
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,130
I just wasn't sure what it was.

600
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,440
In fact, there's a show right now,

601
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,560
But...ah, I'm not gonna go.

602
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,830
No, no. D--

603
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,030
- I could tell this is important to you. - No.

604
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,390
You -- you should go. You should go.

605
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,130
I don't want to sneak out,

606
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,200
and I don't want people to know about it.

607
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,210
Dad.

608
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,330
A wise man once told me,

609
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,830
"I don't get it,

610
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,360
but if that's who you are,

611
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,830
Don't you dare be ashamed of it."

612
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,730
I did handle that kind of well.

613
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,310
Yeah, yeah, well...

614
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,690
And it wasn't easy.

615
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,480
I just never pictured my kid a lawyer.

616
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,340
It's scary to let people see the real you,

617
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,770
even when those people are your own family.

618
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,740
But aren't they the ones we should be least worried about,

619
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,460
the ones who will love us without judging,

620
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,380
who forgive our faults

621
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,180
and celebrate our imperfections?

622
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,530
Maybe even encourage us

623
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,450
to let our true selves shine through?

624
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,040
Wait, wait. Hang on. Wait, wait.

625
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,820
Okay.

626
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,050
I think you look beautiful.

627
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,040
I look old.

628
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,100
All my cousins are going to see this.

629
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,770
Click the button that makes my wrinkles go away.

630
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,450
- What happened? - Nothing.

631
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
It's not nothing. You're limping!

632
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,890
Were you trying to do the Russian dance again?

633
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,360
It was just something stupid I was trying out,

634
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,020
and I don't even know why,

635
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,660
since it's basically impossible.

636
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,880
Gloria. Gloria! Check it out.

637
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,840
Is this not the cutest thing you've ever seen?

638
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,810
She did that on her first try.

639
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,230
He loves it, too.

640
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,550
Oh, oh, sure. Rub it in, Joe.

641
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,800
Attagirl!

642
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,140
Here she comes this way!

643
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,770
Now she is just showing off.

644
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,890
Both way.
