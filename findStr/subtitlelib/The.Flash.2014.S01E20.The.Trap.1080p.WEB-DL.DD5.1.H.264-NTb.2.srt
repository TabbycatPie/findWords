1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,871
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,539
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,541
By something impossible.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,042
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,878
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,815
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,418
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,488
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,189
And find others like me.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,525
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,826
Mom!

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,061
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,864
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,565
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,100
The night we trapped
the Reverse-Flash

16
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,735
In the force field,
there's no reason

17
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,570
That the containment system
should have failed.

18
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,272
- I've been having these dreams.
- What happens in the dream?

19
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,207
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash,

20
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,376
And he kills me.

21
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,412
If this is Dr. Wells,

22
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,414
Then who have we been working
for this whole time?

23
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,616
A completely different person.

24
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,850
Oh, my god.

25
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,752
What the frack?

26
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,626
"Flash missing.
Vanishes in crisis."

27
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,195
"after an epic street battle
with the Reverse-Flash,

28
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,131
"our city's
very own scarlet speedster

29
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,035
Disappeared in an explosion
of light."

30
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,004
Barry, look at the date.

31
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:16,642
April 25th, 2024.

32
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:20,045
Guys, when I fought
the Reverse-Flash at christmas,

33
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,448
He said that we'd be fighting
for centuries.

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,019
Wait, you can't really think
that this is from...

35
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,620
The future.

36
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,891
That would means Dr. Wells,
or whoever he is, is also...

37
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,693
From the future.

38
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,962
I have to say,
I'm really digging

39
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,664
The brighter red suit.

40
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,199
And the white
on the symbol?

41
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,467
That's dope.

42
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,901
Wait a second.

43
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,003
Suppose we now change
the color on your suit.

44
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,906
Will it be because we got
the idea from this picture?

45
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,142
That would mean
we're living in a causal nexus.

46
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,376
This... wow.

47
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,678
This is so trippy.

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,881
Like, Marty and the Polaroid
trippy.

49
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:59,585
Not as trippy as the name
on the byline.

50
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:04,256
Iris West-Allen?

51
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,491
Mazel Tov?

52
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:06,493
Hebrew.

53
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,094
Ancient language
of the Jewish people.

54
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,430
Uh-uh.
What the hell was that?

55
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:14,266
Is someone here?

56
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,801
Hello?

57
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,804
Good evening,
Barry Allen.

58
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,273
Uh...

59
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,609
H-Hi.

60
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,511
- You know who I am?
- Of course.

61
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,080
Barry Allen,
Director of Central City Police,

62
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,414
CSI division.

63
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,649
Director?

64
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,284
I guess
you get a promotion.

65
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,186
Also known as The Flash.

66
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,188
Founding member of...

67
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,189
What are you?

68
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,623
I am Gideon,

69
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,358
An interactive
artificial consciousness.

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,793
Ai.

71
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,997
Sick.

72
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,466
You know Dr. Wells?

73
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:51,336
Yes.

74
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,472
Do you know who he really is?

75
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,340
I don't understand the question.

76
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,709
I...I mean,
what is he doing here?

77
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,780
W-why did he come here?

78
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,881
To kill you.

79
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,058
Wells is in the building.

80
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,459
What?
How do you know that?

81
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,094
I put a tracker
on his wheelchair.

82
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,697
Which, if we're wrong about him
and he is paralyzed,

83
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,932
I'm going to hell
for that one.

84
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,404
He's in the cortex.

85
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,206
Ask questions fast.

86
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,607
Why did he kill Nora Allen?

87
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,741
Because he was angry.

88
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,976
About what?

89
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,244
That you escaped.

90
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,448
He's on B level.
He's coming this way.

91
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,116
What does he want from me?

92
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,619
For you to be the Flash.

93
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,720
Maybe that's why wells let

94
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,121
The Particle Accelerator
Explode,

95
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,791
So that you could become
the Flash.

96
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,659
Why?
I mean, for what reason?

97
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,394
Guys, we got to go.
He's almost here.

98
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,662
- Hurry.
- All right.

99
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,898
Wait a second.
Wait.

100
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,767
What if Hal over there tells
Wells that we were in here?

101
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,169
That would be bad.

102
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,438
If I can get into
its operating system,

103
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,907
Maybe I can disable
its memory core.

104
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,011
Gideon, can you show us where
your operating system is?

105
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,646
Certainly.

106
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,085
Yeah.
Nope.

107
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,353
That's not gonna happen.

108
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,854
Guys, he's in
the corridor.

109
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,356
Gideon, could you just,
like,

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,092
Not tell him that we were here?

111
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,660
Of course.

112
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,894
I will accept any command
given to me by you.

113
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,496
- Barry.
- Come on.

114
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,864
- We got to get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,500
Why would you accept
my commands?

116
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,435
Because you created me.

117
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,128
Good evening, Gideon.

118
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,561
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

119
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,096
Is everything all right?

120
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,866
Everything is fine.

121
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,808
Eddie.

122
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,943
- Thank you.
- What's the emergency?

123
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,146
Oh, no emergency.

124
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,848
I just wanted to,
you know, talk to you...

125
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,850
Thanks.

126
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,950
Without Iris around

127
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,652
Or Barry around

128
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,189
Or Cisco around
or Caitlin around.

129
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,659
So, in other words,
you want to talk to me alone.

130
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,362
What is it?

131
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,863
Right.

132
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,166
Um, so listen.

133
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,234
With everything going on...

134
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,338
Investigating Wells
and finding out about Barry...

135
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,239
Eddie, you cannot tell Iris
about Barry.

136
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,310
This isn't about Barry.

137
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,146
I know the timing
might seem off, you know,

138
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,249
With everything
that's going on,

139
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,220
But I want to propose to iris,

140
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,290
And I'd like your blessing.

141
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,832
No.

142
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,167
Come again?

143
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,436
No.

144
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,804
You do not have my blessing.

145
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,843
That's Barry.
We got to go.

146
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,411
Joe, I only asked
as a courtesy,

147
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,413
Out of respect.

148
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,782
I don't need your permission.

149
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,950
Really?

150
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,318
For three very smart people,

151
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,586
That was really stupid.

152
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,322
What if wells had caught you
in that...

153
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,857
- Time vault.
- Thank you.

154
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,792
Okay, I know we've seen
a lot this past year,

155
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:34,826
But time travel?

156
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,162
I did it.

157
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,531
- Or I will do it, I mean.
- Excuse me?

158
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,367
One of the two speedsters
in Barry's house

159
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,636
The night his mother died
was Barry.

160
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,805
I mean, The Flash.
He was there.

161
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,775
Which means that one day
in the future,

162
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:53,545
Barry will travel back in time
to that night.

163
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,880
Okay.

164
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,717
Actually, I wasn't talking
about that.

165
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,221
I kind of already
time traveled.

166
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,890
- By accident.
- What?

167
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,592
I was running to
try and stop a Tsunami

168
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,594
From hitting the city...

169
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,595
When was that?

170
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,063
A few weeks ago.

171
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,932
Right before you started
getting those dreams.

172
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,401
Oh, you mean the ones
where Wells uses

173
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,904
His super-speeding hand
to shred apart my heart?

174
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,772
- Those?
- Yes, right.

175
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,542
So, what if they're not dreams?

176
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,776
What else could they be?

177
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,877
Memories.

178
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,813
I'm not following.

179
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,315
All right, what if, that day,
Cisco found out

180
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,651
That Wells is the Reverse-Flash,
and then Wells killed him?

181
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,152
But when I ran back a day,

182
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,254
I changed the timeline
so that event never happened.

183
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,757
If it never happened,
how can Cisco remember it?

184
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,593
I don't know.
I don't know.

185
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,563
I think the important thing is,
he does.

186
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:52,237
Guys, I think
I've got a really bad idea.

187
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,323
Dad, it's been three weeks.
You barely eat or sleep.

188
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,724
You should probably go home
at some point.

189
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,992
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

190
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,729
I'll go home when Barry does.

191
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,335
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

192
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,569
Help!
My son's coding.

193
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,338
They said he was stable.

194
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,507
Barry.

195
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,774
- Oh, my god.
- I need the room.

196
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,278
Just go.
I need the room.

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,247
How can he be seizing?

198
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,515
He has no heart rhythm.

199
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,118
- Starting compressions.
- Epi push. Epi.

200
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,594
They can't save him.

201
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,963
But I can.

202
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,699
I know who you are.

203
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,735
You're that scientist
that Barry's obsessed with,

204
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,271
The one who blew a hole
in the city.

205
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,239
Harrison Wells,
and interestingly enough,

206
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,475
My facility is the very place
I would like to take him.

207
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,176
You're out of your mind.

208
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,145
I'm not gonna try and
convince you with promises.

209
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,481
But, detective,
give me a chance.

210
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,650
I think we already know
what you're capable of, doctor.

211
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,218
You hurt a lot of people
that night.

212
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,987
So those doctors in there,
they're good enough?

213
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,490
The best in the city,
best in the country.

214
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,824
Look at them.

215
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,526
They have no clue
what's going on.

216
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,295
They're baffled,
and the reason for that is

217
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,297
What's happening
inside Barry is a mystery,

218
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,898
And they don't have
the tools to solve it.

219
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,366
- But you do?
- That's right.

220
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,902
Millions of people

221
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,638
Used to look at my lab,
and what did they see?

222
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,739
They saw the future.

223
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,141
Well, let me take
that technology,

224
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,476
Let me take that know-how
into ensuring

225
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:42,647
That your son
actually does have a future.

226
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,384
Detective.

227
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,919
Let me save him.

228
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,894
- Hand me the paddles.
- Starting compressions.

229
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:59,998
Then save him.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,902
Charge.
200. Pads.

231
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,270
Joe?

232
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,571
Joe, are you listening?

233
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,239
Yeah.

234
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,943
We... we have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

235
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,045
Somewhere in his subconscious
is the key.

236
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,213
The key to what now?

237
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,548
Getting my dad out of prison.

238
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,785
And how are we going to do that?

239
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,089
We're gonna get Wells to confess
to killing my mom.

240
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,900
So, this will allow Cisco
to see into his dream?

241
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,302
I got the idea
from a journal article

242
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,870
On Lucid dream therapy.

243
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,405
They think it can be used
to help people

244
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,374
Suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

245
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,809
Traumatized, stressed?

246
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,277
Check and check.

247
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,979
The theory is that
it will allow people

248
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,481
To objectively enter
their dreams

249
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,216
And face their fears.

250
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,284
Still working on
the talking part.

251
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,887
And you're sure this thing
isn't gonna, you know,

252
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,155
Mess with my brain?

253
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,823
Oh, the amount of electricity
required

254
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,892
To trigger Lucid dreaming
is harmless.

255
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,327
Probably.

256
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,796
Who's going to be
Lucid dreaming?

257
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,798
Um...

258
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,068
With all of the meta-humans
in Central City,

259
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,203
People have been seeing
some strange things...

260
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,205
Things that
they don't understand.

261
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,074
And it's really just
a matter of time

262
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,043
Before psychological issues
develop.

263
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,011
And Lucid dreaming will help
the doctors

264
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,246
Better understand their fears.

265
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,714
Intriguing.

266
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,250
Of course, you still need to
guide the patient

267
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,751
From the outside, right?

268
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,487
Direct them to
specific aspects of the dream.

269
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,424
We're still working
on a communications interface.

270
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,893
When we dream,

271
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,262
The middle brain lights up
with electrical activity,

272
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,765
Whereas the higher brain
remains dormant.

273
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,735
Once we find a way to make
both parts of the brain active,

274
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,037
Then it's just a matter of
finding the frequency

275
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,073
That will stimulate
the language center.

276
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,075
Then the dreamer could speak.

277
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,409
He could describe his dream.

278
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,777
- Exactly.
- Or her dream.

279
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,112
It could be used for anyone.

280
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,613
Right, it's not gender specific.

281
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:59,918
I would try a frequency of
45 hertz to start.

282
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,286
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

283
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,789
Well, you never cease to
impress me, Caitlin.

284
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,162
- Allen.
- Hey.

285
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,497
The owens case.

286
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,665
I'm still waiting
on the fiber evidence

287
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,799
And the ballistics report.

288
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,534
Are you on vacation
or something?

289
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,169
- No, I'm so sorry, I've just...

290
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,370
I've been distracted
by another case.

291
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,872
Which is no excuse,
I just...

292
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,874
Okay, just get me the reports
when you can.

293
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,209
There's... there's no rush.

294
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,312
All right.
Uh, Captain?

295
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,647
Is everything okay?

296
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,151
Yeah, since Rob and I
have been planning the,

297
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,286
You know, wedding,
between the florist

298
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,555
And the hundreds of kinds
of cake filling

299
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:41,693
And who can sit next to who...

300
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,129
Never get married, Allen.

301
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,730
Right.

302
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,702
- Oh.
- Iris.

303
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,069
- Barry.
- Hey.

304
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,137
Are you okay?

305
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,338
Yeah. No. Yes.

306
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,373
That was...
That was just really weird.

307
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,909
Captain Singh was
nice to me.

308
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,711
Oh, well, he's in a good mood.

309
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,813
He's about to get married.

310
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,282
Lucky him.
Yeah, I know, it's...

311
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,252
Oh, hey,
can I talk to you in private?

312
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,920
It's... it's kind of work-related.

313
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,655
Okay, yeah,
now's not a great time.

314
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,257
- I'm sorry, I've got...
- Hi, beautiful.

315
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,159
Hi.

316
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,493
Barry, can I grab you
for a second?

317
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,961
Absolutely.
Yeah.

318
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,730
Okay, well, can you call me
when you're done?

319
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:19,932
It's... it's really important.

320
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

321
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,971
What's up?

322
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,645
Oh.
O-okay.

323
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,480
W-what did she say?

324
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,115
Or, wait, you still have it, so,
duh, you haven't asked her yet.

325
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,983
Or you did ask her,
and she said...

326
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,852
- I was gonna propose tonight.
- All right.

327
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,121
But I went to joe
to ask for his blessing.

328
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,123
- He said no.
- He did? He...

329
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,025
- Repeatedly.
- Uh, weird.

330
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,927
I need you to talk to him,
find out why.

331
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,295
Uh, Eddie...

332
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,963
Look, I know me
asking you like this,

333
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:52,965
It's a little awkward.

334
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,432
Yeah.

335
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,267
But you know how heartbroken
she's gonna be

336
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,137
If she finds out
that Joe's not on board.

337
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,139
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.

338
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,372
Yeah, I'll talk to him, man.

339
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,842
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate it so much.

340
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,844
- Yeah.
- And so will

341
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,878
The future
Mrs. Thawne.

342
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,613
Iris Thawne.

343
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,250
Sounds pretty good, huh?

344
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,252
I have a feeling
she's gonna want to hyphenate.

345
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,123
Okay, can we go over this
one more time?

346
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,593
Yeah, you put the glasses on,
fall asleep, and start dreaming.

347
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,127
Not that hard.

348
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,029
Yeah, except I'm pretty sure
I die in this dream.

349
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,798
If I go back into it,
am I gonna die in real life?

350
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,366
I mean, what are
we talking about here?

351
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,601
<i>Is this inception
or dreamscape?</i>

352
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,802
Here.
Drink this.

353
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,270
- What, am I five?
- Just drink it.

354
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,538
Okay, I'll drink it.

355
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,772
You're gonna be fine, Cisco.

356
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,075
Mm.

357
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,910
Okay.

358
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,281
The glasses are emitting
a Low-Level Delta Wave

359
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,649
Which should help you
fall asleep.

360
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,585
Okay.

361
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,920
I got to warn you, though,

362
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,890
Usually it takes me
a long time.

363
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,658
I mean...

364
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,059
I'm not saying I'm, like...

365
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,496
An insomniac or any...

366
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,799
Ah, so that's how you get him
to shut up.

367
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,501
He's entering rem.

368
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,702
It's working.

369
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,206
Cisco.

370
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,407
Can you hear me?

371
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,510
You're dreaming, bud.

372
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,252
Okay, I will take Dr. West
to jitters

373
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,988
So you do whatever it is
you want to do.

374
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,329
Whoa.

375
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,733
Guys, this is mad freaky.

376
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,370
Okay, um, where are you?

377
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,942
Um, in the cortex.

378
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,079
I mean, I know I'm just dreaming
that I'm in the cortex,

379
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,016
But it feels so real.

380
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,954
What is dream you doing?

381
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,922
Caitlin just left.

382
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:02,760
I asked her to
take Wells to jitters.

383
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,829
Why... why do you want Wells
out of the lab?

384
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:09,100
I think he might have
tampered with my work.

385
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:12,203
I need to check.

386
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,206
Okay.

387
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,942
Okay, I'm walking to the bunker.

388
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,316
Oh, man, I love this shirt.

389
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,617
I thought the dryer ate it.

390
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,219
Focus, Cisco.

391
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,322
Okay, okay.

392
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,324
All right.

393
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:38,029
Now I'm running tests
on the containment system.

394
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:43,301
This data...
It doesn't make any sense.

395
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,970
All the supercapacitors...

396
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:49,140
They were all still
fully charged.

397
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,043
There's absolutely no reason
that the man in yellow

398
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,313
Should have escaped.

399
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,056
Oh, my god.

400
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,092
It was just a hologram.

401
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,129
He tricked us.

402
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,266
Hello, Cisco.

403
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,171
Oh, god, Wells is here.

404
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,007
Cisco, it's just a dream.
He can't hurt you.

405
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,509
You better be right
about that.

406
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:30,014
My name is Eobard Thawne.

407
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,516
Eobard Thawne.

408
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,618
Thawne?
Like Eddie Thawne?

409
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,455
You killed Nora Allen.

410
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,091
It was never my intention.

411
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,160
Nora?
What about my mom?

412
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,329
- He's confessing.
- Cisco?

413
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,667
He... he didn't want to kill her.

414
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,769
It was you, Barry.

415
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,771
He was trying to
kill you.

416
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,707
Guys, he's losing
higher brain function.

417
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,376
Cisco, you're gonna be okay.

418
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,811
It's just a dream.
You're gonna be okay.

419
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,380
I have grown quite fond of you,
Cisco.

420
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,582
His hand...
It's vibrating.

421
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,918
- He's gonna have a stroke.
- Get him out of there!

422
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,720
In many ways,

423
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,255
You've shown me
what it's like...

424
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,890
- Help me.
- Caitlin.

425
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:13,925
Help me, please!

426
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:14,927
To have a son.

427
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,928
Help me!

428
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,396
Aah!

429
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,466
You're okay.

430
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,035
It was just a dream.
You're okay.

431
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,409
Oh, god.

432
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,245
It felt so real.

433
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,550
- Barry?
- My mom.

434
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,419
That's why it's my fault.

435
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,293
Hello?

436
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,561
Where are you?

437
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,402
Barry.

438
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,637
Barry, are you there?

439
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,205
Dr. Wells.

440
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,007
Yeah.
It's... sorry, yeah.

441
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,876
It's... it's a bad connection
right now.

442
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,344
Where have you been?

443
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,013
Uh, we're...
Why? What's going on?

444
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,015
A fire.

445
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,749
A huge fire just erupted.

446
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,752
A fire?
Where?

447
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,753
New Brighton.

448
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,154
Bradford tower high-rise.

449
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,722
I know that building.

450
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,824
That's where Captain Singh's
fiance works.

451
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,260
On my way.

452
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,009
Now move it!
Go!

453
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,011
Get those hoses up.
Move!

454
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,245
And tell dispatch we need

455
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,580
As many tankers
as this city has.

456
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,382
- What floor?
- 21st.

457
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,217
My god.
That's where Rob works.

458
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,424
Please hurry.

459
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,727
Over here!

460
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,199
Dr. Wells, the sprinklers...

461
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,633
They're not working.

462
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,035
I see that.

463
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,103
Just get everyone
out of there, Barry.

464
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,805
No, I can't.
I can't save them all.

465
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,310
Dr. Wells, please, what do I do?

466
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,711
You create a vacuum.

467
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,613
Rotate your arms
at super-speed.

468
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,415
That'll create a wind funnel

469
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,177
That will suck the air
right out of the room.

470
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,324
It's making it worse!

471
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,592
Barry, listen to me.

472
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:31,395
You need to move
your arms faster.

473
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,630
I believe in you, Barry.

474
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,432
Rob.

475
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,601
I'm okay.
It's okay.

476
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,436
I thought I lost you.

477
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,207
Medic!

478
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,025
Mr. Allen.

479
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:37,461
Tonight, at the fire,

480
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,730
I saw hesitation.

481
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,400
I saw you doubting yourself.

482
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,302
Why is that?

483
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,304
I don't know.

484
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,873
Uh, I guess I was afraid

485
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,708
I couldn't save everyone.

486
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,310
Right.

487
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,713
But if there is anything
that I have learned

488
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,381
In our time together, Barry,

489
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,719
It is that the only thing
standing in the way of you

490
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,356
Achieving every goal
that you set for yourself

491
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,891
Is you.

492
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:11,295
There is no limit
to how strong you will get

493
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:15,199
Or how fast you will go.

494
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,470
Everything that you need,

495
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,473
You already have.

496
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,009
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

497
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,250
You know,

498
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:37,722
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

499
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,590
I feel the same way about you.

500
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,670
It's so strange.

501
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,405
I mean, I look at him now,

502
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,675
And I know that he killed my mom
and he sent my dad to jail,

503
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:01,379
But, I mean,
sometimes he's just so kind

504
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,982
In the moment,
I actually like him.

505
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,784
But you never did.

506
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,819
- No.
- No.

507
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,188
Well, at least now
we know how to trap him.

508
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,925
In Cisco's dream,
he confessed to everything.

509
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,027
If we can just recreate
those conditions,

510
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,029
He'll do it again.

511
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,365
Man, Barr.

512
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,634
Taking down bad guys,
pulling confessions.

513
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,336
I'm the cop.

514
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:26,804
I'm the one that's supposed
to be doing this.

515
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,205
Look, if we're gonna get him
to confess,

516
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,708
It has to be with someone
that he truly trusts,

517
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,677
Someone that he'll genuinely
let his guard down with.

518
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,180
He thinks of Cisco as a son.

519
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:39,550
Well, then we need to do
a better job protecting him

520
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:42,286
Than I did protecting you.

521
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,022
I'm not sure
what that means.

522
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,524
Barry,
this is all because of me.

523
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,192
No.

524
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,027
I never should've let Wells
take you from that hospital.

525
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,862
None of this would've
ever happened.

526
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,999
If you hadn't let him take me,
I would be dead, for sure.

527
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,635
But even then,
I knew something wasn't right.

528
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,870
Everything in my gut
was telling me not to trust him,

529
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,238
But I did,

530
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,474
Because I was so desperate
to see you okay.

531
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:04,975
Joe, this isn't your fault.

532
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,777
It's not your fault.

533
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,648
Look, every bad thing
that has happened to us...

534
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,951
All of it...
It was him.

535
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,454
And now he's gonna pay for it.

536
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,662
So, Wells set up a fake showdown

537
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:27,465
With a fake opponent
who was never really there?

538
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,600
He figured if we saw
both of them together

539
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,802
It would prove that he wasn't
the man in yellow.

540
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,638
This all just keeps getting
crazier and crazier.

541
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,844
I just talked to Dr. Wells.

542
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,412
He's attending
a lecture downtown,

543
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:42,746
Won't be back until 5:00.

544
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,148
All right, Cisco,
you know when he gets here

545
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,616
You need to be working
on the trap

546
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,284
So he sees you set off
the hologram.

547
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,453
Hold on,
isn't that, in your dream,

548
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,188
When everything went all...

549
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,790
Kali Ma.
Temple of doom.

550
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,092
Yeah, that definitely happened.

551
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,362
But this time,
I'm ready for him.

552
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,930
I originally designed
the force field

553
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,832
To keep a speedster
from getting out.

554
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,200
But I've reversed it.

555
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,503
Now it won't let one in.

556
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,210
Back up.

557
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,958
Barry, are you okay?

558
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,427
Ah.

559
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,763
It works.

560
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,732
Okay,
as long as I'm inside,

561
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,367
Wells won't be able
to get near me.

562
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,935
And I will be in the cortex

563
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,137
Watching and recording
everything that happens.

564
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,939
And as soon as we get
the confession we need

565
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,208
To free my dad,
I'm moving in.

566
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,043
So what do I do?

567
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,711
Wells also threatened iris,

568
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,979
So if something
goes wrong here,

569
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,214
We need you to keep an eye
on her

570
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,448
Until wells is neutralized.

571
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,151
I'll always keep iris safe,
Joe.

572
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,491
- What?
- Come here.

573
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:05,829
So, um, Eddie told me
what happened,

574
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,365
That you kiboshed
his proposal.

575
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,034
That was supposed to be
between him and me.

576
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,803
I so agree with that.

577
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,239
And I... and I know that we have
a lot going on right now,

578
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,007
And I should definitely be
the last person

579
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,076
Pleading Eddie's case,
but I don't get it, Joe.

580
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,878
Why did you say no?

581
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,414
Because if Eddie
proposes to Iris,

582
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,583
She's gonna get caught up
in the moment and the romance,

583
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,051
And she's gonna say yes.

584
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,652
What's wrong with that?

585
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,555
Again, I don't know
why I'm saying this.

586
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,923
Because one day
she's gonna wake up and realize

587
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,491
She married the wrong guy.

588
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,561
But she'll stay anyway
because she made a promise.

589
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,029
I don't want
that kind of life for her.

590
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,731
Or him.

591
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,534
She's got feelings for you,
Barry.

592
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:46,270
She may not know how to deal
with those feelings right now,

593
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,539
But I know her.

594
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,608
They're there.
Always have been.

595
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:56,113
You know that, too.

596
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,850
Speaking of,
Iris just sent me a 911 text.

597
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,685
I'll be right back.

598
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,289
Like I said.

599
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:08,926
- Hey.
- Hi.

600
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,461
What's going on?

601
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,029
Look, Barry, I know
it's not a good time.

602
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,631
I mean, lately, it never seems
to be a good time,

603
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,433
But I need you to listen to me
right now.

604
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:20,204
Like... like, really
listen to me.

605
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,172
Of course.
Yeah.

606
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,309
Whatever you need to tell me,
I'm listening.

607
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,710
Okay, I mean,
I know this is gonna sound

608
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:31,281
Really crazy at first,
but...

609
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,351
Everything strange that's been
going on in Central City,

610
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,053
It all goes back to
that night.

611
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,122
The night that the particle
accelerator exploded.

612
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,324
I have gone through
every bit of information

613
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,126
That I've collected
since I started my blog...

614
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:45,029
Every tip, every rumor,
every strange sighting.

615
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,198
Nothing predates the explosion.

616
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,534
Whatever was released
into the atmosphere that night,

617
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,735
I think
it changed people...

618
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:55,072
Caused them to have powers.

619
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,641
And I think that
S.T.A.R. Labs knew about it.

620
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,544
I think the burning man
worked there,

621
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,981
And I think that that's how
the Flash got his powers too.

622
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,986
- Uh...
- So what do you think?

623
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,755
I...

624
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,991
I don't know.
I mean, it's... it's interesting.

625
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,325
Yeah, it's interesting.

626
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,727
It's... there's... there's just...

627
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,462
A big hole
in your theory.

628
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,597
Um, you know...

629
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,969
I was affected by whatever was
released by the explosion,

630
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,972
And I don't have any powers.

631
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,075
- Obviously.
- Right, yeah.

632
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,343
Look, I mean, I know that it's...
It's really mind-blowing.

633
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,512
I mean, I haven't even talked to
Eddie about it yet, but...

634
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,315
Yeah, you and Eddie...
How are...

635
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,484
Everything's okay
with you and Eddie?

636
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,486
Uh, sure.
Sure.

637
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,355
Yeah, we're great.
Why?

638
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,825
Uh, I...
Yeah, okay, look.

639
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:51,995
I'm gonna... let me read over
all of this stuff,

640
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,665
And we'll definitely
talk about it later.

641
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,667
I promise.

642
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,501
Just... I mean, this is crazy.

643
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,503
Yeah, okay, just let me
just go through it,

644
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,940
And we'll talk later,
all right?

645
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,409
Okay.

646
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,891
Hey, Barry.

647
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,726
It's Iris.

648
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,629
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I hope you can,

649
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:30,701
Because I really, really
need you to wake up.

650
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:35,305
Like, the other day,

651
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,141
Detective pretty boy
came into jitters,

652
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:41,445
And he asked me out,
and I actually said yes.

653
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,618
See, I do dumb things like that
when you're not around.

654
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,728
And the house is really
quiet without you.

655
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,301
I know that the reason
that you came to live with us

656
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,438
Was awful.

657
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,741
But Barry,

658
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,343
You made it a home again.

659
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:18,248
You made us a family again.

660
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,286
We need you.

661
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:25,422
I need you.

662
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,134
Hello, Dr. Wells.

663
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,936
How was your lecture?

664
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:42,606
Oh, boring, tedious.

665
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,374
Platitudinous?

666
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,143
Couldn't have said it better
myself.

667
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:49,847
Um, where...
Where's Cisco?

668
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,883
Uh, he is in the bunker.

669
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,520
He thinks he finally figured out
what went wrong at christmas.

670
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,190
You know, when we were trying
to catch the Reverse-Flash?

671
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,627
Yes, I remember that night.

672
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,028
Well, did he say
what he's found?

673
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,864
Nope,
just that it was important.

674
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,199
Hmm.

675
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,735
Good for Cisco.

676
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,705
Um... Okay.

677
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, maybe
I'll wheel on down there,

678
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:17,942
See what he's got.

679
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,477
Okay.

680
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,450
Here he comes.

681
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,913
Hello, Cisco.

682
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,926
You've been busy.

683
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,765
You really are
incredibly clever, Cisco.

684
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,702
I've always said it.

685
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,104
You're him.

686
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,007
The Reverse-Flash.

687
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,376
Joe was right this whole time,
wasn't he?

688
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,945
Good ol' Joe.

689
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,283
Joe West had his doubts
all along.

690
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,186
Even from that first night
in the hospital,

691
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,089
Joe knew
something wasn't right.

692
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,525
Cops... as inconvenient now

693
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,093
As they will be
in a hundred years.

694
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,963
Come on, Cisco.
We need a confession.

695
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,266
You killed Barry's mother.

696
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,701
I want to know why.

697
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,970
It was never my intention
to kill Nora.

698
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,539
But from my perspective,

699
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,542
She was already dead.

700
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,111
It just happened sooner
than it was supposed to.

701
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:05,115
No.
That's not an admission.

702
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,350
Oops.

703
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:14,958
You're not gonna get away
with this.

704
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,326
I'm not gonna get away
with it?

705
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,471
Oh, you're smart.

706
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,740
You're smart, Cisco.

707
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,079
But you're not that smart.

708
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,382
Cisco!

709
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,585
No!

710
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,273
He didn't confess.

711
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,076
Cisco, are you okay?

712
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,344
Yeah.

713
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,912
I'm never ever gonna sleep
ever again,

714
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,847
But, yeah, I'm okay.

715
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,086
He's dead.

716
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,187
He didn't confess.

717
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,289
Joe, this was it.

718
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,458
My dad's gonna be in prison
forever.

719
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,360
Barry, I'm sorry.

720
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,162
Hey, uh...

721
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,298
Whoa.

722
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,533
What the hell?

723
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,502
I told you this before.

724
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:37,174
I am always
one step ahead... Flash.

725
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,676
Allow me
to reintroduce to you

726
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,845
Mr. Hannibal Bates

727
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,381
And his incredible ability
to transform

728
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:48,051
Into any person he touches.

729
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,287
I knew that ability
would come in handy.

730
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:53,824
I did not expect it
to come in handy this soon.

731
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,659
You used him!

732
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,893
Like you used all of us!

733
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,662
Well, he served a purpose.

734
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,098
Didn't take much convincing.

735
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,733
Just the simple promise
of his freedom.

736
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,536
You ruined my life!
All our lives!

737
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,040
We stood by you
after everything that happened.

738
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,976
I can see how this must be
difficult for you to understand,

739
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,712
But trust me,

740
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,215
Your lives now
are so much better

741
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,884
Because of what
I have done for you.

742
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,152
You don't have to
hide anymore.

743
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,487
We know you're not
Harrison Wells.

744
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,788
Just tell us who you are.

745
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,091
A confession
will get you nowhere.

746
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,827
You've seen who I am.

747
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,895
You know what I can do.

748
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,297
You want to kill me, go ahead.

749
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,599
I'm not gonna fight you.

750
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,068
But just tell the police
what you did.

751
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,436
Get my dad out of prison.

752
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,004
I don't want to kill you, Barry.

753
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,006
I need you.

754
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,474
And...

755
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,479
I also did not anticipate,

756
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,915
As difficult as the past
15 years have been for me,

757
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,418
How much I would come
to love working with you.

758
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,087
With all of you.

759
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,624
And yet, that does not change
what needs to happen.

760
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,659
Then face me now!

761
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,230
Oh, we will face each other
again.

762
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,266
I promise you.
Soon.

763
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:13,036
Very, very soon.

764
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,239
He's in the time vault!

765
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,241
Barry!

766
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,593
It was all a set-up.

767
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,061
We thought we set
a trap for him,

768
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,096
But he set a trap for us.

769
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,237
Oh, my god.

770
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,605
Iris.

771
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,913
We have to find Iris.

772
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,215
- Why?
- Wells.

773
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,749
He's been watching
all of us.

774
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,685
He has surveillance footage
set up everywhere.

775
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,687
Our homes, my lab
at the police station,

776
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,389
Central City picture news.

777
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,792
Cisco, call me
when you have a location.

778
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,666
I am very much enjoying
this stroll.

779
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,468
We needed a good stroll.

780
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,870
Yeah.

781
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,808
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

782
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,978
Um...

783
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,813
Oh, it's my dad.

784
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,415
Could you call him back later?

785
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,251
Sure.

786
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,253
What's going on?

787
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:40,056
Iris, this week,
when I was arrested

788
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,093
And it looked bad,

789
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,694
You never wavered.

790
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,496
You never lost faith in me.

791
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,265
Impossible.

792
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:55,238
And even though we've been
through some rough times,

793
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,507
I've never lost faith in us.

794
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:04,347
Iris West.

795
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,849
Eddie?

796
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,488
Eddie!

797
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,525
Bad timing, Detective.

798
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,362
Stop!
Leave him alone!

799
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,798
Iris, no!

800
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,202
I know who you are.

801
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,204
You killed Barry's mom.

802
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,206
But you don't have to hurt
anyone else.

803
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,713
Hey, Iris.

804
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,881
It's okay.
It's me.

805
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,282
He took him.

806
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,550
The man in yellow,
he took Eddie.

807
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,452
I promise I will find him,
okay?

808
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,620
What is happening?

809
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,789
Listen to me.
You go home.

810
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,857
Don't say anything to anyone.

811
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,327
I swear to you, I will
bring him back, all right?

812
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,795
Wait, stop.

813
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,200
Barry?

814
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,752
You might as well take
that mask off.

815
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:19,322
I know it's you, Wells.
Or whoever you really are.

816
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:25,795
Well, allow to
to introduce myself.

817
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,799
My name is Eobard.

818
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,236
Eobard Thawne.

819
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:36,106
I don't understand.

820
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,274
Why do you have my name?

821
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,943
Why?

822
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:44,814
Well, 'cause we're family,
Eddie.

823
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,917
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

824
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,185
That is funny.

825
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,788
And the reason for that

826
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,626
Is because as far as
those guest lists are concerned,

827
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,662
I haven't been born yet.

828
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:03,700
So that's why you didn't kill me
that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?

829
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,506
This whole thing...

830
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:10,774
It's been about me?

831
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,475
Not a chance.

832
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:16,179
You, my friend,

833
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,248
Are simply my insurance.

834
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,790
You look so young.

835
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,165
And I could kill you

836
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,401
Right now so easy.

837
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,177
What I wouldn't have given...

838
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:53,149
All those times before
to have had you like this.

839
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,018
So...

840
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,586
Helpless.

841
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,089
But fate,

842
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,293
It's tricky, isn't it?

843
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,262
I come here to destroy you...

844
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,800
And then to get home,
I have to be the one

845
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,571
Who creates you.

846
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,012
But I will say,

847
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,581
It's been an education...

848
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,519
Watching you grow up
all these years.

849
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,990
Science fairs
and soccer games.

850
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,693
No hint, no sign,

851
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:40,597
No trace of the man
you will be one day

852
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,000
For whom I have
nothing but hate.

853
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:48,304
And to be clear,

854
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,307
Nothing is forgiven.

855
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,110
There will be a reckoning.

856
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:58,982
I promise you, Barry Allen,

857
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,717
That you will die.

858
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,710
Greg, move your head.
