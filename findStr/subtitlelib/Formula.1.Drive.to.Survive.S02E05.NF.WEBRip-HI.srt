1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,480
[Christian] Ah! [chuckles]

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
Ah!

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,416
We've got Rice Krispies on the dog.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
It's like a chimp's tea party, isn't it?

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,440
Can I have some poached eggs, please?
When you get the chance.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,240
What's your favorite car, Mol?

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,160
[Olivia] A digger!

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,200
[Christian chuckling] A digger? A digger!

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
She's coming, everyone, hide!

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,620
[shushes] Monty, get down! Get down!
[chuckles]

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,920
- Hey!
- [Christian] Hi!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,540
[Geri] Hey! Hi, darling!

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,840
- No, I haven't seen the children.
- [children] Hey!

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
- [Christian chuckles]
- [Geri] Hey!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,060
Mommy!

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,180
[Monty] Go!

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,060
[Geri] Hi.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,300
[Christian] Right.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,940
- Who's your favorite driver, Bluey?
- Lewis Hamilton.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,956
[Christian] You're winding me up now,
aren't you?

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,060
You're winding me up!

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,520
Who's your favorite driver?

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Sebastian.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,780
Sebastian?

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,520
Who's your favorite driver?

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,056
- [Bluebell] Please say Max Verstappen.
- [Monty] Max.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,280
- Oh! We got a Max fan.
- [Bluebell] Yay! [chuckles]

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
And Daddy.

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,960
[Christian] And Daddy.
Daddy's not the driver, though. So...

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,800
[Geri] Christian,
who's your favorite driver?

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,000
Who's my favorite driver?

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,000
[Geri] Come on, tell the truth.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,380
[Christian] Well...

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,460
I don't know...

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,460
Uh...

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,500
Who is ever winning for us.

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,780
[Christian]<i> Last season,
we lost Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Did I say his name right?

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,676
- [interviewer] Ricciardo?
- [woman] Riccardo.

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,556
- Is it Ricar... Riccardo or...
- [woman] Riccardo.

41
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,200
- He only drove for us for five years.
- [man laughs]

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,120
[woman] Yeah.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
- So, Riccardo?
- [woman] Riccardo.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah, we lost Daniel Ricciardo.
For us, that was slightly unexpected.

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,500
All right, good, that's great.

46
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,560
[man 1] Remove the smile.
Be a bit more intense.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
[man 2] Couple more. Hold it.

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
Thanks, Max. Okay.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
[Christian]<i> Max is
arguably the hottest property</i>

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,980
<i>in Formula 1 at the moment.</i>

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,480
[man 2] Little bit more
smile with your eyes.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Yep. There. Good, that's great.

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,060
So, we had to think long and hard

54
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,740
about who would be the right teammate
for Max Verstappen.

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,360
[man 2] Pull your helmet back
a little bit if you can.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,780
- [Christian] <i>It's a tough gig.</i>
- Nice. That first look up.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Money. So good.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,700
[Christian]<i> Looking within our own
talent pool, to step into that seat,</i>

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>Pierre Gasly was the obvious candidate.</i>

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,220
[commentator 1] <i>That's Pierre Gasly.
He's come fourth for Toro Rosso.</i>

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,720
[crowd cheers]

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,420
[commentator 2] <i>That's one of the greatest
Grand Prix finishes.</i>

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
[all cheering]

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,196
[Christian]<i> Product of
the Red Bull Junior team,</i>

65
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>he stepped up into the lead team.</i>

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,140
[Pierre]<i> Coming to Red Bull
was a really special moment.</i>

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
I tried to stay calm...

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,280
even though inside me, there was, like,
so much fire and I wanted to explode.

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,940
[man] Nice. Big smiles.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,080
[laughs]

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
[Max chuckles]

72
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, here he is. [chuckles]

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,780
I didn't see you. You good, man?

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,340
No, I was like,
"Why are they laughing at me?"

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
[man] I'm sorry, Pierre.
We didn't mean to laugh at you.

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,300
- [Pierre] Money. Money, money...
- [man] Money in the bank!

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,720
[Pierre] Hello.

78
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,980
Who the fuck are you? [chuckles]

79
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm Pierre Gasly. And you?

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,020
[Christian] <i>Now, Max is extremely
impressive for a 21-year-old.</i>

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,640
[all cheering]

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
[Max] Yes!

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,860
[Christian] Race winner,
what a debut. Fantastic.

84
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,320
<i>At the Barcelona race in 2016,</i>

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,620
<i>winning on his debut.</i>

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,296
[commentator] <i>Well done to Max Verstappen.</i>

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,860
[Christian] <i>Eighteen years of age.</i>

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,240
<i>But don't underestimate Pierre Gasly.</i>

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,660
<i>He's a great talent.</i>

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,120
What is your earliest memory
of racing each other?

91
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,300
[both chuckle]

92
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,936
[Max] You know what
I'm going to say, right?

93
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,260
You know what I'm gonna say.

94
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
- 2010 La Conca.
- [Pierre] Yeah.

95
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,640
- [both laugh]
- [Pierre] You fucking bastard.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,980
Wow. So, the story was,
I had to start every heat...

97
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,900
Six heats on Friday and Saturday
behind Pierre.

98
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,836
- [chuckles] But...
- How many... How many times...

99
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,600
How many times did I push Pierre
off the track in the first corner?

100
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,900
But this is actually
my first memory as well,

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,780
like, really fighting...
Fighting each other.

102
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
[Christian] <i>The biggest question mark
we have is,</i>

103
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,200
<i>"Is he gonna be up to the task, delivering
at the kinda level of Max Verstappen?"</i>

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>Monaco's the big event of the year.</i>

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,060
Morning.

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
<i>Last year was a fantastic race for us.</i>

107
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,940
<i>Winning the Grand Prix.</i>

108
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>So there's that pressure.</i>

109
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,940
<i>Everybody's expecting to see the Red Bull
cars near the front of the field.</i>

110
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,400
Good morning, gents. Hi.
Good morning, Nige.

111
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,920
[indistinct chatter]

112
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,080
[Max] What do you think?

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,260
- Looks sick! [chuckles]
- [Max] Nice! [chuckles]

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,100
[Pierre]<i> Monaco is really something
that gives me goosebumps.</i>

115
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,720
There's no track in the calendar
that is that challenging for us drivers,

116
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,240
so, it's a mental challenge.

117
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>Max is one, if not the best driver
on the grid at the moment.</i>

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,320
<i>So, it pushes me
because I know it's possible</i>

119
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,320
<i>to achieve these kind of performances.</i>

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,200
[indistinct chatter]

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,460
I think what is the most important
is that we get the best out of each other

122
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,040
and that's, at the end of the day,
the best also for the team.

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,460
[Christian]<i> Of course, both drivers get
exactly the same equipment.</i>

124
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,600
[indistinct chatter]

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,920
You are measured directly
against your teammate.

126
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,260
[man and Pierre speak French]

127
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,736
- [in English] You good?
- [man] Yeah, you?

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,060
[Christian]<i> And we need both of those cars
scoring as many points as we possibly can.</i>

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
[Christian] You all right?

130
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,260
Are you driving today or not?

131
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,936
- [Pierre] Am I driving?
- Are you driving this morning...

132
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,096
- [Pierre] Yeah.
- [Christian] Okay.

133
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,380
- So, we're just hanging out.
- [both chuckle]

134
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,776
Just make sure the car looks like that
at the end of session.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,140
[Pierre] Yeah, definitely.

136
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,520
[Christian] <i>Pierre Gasly. His career at
Red Bull Racing got off to a bad start.</i>

137
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,060
<i>He crashed twice in pre-season testing.</i>

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,940
<i>Did close to €2 million worth of damage.</i>

139
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,320
<i>That knocked his confidence.</i>

140
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,540
<i>And Monaco is a track
that is all about confidence.</i>

141
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,080
<i>For Pierre, that just
makes life even harder.</i>

142
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,780
[Pierre] The car pull is good.

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,480
[engineer]<i> Lift your pace now.</i>

144
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
[Pierre] Okay, copy, it's good.

145
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,580
[engineer] <i>Excellent, Pierre.</i>

146
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,420
[Pierre] Oh!

147
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,460
- Fuck!
<i>- </i>[commentator]<i> Gasly makes a mistake.</i>

148
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,480
<i>A cold shiver down his back,
I'm sure, now.</i>

149
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
[Christian] Ouch.

150
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,376
[engineer 1] Did you see how close
he came to binning this one?

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,956
- Yeah.
- [engineer 2] He caught it quite well.

152
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,400
- He caught it nicely!
- Yeah.

153
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
[engineer 1] Yeah, fortunately.

154
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,640
Then needed to come in
and change his underwear, I think!

155
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,400
[engineer 1] I reckon he did, too.

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,780
[Pierre] Where I lose a lot is, uh...
the chicane.

157
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
- [Christian] Yes.
- [Pierre] Yeah.

158
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,460
At the right-hander,
you seem to come in...

159
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,740
- Later.
- ...later. I see you taking a later apex.

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah. And then after, I'm also slower,
so I go on the gas...

161
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,540
And then you got a bigger turn...

162
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,800
- For the left one. Yeah.
- ...for the left.

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
[Pierre] Yeah. For sure...
It's wrong.

164
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
I don't need anyone to tell me,
"That's what you need to do."

165
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,300
<i>Because the target they set me
is lower than the one I set to myself.</i>

166
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,980
<i>That's the way I work.</i>

167
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,596
[Christian] Right, usual street race.

168
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,636
- Don't be a hero.
- [Pierre] Yeah. In the first lap.

169
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,016
- In the first fucking lap.
- [Pierre] Yeah.

170
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Okay?

171
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,080
- Just go with the track.
- [Pierre] This should be good.

172
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,856
[Christian] The circuit's
going to be horrible.

173
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,800
- Just keep building up.
- [Pierre] Yeah, I know.

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,640
All French drivers go well here.
It's almost compulsory.

175
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
- So, it'll be all right.
- [Pierre] Yeah.

176
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,600
[Christian] <i>Formula 1
is all about pressure.</i>

177
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,400
<i>We need Pierre to deliver
week in, week out.</i>

178
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,900
<i>The expectation is you gotta perform,
and I think, if he can do that here,</i>

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,500
<i>that'll just give him a lift in confidence
and set him up nicely for the races ahead.</i>

[man cheering]

181
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,980
[engineer] Thirty seconds.

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
[Pierre] Okay.

183
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,060
[engines revving]

184
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,780
[Christian] Take care.

185
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,820
[David]<i> And the Monaco Grand Prix
is go!</i>

186
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,880
<i>Bottas tries to cover up Verstappen.</i>

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,620
<i>It's wheel-to-wheel.
Bottas just squeezes ahead.</i>

188
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,880
<i>So, it's Hamilton, Bottas, and Verstappen,
the top three.</i>

189

[commentator]<i> There's Pierre Gasly.

[Pierre] <i>Monaco, it gives you
so much adrenaline.</i>

191

<i>Being as fast as you can,</i>

192
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,660
<i>but without losing the concentration,
otherwise you're in the wall.</i>

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,460
<i>Your level of focus is just so high.</i>

194
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,640
<i>You switch to a different mode.</i>

195
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
<i>Unconscious.</i>

196
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,020

you just switch to a different person.</i>

197

198
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
[Pierre] Okay.

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,136
[commentator] <i>So while the track
is being cleared,</i>

208

he's ahead of Bottas.</i>

212

- [engineer] <i>Ten laps remaining.</i>

221
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,880
[David] <i>Verstappen is really taking
the fight to Lewis Hamilton here,</i>

222

<i>the championship leader.</i>

223
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,316
[engineer] <i>You can overtake Hamilton
and drive off into the distance.</i>

224
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,420
[Max] I'm trying to.

225
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,156
[engineer] <i>I'll leave that with you, mate.</i>

226
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180

[Lewis] Those tires
aren't feeling too good, huh?

228
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Left front is dead.

229

- Go on!</i>

233
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,740
[Lewis] Tire doesn't want to turn.

234
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
These tires are dead.

235
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,340
We need to hope for a miracle.

236
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,960
He's on my ass.

237
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,100
I think I'm in big trouble, guys.

238
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,440
- [engineer] <i>Okay, Max, last lap.</i>
- [Max] Yeah.

239
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
Thread the needle.

240

[David] <i>Here goes Verstappen!</i>

242
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
[all] Oh!

244
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,380
[Max] Shit, shit, shit.

245

- [Max] Ah!

246

[David]<i> Hamilton wins
the Monaco Grand Prix!</i>

247
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,236
[engineer] <i>You drove
like a lion today, Max.</i>

248
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,840
<i>You gave it everything.
It was so, so unlucky.</i>

249
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,180
<i>- Really unlucky. You drove your heart out.
- </i>[Max] Yeah!

250
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
We deserved more.

251
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,780
[engineer] <i>It will come. It will come.</i>

252
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,740
[David] <i>Pierre Gasly
with a fifth-placed finish in the end.</i>

253
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,940
[Pierre] Thanks, boys. Was good.

254
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,960
The car was really super-fast.

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,000
[Christian] <i>So, Pierre, obviously,
he got a decent result in Monaco,</i>

256
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,720
but he was nowhere near
the pace of the lead group.

257
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,060
Being a really competitive guy,
I want everything to be perfect.

258
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,060
<i>Coming into a new team,
new people around me...</i>

259
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,680
<i>You need to be patient,
but it's also difficult at the same time,</i>

260
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,780
because I want this to be at 100%,
I want this to be at 100%.

261
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,560
I want myself to be at 100%.

262
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,240
<i>I just want it to come straightaway.</i>

263
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,820
[Will] <i>It's incredibly hard for Pierre.</i>

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,080
When you line up alongside Max Verstappen,

265
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,840

is gonna look like failure.</i>

266

[Christian] <i>Formula 1

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,840
Come on, then.
We're going to go see the helicopter.

268
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,260
[indistinct chatter]

269
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,496
[Christian] <i>For me, this year is busy.</i>

270
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,780
<i>Obviously, my wife's busy with
doing her stuff as well.</i>

271
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,200
Give us a hug.

272
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,956
- [Monty] Bye, Daddy, take care.
- See you later.

273
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
[Geri] Bye, girls.

274
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,940
What? Do you just want one of me?

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
[Christian] Come on, Geraldine. You'll be
late for your own fucking concert.

276
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
- Bye!
- Bye!

277
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,040
- Stop right now, thank you very much.
- [Geri] Thank you very much.

278
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,380
Somebody with a human touch.

279
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Not...

280
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

281
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,720
- Always on the run. Gotta slow it down...
- Always on the run. I've got that.

282
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,060
[Christian]<i> Pierre, it's going to be
a make-or-break season for him.</i>

283
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,520
He will be putting pressure on himself

284
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,820
because he will, obviously, be looking
to gauge himself against Max.

285
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,480
And inevitably, the media will be
looking at, "How does he compare?"

286
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,780
- Hi, there.
- Ready?

287
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,900
Right.

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,840
<i>If he can find that confidence,
he's a very capable racing driver.</i>

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,460
<i>Whether he's at Max's level,
I don't honestly know.</i>

290
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,920
<i>Only time will tell if he's capable
of running at the front in Formula 1.</i>

291
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,760
I'm knackered.

292
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,156
- [Geri] Yeah?
- [Christian] It's a big weekend.

293
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,020
[Geri] Mine is like having to do
12 Monacos in the space of three weeks.

294
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,900
Yeah, and you get... You get
one or two weeks off between each...

295
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,100
I've gotta do it, like, one,
then day off, another two.

296
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,020
Actually, I've gotta do three in a row.

297
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Just saying.

298
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,860
[whispering] I work harder. [chuckles]

[engineer] <i>Pierre, pick up your pace.</i>

301
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
[Pierre] Yeah, I'm trying to.

302
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
Gasly is poor.

303
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,820
Right. But he's losing four-tenths...

304
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,620
...in the last two corners.

305
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
It's like...

306
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,500
Which, I think, you or I could do.

307
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,260
[Christian] <i>His pace looked quite a bit
off his teammate.</i>

- Okay. Yeah.

309
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,100
The more you relax, the faster you go.

310
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,700
- [Pierre] Exactly.
- [Christian] Yeah?

311
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,800
<i>Pierre spends an awful lot of his time
looking at data.</i>

312
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,400
<i>Too much so.</i>

313
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,140
<i>He's not driving on instinct.</i>

314
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,520
At this level, you can't do that.

315
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,240
<i>He needs to stop screwing his own head,
measuring himself against Max,</i>

316
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,820

from Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc.</i>

332
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,440
<i>Ricciardo is ahead of Gasly.</i>

333
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,940
[engineer 1] <i>Close up to Ricciardo.</i>

334
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
[Pierre] Okay, copy.

335
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,320
[engineer 1] <i>Push, Pierre. Push.</i>

336
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,880
[David]<i> Gasly starting
to come under pressure.</i>

337
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
- Come on, come on.
- Come on!

338
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,940
[engineer 1] <i>We cannot keep doing this.</i>

339
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,220
<i>Push, Pierre. Push.</i>

340
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,500
[Pierre] Yeah, I'll try to.

341
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,800
[engineer 2] It's a good start, Max.
Take your time.

342
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
[Max] <i>Okay.</i>

343
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,440
[Max] I still need to gain
six, seven seconds, right?

344
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,780
[engineer 2] <i>You're about three and a half
seconds shy at the moment.</i>

345
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,420
<i>Now press and hold the overtake button.</i>

346
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,940
[Max] Okay.

347
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,840
[all clapping]

348
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,800
[Max]<i> What I like about racing</i>

349
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,140
<i>is driving on the limit
of what you can do as a person,</i>

350
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,800
<i>but then, also, being so close
to the ground and being that quick,</i>

351
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,600
<i>overtaking and stuff.</i>

352
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>Just confidence...</i>

353
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
<i>feeling...</i>

354
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,240
<i>and rhythm.</i>

355
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,460
[David]<i> Here's Verstappen.
He's up into sixth place.</i>

356
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
[engineer] <i>Push, Pierre.</i>

357
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
<i>Push, Pierre.</i>

358
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,120
[David]<i> Pierre Gasly is behind
by quite some margin.</i>

359
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
[engineer] <i>Close up.</i>

360
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,560
<i>Close up. Get past him. Quickly.</i>

361
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,520
[Pierre] Argh!

362
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,060
[David] <i>Lewis Hamilton wins
the Canadian Grand Prix!</i>

363
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,900
[commentator] <i>Max Verstappen charged up
from ninth to finish fifth.</i>

364
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,780
<i>But his teammate, Pierre Gasly,
slid backwards to eighth.</i>

365
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,300
[Christian]<i> Pierre, I forget the car
that he was stuck behind,</i>

366
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,580
<i>but there's nothing dynamic
about the drive.</i>

367
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,220
<i>We want the drivers to be heroes.</i>

368
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,840
<i>If he crashes a car, trying,
if he's going for it, I don't care.</i>

369
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,260
<i>What we don't wanna be doing is finish
in sixth or seventh or eighth or ninth.</i>

370
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,720
<i>That has no value to us.</i>

371
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,740
[chuckles]

372
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,200
Honestly, I remember
that weekend so, so much.

373
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,780
[Jean-Jacques] The first Grand Prix,

374
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,240
Formula 1 of Pierre,

375
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,720
for us, it's, uh...
it's very, very amazing.

376
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,460
[Pierre]<i> It's always fantastic
to have my parents around.</i>

377
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,380
<i>I don't really see them
so much anymore, you know.</i>

378
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,920
<i>I left home at 13.</i>

379
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,480
<i>All the time, I was in racing and karting.</i>

380
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,780
[in French] I really want to win
everything. I want to win every year.

381
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,480
[crowd cheering]

382
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,200
[in English] <i>It wasn't easy for my family.
They gave everything they had.</i>

383
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,480
<i>And they have been through
difficult situations just to support me</i>

384
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,700
<i>and try their best
to make my dream happen.</i>

385
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,500
[in French] It's Pierre's first
karting all-in-one suit.

386
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,760
He was only nine
when he started competition.

387
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,420
It is very precious to me.

388
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,720
He wore it all weekend.

389
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,720
He only took it off to go to sleep!

390
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,340
[in English] So... Okay.

391
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,640
<i>I've spent only one and a half years
in Formula 1,</i>

392
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
<i>and of course things are not perfect.</i>

393
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,860
But Max, he does the job perfectly,

394
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,440
always extracting everything
from the car, so...

395
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,440
<i>I just need to use that</i>

396
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,660
<i>and use the experience and the talent
he has to develop myself even quicker.</i>

397
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,840
[Christian] <i>The Red Bull Ring.
It's our home race.</i>

[Christian]<i> We have a home crowd

400
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
[announcer] <i>Max Verstappen is here!</i>

401
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,336
[journalist] Red Bull has a reputation
for being rather ruthless

402
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,540
with drivers who don't perform
at the level of their teammates.

403
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
Are you sort of worried?

404
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,136
No, not really. I think at the moment,
it's clear, you know.

405
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,880
No one is happy and I'm the first one
not happy with the performance.

406
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,720
Um... And then, yeah, that's not pleasant
and no one is happy about it, so...

407
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,000
You know, he's just getting a headfuck
at every race at the moment.

408
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,420
<i>Confidence then gets hit
and becomes self-perpetuating.</i>

409
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,220
<i>And the pressure just builds
and builds and builds.</i>

410
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,260
[indistinct chatter]

411
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,560
[man] They ask you a question
and sometimes you go on a bit.

412
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,820
You know, they can only ask
so many questions. So, you know...

413
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,900
So if you give a concise answer
then you're helping yourself.

414
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
[Pierre] Yeah.

415
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,280
[music playing]

416
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
How do you cope with this situation?

417
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,920
With the rumors
that you will lose your seat on...

418
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,276
- Yeah...
- Yeah, you're smiling,

419
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,000
but that's not a fact of smiling.

420
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,656
[Pierre] I don't have anything to say.
You know, rumors...

421
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,800
All the media, like, some of them,
I'd just like to tell them "fuck off,"

422
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,520
because some of these things are not fair.

423
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,640
<i>You know, a lot of people
try to break your dreams.</i>

424
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,640

426

[man] Fuck! That wasn't easy.

427
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
[Pierre] Yeah.

428
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,780
[man] You all right?

429

[Christian]<i> He's shown flashes
of real speed.</i>

430
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,320
That's what you're capable of.

431
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,780
<i>Now, it's a matter
of brushing himself down,</i>

432
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,380
<i>ignoring all the negativity
that he's getting</i>

433
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,660
<i>and to see if he can actually
realize the potential</i>

434

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,900
[Max laughs] Two in a row, Christian,
at home.

497
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Not too bad.

498
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,080
[Christian] Amazing. Honda's first win
as well, absolutely amazing.

499
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,460
[Max] Yeah, amazing job, guys.

500
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,120
[all laughing]

501
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
[Christian] Hey!

502
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Great job!

503
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,220
Very, very good.

504
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,040
[Yamomoto] Super, Max.

505
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Yeah, super.

506
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,420
[crowd cheering]

507
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,520
Oh, my God, that was epic.

508
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,760
Amazing.

509
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,180
[cheering]

510
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,560
[Christian]<i> Suddenly, things are coming
alive for us and we're fighting.</i>

511
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
<i>You know, the momentum is with us.</i>

512
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,160
[announcer] And now, Verstappen!

513
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,700
[imperceptible]

514
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,880
[all cheering]

515
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,840
[imperceptible]

516
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,180
Congrats.

517
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm fucking fast, but at the moment
I'm so fucking slow.

518
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,600
Just got to find, like...

519
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,220
The right thing for me.

520
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,560
But I think there were still
some positives today, but...

521
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,060
I pushed too much at the beginning
when I was behind Räikkönen.

522
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,100
I pushed too much,
then after I caused a blister.

523
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
- Made things worse. But...
- [Christian] Yeah.

524
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,900
- Yep.
- That was...

525
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,120
Not great, but...

526
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,080
Max wins, so at least we know...

527
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,160
- We got a good car.
- [Christian] We have a good car.

528
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,460
<i>You know, it's hard on Pierre,</i>

529
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,680
<i>it feels like we've given him
a huge amount of time,</i>

530
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,140
a huge amount of effort
to try and make this work...

531
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,060
Congratulations.

532
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
[Christian] <i>And...</i>

533
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,100
he was promoted into that drive...

534
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,860
prematurely.

535
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,740
<i>You know, I can't keep
making excuses for him.</i>

536
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,960
You know, if they're good enough,

537
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,380
they swim, they survive.

538
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,080
<i>If they're not good enough...</i>

539
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,140
<i>The question is, who is the right guy
to be partnering Max Verstappen?</i>

540
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,900
- This is the living room.
- [Sophie] That's the dining room.

541
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,360
Dining room.

542
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,280
[man 1] <i>Red Bull's an impatient machine.</i>

543
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,860
<i>The question is, who is the right guy?</i>

544
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,440
[man 2]<i> It's such a dangerous sport.</i>

545
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,820
Holy jeez.

546
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,580
He would have given his right arm
to be in your position.

547
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,080
[man 3] <i>He aced that one brilliantly.</i>

548
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,320
- Can you win this weekend?
- Yeah!

549
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,240
[man 4] Whoa!

550
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,680
- [man 5] We'll speak later.
- You can occasionally kiss if you want.

551
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,680
Showtime.
