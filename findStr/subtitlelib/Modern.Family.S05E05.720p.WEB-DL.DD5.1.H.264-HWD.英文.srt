1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,280
Gloria, honey!

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,720
I'm ready whenever you are!

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,820
We should hurry. The reservation's at 7:00.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,990
Claire, where are you?

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, see you in two.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,470
What are you doing?

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,810
I'm striking a seductive pose for your mother.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,110
Gross. But I like the suit. Is that new?

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,930
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,410
Now that his honey gots her own money,

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,090
daddy went and snagged hisself some new threads, girl.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,350
Hands down, your funniest voice.

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,840
Bordering on the offensive.

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,410
Listen, I'm a realtor,

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,530
and I work a lot with families,

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,000
so normally, I dial the sexy back to five,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,740
but Claire's been working very hard lately.

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,200
So tonight...

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,260
Stick around if you want to see

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,030
your mom's tongue fall out of her mouth.

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,400
Not unless you want to see my lunch fall out of mine.

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,580
Oh, I'm sorry I am late.

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,230
Traffic was horrible.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,650
Sounds like someone could use a tall drink of water.

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,670
Yeah, right. Water.

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,740
Luke, what did I tell you about

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,850
leaning back on that thing?

28
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,140
I don't know. "Don't"?

29
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,300
Honey, what are you still doing here?

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,670
You're supposed to be babysitting Joe.

31
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,920
Yeah, but I have to drop off Alex to watch Lily first,

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,990
and she's still not ready.

33
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,100
She can't be concerned about her looks, right?

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,750
- I can hear you! - I'm kidding.

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,260
I'm just saying,

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,330
it'd be sad to think she actually tries.

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,140
- Heard that, too! - It was a joke!

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,030
Man, do big ears actually hear better?

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,790
Oh, my God, just stop talking.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,920
Okay, girls.

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,350
It's time for you guys to hit the road.

42
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,900
Okay, bye.

43
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,970
- Oh, yeah, bye. - Bye.

44
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,190
Why aren't you going with them?

45
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,140
He wanted to stay home.

46
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,470
I said it was okay.

47
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,150
- By himself? - It's fine.

48
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,260
If he's old enough to watch "The Walking Dead" with me...

49
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,090
- He's not. - then he's old enough

50
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,830
- to stay home alone. - He's not.

51
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,510
Claire, he's not a little boy anymore.

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,260
I'm fine.

53
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,890
See how deep his voice is?

54
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,350

YYeTs.com

60
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,780
Oh, this is Haley.

61
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,700
"Be there in 5. Alex took ducking forever."

62
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,710
Oh, it's fine. You know what?

63
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,160
We have to pick the "Save the date" card.

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,970
I'm at a loss.

65
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,930
Can we just do it tomorrow?

66
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,680
I hate the way my dad looks at us when we're late,

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,180
like we're two silly queens

68
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,300
blasting disco music,

69
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,070
primping, losing track of time.

70
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,930
Wow, it gets really busy in that head, huh?

71
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,910
Okay, quick. Which one do you like?

72
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,020
- Uh, that one. - Really?

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,990
I think you picked too quick.

74
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,380
No, I didn't. I really like that one.

75
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,480
I really like this one.

76
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,350
Well, then, why did you ducking ask me?

77
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,180
Fine, goes with yours.

78
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
Well, if that's the one you really like.

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
Can you just get ready?

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,660
Yeah. Lily, hit it.

81
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,600
On it!

82
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,170
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

83
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,940
I've never seen you so excited about a restaurant.

84
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,230
I've waited six weeks for this reservation.

85
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,070
They have an Australian Wagyu beef

86
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,620
that's supposed to change your life.

87
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,460
In the way heart disease changes your life?

88
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,060
Because you're a pillar of health.

89
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,890
They only feed this cow alfalfa, barley, and red wine,

90
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,780
and some chef hand-picks each cut,

91
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,280
dry ages it 35 days

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,250
before cooking it to a perfect medium-rare,

93
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,220
all for me.

94
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,810
Doesn't the wine make the cow drunk?

95
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,200
It's not "The Far Dide." The cow doesn't drive anywhere.

96
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,470
Gloria!

97
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,470
Let's go!

98
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,570
You know she's not here, right?

99
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,300
What?

100
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,780
She's having her hair blown out.

101
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,030
That's a thing?

102
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,700
That I pay for?

103
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,170
Gloria's always late.

104
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,710
Then I get mad and tell her to hurry.

105
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,350
We yell, and it just takes longer.

106
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,290
So I promised myself, no matter how late she is,

107
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,540
just to take some deep breaths and stay calm.

108
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,760
That's the only thing I learned in lamaze class

109
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,730
because we were always late.

110
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,460
Hi! Everybody's running like crazy tonight.

111
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,500
I took San Vicente thinking that I was gonna save some time,

112
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,340
but then they're working on the sewer.

113
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,650
So I went around Montana,

114
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,810
down Moreno.

115
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,110
But then there's that dip in the road.

116
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,870
I always forget about that dip in the road.

117
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,910
I hit it so hard that I spilled the coffee all over the car.

118
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,350
Did I tell you who I had coffee with?

119
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,150
I think Luke is scared to be left in the house alone,

120
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,610
and he's just pretending to be brave for you.

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,070
Honey, he's 14.

122
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,090
We left Alex alone when she was 10.

123
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,990
We didn't leave her. We forgot her.

124
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,950
And when we got home, she was fine.

125
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,050
Physically.

126
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,300
Plus, she's still friends with

127
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
that sweet 911 operator.

128
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,950
Yeah.

129
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,090
What are you doing?

130
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,080
Making sure Luke knows

131
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,400
what to do in case of emergency.

132
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,040
Of course he does.

133
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,400
Someone's at the door!

134
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,970
Luke, it's just your mom testing you.

135
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,100
Don't worry, mom.

136
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,470
If I hear that while you're gone,

137
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,670
I won't answer.

138
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,670
I'll just hide where no one can find me.

139
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,540
Cam, come on, let's go.

140
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,640
Two seconds.

141
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,800
I thought that being with a man

142
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,570
meant that I wouldn't have to wait around like this.

143
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,180
I feel cheated. I do.

144
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,380
Let's play dolls.

145
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,090
Actually, I want to read you one of my favorite books.

146
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,040
It's called "Little Women," and it's about four sisters

147
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,190
who overcome poverty and the patriarchy...

148
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,380
Nope! Dolls.

149
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
This is Ashley. She's a wife.

150
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,350
Well, I hope that's not the only thing that defines her.

151
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,020
Does she have a career?

152
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,440
Nope, she shops. Where's Haley?

153
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,400
How come it takes me five minutes to get ready,

154
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,520
and you take forever?

155
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,230
Oh, please. I could get ready in five minutes, too,

156
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,420
if I dressed like --

157
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,310
You did it again.

158
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,500
Not changing.

159
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,110
Fasten your seatbelts.

160
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,220
It's going to be a crazy night.

161
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,040
No, honey, it's gonna be a bumpy night.

162
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,290
Remember, you can't have two dads

163
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,990
and make that mistake.

164
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,380
Bumpy night.

165
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,310
Okay, so how often does this happen?

166
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,320
Too often.

167
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,040
Men just don't have that many options.

168
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,500
I can't tell you the number of times

169
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
I've walked by a women's boutique

170
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,180
and just thought, "What I would do

171
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,580
to have that many choices."

172
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,750
Don't ever say that again.

173
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,950
I don't like any part of it.

174
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,310
All right, one of us has to change.

175
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,620
We look like twin toddlers at church.

176
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,420
Yeah, tell me about it.

177
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,410
And this place we're going is supposed to be super hip.

178
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,280
We're probably gonna run into someone.

179
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
And come on. I don't have that many outfits.

180
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,700
My clothes take up exactly one-quarter of the closet.

181
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,390
That's not fair. My clothes are bigger than yours.

182
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,110
All right, I hate to play this card,

183
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,100
but I was dressed first. So...

184
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,590
Oh, that is silly.

185
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,610
Lily, it's time to play "Who wore it best?"

186
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,820
No, I'm not doing this again. I can't.

187
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,230
Fine. Alex.

188
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,460
Uh, I don't know.

189
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,380
Boys' clothes aren't really my thing.

190
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Really?

191
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,160
I don't get it.

192
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
Doesn't the wine get the cow drunk?

193
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,200
- Thank you. - Honest to God.

194
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
Have neither of you seen a cow?

195
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,320
They're huge.

196
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,760
I bet tequila would do it quicker.

197
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,890
It's not the goal to get the cow drunk.

198
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,730
You got to be kidding me.

199
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,450
Manny, see why your mother's taking so long.

200
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,770
And don't tell her I sent you.

201
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,880
Mom! Hurry!

202
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,280
Don't yell. I could have yelled.

203
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,910
- Then why didn't you? - Because I didn't want to yell.

204
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,640
- I want you to go. - Why can't you go?

205
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,970
Why can't you do what I ask?

206
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,680
I'm trying to do something new here!

207
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Stop yelling, Jay! I'm ready!

208
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,810
Oh, geez.

209
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,000
Haley, Manny knows where all the baby stuff is,

210
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,070
and if Joe won't go to bed,

211
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,990
just put on Gladys Knight

212
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,090
and bounce him around a little bit.

213
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,110
Oh, you still do that?

214
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,550
I loved when you did that with us.

215
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,100
How about that?

216
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,610
Somebody in this family remembers a nice thing I did.

217
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,120
I remember something nice you did.

218
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,370
You bought me this dress yesterday when you were working.

219
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,270
How do I look?

220
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,650
Gorgeous. Let's go!

221
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,300
You didn't even look at me. Haley.

222
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,780
Well, "A," your hair looks amazing,

223
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,260
like you just got off a horse.

224
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,920
That's exactly what I was going for.

225
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,980
But if I had one thought...

226
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,000
No! No thoughts.

227
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,510
...are those for sure the best earrings?

228
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,000
They seem to be kind of getting lost.

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,780
I have the same color in a bigger size.

230
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,160
- How much bigger? - Like a meter.

231
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,430
A meter? That's like a foot.

232
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,610
Actually, it's like a yard.

233
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,110
Oh, sorry -- it's like a millimeter.

234
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,000
You mean a centimeter.

235
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,840
All this math. Just show me.

236
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
- Gloria! - What?

237
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
I think the new earrings

238
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,180
are really gonna tie your whole outfit together.

239
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,760
You're so sweet!

240
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,770
Wow. That was very mature of you.

241
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,280
Yeah, well, I'm a lot older now

242
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,150
than when she started getting dressed.

243
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,850
So this sound...

244
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,050
...that's the doorbell.

245
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,310
That other sound was the smoke alarm.

246
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,990
Got it.

247
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,940
Okay, and if you're hungry, don't order a pizza.

248
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,370
They don't screen those delivery guys.

249
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,690
Half of them are ex-cons.

250
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,190
Stop it. You're gonna scare him. It's gonna be fine.

251
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,680
But if you do choke, you've gotta throw yourself

252
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,540
against the back of a chair to get the food out.

253
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,030
He'll just drink stuff.

254
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,220
Nothing from under the sink.

255
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,590
Even if it's lemony?

256
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm just messing with you.

257
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,910
In case of fire, go low and get out.

258
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,120
In case of earthquake --

259
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,700
Wait. You think there could be an earthquake?

260
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,830
The last time we had one, that big cabinet fell on me.

261
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,150
- No, it didn't. - It did?!

262
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,870
Let's go.

263
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Bye, honey, we love you.

264
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Do you have the keys?

265
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,130
We're gonna check in. I promise!

266
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,030
Uhh, what's going on?

267
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,160
New suit?

268
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
This old thing?

269
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,410
Yes, it is.

270
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,600
I got it at this hipster place downtown.

271
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,910
You like it?

272
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,620
It's tight.

273
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,130
Well, the salesman said it was the style,

274
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,260
and he looked like a Mumford and Son,

275
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,230
so I think he'd know.

276
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,630
Mm, let's go.

277
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,700
Slow down, Flo Jo.

278
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,540
You know what? We don't have time for this.

279
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,320
I'll just change.

280
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,620
Well, now I feel bad. Let's both just change.

281
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,770
That's the fair thing to do.

282
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,090
Okay, fine. But quickly, pLemony Snicketlease.

283
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,540
I don't know.

284
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,810
It's blue.

285
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,450
Yeah, this one's so yellow.

286
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,950
Oh, you know what?

287
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,310
I have a stain on this one. I can't wear it.

288
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,380
Oh, paisley, yeah. I don't know.

289
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,900
Are you kidding me right now?!

290
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,170
- What? - I know this trick, Cam.

291
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,780
You take forever to pick out an outfit,

292
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,490
knowing very well that I'll say, "Let's just go,"

293
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,340
because we're late.

294
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,230
Meantime, you get credit for offering to change

295
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,850
while I'm the one who actually does.

296
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,960
- As usual. - Excuse me.

297
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,490
Are you accusing me of manipulating you to get my way?

298
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,180
Actually...

299
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,720
Because that's what my mother used to accuse me of,

300
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
and I got to say

301
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,980
that that brings up a lot of stuff with me.

302
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,600
You're crying without tears.

303
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,010
Give me a minute.

304
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,380
"'Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,'

305
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,490
"Grumbled Jo.

306
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,860
'it's so dreadful to be poor,' sighed --"

307
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,840
Stop! I hate this.

308
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,020
Can I put makeup on you?

309
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,670
Why does everyone ask me that?

310
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,450
Let's just have a good time tonight, all right?

311
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,110
- I'm not mad. - Okay, good.

312
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,250
And you do look super-duper handsome in that.

313
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,140
Don't even.

314
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,300
I'm gonna grab a water for the road.

315
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,260
Yeah, get me a soda.

316
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,870
Okay, Alex. Thank you so much.

317
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,000
Have a fun night.

318
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,260
Honey, we love you.

319
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,080
- Here you go. -All right. Thank you.

320
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,740
Okay, and remember, no eating in the living room.

321
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,580
Aah! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

322
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,810
What did you do? What did you do?!

323
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,050
Come on! You can't possibly think --

324
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,970
You shook this can

325
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,790
so you could wear the outfit that I wanted to wear?

326
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,860
That is exactly what I think!

327
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,600
That is insane.

328
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,910
You saw me take it from the refrigerator

329
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,460
- and bring it to you. - Did I?

330
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,360
Or were you out of my sight for the two seconds

331
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,330
that it took you to get from the refrigerator to here,

332
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,580
which would have given you exactly the right amount of time

333
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,670
to shake the can?

334
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,350
Nice theory, Nancy Grace, but I'm not that petty.

335
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,350
Okay, you two. Did you see anything?

336
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,350
Just pretend you're coloring.

337
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,770
Okay, what are you doing?

338
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,780
I'm trying to reach the mirror.

339
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,880
I got something in my eye.

340
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,980
Hi, you've reached the Dunphys.

341
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,910
Why isn't Luke picking up?

342
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,850
It's hard to reach the phone

343
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,090
when you're tied up by a recently paroled pizza guy.

344
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,660
Ha ha. You're very funny.

345
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,820
What are you doing?

346
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,550
I know it sounds weird.

347
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,450
Call it mother's intuition,

348
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,600
but I just have this feeling that something is wrong.

349
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,680
Fine, do what you want,

350
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,110
but I've just about had it up to --

351
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,240
higher than here with this.

352
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,630
Die, pizza man!

353
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,230
Stop! Stop!

354
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,180
Oh. Sorry, mom.

355
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,200
Told you he could take care of himself.

356
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,700
Move.

357
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,790
Why does she do this?

358
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,470
We're gonna lose our table.

359
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,260
She knows how important it is to me to be on time.

360
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,220
This is torture.

361
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,180
I think you've lost perspective, Jay.

362
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,500
You know what I would give to wait around

363
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,840
for a woman like that?

364
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,940
Reel it in, creepy.

365
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,460
That's your mother up there.

366
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,770
Sorry, sorry.

367
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,130
Once I changed the earrings, I had to change the shoes.

368
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,910
And then I tried on one of Gloria's old dresses,

369
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,710
which made me feel like a 10-year-old boy.

370
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,460
Ay, your body's beautiful.

371
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,110
I agree.

372
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,670
Take it outside the family.

373
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,100
Okay, we ready to go?

374
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,770
Wait. I have the wrong lipstick.

375
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,950
Oh! That's it! I've had it!

376
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,730
Just one minute!

377
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,030
Nothing takes a minute with you.

378
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,090
We're leaving right now.

379
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,630
I don't care what you have to do.

380
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,380
It's bad enough you're being rude to me,

381
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,490
but you're being rude

382
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,770
to the people sitting there waiting for us!

383
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,140
Sorry, you're the first to arrive,

384
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,570
and we can't seat you till everyone's here.

385
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,870
I hope you're happy!

386
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,030
Where the hell is everybody?

387
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,900
Yes, I hate waiting like this.

388
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,860
Do you?

389
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,840
Just because everybody else is late

390
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,730
doesn't make it okay for us to be late.

391
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,720
I can't get ready fast with all the yelling!

392
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,530
I wasn't yelling.

393
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,170
You see, you're doing it again!

394
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,920
Gloria, you do this every single time.

395
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,370
If you know how long it takes you to get ready,

396
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,680
why don't you start earlier?

397
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,910
I have my reasons.

398
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
I would love to know them.

399
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,590
You're going to be mean.

400
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,020
I promise I won't be.

401
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,760
I like to make an entrance.

402
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,120
What's that, now?

403
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,680
I like the part where I go in,

404
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,190
and everybody's waiting for me,

405
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,530
and they say,

406
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,380
"Gloria, you look so pretty,

407
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,730
and that dress is so beautiful."

408
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,130
Is that so bad?

409
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,290
I don't love it.

410
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,420
Oh, this room is so nice.

411
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,440
I know. It's almost as gorgeous as -- you monster!

412
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,660
What? Oh, this?

413
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,820
Well, you know, you couldn't wear it,

414
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,740
so I figured, what's the harm?

415
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,330
Mm. Okay, you know what? I will go over there,

416
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,520
and I will be as socially magnetic as I always am.

417
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,870
We will put this on the back burner,

418
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,110
but underneath, I want you to know, I am fuming.

419
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,550
Hey, Jay, where's Gloria?

420
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,230
She's -- she was there a second --

421
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,440
There are my boys!

422
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,420
Gloria, you look so pretty.

423
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,770
That dress is so beautiful.

424
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,980
You got to be kidding me.

425
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,640
You let him watch those scary shows with you,

426
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,020
and then we leave him home alone at night.

427
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,500
Of course he's gonna arm himself.

428
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,770
He was fine until you gave him your "50 Ways to Die" speech.

429
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,200
What was the one about the welcome mat?

430
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,450
They are highly flammable.

431
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,850
For seven to ten people a year,

432
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,050
they may as well say, "Welcome to the morgue."

433
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,780
You know what? Drop it.

434
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,820
I don't want to fight in public.

435
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,240
- It's embarrassing. - Fine.

436
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,800
Hi, how are you?

437
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,560
Good evening. Good.

438
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh, my leg's asleep!

439
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,340
My leg's asleep! Okay, thank you.

440
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,050
Sir, if the rest of your party doesn't arrive soon,

441
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,250
we have to give up your table.

442
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,070
Any minute.

443
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,600
Again, dad, sorry we're late.

444
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,540
Yeah, you know, Mitchell put on some music,

445
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,620
and we were primping and dancing around,

446
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,440
and I guess, well, we just lost track of time.

447
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,790
Actually, dad, what happened

448
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,140
was Cam was practicing this trick

449
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,440
where he pretends to be accommodating

450
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,120
and then magically gets his way.

451
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,820
There they are.

452
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,560
We need a second.

453
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
Oh, Cam, no.

454
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,970
Where are you guys going?

455
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,380
Can't talk. Too mad.

456
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,640
Oh, God.

457
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,290
Hi, dad.

458
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,100
Where's Gloria?

459
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,750
She -- for the love of --

460
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,420
There you are!

461
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh, my goodness! That dress!

462
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,570
Gloria, holy mackerel.

463
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,780
We're so sorry we're late.

464
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,910
We had to drop Luke off at your place.

465
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,830
Phil wanted him to stay home alone, but he got scared.

466
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,040
Man, I can't wait to get some food

467
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,730
in my mouth and yours.

468
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,260
Poor Haley.

469
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,610
What is she going to do with all those boys?

470
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,760
I'll be with him

471
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
I know you will

472
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,930
On that midnight train to Georgia

473
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,240
Leaving on the midnight train to Georgia

474
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,520
You know what?

475
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I resent the implication that I always get my way.

476
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,600
Really? The "Save the date" cards.

477
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,720
For our wedding?

478
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,020
Oh. So, it is still our wedding.

479
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,430
I wasn't sure I was even invited

480
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,230
because you keep asking for my opinion

481
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,680
and then doing the exact opposite.

482
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,410
- That's one thing. - What about the music?

483
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,420
I think our love deserves a band, not a D.J.

484
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,160
The tablecloths.

485
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,820
They make sneakers out of that fabric.

486
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,870
You won't let me pick one thing, and you want to know why?

487
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,390
Because I have better taste than you.

488
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,300
I was gonna say because you're a control freak.

489
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,100
And how can you think that I have bad taste?

490
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,990
We chose the exact same outfit.

491
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,820
Did we?

492
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,970
I wore fun loafers.

493
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,530
You wore sensible oxfords.

494
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,610
Your collar's buttoned down.

495
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,860
Mine's a more current widespread.

496
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,330
And I chose a bold pocket square

497
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,090
to bring out the stripe in the shirt,

498
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,470
all of which you wouldn't have thought of.

499
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,100
Because, well, I've already said.

500
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,330
You don't like my oxfords?

501
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,870
I'm sorry. I'm being harsh.

502
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,520
- They're fine. - Thank you.

503
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,130
For a small-town detective.

504
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,820
Okay, look. I can't help myself. I did it again.

505
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,900
So, I-I don't love them.

506
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,080
But I do love you.

507
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,290
And I don't want you to feel left out.

508
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,880
Okay. Then let me have a say in planning our wedding.

509
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,090
That's what we agreed to.

510
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,920
You will, and you should, and I'm sorry.

511
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,760
Thank you.

512
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,430
Can you just do one thing for me?

513
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,400
Sure.

514
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,400
Just be honest, and I'll let this go forever.

515
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,590
Did you shake that can?

516
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,910
No.

517
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,770
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

518
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,220
See, Phil?

519
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,050
They don't let Manny stay home alone.

520
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,080
Why do you think Haley's there?

521
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,170
Actually, we let Manny stay home all the time,

522
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,220
and sometimes, he makes cupcakes,

523
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,180
which I could use one right about now --

524
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,400
or a potato.

525
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,640
Haley's there to take care of Joe.

526
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,470
Are you sure, guys?

527
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,620
'cause Claire's always right about everything

528
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,080
all the time, forever and ever.

529
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,310
Thank god. Here they are.

530
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,510
Fiona, we're all here.

531
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,290
Actually, dad, we could use a moment.

532
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,280
I'm going to eat my hand.

533
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,540
"Jo immediately sat up,

534
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,720
"put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.

535
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,650
"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish."

536
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,780
"That's why I do it."

537
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,200
"I detest rude, unladylike girls."

538
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,370
"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits."

539
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,710
Okay, this stinks. I give up.

540
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,060
Thank god.

541
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,460
Want to see your hair?

542
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,180
Lily, that's actually good.

543
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,040
Can you really do makeup?

544
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,720
Stay there.

545
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,010
Is it really too much to ask that you consult me

546
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,500
before you make such a big decision?

547
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,690
Claire, when you went back to work,

548
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,130
you asked me to take the reins.

549
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,700
So I think you need to trust me now.

550
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,030
Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?

551
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,810
He's my favorite, which I did not just say.

552
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,180
- If anything happens to him... - It won't.

553
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,000
If you haven't noticed, I'm pretty good at this,

554
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,090
as hard as it is for you to pay me a compliment.

555
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,570
Where is that coming from?

556
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,830
Well, do you like this suit?

557
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,900
I wouldn't know

558
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,300
because all you said was, "It's tight,"

559
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,000
and not in a cool black way.

560
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,890
Wait, a-are you trying to say

561
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,130
that you squeezed yourself in that for me?

562
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,050
Yes.

563
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,820
You've been a little distracted at work,

564
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,460
so I wanted to look nice for you.

565
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,480
Oh, honey.

566
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,170
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,410
You're right.

568
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,400
Luke probably would have been fine,

569
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,530
and I am having a hard time letting go.

570
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,600
And if there's one person in the world I trust, it is you.

571
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,750
And?

572
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,620
And...you look hot in that suit.

573
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,450
When we get home later...

574
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,120
Okay, you're actually gonna need to stop.

575
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,830
This suit can't get any tighter.

576
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey, we're back.

577
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,800
Nobody goes anywhere.

578
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,920
Everybody hold hands, and we go right to the table.

579
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,640
Fiona?

580
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,570
Actually, we just gave away your table.

581
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,520
I'm sorry, but I did warn you about this.

582
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,350
Listen to me, Fiorina.

583
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,070
This man has been waiting

584
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,350
to eat in this restaurant for months!

585
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,860
We were all selfish, and we made him late.

586
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,970
And maybe I got a little crazy,

587
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,650
but I'm gonna think about that later.

588
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,460
But he has done nothing wrong!

589
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
So we're not gonna leave this place

590
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,240
until he eats that drunk cow

591
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,530
that he can't shut up his mouth about!

592
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,430
Why you haven't moved?

593
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,880
Last night, I had the greatest meal I've ever had,

594
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,710
and it never would have happened

595
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,450
if Gloria hadn't got us kicked out

596
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,990
of that snooty restaurant.

597
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,770
Tacos.

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,410
- Tacos. - I need a taco.

599
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,390
- Yes. - Taco truck!

600
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,690
That is delicious.

601
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,080
No, but seriously, who looks better?

602
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,480
I don't know if it was the six scotches I drank

603
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,900
waiting for everybody,

604
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,290
or the fact that I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast...

605
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,020
or the moment Phil's suit finally gave up.

606
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,090
They even played my favorite song.

607
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,900
He's leaving

608
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,900
Leaving

609
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,760
On that midnight train to Georgia

610
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,770
Leaving on the midnight train

611
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,230
Said he's going back to find

612
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,240
Going back to find

613
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,370
the simpler place and time

614
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,190
Oh, yes, he is

615
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,390
And I'll be with him

616
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,740
Yes, he will

617
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,880
On that midnight train to Georgia

618
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,390
A train I'd never make

619
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,490
unless I told Gloria it left at 11:00.

620
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,040
I'd rather live in his world

621
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,790
than live without him in mine

622
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,580
Here you go.

623
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,960
I didn't know what you wanted to drink,

624
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
so I just got you this soda.

625
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,590
That's fine. Thank you.

626
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,540
Cam, what did you do?

627
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,940
I did exactly what you did

628
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,720
because I know you so well.

629
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,600
I didn't shake the soda.

630
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,160
Then you have nothing to worry about,

631
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,570
so go ahead and open it.

632
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,340
I shook it, okay?

633
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,010
I shook the soda. I shook it up!

634
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,230
Are you happy?

635
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,680
It was petty and stupid and awful.

636
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,630
I'm sorry.

637
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,680
Damn it.
