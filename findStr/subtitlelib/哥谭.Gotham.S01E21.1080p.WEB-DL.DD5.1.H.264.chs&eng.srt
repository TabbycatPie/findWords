你希望我去告诉邦德斯洛你发现他了吗

Morning. How'd you sleep?

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,750
我们真正入睡的那一小时吗
The hour we slept?

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,170
很好
Great.

23

我给你讲讲我为今天做的安排

昨晚过得很愉快  不是吗
We had fun last night, right?

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,130
别走
Stay.

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,810
听着  你没必要这么做的
Listen, you don't have to do this.

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,910
做什么
Do what?

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,880
昨晚在舞会上
Last night at the ball,

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,890
你确实说得天花乱坠
you talked a good game.

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,800
但还是别假装我们之间还有更多感情了
But let's not pretend this is more than what it is.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,500
芭芭拉  我不是装的
Barbara, I'm not pretending with you.

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,780
我想要你
I want you

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
留下来陪我

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,110
算了吧
I don't think so.

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,720
等等  等等
Just... wait, wait, wait.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
放开
Let go.

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,040
好吧
Look...

43
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,270
我确实在伪装
I was pretending with you.

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,960
但并不是你想象的那样
But not in the way you think.

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,310
我们初遇的那晚上
The night we met....

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,400
我本来想杀掉你的
I was going to kill you.

47
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,060
-不好笑  -但是...
- That's not funny. - But then...

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,330
我在你身上看到了某种特质
I saw something in you,

49
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,790
芭芭拉  我看到了
Barbara, I saw...

50
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,020
真实的你
the real you.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,970
你就是我一直在寻找的女人
You are the woman that I have been searching for.

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,030
你骗人
You're lying.

53
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,060
我这就放开你
I'm gonna let you go now,

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,580
你要乖乖坐下
and you're going to sit down

55
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,610
和我一起吃早餐
and have breakfast with me.

不
No!

那就用粗暴的方式来了

第一季第二十一集

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,140
你还好吗
How are you doing?

64
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,790
不太好  见到哈维了吗
Been better. You seen Harvey?

65
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,650
没有
No.

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,470
芭芭拉有消息吗
Any word on Barbara?

67
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,550
还没发现她的尸体
They haven't found her body yet,

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,130
所以她有可能还活着
so there's a chance she's still alive.

69
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,830
你多久没睡觉了
When's the last time you slept?

70
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,160
不知道
I don't know.

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,300
-吃饭呢  -我不知道
- Last time you ate? - I don't know.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,350
我知道让你睡你肯定也不会听话
I know better than to try to get you to sleep,

73
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,590
但你至少得吃点东西
but you really should eat something.

74
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,820
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

75
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,950
吉姆
Jim...

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
这不是你的错
it's not your fault.

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,590
都怪我  是我向洛布施压
I did this. I pressed Loeb,

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,730
他才让食人魔找上了我
he sent the Ogre after me,

79
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,190
而我没有停手
and I didn't stop.

80
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,170
明知道会给你带来危险就够糟糕了
It was bad enough I knowingly put you in danger.

81
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,900
我都没想起还有芭芭拉
I didn't even think of Barbara.

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,970
那是你的工作
You were doing your job.

83
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,210
-但我早该知道的  -怎么可能
- But I should've known. - How?

84
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,000
你们已经分手了
Y-You weren't together.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,580
难道不爱她了你也要怪自己吗
Do you blame yourself for falling out of love?

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,870
小莱  这是我的责任
Lee, it's my responsibility.

87
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,090
你说什么也不能改变这个事实
There's nothing you can say that changes that.

88
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
芭芭拉出了事
Whatever happens to Barbara,

89
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,670
那就得怪我
it's on me.

90
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,970
我理解
I understand.

91
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,270
吉姆
Jimbo!

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,070
这位是皮条客杰克
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

93
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,220
他在外面跟人吹牛
He's been bragging on the streets

94
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,320
说他知道食人魔是谁
that he knows who the Ogre is.

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,530
我跟你说了多少遍了
I keep telling you, man,

96
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,620
你被骗了  我什么也不知道
you been lied to; I don't know nothing.

97
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,200
是吗
Yeah?

98
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,520
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,950
好了
Okeydoke.

100
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,530
没尸体不立案  没尸体不立案
No body, no crime. No body, no crime.

101
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,160
没有  从来没见过他
Nope. Never seen him before.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
我们认为这个人是连环杀手食人魔
We think this is a serial killer called the Ogre.

103
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,620
他绑架了一个女人
He's kidnapped a woman,

104
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,360
而且要杀掉她  除非我们先抓到他
and he's gonna kill her unless we find him first.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,340
真遗憾
Bummer.

106
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,040
跟你说清楚
Just so you understand,

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,830
这位女士是我们的好朋友
the lady in question is a real good friend of ours.

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
那么  假如说
Supposing, for the sake of argument,

109
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,510
我的确见过他
I did see him before.

110
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,780
她值多少
What's she worth?

111
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,780
什么意思
What's she worth?

112
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,920
你懂的
Yeah, you know,

113
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,650
如果要说个数的话
if you had to assign a dollar amount.

114
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,100
哈维  我打算在审讯方法上
Harvey, I'm about to violate departmental policy

115
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,870
违反一下部门政策
on interrogation techniques.

116
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,130
我好像看到外面有给我的甜甜圈
Think I saw some donuts outside with my name all over them.

117
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,710
别激动
Hey, now. C-Calm yourself.

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,950
没必要被情绪冲昏头...
There's no need to get carried...

119
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,010
杰克在一家叫指顶花夜总会的妓院
Jake worked as a barman at a brothel

120
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,220
做酒吧招待
called the Foxglove.

121
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,030
他说食人魔是常客  没法给我们提供位置
Said the Ogre was a regular. Can't give us a location.

122
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,960
因为相同的地方他们不会用两次
Yeah, 'cause they never use the same place twice.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,040
-什么  你知道吗  -没亲眼见过
- What, you know it? - Not personally.

124
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,350
指顶花的档次极其高
The Foxglove is very high-class, very extreme.

125
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,970
你得认识人牵线搭桥才能找到
You got to know someone who knows someone.

126
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,130
我也许认识个人
Uh, I might know someone.

127
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,530
你是说企鹅吗
You talking Penguin?

128
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,200
你和那混蛋再走得近一点  就会受他控制
If you get any deeper with that clown, he will own you.

129
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,200
我没得选  芭芭拉在食人魔手上
I don't have a choice; the Ogre has Barbara.

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,460
让我去查查
Let me shake a few trees.

131
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,800
别心急  休息一会儿
Take the time, grab some "Z"s.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,110
你要累死了
You're burnt!

133
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,700
第一个是最难的
First one was the hardest.

134
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,660
但那不是她的错
But it wasn't her fault.

135
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,540
她就是不是我要找的人
She just wasn't the one.

136
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
我也不能放她走
I also couldn't let her go.

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,160
但是这让我更下定决心
Still, it strengthened my resolve

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
不找到适合我的伴侣
to never stop till I found my soul mate--

139
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,090
能与之分享一切的人  誓不罢休
person I could share everything with.

140
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,830
我认为这人就是你  芭芭拉
I think that person is you, Barbara,

141
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,460
但我需要你的配合
but I need your help.

142
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,640
那么
So...

143
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,950
我们再来一次吧
let's begin again, shall we?

144
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,130
送信人
This just, uh...

145
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,710
刚刚送来了这个给你  布鲁斯少爷
came for you by messenger, Master Bruce.

146
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,840
谢谢
Thank you.

147
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,100
好  那...
Right, well, I'll...

148
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,060
那我走了
I'll just be off.

149
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,040
要人陪你吗
Do you want company?

150
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,550
给雷吉认尸吗
To identify Reggie?

151
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,860
不  不用了  我还是自己去吧
No, I don't think so. Best done alone.

152
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,140
我很遗憾  阿尔弗雷德
I'm sorry, Alfred.

153
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,490
我知道他是你的朋友
I know he was your friend.

154
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,960
这事说不通
Just doesn't make any sense.

155
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,740
雷吉竟然这样自杀
Reggie topping himself like that.

156
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,410
你说他从窗户掉下去了
You said he fell out of a window.

157
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,420
可能是喝了酒  失足掉下去的
He might've been drinking, lost his balance.

158

不  雷吉是个传奇
No, Reggie, he was a legend.

159
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,430
即使他喝得烂醉  也能去走钢丝
He could be blind drunk and walk a tightrope.

160
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,200
他的结局如何不重要了
Doesn't matter what he was like in the end.

161
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,120
我一定给他安排个体面的葬礼
I want to see he gets a proper send-off.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,450
晚上见  少爷

164
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,570
你老板不信任合伙人吗
What, your boss doesn't trust his partners?

165
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,460
这叫做尽职
It's called due diligence.

166
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,400
他只是要我检查一下
He just wants me to look the place over.

167
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,860
请吧
So look.

168
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,100
我还煮着肉汤呢  今天有特别的派对

别让我耽误你了

臭娘们
Piece of work.

171

我会把手枪放在吧台下
I'll put the pistol under the bar,

172
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,880
把机关枪放在点唱机后面
machine gun behind the juke.

173
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,550
康纳和他的人只要去拿就行
All Connor and his guy got to do is get to them.

174
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,450
这天终于来了

何事大驾光临啊
To what do I owe this wonderful surprise?

179
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,780
我要知道指顶花夜总会在哪

你能帮我吗  一句话

183
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,740
吉姆  我很喜欢我们公平交易的关系
Jim, I do so love our give-and-take relationship.

184
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,230
但我开始觉得索取的总是你
But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.

185
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,380
好吧
Fine.

186
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,840
我欠你一个人情
I'll owe you a favor.

187

你已经欠了一个
You already do.

那就再欠一个
Then I'll owe you another.

You think you know who I am.

192
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,760
知道我的底线
What I'm capable of.

193
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,280
你根本不知道
You have no idea.

194
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,090
今天对我很重要
Today is an important day for me...

但是  警探  你给我记好了

不好意思  我需要去一下洗手间

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,670
指顶花夜总会就在五月花街的克朗代克大厦
The Foxglove is in the old Klondike Building on Mayflower.

206

-你搞到了门票  -没错

207
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,270
不过就一张
But only one.

208
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,850
我打算让你伪装成嫖客潜伏进去
I figure you go in, pose as a john,

209
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,360
找个由头进行搜查
find something to bust them on,

210
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,620
然后我们撬开他们的嘴
then we squeeze them till they talk.

211
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,060
派我去潜伏是高招
Smart move sending me, hmm?

212
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,280
你就算不穿制服也是一身警察味儿
You couldn't look more like a cop if you wore a blue uniform.

213
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,230
你不换身行头吗
You got something to wear?

214
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,130
-你还得融入环境呢  -别担心
- You, uh, are gonna need to fit in. - Don't worry.

215
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,580
阿尔瓦雷斯上周抓到几个人倒卖意式西服

216
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,950
赃物送去物证室的路上
and a couple fell in my locker

217
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,850
不小心落了几件在我柜子里
on their way to the evidence room.

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,320
抱歉丢下你一人
I'm sorry I left you alone,

219
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,700
但你需要点时间思考下
but you needed time to think,

220
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,840
好接受这是真的
to accept that this was real.

221
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,890
顺便说一声  这间公寓是隔音的
This apartment is soundproofed, by the way,

222
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,350

瞧瞧我  手都抖了
Look at me. My hands are shaking.

224

那么多女人来来去去
That's never happened before

225
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,860
我都从来没手抖过
with any of the other women that I've had here.

226
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,170
你知道为什么吗
You know why that is?

227
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,260
你知道是因为什么吗
Do you know why that is?

228
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,520
你是个疯子
You're a psycho.

229
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,150
我不知道你在想什么
I don't know what you're thinking.

230
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,940
因为我总是能感觉出来
It's because I always somehow knew

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,240
其他人本质上不是我要的人
that deep down, the others weren't the one.

232
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,020
不是我要找的人
They weren't the one.

233
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,930
我希望你我能成  芭芭拉
I want this to work, Barbara.

234

你很害怕
You're scared.

235
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,470
没关系
It's okay.

236
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,130
吉姆会找到
Jim will find...

237
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,820
唯一会惹我生气的
The only way you're going to make me angry is

238
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,940
就是你说他的名字
if you mention his name.

239
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,230
喝了
Drink this.

240
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,610
是水  你脱水了

我比其他所有人都爱你
I love you like no one has ever loved you.

244
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,360
但如果你想逃
But if you try to escape,

245
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,610
我会把你吊在天花板上宰了你
I will chain you to the ceiling and gut you.

246
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,410
赶紧  过来
Now come... here.

247
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,870
这些是...

248
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,250
寻找真爱的路上
When you're looking for love,

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,580
难免遇到不少错的人
you have to kiss a lot of frogs.

250
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,620
不过我还是得感激她们
Still, I-I should be thankful.

251
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,080

你在这儿

连行程都取消了

267
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,900
吃饼干吗
Cookie?

268
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,980
我小时候

269
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,740
对饼干一向来者不拒
I'd always take a cookie when I had the chance.

270

你雇人刺杀阿尔弗雷德

271
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,310
我只是雇了你管家的老战友

我跟董事会说了  你的情况特殊
I told the board you were a special case,

275
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,690
需要提前跟你说清楚
that you need the talk early.

276
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,570
说清楚
The talk?

277

285
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,030
和你父亲一样

他也曾拿着秘密文件来  说要伸张正义

287
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,130
不过只是一开始

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,260
后来他就改了主意
Then he changed his mind.

289
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,950
你撒谎
You're lying.

290

你父亲后来明白了生意的真实情况

291
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,450
他的父亲也一样

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,790
你也会

我希望你再考虑考虑

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,140
抱歉
Pardon me.

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,100
布鲁斯

308
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,410
听完之后  你一定要面不改色

他并不像公司以为的那样

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,720
我不明白
I don't understand you.

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,000
你父亲是个真正清心寡欲之人

他最好的一面不为人所知
He kept his best self hidden.

319
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,100
我就说这么多了
That's all I'll say.

320
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,930
祝你好运

321

亨德里克斯  亨德里克斯  亨德里克斯

332
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,250
亨德里克斯  亨德里克斯  亨德里克斯

333
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,630
天啊
Oh, my goodness.

334
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,200
他怎么了
What happened to him?

335
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,900
斧...是事故

336
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,650
在一家金属片厂
At a sheet metal factory.

工业电锯...

338
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,280
可怜人
Poor man.

339
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,030
真不知道你怎么受得了这份工作
I... I don't know how you do this job.

340
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,250
被死亡包围
Death all around you.

341
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,090
是啊  所以一定要有幽默感
Yes. One must have a sense of humor.

342
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,490
案卷
The-the file?

343
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,020

Yes.

344
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,740
尼格玛先生
Um, Mr. Nygma,

345
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,790
你有没有遇到汤姆...多尔蒂警官
you haven't, by chance, seen, uh, Tom... Officer Dougherty?

346
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,180
我们昨晚约好一起吃晚饭的
We were... supposed to have dinner last night.

347
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,940
他没来  这也不奇怪
He didn't show-- no surprise--

348
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,570
但今天他也没来上班
um, but I haven't seen him today.

349
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,740
我也没见到他
Me neither.

350
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,950
抱歉  我真的得工作了
Excuse me. I really need to get back to work.

好吧
Okay.

353
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,860
天啊
Oh, dear.

你确定
You're sure...

355
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,590
枪在那里了吗
the guns are there?

356
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,430
布奇亲自放的
Butch placed them himself.

357
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,730
你还记得下手前应该和马罗尼说什么吗
Do you remember what to say to Maroni before you do the deed?

358
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,210
我向来不理解为什么要在崩人前
I never saw the point in telling a man something

359
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,860
和他废话
right before you're gonna whack him,

360
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,290
不过你也不是第一个提出这要求的
but you're not the first to ask for it.

361
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,090
多谢迁就我
I appreciate you humoring me.

362
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,590
你怎么知道马罗尼一定会在今天
So how do you know Maroni's gonna be in this bar

363
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,370
出现在那个酒吧

你会杀了我
You're gonna kill me.

你希望我杀你吗

你还是不相信我爱你

你觉得我是疯子
You think I'm crazy.

404
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,640
没关系
That's fine.

405

但你做不到...

409
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,990
它太强烈了
it's too strong.

410
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,620
那晚你向我展示了它

我想要释放它  我想要给你自由

简直是疯了
That's insane.

415
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,200
你这么说
You say that

416
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,970
是因为你不了解毫无畏惧的滋味
because you don't know what it is to live without fear.

417
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,630
但你会知道的
But you'll learn.

418

这地方你开的
You run this place?

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,560
想逮捕我随你  我不会谈论客户的

432
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,540
让他们都拍下来
in front of the cameras.

433
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,850
怎么样
How's that sound?

434
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,990
问萨莉吧
Talk to Sally.

435
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,500
你认识他
Do you know him?

436
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,000
你确定
You sure?

437
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,770
非常确定
I'm sure.

438
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,390
他说他叫杰森
He said his name was Jason.

439
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,090
很会说话
He was sweet.

440
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,810
我一上他的车  他就用头罩蒙住我的头
As soon as I got into his car, he pulled a hood over my head

441
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,240
还绑住了我的手腕
and tied my wrists.

442
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,380
他带我回了他的公寓
He took me back to his apartment.

443
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,900
给我留下了这个
That's where he did this.

444
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,920
我不知道他为什么放我走了
I don't know why he let me go.

445
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,310
什么时候的事
When was this?

446
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,700
-差不多九年前  -大概是第一起
- Almost nine years ago. - About a year before

447
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,010
凶案前一年  他是在慢慢升级
the first murder-- he was working his way up.

448
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,490
你怎么没报警
Why didn't you go to the police?

449
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,080
我报了
I did.

450
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,230
我是个妓女  而他是我说不上名字的有钱人
I was a hooker; he was a rich man with no name.

关于他的公寓
Anything about his apartment?

453

哪怕是最细微的细节也有用

电梯直接通向他的公寓
The elevator opened right into the apartment.

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,600
可以眺望城市
You can see out into the city.

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,890
各位  私人派对
Whoa, fellas, private party.

472
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,440
就是来表示下敬意
Just here to pay respects.

473
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,610
狂野东北的康纳
Connor from the wild northeast.

474
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,360
法尔科内那老家伙又想怎么样
What's that old man Falcone want now?

475
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,950
法尔科内阁下派我来致以敬意
Don Falcone sends me with his respects,

476
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,130
并为您和汤米・伯恩斯
and a small gift for you

477
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,280
准备了薄礼一份  庆祝这个好日子
and Tommy Bones on this happy day.

478
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,760
奇克
Cheech.

479
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,720
原谅我这么多疑
Forgive my suspicious nature.

480
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,780
当然  小心驶得万年船
Of course. Can't be too careful.

481
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,130
来  拿给我看
Come here. Let me see this.

482
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,180
马德雷瓷罐
Madre di Dios.

483
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,630
我最喜欢了
My favorite.

484
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,010
告诉法尔科内  多谢他这番心意
You tell Falcone I appreciate the gesture.

485
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,310
法尔科内阁下知道这日子的特殊性
Don Falcone knew it was a special occasion.

486
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,130
我们可以喝一杯  莉迪娅
We got time for a drink. Lidia!

487
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,460
准备干净杯子
Clean glasses, please.

488
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,550
另外还有话要捎给您
The gift comes with a message.

489
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,260
是吗  什么话
Oh, yeah? What's that?

490
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,910
他要告诉您  决定杀您
He wants you to know that it wasn't easy

491
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,010
并非易事
for him to decide to kill you.

492
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,880
该死
Son of a bitch.

493
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,150
但生意归生意
But business is business.

494
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
能相信吗
You believe it?

495
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,770
你们都卡枪了
You both jammed.

496
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,720
如果这还不算神迹  我都不知道怎么才算了
If that ain't a sign from God, I don't know what.

497
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
-求您  -闭嘴
- Please... - Shut your mouth!

498
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,830
你去给法尔科内阁下捎去我的话
You're gonna take don Falcone a message from me.

499
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,470
让他知道你搞砸了
You're gonna let him know that you messed up...

500
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,140
告诉他我跟他没完
...and you're gonna let him know that I'm coming for him.

501
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,930
不过  你不非得活着也能捎这个信儿
Of course, you don't need to be alive to tell him that.

502
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,490
汤米  请吧
Tommy, do the honors.

503
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,140
等等
Wait...

504
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,900
朋克族  坏男孩*
*All you punks and all you teds

505
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,180
民族阵线  爆炸头*
*National Front and Natti dreds

506
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,460
时髦人物  摇滚迷  嬉皮士  光头党*
*Mods, rockers, hippies and skinheads...

507
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,310
康纳搞砸了
Connor blew it.

508
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,070
马罗尼还活着
Maroni's still alive.

509
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,170
这酒太没滋味了
This is flat.

510
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,020
你没听到吗
Did you not hear me?

511
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,070
马罗尼还活着
Maroni is still alive.

512
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,730
你得赶快离开哥谭
You got to get out of town.

513
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,820
错过精彩的场面吗
And miss all the fun?

514
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,280
你早知道
You knew.

515
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,670
你给他下套
You set him up.

516
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,740
你藏枪之前  我把撞针都拔了
I took the firing pins out of the guns before you hid them.

517
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,040
这是我从马罗尼那儿学来的
A spin on a trick I learned from Maroni.

518
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,810
但你本可杀掉马罗尼的
But you could have had Maroni dead.

519
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,040
是啊  但那样我还是得在法尔科内之下
True, but I still would've been under Falcone's thumb,

520
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,650
而这让我越来越无法忍受了
and that... has grown intolerable.

521
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,440
不  我宁可让马罗尼活着
No, I'd much rather Maroni be alive,

522
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,060
一心想复仇
and out for blood.

523
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,950
可惜啊  多尔蒂警官  她会想你去哪了
Alas, Officer Dougherty, she's gonna wonder where you went.

524
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,810
写封信吧
Perhaps a letter.

525
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,540
跟她道别  给她句忠告
You could say good-bye, give her some advice.

526
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,740
或许让她
Something that might lead her

527
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,560
今后能做出更好的选择
to make better choices in the future, hmm?

528
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,710
皇家

529
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,300
皇家

530
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,600
吉姆
Jim?

531
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,430
这里没人
Place is empty.

532
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,780
但你该过来看看
But there's something you should see.

533
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,030
看到什么跟芭芭拉有关的东西了吗
You see anything that connects to Barbara?

534
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,220
或许她没来过
Maybe she was never here.

535
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,940
不  她来过
No, she was here.

536
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,500
我还能闻到她的香水味儿
I can still smell her perfume.

537
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,800
我们会找到他的
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

538
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
但你得做好心理准备
but you need to prepare yourself...

539
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,480
我们或许赶不及救下她
...that we might not be in time to save her.

540
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,940
这不可以
That is not an option.

541
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,720
这很有可能
It's the most likely option.

542
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,130
喂
Hello.

543
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,400
戈登警探
Detective Gordon,

544
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,040
应该是你触响了警报吧
I assume you are the one who triggered the alarm.

545
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,850
你个混蛋  芭芭拉呢
You son of a bitch. Where's Barbara?

546
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,350
当然是跟我在一起
With me, of course.

547
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,830
如果你敢伤害她
If you've hurt her...

548
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,270
她十分安全
She's as safe as milk.

549
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,650
比跟你在一起的时候安全多了
Safer than she ever was when she was with you.

550
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,290
你这话什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

551
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,790
她不需要你的保护  吉姆
She doesn't need your protection, Jim.

552
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,530
她从来都不需要
Fact is, she never did.

553
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,350
回见了
I'll see you around.

554
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,120
等等
Wait.

555
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,110
他在开车
He was driving.

556
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,520
如果他有脑子就开去大溪地
To Tahiti if he's smart.

557
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,160
有个杂音  是吧
Yeah, there was a noise, right?

558
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,930
敲击声  像是在过桥
A thumping, like he was going over a bridge.

559
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,140
我好像听到了火车笛
You know, I heard, uh, a horn, like a train horn.

560
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,190
哪座桥有火车
Okay, so, which bridge has a train?

561
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,670
该死  白十字  去州北的火车
Damn. Um... Whitecross, but that's the upstate train.

562
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,400
州北
Upstate.

563
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,620
她父母住那里
It's where her parents live.

564
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,330
芭芭拉  求你了
Barbara, please.

565
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,120
怎么回事啊
What's happening?

566
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,260
你们的女儿终于觉醒了
What's happening is your daughter is finally waking up.

567
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,310
求你
Please.

568
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,600
芭芭拉  我们这是为了你
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

569
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,160
吉姆
Jim?

570
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,530
芭芭拉
Barbara.

571
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,720
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

572
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,340
你不该来的
You're not supposed to be here.

573
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,980
他在哪
Where is he?

574
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,190
放下
Drop it.

575
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,660
放下刀  否则我开枪了
Drop the knife, or I'll shoot.

576
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,160
稍施加点压力  她就会血如泉涌
Just an ounce of pressure, and she'll split right open.

577
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,820
我可不希望那样  你呢
I don't want that. Do you want that?

578
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,030
没事的  芭芭拉
It's gonna be all right, Barbara.

579
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,780
没事的
It's gonna be all right.

580
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,760
如果你真在乎她
If you cared about this woman,

581
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,710
你就根本不会来追查我
you never would have come after me.

582
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,730
我比你要更爱她
I love her more than you ever did.

583
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,000
放下刀
Drop the knife.

584
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,110
割开她喉咙的不是我
Won't be me that slits her throat.

585
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,480
警探  那是你
Detective, that's gonna be you.

586
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,700
-放下刀  -吉姆  求你
- Drop it. - Jim, please.

587
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,140
放我们走吧
Just leave us alone.

588
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,690
混蛋
Hey, jerk-o!

589
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,300
芭芭拉
Barbara?

590
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,470
芭芭拉
Barbara?

591
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,350
他死了
He's dead?

592
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,460
嗯  他死了
Yeah. He's dead.

593
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,470
没事了
It's gonna be okay.

594
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,130
看着我  芭芭拉
Look at me. Barbara?

595
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,580
没事了
It's gonna be okay.

596
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,390
阿尔弗雷德  我还没问你呢
Alfred, I never asked you.

597
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,860
昨天去安葬雷吉怎么样
How was it yesterday, seeing Reggie?

598
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,780
我并不想再回忆一遍  布鲁斯少爷
Not really, uh, an experience I'd care to repeat, Master Bruce.

599
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,340
不过  我所认识的雷吉早就不在了
But then again, the Reggie I knew died years ago.

600
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,900
阿尔弗雷德  我对你有所隐瞒
Alfred, I haven't been honest with you.

601
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,750
你受伤之后
After you were hurt,

602
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,850
塞琳娜和我去找雷吉了
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

603
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,750
我们找到了他
We found him.

604
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
是吗
Did you, now?

605
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,830
他没有跳楼  也没摔下去
He didn't jump or fall.

606
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,870
是塞琳娜把他推下去了
Selina pushed him.

607
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,030
她为什么要那么做
And why did she do that?

608
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,430
雷吉是一个叫希德・邦德斯洛的人派来的
Reggie was sent here by a man named Sid Bunderslaw.

609
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,110
邦德斯洛在韦恩集团工作
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

610
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,570
雷吉供出了他的名字
Reggie gave us the name,

611
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,940
但又说会去告诉邦德斯洛我们做了什么
but said he was gonna tell Bunderslaw what we were doing.

612
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,720
这样啊
I see.

613
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,210
还有呢
And the rest?

614
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,650
慈善舞会
The charity ball--

615
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,310
应该是为接近邦德斯洛先生吧
presumably to have access to Mr. Bunderslaw.

616
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,470
塞琳娜偷了他办公室保险柜的钥匙
Selina stole the key to his office safe.

617
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,500
我今天去了  里面是空的
I went there today. It was empty.

618
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,760
但邦德斯洛在那儿等着我
But Bunderslaw was waiting for me.

619
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
-他做了什么  -没什么
- What did he do? - Nothing.

620
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,470
他做了什么
What did he do?!

621
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,320
没什么
Nothing!

622
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,520
但他说我父亲和我祖父
But he said that my father and grandfather

623
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,830
都知道公司在做违法的事
knew about the illegal things that the company was doing,

624
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,780
却选择...
and chose...

625
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,030
他们选择了沉默
They chose to stay quiet.

626
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,920
你父亲是个好人
Your father was a good man.

627
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,390
我知道
I know.

628
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,890
但好人也有秘密
But even good men have secrets.

629
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,370
他来了
There he is.

630
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,960
-就是他  -干得好
- That guy right there. - Yeah, nice work.

631
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,290
干得好
Yeah, nice work.

632
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,250
恭喜  你成了英雄
Congratulations. You're a hero.

633
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,020
也就这一时吧
Yeah, it won't last.

634
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,730
明天他们就又恨我了
Tomorrow, they'll go back to hating me.

635
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,110
那我会提醒他们的
Well, then I'll remind them.

636
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,480
昨天你只是想帮忙
Yesterday, you were trying to help.

637
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,940
我却听不进去  对不起
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

638
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,430
我绝不会试图改变你的  吉姆
I would never try to change you, Jim.

639
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,780
你的使命感  也是我喜欢你的一部分原因
Your sense of mission-- it's part of what I love about you.

640
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,850
我以为是因为我帅得没天理呢
I thought it was my devastating good looks.

641
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,850
我说笑呢
That's a joke.

642
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,230
我是害怕
I was scared.

643
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,860
我怕芭芭拉会受伤
Scared that Barbara would get hurt

644
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,330
而你会责备自己先来保护我
and you would blame yourself for protecting me first,

645
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,630
而我们的感情也会因此破碎
and then whatever we had would die.

646
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,530
那并不英勇  只是自私
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

647
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,200
小莱  我爱你
Lee, I love you.

648
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,970
不是她
Not her.

649
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,810
如果让我再来一次  我也会先保护你
If I had to do it again, I'd still protect you first.

650
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,070
你干什么了
What did you do?

651
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,640
握刀刃来着
Uh, grabbed a... knife by the blade.

652
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,500
当然了
Of course you did.

653
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,260
让我看看
Let me see.

654
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,110
柯林格小姐
Miss Kringle?

655
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,910
你没事吧
Are you okay?

656
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,750
我收到一封多尔蒂警官的信
I got a letter from Officer Dougherty.

657
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,810
他离开哥谭了
He left town.

658
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,080
"别等我了  好好享受人生吧
"Don't wait around for me. Go have some fun,

659
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,100
或许等我回来会再找你"
and maybe I'll give you a call when I get back."

660
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,320
一堆废话
Blah, blah, blah.

661
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,280
都不当面跟我说
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

662
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,110
我为什么总选这些混蛋啊
I mean, why do I keep picking creeps?

663
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,150
有时候男人的本意在字里行间之外
Sometimes with men, you need to read between the lines.

664
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,850
有时候男人的烦心事  得喝酒忘记
Sometimes with men, you need a drink.

665
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,970
日安  尼格玛先生
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

666
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,890
{\an8}尼格玛

667
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,640
字里行间啊
Read between the lines.

668
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,950
大家听好
Everybody listen up!

669
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,120
刚刚得到消息  法尔科内城里
Just got wind of three separate attacks

670
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,970
三处不同地点的生意遭到袭击
on Falcone businesses in different parts of town.

671
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,420
据传是马罗尼干的
Word is it's Maroni.

672
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,720
即刻起  所有休假取消
As of right now, all leaves are canceled,

673
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,970
所有警员都要值勤

674
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,340
枪战开始了  各位
